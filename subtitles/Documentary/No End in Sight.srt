great respect that I have for your
leadership mister president

00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,80
unfamiliar wars the first war the 21st
century

5
00:00:28,80 --> 00:00:33,670
it is not well known it was

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,100
not well understood it is complex for
people to

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,309
comprehend and I know with certain

8
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,860
certainty that over time 3 contributions
you've made will be

recorded by history our

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:02:22,720
hard

11
00:02:22,720 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm

12
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:31,140
here

E

15
00:03:39,60 --> 00:03:41,30
on May 1st 2003

16
00:03:41,30 --> 00:03:45,690
President George W Bush declared an end
two major combat operations in Iraq

17
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,690
and said in the battle over iraq the
United States and our allies have

18
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,760
prevailed

19
00:03:50,760 --> 00:04:09,470
in

20
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,500
here

21
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,548
and

22
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,779
four years later after over three
thousand american deaths

23
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,650
and over 20,000 American wounded iraq
has disintegrated

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,789
50 keia but I suspect this

27
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,128
drastically under-reported we probably
cash in a third

28
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,690
what's actually occurring millions of
Iraqis have lost access to drinking

29
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,319

sewage treatment and electricity since
the invasion baghdad

31
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,539
a city of 6 million has been under an 8
p.m. curfew since March

32
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,479
2006 over three million Iraqis have fled
to neighboring countries

33
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,490
0 estimates have the civilian death toll
ranged as high as 600,000

34
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,80
on people who who died

35
00:05:04,80 --> 00:05:07,659
they're lucky but people living they're
dead

36
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,449
well their life the west part and the
North Park all there are

two major muscle groups

for tonight I just don't do it again

46
00:05:43,29 --> 00:05:53,969
financial ruin

47
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:58,959

mom

51
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:20,340
from January 2003 to January 2005 I was
chairman of the National Intelligence

52
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,869
Council

53
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,990
we produced the first national estimate
on

54
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,180
the state of the insurgency and iraq the
estimate delivery pretty bad news

55
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,900
basically laid out so to bad worst worst
scenarios

56
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,30
the president called guesswork and is
Harper spokesman called it's our

57
00:06:38,30 --> 00:06:41,900
hand-wringing amazing harm

58
00:06:41,900 --> 00:07:13,248
what was really really into me was the
president haven't read it

59
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,110
September 11th 2001 was a very clear
break beautiful day

60
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,339
and I had just come back from the
pentagon barbershop

61
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,39
walked by my office and glanced up in on
the television screen and

62
00:07:25,39 --> 00:07:32,340
there was wanted the Twin Towers burning

63
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,520
we never heard the plane coming at least
I didn't suddenly though

64
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,979
whole world turned upside down I saw a
fireball

65
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,99
and I don't tell you ice on it and I
said to myself I'm going to die today

66
00:07:45,99 --> 00:07:49,840
that plane had come directly under our
our section in the office is the army

67
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,770
Budget Office

68
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,900
were 38 army employees were killed

69
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,99
was directly beneath us and the Navy's
new

70
00:07:57,99 --> 00:08:01,159
command center was two floors beneath us
everybody was killed in those two

71
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,39
sections this was something that Osama
bin Laden had to orchestrate because he

72
00:08:06,39 --> 00:08:07,800
was the only terrorist I could think of

73
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,60
who could've coordinated this kind of
activity you had that thought

74
00:08:12,60 --> 00:08:15,990
media immediately immediately I'm

75
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,919
a month after September 11th the United
States and turn Afghanistan in search of

76
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,590
al Qaeda

77
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,250
and Osama bin Laden but even before the
Afghan war several senior administration

78
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,240
officials were looking at another target

79
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,49
one that had nothing to do with the 9/11
attacks when the planes at the pentagon

80
00:08:33,49 --> 00:08:33,468
I was

81
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,800
in the building and then I guess the
next

82
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,439
between this or that happened was we
immediately got asked

83
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,479
to see if we could write any
relationship between

84
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,170
saddam in Arcadia I went right away to
the

85
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,149
to the counterterrorism group and to
their chief

86
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,600
Iraq analyst the two of us sat down over
a few days

87
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,180
and looked at all historical reporting
that we could go through

88
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,219
which include well we concluded that
there was no relationship

89
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,250
his regime he'd and protect terrorist
including

90
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,579
members and al Qaeda we continue to
watch iraq's involvement in terrorist

91
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:11,399
activities

92
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,199
when I want to bring to your attention
today is the potentially much more

93
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,910
sinister nexus between

94
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,209
Iraq in the ok I to terrorist network we
don't want

95
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,670
smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud iraq
has drones

96
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,860
and I don't think these drones and
infirm on the ships in ago I'm the

97
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,709
drones with chemical biological weapons
in the gulf latest round of the ship's

98
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,469
an attack the East Coast United States
you know this is absolute fantasyland

99
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,649
people or

100
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,759
I don't know what they were smoking but
it must been very good

101
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,40
George W Bush's foreign policy inner
circle

102
00:09:45,40 --> 00:09:50,269
cheney rumsfeld and Wolfowitz set the
administration on course for war with

103
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,819
Iraq

104
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:55,929
Condoleezza Rice sided with them colin
powell and Richard Armitage

105
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,230
the only senior officials with combat
experience expressed concerns privately

106
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:09,290
but supported the administration in
public and

107
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,240
bush's advisers had been involved with
saddam hussein

108
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,50
since he invaded Iran in 1980 in a
brutal war that killed nearly a million

109
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:17,770
people

110
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,520
iraq used chemical weapons against both
the Iranian military

111
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,520
and innocent civilians saddam invested
billions of dollars in

112
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,529
clear chemical and biological weapons
programs well murdering three hundred

113
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,959
thousand his own citizens

114
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,529
I'm but the reagan administration
fearing a ROM

115
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,180
supported saddam with military
intelligence and economic aid

116
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,390
Donald Rumsfeld met with saddam in 1983

117
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,689
colin powell was reagan's national
security adviser

118
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,490
from 1987 to 1989 it's really summed up

119
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,800
in dreadful but very very telling

120
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,319
State Department document from 1987

121
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,20
which said human rights and chemical
weapons use

122
00:10:59,20 --> 00:11:05,310
aside comma our interests run roughly
parallel to those in Iraq

123
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,149
the iran-iraq war ends in stalemate in
1988

124
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,320
in nineteen ninety saddam invades kuwait

125
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,329
a us-led coalition expels him

126
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,20
in a war masterminded by Dick Cheney
then-secretary of Defense

127
00:11:19,20 --> 00:11:23,29
Paul Wolfowitz then undersecretary of
defense for policy

128
00:11:23,29 --> 00:11:26,350
and colin powell then-chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff

129
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,19
the first president Bush urges the
rockies to stage a coup against saddam

130
00:11:31,19 --> 00:11:36,730
there's another way for the bloodshed to
stop and that is for the iraqi military

131
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,970
and the Iraqi people to take matters
into their own hands and force at

132
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,860
Amherst saying the dictator

133
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,940
to step aside yet when iraq's southern
Shiites rise up

134
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,529
the administration allow saddam to
repress them 14

135
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:54,699
auto iraq's in to governors

136
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,240
were under rebel control when general
schwartzkopf

137
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,630
allowed saddam hussein to use

138
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,610
helicopter gunships to massacre

139
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,970
the rebels men women and children the
1991 armistice requires a rock to disarm

140
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,470
but saddam refuses to comply as a result

141
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,950
iraq's economy crumbles under a UN
embargo instituted in 1993

142
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,500
and continued by the clinton
administration saddam's favor delete

143
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,560
remain wealthy but ordinary iraqis are
plunged into extreme poverty

144
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,979
and many turned fundamentalist Islam in
1993

145
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,40
when George Bush Senior visits kuwait
saddam attempts to assassinate him

146
00:12:37,40 --> 00:12:41,390
seven years later his son has elected
president the United States

147
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,970
when you see the same architects those
policies

148
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,210
on the one hand talking about getting
right

149
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,490
what they had gone wrong back in 1991
finishing the job

150
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,40
I was tempting to say well we'll maybe
they've learned use

151
00:12:58,40 --> 00:13:01,189
use much sweeter with sure you

152
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,120
worse every resume military

153
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:14,70
shoes

154
00:13:14,70 --> 00:13:16,680
if you want to date the beginning love
did

155
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,239
disaster post-war Iraq it would be
january 28th 2003

156
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,240
when bush signed without

157
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,20
as far as I can tell any real discussion
within the white house with the

158
00:13:28,20 --> 00:13:33,40
administration national security
presidential directive number 24

159
00:13:33,40 --> 00:13:36,430
which gate controller post-war Iraq to
the pentagon

160
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,99
that document essentially made on
rumsfeld

161
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,730
the main actor on post-war Iraq is war
was

162
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,740
conceived by a very small group of
people inside the administrator Bush

163
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,790
administration

164
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,890
they had an entirely and naive the

165
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,140
vision of what iraq was and what iraqis
would do once the regime

166
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,000
fell in formulating its views on
post-saddam Iraq

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,100
the administration relied heavily on a
man named akhmed

168
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,320
Chalabi since 1992 Chalabi had been
president of the Iraqi National Congress

169
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,960
War II and see widely viewed with
suspicion

170
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,230
Chalabi had been convicted in jordan
over huge bank fraud

171
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,780
the intelligence community found his
information unreliable

172
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,920
or even fraudulent at best I think

173
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,860
they were liars and at worst they were
provocateurs

174
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,70
defer to 9c source it was always

175
00:14:30,70 --> 00:14:33,280
looked at very very skeptically by

176
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,470
the analyst but that wasn't the case
with policymakers

177
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,10
Chalabi asserted that post-war Iraq
would be pro-american

178
00:14:40,10 --> 00:14:43,780
and easily stabilized particularly if
Chalabi himself

179
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,459
was in charge and so the plan was
essentially

180
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,330
will stay for three or four months we
will install

181
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,90
a government made up %uh exiles and led
by

182
00:14:55,90 --> 00:15:00,480
I inchallah be and then in August or
September 2003

183
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,850
we will begin ATM drastic reduction of

184
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,810
troops Larry to readdress torsten 14 min
said by the end of August

185
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,319
love 2003 we will have all but
twenty-five to thirty thousand troops

186
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
out of Iraq

187
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,460
I heard him say that in a room full of
people

188
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,600
and I turned my colleagues I said this
guy doesn't know what he's talking about

189
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:22,920
its

190
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,550
physically impossible the state
department's future other

191
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,359
iraq project thirteen volumes study on
post-war Iraq

192
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,370
was ignored by the pentagon it was ok of
a lot of thinking and state department

193
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:34,750
there

194
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,880
board feet volumes on

195
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,220
how we should do this almost done at
this was integrated into the pentagon's

196
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,720
think

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,269
secretaries frustration along with my
own

198
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,380
grew as we watched are careful planning
our detailed planning

199
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,470
my essentially discarded in the people
who've been involved in

200
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,670
essentially discarded so that more

201
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,19
loyal in line with the republican
party's views and so forth people could

202
00:16:03,19 --> 00:16:04,690
be appointed to key positions

203
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,290
in in Iraq

204
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,410
at this hour American and coalition
forces

205
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,240
are in the early stages a military
operations to disarm Iraq

206
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,329
reads people defend the world

207
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:43,359
great danger

208
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,000
generates because thing I've always felt
a really important job and I didn't feel

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,759
like I B

210
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
content with myself going to life
knowing that other people had fought

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,259
for my freedom John armitt on

212
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,630
to are support my country and now

213
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,620
us does a good time to the num

214
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,99
it was I A and on our

215
00:17:07,99 --> 00:17:11,208
to go there and help my federal soldiers

216
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,549
to do but they tailed off

217
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,569
to go into their maybe takeout are

218
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,740
dictator out and then power

219
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,679
to reestablish to democracy I just

220
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,770
was waiting for the water to happen
because it was the

221
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,240
on the eye of Hall I them I had

222
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,299
to look for and and when it happened I
was

223
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,320
the excited and

224
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,510
that things will roll le début and
talents that better

225
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:58,929
circumstances I killed

226
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,90
you're not stuck on another cell

227
00:18:02,90 --> 00:18:06,770
other 11 it's just too confusing

228
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,639
loud noisy scary hopeful place

229
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,730
all kinda wrapped up together I would
see kids with

230
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,760
ski caps on it said FBI across it and
the beginning with a big thumbs up and I

231
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,530
would have other

232
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,710
young men who for probably 15 in
civilian clothes can be very hard stares

233
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,590
and

234
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,480
you know kind of sizing me up and always
come looking at the license plate of the

235
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,940
car

236
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,80
the iraqis were in waiting to see what
this was going to bring them

237
00:18:34,80 --> 00:18:37,820
the presence in the Americans had not
been rejected

238
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,310
yet by the iraqi 0

239
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,929
no top I've seen people well coming be

240
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,120
coalition talks because we thought
everything is planned

241
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,428
everything is prepared

242
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,960
how during world war 2

243
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
the United States started planning the
occupation of germany

244
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,120
two years in advance but the bush
administration didn't create the

245
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,840
organization that would manage the
occupation of Iraq

246
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,740
until 60 days before the invasion or

247
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,890
the organization for reconstruction and
humanitarian assistance

248
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,770
reported directly to Defense Secretary
Rumsfeld I got a call

249
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,580
from the office security firms in late
January

250
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,500
and they were life lead handle
humanitarian affairs reconstruction

251
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,549
retired army general J garner was
appointed to run or a

252
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,570
in the first Gulf War he had commanded
22,000 soldiers responsible for

253
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,129
humanitarian operations in the Kurdish
zone

254
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,200
northern Iraq this time he would be
running the entire country

255
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,410
to think we were prepared to run iraq I
think we're ever prepared to me

256
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,230
it you know to for %uh task that made to
publish years prepare

257
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,429
court in a Butthead years I got a phone
call on my cell phone

258
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,30
from someone at the State Department
telling me that retirement age

259
00:20:01,30 --> 00:20:04,40
was looking for me and wanted me back in
washington

260
00:20:04,40 --> 00:20:08,340
right now ambassador Barbara Bodine was
placed in charge

261
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,000
baghdad only three weeks before the war
she was a career foreign service officer

262
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,340
who had served in Yemen

263
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,590
iraq and had been a hostage in kuwait
for five months after Saddam's invasion

264
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,699
in nineteen ninety

265
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,990
she was one of the few State Department
mideast experts

266
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,20
that the pentagon allowed into iraq she
was one of you we could get it and I

267
00:20:27,20 --> 00:20:27,710
thought they

268
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,710
initially made a mistake they thought
they had a woman should be an easy mark

269
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,460
barber

270
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,340
wit of its members the servers by 2003
Army Colonel Paul Hughes had worked in

271
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,90
the pentagon for six years doing
planning and strategy work for senior

272
00:20:40,90 --> 00:20:41,530
Defense Department officials

273
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,809
I wonder being assigned to the officer
reconstruction and humanitarian

274
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:47,940
assistance

275
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,20
under Jay garner know I was the director
strategic policy for him

276
00:20:53,20 --> 00:20:57,320
and

277
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,720
I'll we were given a suite of offices
that

278
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,929
had been unoccupied for a couple of
years had no computers in it you have

279
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:08,600
people showing up daily asking where do
I said

280
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,259
they had no staff I had no personal I
had I have nothing

281
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,980
from either a senior deputy down to our
a secretary

282
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,70
there is only one meeting at the
National Defense University and it was

283
00:21:20,70 --> 00:21:20,720
the

284
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,389
I think the consensus opinion have the
people who went to that meeting

285
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,758
with whom I spoke afterwards arm

286
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,340
that hey this is crazy that was our
first meeting

287
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,350
and we're not given a whole lot of
confidence by the first meeting because

288
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,480
essentially

289
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,649
we didn't do anything except meet each
other it was completely

290
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:46,590
unstructured am there were no plans and
they're truly were

291
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,830
norplant on the 16th of March or harm

292
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,499
flew out to Kuwait City we had 167
people that flew with us

293
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,399
167 people that were to essentially
become the government

294
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:04,969
up a country of $25 million home

295
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,500
after the hall baghdad we had no idea
what was going to happen

296
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,750
and they're certainly didn't seem to be
much a plan what we're

297
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,889
generally being told is that we'd be
getting back on the ship's

298
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:18,908
you know within a month or two I love a
century conquering iraq

299
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:24,320
in

300
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,70
in

301
00:22:27,70 --> 00:22:31,320
while we were in kuwait wheeler is glued
to the television sentences everyone

302
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,720
else

303
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,889
malas the realization that there was

304
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,899
absolute lawlessness and chaos going on

305
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,799
iraq the Americans were doing it

306
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,590
they they would sit at certain
intersections but

307
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,889
they wouldn't actually get out the on
these are the tanks and

308
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:55,879
and really do much time passed

309
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:59,799
and we didn't see any progress there on
the progress we found as the

310
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,830
uncontrolled

311
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,939
me down no tears had to note on the
governmental buildings and even

312
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,509
private owned company deluding was
partly a factor

313
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,129
I'll the troop levels and the

314
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:17,230
sense that Rumsfeld communicated to his
commanders and his commanders

315
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,100
communicated down the chain

316
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,000
to the platoon in company level

317
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,240
that we were not their to run iraq

318
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,460
we were there to get rid of the regime
and get out we're not under martial law

319
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,629
in his order general McKiernan was not
told

320
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:40,490
to establish martial law you know not
once was martial law declared

321
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,929
I'll just I'll tell you honestly where
the transition period

322
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,769
I mean there's an iraqi civil law but
there's no

323
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:51,750
I just heard that we just opened up to
the first two courts

324
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,139
today so I i mean when your your started
nothin

325
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,418
head martial law been declared which
would have been authorized under the

326
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:00,960
Fourth Geneva Convention

327
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,289
maybe we would have had a bit more
security

328
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,750
were pilloried I mean we can't we get
early start worrying if we

329
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,690
if we do that was our sin task the
greatest mystery

330
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,220
post-war Iraq involves that month or so
after the fall of Baghdad

331
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,289
why the US didn't do anything to control
the looting because no way

332
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,220
everything that's been a problem since
then started at first month

333
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,240
people at the National Security Council
chicken power

334
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,290
shelf and others

335
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,990
CIA director did express concern about
the looting

336
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,520
did you express any concern president
bush I was at a meeting where was she

337
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,620
expressed by my boss

338
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,679
tell me what mister Paul said that mean
well you know it's not the way

339
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,290
we generally work hard my eyes to the
president can be kept away private to

340
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,280
the present the word came from

341
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,310
Washington that we're not getting
involved in that we're not we're not

342
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,919
gonna stop polluting were not

343
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,550
doing police work that's not what we're
here for and I think

344
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,600
so there were explicit instructions from
Washington

345
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:09,139
to not interfere with the living yes

346
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,620
hospitals government offices
universities

347
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,629
ministries one CPA estimate had been
possible leading

348
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:22,59
at twelve billion dollars that was the
revenue

349
00:25:22,59 --> 00:25:26,450
for iraq Ian 2003-2004

350
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,509
I picked up a newspaper today and I
couldn't believe

351
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,649
I read a headline they talked about
chaos

352
00:25:34,649 --> 00:25:40,370
violence armrest any just was Henny
Penny the sky is falling

353
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,739
just imagine the room this week that
were sitting in all that you have

354
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,549
is concrete walls everything is gone we
talking people coming in

355
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,879
with industrial cranes in walking off
with parter

356
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,668
a power plant think what's happened in
our cities

357
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:58,909
when we had riots and prop and looting

358
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:04,820
stuff happens this was not just people
stealing stuff from grocery stores in

359
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,749
this was people

360
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:08,990
chip in concrete walls into

361
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,350
little pieces so they could take the
rebar the image is your thing on

362
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,29
television

363
00:26:13,29 --> 00:26:17,460
you're seeing over and over n over in it
the same picture

364
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,610
up some person walking out of some
building with the bait I think that was

365
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,389
probably the day that we lost

366
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:27,629
iraqis you think my goodness with that
many believe

367
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:33,850
yeah it is it possible that there were
that many bases in the whole country

368
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,9
that's when it became very clear that

369
00:26:37,9 --> 00:26:41,59
this liberation really didn't have
anything to do with the average iraqi

370
00:26:41,59 --> 00:26:44,249
there was a belief that the Americans
actually incurred still looking or one

371
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:44,919
at that

372
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,309
the destruction of our country occur
they let this happen

373
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:54,29
so whether you're Sunni or Shia you
outraged about the looting we

374
00:26:54,29 --> 00:26:59,940
had an a list are twenty sites that we
thought needed to be protected

375
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,919
I'm historical cultural artistic

376
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,360
religious and we had provided that

377
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,310
and and believe me no difference
whatsoever

378
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:22,659
the

379
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,840
the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad

380
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,659
number one on nora's list contains some
of the world's most important artifacts

381
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,530
early human civilization the museum was
never protected

382
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,570
gonna go to bed I don't want them so
that that after them

383
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,210
well other job creation tho Iraq's
National Library

384
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,30
and National Archives containing
thousands have ancient manuscripts

385
00:27:46,30 --> 00:27:49,190
were burned down all what our pretend

386
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,310
all wat wherever 10 are

387
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,350
kept this library now we have no

388
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,10
national heritage three days ago

389
00:28:00,10 --> 00:28:05,30
me bunny child

390
00:28:05,30 --> 00:28:09,70
want to the head the Marines and
Palestine Hotel

391
00:28:09,70 --> 00:28:12,418
we waited there for about four hours

392
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,520
we met kernel that do promise

393
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,200
said he will send of cars to protect

394
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,529
what's left on the museum

395
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:25,340
three days ago till now

396
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,178
nobody came to try don't lay off the
fact that

397
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,570
unfortunate activity

398
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,649
on on a defect in a war plan

399
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:39,809
it strikes me as a stretch weird
specifically by

400
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:44,39
scholars and others about the danger to
the you

401
00:28:44,39 --> 00:28:48,29
what you urge to provide a greater level
protection and security in the initial

402
00:28:48,29 --> 00:28:48,789
phase Israel

403
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,210
not to my knowledge no one can claim
that they were caught by surprise by the

404
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,630
leading

405
00:28:53,630 --> 00:29:12,979
I just don't think they wanted to know
they didn't want to hear it

406
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:17,139
in the months leading up to the invasion
a debate over troop levels required in

407
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:20,379
Iraq had been privately brewing between
the military leadership

408
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,719
and Donald Rumsfeld Rumsfeld and his
deputy

409
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,639
Paul Wolfowitz believed that a foursome
under 100,000 troops would be sufficient

410
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:33,189
for the invasion and occupation of Iraq
a month before the invasion

411
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,399
the fight over troop levels became
public as the Chief of Staff of the army

412
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,109
Eric Shinseki testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee

413
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:44,649
ignoring pressure from rumsfeld in with
words generation sexyy

414
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:49,969
could you give us some ideas to the
magnitude of the Army's force

415
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,39
requirement

416
00:29:51,39 --> 00:29:54,509
for an occupation of Iraq something on
the order

417
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:57,700
several hundred thousand soldiers are
are

418
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,529
probably figure that

419
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,399
would be a required home

420
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,590
what is I think reasonably certain areas
the idea that it would take several

421
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,259
hundred thousand US forces

422
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,989
I think is far from the mark it's hard
to conceive that it would take more

423
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:19,409
forces to provide stability in
post-saddam Iraq

424
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:23,369
that it would take to conduct the war
itself in to secure the surrender saddam

425
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:27,149
security forces in his army hard to
imagine

426
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:30,189
hard to imagine

427
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,39
anyone who had any experience

428
00:30:33,39 --> 00:30:37,259
in the interventions in the nineties new
that the opposite was true

429
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:40,559
you need X number them soldiers

430
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,629
her thousand citizens simply

431
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:47,389
to provide up a modicum of security

432
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:55,389
but Paul Wolfowitz couldn't imagine
we're talking about

433
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:58,799
most are still a tease control over a

434
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,600
piece of geography that fairly
significant with

435
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,90
the kinds of ethnic tensions that could
lead to

436
00:31:08,90 --> 00:31:13,820
other problems and so takes a
significant ground force presence

437
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,779
did Josh in Turkey get it right he was
asked for his best military pay

438
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,850
and his experience exceeds mine he

439
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,480
commanded our forces in bosnia he did it
for your plus

440
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,369
he knows what he's talking about check
tree pollen

441
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:31,470
to the same stand myself

442
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,90
we argued from one more troops and we
made some difference but ultimately

443
00:31:36,90 --> 00:31:44,230
Denzin we made enough for the difference
personally I feel the word be going

444
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,559
differently if you had

445
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,830
leadership that really understood

446
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:54,359
number one what its like to be on the
ground had actually served in the armed

447
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:54,980
forces

448
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,480
and number two really had a good

449
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,869
com managerial grasp love making this

450
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:04,899
this thing work the senior
administration officials who overruled

451
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,748
the military and state Department

452
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:10,600
had no experience with post-war
reconstruction efforts and little or no

453
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,879
military experience

454
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,899
Cheney had avoided military service
during vietnam through 5 draft

455
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:16,580
deferments

456
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,590
Rumsfeld was a Navy pilot in the
nineteen fifties

457
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,928
but it never seen combat wolfowitz and
rice

458
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,889
had never served in the military

459
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:29,80
bush had avoided the vietnam draft by
joining the Texas Air National Guard

460
00:32:29,80 --> 00:32:32,149
he also had no foreign policy experience
prior

461
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:35,748
to becoming president we're looking at
it I say we

462
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:39,590
those overseas who had military
experience and we would talk about this

463
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,570
often this doesn't look good in mid
April 2003

464
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,729
with looting still underway rumsfeld
cancel deployment the 1st Cavalry

465
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:49,619
Division

466
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:53,228
before some 16,000 soldiers it shocked
us

467
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:57,470
you know how can you turn off that
division if we'd head that division

468
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,129
following us into a rock we would
destabilize

469
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:05,418
a lot more iraq just to our present on
april nineteenth

470
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,809
or a finally entered iraq to begin
post-war operations

471
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,440
know that 20 ministry would bring back
sixteen

472
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,460
those buildings were destroyed as a prop
as a functionally we were starting from

473
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:17,960
zero

474
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,889
unit there are no desks and there are no
chairs in running typewriters left

475
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:25,19
where do we go in me iraqis to

476
00:33:25,19 --> 00:33:28,269
start working there was no structure
left am

477
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:31,599
physical structure bureaucratic
structure had put people out on the

478
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,779
street walking around asking do you know
him as an interview with People measure

479
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,539
helping other people were in the
ministry

480
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,929
to you know the P people in Minister of
Education within the group itself

481
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,580
we had I think probably five

482
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,320
who spoke any amount to a very big we
had

483
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,489
no phoneless we had two phones for a
while selling is having a homeless was

484
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,759
not really that important

485
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,590
we had no information we had no place to
go we didn't know who to contact

486
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,668
I am not the best way to not the best
way to start an occupation

487
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:07,99
and what followed was this pervasive

488
00:34:07,99 --> 00:34:11,679
senselessness to direct her covered for
and guys with guns took over

489
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,99
and they were the iraqi got to go

490
00:34:17,99 --> 00:34:18,429
on

491
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:21,970
it

492
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,949
the firefighter got caught up in

493
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,759
were not fire fights were americans were
being attacked it was a rocking on iraqi

494
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,370
firefights he just be driving down
stream suddenly

495
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,759
there's a few slaughter fire just opens
up on you

496
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,950
and you're just in the middle up these
guys shooting channel

497
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:42,879
the streets were chaotic people could
kill and get away with that there was no

498
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,410
working police force

499
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,889
just trying to do. invasion saddam
released about a hundred thousand

500
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,319
prisoners common criminals from the
jails

501
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:56,639
in February love

502
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,549
2003 going to petition to come in brief

503
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,849
advisory panel that advises Secretary
Rumsfeld on

504
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:07,239
on defense policy matters what I told
them was that

505
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,420
based on our experiences in previous
peace operations in on what had happened

506
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,89
in Iraq

507
00:35:12,89 --> 00:35:15,380
historically who is very likely that if
the US

508
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,799
intervened and captured Baghdad that we
were likely to face

509
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:23,509
massive civil disturbance I suggested
that we needed about 2500 Constabulary

510
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,99
forces

511
00:35:24,99 --> 00:35:27,249
about 4,000 civil police street cops

512
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,999
and then teens and judicial advisors and
corrections officers

513
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:35,58
in the NBA agreed that while this was a
good idea

514
00:35:35,59 --> 00:35:38,299
there wasn't enough time but maybe for
the next war

515
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:41,549
prior to the war the but I didn't work
received

516
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:45,269
one murder case a month within the month
they were getting about 25

517
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:48,738
the they were seen grapes open for the
first time rapes and murders

518
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,789

acumen disappeared in the streets stop

519
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:53,799

stop driving the Americans were not
acting as the police

521
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,89
needed no the street a bag that they
didn't speak the language they didn't

522
00:36:01,89 --> 00:36:02,219
have interpreters

523
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:06,609
in sufficient numbers million have
intelligence about what was going on

524
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:10,569
so it was a free-for-all and you just
fell

525
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:16,9
is a is avoid here

526
00:36:16,10 --> 00:36:22,660
here

527
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,770
very quickly the mosque came in a field
in that the vacuum

528
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,460
that the Americans created by getting
rid of Saddam leaving nothing as place

529
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,670
and she neighborhood say very quickly

530
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,980
establish control in particular the
clerks associated with move to the

531
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,400
center

532
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,850
inkatha outsider was the son of a famous
Shiite cleric

533
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,750
and started a bid for power based on his
father's network of masks

534
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,750
and charities Ohare the No

535
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,710
there

536
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,370
all at

537
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,549
here

538
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,230
there

539
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,130
only a few days after american troops
entered baghdad

540
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:09,20
he assassinated a pro-american Shiite
leader then he began creating a heavily

541
00:37:09,20 --> 00:37:09,940
armed militia

542
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,690
the Mahdi Army which took over Baghdad
Shiite ghetto

543
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,990
and much of southern iraq if you tended
to the issues of policing

544
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,540
if there hadn't been the looting then
you would have had people turning to

545
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,670
sectarian militias as their sources

546
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:29,190
neighborhood security or how worked on
recalling the Iraqi military to deal

547
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,619
with the security vacuum

548
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:34,970
the army Central Command CENTCOM
supported this policy

549
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,560
what's up comedy they had factored into
their planning to bring it back to the

550
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,328
Iraqi army use Iraqi army to seal the
borders to

551
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,589
provide static security things and also
help in the reconstruction /url nation

552
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:50,578
from cellco

553
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,359
he said hey Jade Korea like everything's
gonna you did a great job you need team

554
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,799
lectern and a day and all them by the
way the president is

555
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,310
morning jerry brimmer as the
presidential employer

556
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,850
bremen was a former Foreign Service
Officer like most official sent to Iraq

557
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,730
brimmer did not speak Arabic had no
previous experience with the mideast

558
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,230
or post-war reconstruction and had never
served in the military

559
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,240
after grammer's arrival more how would
be phased out

560
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,259
and the Coalition Provisional Authority
CPA would take its place

561
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,580
we intend to have a very I

562
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,700
affected efficient and well-organized

563
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,290
and Oberon on general garner an iron

564
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,210
pledge to working very closely together
he's done an outstanding job we set up a

565
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,980
syriza briefers form he's been a day
going throughout her body was not and he

566
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,650
took charge

567
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:52,790
I came home like third or fourth at the
gym

568
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,109
between May 1st in his departure for
Iraq on May 10th

569
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:59,930
bremmer worked at the pentagon and met
frequently with rumsfeld

570
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,319
will forward and undersecretary dogfight
I'm

571
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,609
romer also worked closely with walter
slocum a former undersecretary of

572
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:08,279
defense

573
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,690
Rumsfeld had appointed to be in charge
of post-war policy

574
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,410
for iraq's military they contacted me
mid-march

575
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:19,250
2003 did cross your mind to think you
know isn't it kinda

576
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,369
wait for them to be thinking about this
yes

577
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:28,480
Digitel in there

578
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,530
now like bremmer slocum had never served
in the military

579
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,470
had never been to Iraq had no post-war
reconstruction experience

580
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,520
and spoke no Arabic in Bremer

581
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,540
first 10 days at work while still in
Washington DC

582
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,910
he made three fateful policy decisions
his first decision

583
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,000
was to stop the formation of an interim
Iraqi government

584
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,10
even though OJ goner have been working
to establish one Jay Carney Shirley

585
00:39:55,10 --> 00:40:00,109
supportable to get some governing body
ever Rockies but this was said

586
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:04,130
done away with on the way to baghdad and
I didn't think I'm gonna do about it

587
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,630
beforehand in order to die

588
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,970
we had expected I think I can say we
have been promised

589
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,140
that there would be a sovereign
government

590
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,720
virtually I'm in charge

591
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,220
and everyone will do what I say and
that's it

592
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,279
understand and that's kinda the way

593
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,70
L paul bremer came across much much much

594
00:40:29,70 --> 00:40:33,10
to hardcore into mission-driven

595
00:40:33,10 --> 00:40:36,359
to see that is exclusion love the iraqis

596
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,810
early on from major participation in the
decision-making process was a grievous

597
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:46,640
error

598
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,390
may 2003 we've got the the legal
occupation of Iraq

599
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,330
I set up a time believe now but that was
mister

600
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,400
on the american basically to leave Iraq
completely

601
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,120
not iraqi people threw a rock

602
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,549
the reaction to his next two decisions
would be dramatically worse

603
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,540
d better education I am today
establishing

604
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,670
an iraqi the bath occasion Council

605
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,780
to ensure that the structure and
influence at the bath party

606
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,120
is eliminated for good bremmer second
decision his first formal order as head

607
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,990
of the CPA

608
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,529
purged an estimated 50,000 members of
the bath party

609
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,910
which saddam had used to rule the rock
for most primers order meant

610
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,200
permanent unemployment the policy also
crippled iraq's government

611
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,720
educational system and economy because i
purge senior government officials who

612
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,939
would join the party simply to survive
under Saddam's regime

613
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,900
I was walking down the hall and master
Robin racial can be a city seen this

614
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,550
lesser what is around and she says

615
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,830
the best case russia now so I read it
real quick and i said i this

616
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,220
don't think we can do this she said well
I think you're good cock torture

617
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,359
to let's say a man tasered about let
miss

618
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,480
go through this and the skin on the
phone from selling secrets of a little

619
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,620
bit he said not all

620
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,240
I'll have that flexibility opinion
mortars mnemonics so that and that's

621
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,49
good he may have command

622
00:42:10,50 --> 00:42:13,160
and spoken to me at great length about I
just don't remember

623
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,210
honestly don't remember you remember
these guys coming in and saying she

624
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,190
doesn't even have 1000 people and

625
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,720
my god what are you doing I just a young
you I was working 20 hours a day in that

626
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,160
period as well this wasn't the only
thing on my

627
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,230
list of things to do the first five days
I was there

628
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,260
bremmer appointed Ahmed Chalabi to head
the debate

629
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,830
application Council Chalabi use the
position to eliminate political rivals

630
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:40,840
the bath occasion was so deep that I we
were able to get the government run in

631
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,590
as efficiently as we should processes we
should have and you had a lotta

632
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,700
disenfranchised

633
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,399
method

634
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,350
the were people who were kicked out of
their jobs

635
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,520
even tho the were just

636
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,480
professionals engineers direct or

637
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,110
the technocrat the intelligencia then

638
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,390
elementary school librarian being
conquered and then losing your job in

639
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,250
not have the means to support yourself
your family was incredibly humiliating

640
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:16,910
experience

641
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:22,970
it was primers third decision however
that was the most explosive

642
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,410
disbanding the Iraqi military and
intelligence services

643
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,799
the most important institutions in Iraq
CPA order number two

644
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,10
disbanded the Iraqi army Republican
Guard special Republican Guard

645
00:43:35,10 --> 00:43:38,510
and secret police overnight bremmer
rendered unemployed

646
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,540
and thereby infuriated half a million
armed men

647
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,300
equivalent to firing over five million
people in the United States

648
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,869
and so these men rather than helping to
prevent an insurgency

649
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:55,420
instead created one

650
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,320
on

651
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,900
I can't believe they did that

652
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,580
hundreds of thousands of families
dependent

653
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,860
on the army they didn't have an Intel
they didn't have

654
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,410
providers we by no

655
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,9
no money rely on God children

656
00:44:15,10 --> 00:44:18,20
have their war women wide stepsisters

657
00:44:18,20 --> 00:44:21,20
fathers and stop

658
00:44:21,20 --> 00:44:25,200
eating because they didn't have enough
money officially think it's 27 percent

659
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,919
unemployment

660
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,490
officially its its almost certainly much
higher

661
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,910
I would guessing where from forty to
fifty percent

662
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,330
is it any wonder that many of these
people who were militant who

663
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,700
almost all had at least some military
training since you had to serve in the

664
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,470
army in iraq

665
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,560
or they were active military would turn
to

666
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,40
joining the insurgency just as a means
to

667
00:44:49,40 --> 00:44:52,100
feed their family and as a means of
regaining some %uh that pride

668
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,480
in deciding to disband the Iraqi
military

669
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,540
bremer was on doing a policy supported
by both the US military

670
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,29
and by aura poll Hughes have a team

671
00:45:03,30 --> 00:45:06,960
that was seeking up a wreck your mean
he's beginning to find a lotto

672
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,430
and he had found a lot of them and we
had made over two hours to bring them

673
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:10,799
back

674
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,910
the soldiers when they registered had to
sign or fill out a questionnaire

675
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,170
about who the war what unit they were
with what they did what their skills or

676
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,340
what military equipment they had at home

677
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,800
want just a I'll a lot

678
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,300
information that would have been useful
to us and I was collecting all of that

679
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,720
but the DOD advisory team in charge of
dealing with the iraqi military

680
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,359
headed by walter slocum had remained in
Washington DC

681
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,920
had never visited Iraq I said I don't
see any reason to go out there I can get

682
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,770
ready better here in washington

683
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:50,259
and I urge them time and again in my
conversations with them from baghdad

684
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,570
that they needed to get over there
because there were people waiting

685
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:58,120
on them you know want me and in
particular to show up so he could make

686
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,89
decisions

687
00:45:59,90 --> 00:46:02,600
and get the ball rolling in his absence

688
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,170
I was left with the duty up

689
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,140
having to deal with the Iraqi army just
to keep contact with them

690
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,750
Iraqi army was essentially standing
there waiting

691
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,329
they were waiting for an overture there
waiting for what they thought would

692
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:17,880
happen

693
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,230
that someone would come to them and say

694
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,230
this is the point and your integral

695
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,69
to that point in we need you no one ever
did

696
00:46:29,69 --> 00:46:32,640
when the war was over on the major
maneuver fighting was over

697
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,540
who were simply Knoll units still in
existence

698
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,109
everybody had gone home generals and
commanders were coming back with entire

699
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:41,980
division saying here are my people

700
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,440
or the Iraqi officers towards the end up

701
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,780
on second or third meeting when baghdad
was going

702
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,79
yeah it was in chaos said

703
00:46:53,79 --> 00:46:57,829
call Paul I can have ten thousand
military policeman for you next week you

704
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:58,660
just tell me

705
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,460
I took that back to Bernie Kerik staff
and nothing

706
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:09,660
was done with it I'll

707
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,000
I'll five days after bremmer issued his
order

708
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
we were farewell in J garner because he
was going to leave Iraq

709
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,70
for good the next day we had to home
fees

710
00:47:22,70 --> 00:47:25,700
on the highway hang out from the Green
Zone

711
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,160
and they were ambushed in two soldiers
were killed

712
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,730
and that was when in my mind the
insurgency began

713
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:41,200
I'm

714
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,730
my colleagues and I could sit on the
Belkin here on the roof for the

715
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,240
republican power supply

716
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,259
we could watch tracers throughout
baghdad

717
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,650
we could watch the players different
colours that went up

718
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,369
working where american convoys have
certain compositions

719
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:00,50
or moving and being followed by the
insurgents

720
00:48:00,50 --> 00:48:03,000
go means

721
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,380
the

722
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,790
these guys all knew where those
munitions war

723
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,790
they are new how to get to those weapons
and how to use them

724
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,840
and you just sent them away and said
they don't exist

725
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,110
common sense tells me you don't do that

726
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,730
when you have a huge ammunition dumps
that weren't guarded until

727
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,110
several weeks if not a couple months
after major combat

728
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,400
action tended I'm standing there
watching these insurgents

729
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,850
pullout rockets and mortars and bombs
from these weapons caches that the

730
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,80
iraqis its store

731
00:48:40,80 --> 00:48:45,250
stashed everywhere and you go to the
British were to the US where is there

732
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,600
with your little GPS

733
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,980
receiver to hey guys no we found like

734
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,390
eighteen thousand million tons of bombs
and they're a bunch

735
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,350
iraqis there with ak-47s take me away
probably not the best idea

736
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:02,529
here's where it's located in a CDO we
just don't have enough people to cover

737
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:02,980
it

738
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,260
just I couldn't believe it was in the
right answer

739
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,570
go there and take care of it for your
security for the civilian security for

740
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:16,430
everybody it's just a bad idea

741
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:25,710
ok

742
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,49
anybody warn you that disbanding the
Army in this way

743
00:49:30,49 --> 00:49:33,200
would and then was fueling

744
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,450
major growth the insurgency not a
minister

745
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:41,249
nobody said that you know i'll settle

746
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:44,629
true but it nobody said nobody still
believe it's true

747
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,450
know I'll try and do not believe is true
a number the most senior generals

748
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,980
came to the canal hotel to UN
headquarters

749
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,670
and they were very explicit a
consequence have leading this order

750
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,539
stand

751
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:00,19
and of marginalizing this incredibly
powerful

752
00:50:00,19 --> 00:50:03,328
segment of society would be an
insurgency

753
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,779
lebanese on diplomat named Hassan salami

754
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:10,990
turned to his colleague as the generals
walked away after one of the meetings

755
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,740
and said I see bullets in their eyes

756
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,348
I see bullets in their eyes of even more
remarkable than the decision to disband

757
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,210
the army

758
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,420
was how that decision was made secretly

759
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,89
over a single week by a few men in
Washington DC who had never been to Iraq

760
00:50:28,89 --> 00:50:31,288
they did not consult with the military
commanders in Iraq

761
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:35,200
the Joint Chiefs of Staff or ha the
state department

762
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,730
the CIA the National Security Council or
even apparently

763
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:45,109
the President of the United States
walter slocum and Paul Hughes worry

764
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,999
interviewed

765
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:49,629
in order to reconstruct the events
leading to the dissolution of the army

766
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,690
these guys called themselves the
independent military gathering

767
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,29
independent military gathering at a
hundred thousand

768
00:50:57,29 --> 00:51:00,680
on the ninth with me and they already
had on defense against this was a

769
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,919
nationwide effort they brought me that

770
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,809
I wanted the printouts I wanted their
desks and they gave them to me and I

771
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:09,700
took them back with me Torre

772
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,489
I said here we go and I and I told Walt
and his crew

773
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:18,339
I've got these things they're here
waiting for you use believe that he and

774
00:51:18,339 --> 00:51:18,700
in

775
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,739
hoping to some Iraqi officers

776
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:25,349
who would have been prepared to
reconstitute

777
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,819
unit I'll he really had obtained
registration statements from 137

778
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,20
thousand in

779
00:51:31,20 --> 00:51:34,400
he had internet he made he may have read
gotten

780
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,40
he met couldn't because nobody could
have gotten statement 330,000

781
00:51:38,40 --> 00:51:41,130
anybody for any in the chaos that
prevailed

782
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:45,70
that point they had a career system
setup that was running around

783
00:51:45,70 --> 00:51:48,120
the the metropolitan area baghdad

784
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,830
Okemos all above a bus for a and Kirkuk

785
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:59,600
and I don't understand I I mean I given
how difficult it was to do anything

786
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,9
just operational and organizational

787
00:52:03,10 --> 00:52:06,500
nobody on 137 pounds what wasn't there

788
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,470
he never met with these people he had no
clue so did you tell slocum

789
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:16,40
this that this was going on yes he knew
this he and his staff knew this

790
00:52:16,40 --> 00:52:20,80
ambassador bremer it you had already
made a recommendation

791
00:52:20,80 --> 00:52:23,920
him and he had already made at least a
tentative recommendation

792
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,10
to Secretary Rumsfeld about the
dissolution of the army

793
00:52:28,10 --> 00:52:31,610
I'm punishment your the primary issue

794
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,570
yes on May 9 yes

795
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:40,10
okay the 9th of May was the last time I
had a conversation

796
00:52:40,10 --> 00:52:44,280
with are walt slocum and we talked on
the phone before one out

797
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,350
did you ever say to him were thinking
you have disbanding the Iraqi army in

798
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,610
stopping your efforts to recall the
Iraqi Army's and one other thing should

799
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:51,880
we

800
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,810
my did just you ever say that to him in
those words no

801
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,310
the conversation was I'm coming over

802
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,930
I'm concerned about where I'm going to
be living you know am I going to have a

803
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,350
motor pool with me

804
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,730
my own cooks yada yada yada me it was

805
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,710
nothing about the Iraqi military and I
was giving him an update on wall

806
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:18,310
so he didn't say that he had already
comes it the tentative conclusion and

807
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,650
recommended to Brammer

808
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,760
to dissolve the arm absolutely not
because here he said that I would have

809
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,800
been on Jay's

810
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,190
doorstep post haste to you guys

811
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,570
came up with this idea and recommended
as Secretary Rumsfeld

812
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,40
without having spoken in you senior
people in Iraq responsible for these

813
00:53:36,40 --> 00:53:36,490
matters

814
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:36,910
that it

815
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,569
subject to and precisely because of the
fact

816
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,650
that it had actually been only thought
it for a few days

817
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,210
because remember was going on in Burma
said the rooms before I make a

818
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,360
recommendation I will

819
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:59,320
talk people on the ground the was a
surprise you with its been discussed

820
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,590
with apples to know him discuss me was
proper

821
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:07,420
big surprise really you never called up
corner and said we're thinking of doing

822
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:07,940
this

823
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,690
do you think this is a good idea go

824
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:16,740
secretive don't you think that might
have been a mistake

825
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,330
no what was your reaction

826
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:30,560
which you think authorities a poor idea
I thought we needed bring them back John

827
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,890
Abbas a day McCarron

828
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,440
were cops p tell me how about her in up
let's get the army-backed let's get

829
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,970
their army

830
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:41,419
there is a large number of former Iraqi
soldiers are unemployed now

831
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,840
that is a huge concern not only from a
security standpoint but from an economic

832
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
standpoint

833
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,280
there they're not earning an income
right now and there's the announcement

834
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,590
that the Iraqi army has been disbanded

835
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,880
and I was floored and at this particular
point I'm

836
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,420
walt slocum and his team still were not
and

837
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,40
iraq colonel Hughes was the person who
is in charge in dealing with the Iraqi

838
00:55:06,40 --> 00:55:09,740
army because none of the people from
your advisory group and yet showed up in

839
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,69
Iraq including you

840
00:55:11,70 --> 00:55:15,110
didn't you think that maybe you should
speak with him about this

841
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,460
my cock him

842
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,850
that's funny he says that the order

843
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,610
spending the army came as a complete
surprise to him and he learned it by

844
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,470
watching it on television and

845
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,680
airport the checks

846
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,410
believe that so much surprised but it
possible

847
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:39,170
I'll talk mean I talk to him we work
together on

848
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,430
a daily basis during the time I was
there he came on the 16th

849
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,940
of May 16 to 440 whirlwind tour of the
country

850
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:53,50
now and then he left and he didn't come
back until the middle of June

851
00:55:53,50 --> 00:56:05,460
no correct he didn't tell you that

852
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,800
wish idea to disband the entire army was
one that came as quite a surprise to me

853
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,500
I C what was your reaction when he
learned of it

854
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,970
I so we did just created a problem had a
lot about work

855
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,9
soldiers president already made a
different decision which was to keep

856
00:56:21,10 --> 00:56:21,710
battalion

857
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:25,170
and below in force earlier yes

858
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,670
yeah but well within I mean it couple
days proximity

859
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,120
I think most of us were caught
politically unawares were completely

860
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,830
unawares by this disbanding the army

861
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,840
Czech Republic found out about it as I
did

862
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,350
which was how you just as we found out
one day he renounced to be disbanded the

863
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:41,730
army

864
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:50,930
about kindly to rise shot to speak for
yourself do you have any idea how much

865
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,730
the president knew about these decisions
in advance whether he had known as I've

866
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,320
said before I don't know if he was in

867
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,70
I missed from children no idea I was in
my office but two hours

downstairs and met with him in the

872
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,910

00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,710
they now have no recourse they have no
money coming to that what are they

878
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:43,30

%uh

880
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:55,339

here there are some who feel like that

885
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,959
you know the conditions are such that
they can attack as their managers bring

886
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:14,379
them on

887
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,279

we have a limited problem some better
enders

895
00:58:51,20 --> 00:58:54,160
some small remnants of the old regime
who

896
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,190
are using professional military tactics
to attack and kill our soldiers as they

897
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,640
did

898
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,730
this morning we don't think this is a
coordinated campaign you know there's no

899
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,610
this is a Google a war been alternately
we move there's

900
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,790
the Rays will award as a consequence for
that blast

901
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:14,450
I saw for a penetrating traumatic brain
injury

902
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,430
and I i last the procession up the light
in my right eye

903
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,399
I E suffer a penetrating my left eye
that

904
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,670
get me a Mac Lahore in the retina

905
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:34,730
and will we fight we fight all too long
to we hear the cease-fire

906
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,640
house a goner and my driver lost both
his legs

907
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,960
and injected me out and now

908
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,820
a separate a.m. fractured Famer nearly
lost my right arm

909
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,300
and clap song in Tom close payable and

910
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,630
I have since gone to the dictionary and
I am looked up

911
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,600
several things one of which I can
immediately recapture but one was

912
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,940
a guerrilla war another was insurgency
in other words

913
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:08,539
a unconventional war pardon me work

914
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:13,569
no that someone else's business quagmire
so I don't do quite Myers

915
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:16,730
a guy I know music counterinsurgency
expert

916
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,349
he was at the palace where the CPA is
headquartered

917
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:23,390
and he was talking to an army colonel

918
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,470
his desk was right outside members
office any said

919
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:31,520
eastward insurgency and the army colonel
held up his hand and said

920
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:37,99
there is no insurgency in Iraq there is
a high level up domestic violence

921
01:00:37,99 --> 01:00:40,589
the security problem increasingly

922
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:45,210
aid into our ability to do our job I had
hoped

923
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:50,250
to establish some neighborhood advisory
councils

924
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,490
based rejected generals gave probably
the most coherent

925
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,720
briefing on the structure and
organization

926
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,359
love any fifteen hundred year old city
that I think anyone could have gotten

927
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:05,650
one of them launched all to

928
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:10,420
this plan for neighborhood Advisory
Group

929
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,700
he had this whole grass roots bottom-up
democratization

930
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,930
thing nailed it wasn't absolutely

931
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,270
beautiful planet and what happened to it
he was assassinated

932
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,450
in the country slipping more more under
control the entire time

933
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:28,549
I think in some ways bremmer his aides
no

934
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:42,470
how bad things were getting outsider the
blast walls

935
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:47,60
headquartered in Saddam's former
Republican Palace the CPA compound

936
01:01:47,60 --> 01:01:48,480
called the Green Zone

937
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,270
was shielded by seven miles a blast
walls to a huge lines

938
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,310
iraqis engineers public officials

939
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,369
people just want to help to translate

940
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:03,550
standing in line at the gates of the
palace

941
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:07,470
May 28 and not been written by anyone
just all go away

942
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:11,640
can come back these people came there
and tried once in two to three times and

943
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,359
I gave up

944
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,848
I absolutely hated the Green Zone I got
out every chance I could

945
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:18,780
to meet with the Rockies and sit in
their homes and hear their complaints

946
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,30
and their farts

947
01:02:20,30 --> 01:02:23,680
and I would come back and tell dance
more you have a problem

948
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:31,230
you not communicating to the iraqis
version only

949
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,619
be sends me a little spoke Arabic what
counts

950
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,680
maybe 5-6 a month among the top

951
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,399
40 fifties seventy officials we had
regional experts who had served

952
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,190
in iraq but is has been documented many
of them

953
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:52,190
were not involved in the initial parche
after the invasion of Iraq in the

954
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,320
initial occupation

955
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,660
so that expertise was lost tell us how
your time there

956
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:00,270
ended um understands me

957
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:03,450
did too sensitive subject say what
you're comfortable saying

958
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,109
I'm plus a that'd it

959
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:11,259
it ended much sooner than I had
anticipated and ended

960
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,599
much sooner than i I would have wanted
home

961
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:18,130
I really would have liked to have stayed
in and tried to you

962
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:21,980
given all he had given her frustrations
and the limitations it was still a very

963
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:26,780
worthwhile place to be now and
worthwhile thing to be trying to do

964
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,220
you know why she was hard the I know why

965
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,98
have I was told was it and she was
difficult to get on with them she had

966
01:03:35,99 --> 01:03:40,160
was offering opinions or counter to the
prevailing wisdom in bag at the time

967
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,529
we were getting new people in
afterburner showed up

968
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:48,119
kids right out of college

969
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:51,460
you know they have a baccalaureate
degree

970
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,230
just got it before better

971
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:57,270
previous spring daddy made a
contribution to the campaign

972
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:02,160
so the kid gets a chance to go over and
experience some fun travel and adventure

973
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,399
home pretty boys that's what I call them

974
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,40
they sat around Broomes front door and
did nothing

975
01:04:10,40 --> 01:04:14,859
during the course my time in and in the
green zone when I was in the past I

976
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:16,109
bumped into one of my sons

977
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:19,578
just graduated as to what she is doing
and

978
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:23,490
she said well I couldn't believe her
luck I'm being asked to

979
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:27,279
to do the traffic plan for the city and
I'm

980
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,920
and after she had any training new
school planning she said now

981
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:37,780
so she's pressure to school and had been
put in charge of something quite

982
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,290
complicated to say the least and being
an embankment traffic and you as a

983
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:42,759
parent

984
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,10
must officials that were on three-month
contracts

985
01:04:46,10 --> 01:04:49,380
as soon as somebody would develop the
appropriate relationships with the

986
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,89
iraqis

987
01:04:50,89 --> 01:04:54,230
in ninety days 108 120 days to go home

988
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:58,990
and that is a terrible way to run an
organization

989
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,709
there was a very strong on preference

990
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:06,390
on the on by the Pentagon to have
American

991
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:09,740
companies doing the work and there are

992
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,990
numerous instances where local Iraqi
contractors

993
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:16,649
proposed that they could do pieces at
work for much much less than

994
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,900
in fact the American contractors could
have done

995
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,250
and I took a very different approach to
our work than many coalition units have

996
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,630
because we word very very closely with
the iraqis

997
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:31,550
if we're sitting in a meeting at ways
Americans

998
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,440
and iraqis and the iraqis had just as
much

999
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,160
say is we did we were building border
forts right next to force being put up

1000
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,649
by the Army Corps of Engineers

1001
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:44,350
that big American contractor Parsons I
mean we are forced design-build

1002
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:49,140
and dedicated a period of about five
months I think we left the Parsons force

1003
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,589
which had been started maybe year before
we arrived we're still not finished

1004
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,660
while

1005
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,89
of

1006
01:05:56,89 --> 01:05:58,640
the

1007
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,759
of the military officers would often be
out in the field expanding the the small

1008
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,440
amount of funds that they had

1009
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,230
for immediate action to say clean up the
street

1010
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,470
affects some temporary improvements in
the sewage system

1011
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:18,319
once the military it expanded its small
amount over money to do that

1012
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,260
it would come back to CPA we need this
this and this for these projects and

1013
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,780
it's going to cost as much and so forth
and

1014
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,160
to disappear it would simply disappear

1015
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,480
what happen to my request what request
in this happen

1016
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:41,539
over and over again of

1017
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,369
eighteen billion dollars that was
committed by congress

1018
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:47,499
arm was really misconceived

1019
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:52,348
and misspent if it was spent it all we
expect to produce enough electricity for

1020
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:56,29
all Iraqis to have electrical service 24
hours daily

1021
01:06:56,29 --> 01:07:00,189
something essential to their hopes for
the future

1022
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:03,848
it was fraud there was corruption om

1023
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:08,669
there was waste I'm

1024
01:07:08,669 --> 01:07:12,219
the ordinary people have that and

1025
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:16,109
first on before 2002 our city water
comes

1026
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:20,9
every like now and then every two or
three days we spend

1027
01:07:20,9 --> 01:07:24,369
want to shivering covered in blankets
because we didn't have enough fuel to

1028
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:24,880
war

1029
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,939
offering the and that he does that's

1030
01:07:27,939 --> 01:07:45,609
thats that's the life with it

1031
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:50,790
in May 2003 the united nations sent its
best expert in post-war reconstruction

1032
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,340
to help the US occupation

1033
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,380
he was a Brazilian diplomat name Sergio
Vieira de Mello

1034
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,760
even though the UN was given nothing
meaningful to do

1035
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,460
coffin and supplements and my best if
anybody can

1036
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,630
carve out a bigger role for the UN its
my guy

1037
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,830
it surgery on and on you know was part
of his tee you now his

1038
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:13,440
principle political adviser at that time

1039
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,670
went together to back it up no political
team

1040
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,890
we're all a bit speakers and we'd good
experience working in

1041
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:24,620
in the region and so on when he's a tard
you did that is very very poignant in

1042
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,849
retrospect is that

1043
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:29,120
seen that the United States had boarded
itself up

1044
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,170
in the green zone and was not accessing
the iraqi Street

1045
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:38,510
Sergio created a structure in Iraq that
was precisely the opposite in the green

1046
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:38,740
zone

1047
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:42,340
Michael the anti Green Zone come listen
I'm listening to political

1048
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,170
leaders

1049
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:47,240
although meeting with them on a daily
basis who had

1050
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,849
various discussions with his military
who came to the UN

1051
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:54,109
and met with surgery at the men on

1052
01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:57,730
ask him you know to mediate in the
dispute that they have

1053
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:01,719
with the CPAP you have these long long
lines right outside the region but they

1054
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,420
could not make their complaints felt

1055
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,580
in in the UN compound by contrast was
incredibly porous

1056
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,710
if you wanted to complain the UN was was
very very eager to hear your complaint

1057
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:13,340
and Sergio saudis his role

1058
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,630
to relate those complaints to bremmer at
the highest levels in hopes that some

1059
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,20
reason to get tended to

1060
01:09:18,20 --> 01:09:21,700
before insurgency took root a meeting
with him

1061
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,179
regularly

1062
01:09:23,179 --> 01:09:27,520
and sharing my advice in my experience
with him soon as bremmer

1063
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,850
had made use upsurge it had made you so
the UN

1064
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:35,299
are he had almost no time for the united
nations and so what's urgent live

1065
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:36,618
through was two months

1066
01:09:36,618 --> 01:09:40,880
I love in effect being used as a vehicle
to get to certain segments in iraqi

1067
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,699
society

1068
01:09:41,698 --> 01:09:45,118
and in for his last month what he
endured was not having his phone calls

1069
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:45,839
returned

1070
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,908
and so on issues like detention policy
hollings was one other

1071
01:09:49,908 --> 01:09:53,330
the issues that surgeon raised again and
again with Bremer and with

1072
01:09:53,330 --> 01:10:01,530
general Sanchez the hearings have
prisoners primer would hear none of it

1073
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:06,240
up

1074
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,780
be three or four crucial months

1075
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:13,670
after the fall of Baghdad the two mean
things the US military was doing on the

1076
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:14,530
ground were

1077
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:18,599
looking for WMD supplies and looking for
saddam hussein

1078
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:24,550
process have those searches busting in
the doors at night rounding up people

1079
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:54,360
taken and Apple grade having mass
arrests really in bettering effect

1080
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,490
you happen to be a military aged iraqi
in an area of operation with the

1081
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:01,389
american military went into there's a
good chance you gonna be

1082
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,600
arrested aren't turned is suspected &
Surgeons

1083
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,50
just have been a military age man and in
that area but operation

1084
01:11:09,50 --> 01:11:13,130
in many occasions you take the you know
the Iraqi man a military each other's

1085
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:13,770
family

1086
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:25,260
you taking the breadwinner

1087
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,990
you and your not just him but you and
your extended family

1088
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:35,380
because he's probably supporting more
than his immediate family

1089
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,500
whenever they here the American

1090
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,760
helicopters pro-american tax driving in
their street

1091
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,660
they immediately wake up even if it's
like 2 o'clock in the morning

1092
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,690
and prepare themselves for the pension
because it

1093
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:52,870
it for them this is a usual thing
happening even now

1094
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:57,960
new attacks on the american soldiers
themselves

1095
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,10
and so the responders attacks by going
out and trying to find the insurgents

1096
01:12:03,10 --> 01:12:06,880
anymore and trying to find the
insurgents day sometimes

1097
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,550
arrested the wrong person they even
sometimes

1098
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:15,890
killed the wrong person are ones people
arrested they tended to disappear in the

1099
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:20,770
American military prison system for a
long time without a trace their families

1100
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:28,560
couldn't get any word on

1101
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,860
it's difficult to understand what it
feels like to be an Occupy purse

1102
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,80
they point to conceive energy they stop
you in a driving

1103
01:12:35,80 --> 01:12:38,580
iraqis not understand instructions given
to them at

1104
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:41,950
traffic checkpoints they would approach
to quickly they will get shot and killed

1105
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:46,120
mostly American units that I spent time
with have tried very very hard to always

1106
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,99
do the right thing

1107
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,150
and to not kill anyone or injure anyone
have been arm

1108
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,730
intended to are needed to but there's no
question that

1109
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,980
the wars are messy and this one in Iraq

1110
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,599
with the way the insurgency is being
waged is particularly so

1111
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,90
one after another you have these these
have short term decisions which by the

1112
01:13:05,90 --> 01:13:38,40
and have 2003 met you had a country with
an insurgency underway

1113
01:13:38,40 --> 01:13:44,119
up

1114
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:54,679
good

1115
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:58,10
russian-made truck pulled up right
outside Sergio

1116
01:13:58,10 --> 01:14:02,320
their dollars window and set of just a
huge amount

1117
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:07,309
explosives the entire southwestern
corner at the UN building collapsed

1118
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:11,360
Sergio was under the rubble and alive
for more than three hours

1119
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,159
awaiting rescue we lost money colleagues
that

1120
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:19,989
moment I think it will slow the sign
that something dramatic what happened

1121
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:23,349
country then search had become that
lethal

1122
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:27,449
full-fledged ready for my mom struggle
and long fight

1123
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:33,169
with the coalition forces

1124
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:37,360
by 2004 the relationship between the
military and the Iraqi people

1125
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,290
have grown toxic

1126
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:48,650
right the corner where should like
character

1127
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,780
hard

1128
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,620
school

1129
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,769
right here home we can use deadly for

1130
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,650
we can't use deadly force

1131
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:02,629
few your shit

1132
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,940
PC arm all these civilians who come over
to work for

1133
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:10,969
on the private contractors who were
doing so much to work with the

1134
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:11,949
reconstruction

1135
01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:21,928
religious because we don't have enough
troops at these

1136
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:26,90
gets have special guests and they're not
what these people they have brought

1137
01:15:26,90 --> 01:15:30,59
yet and so on they have the right to
shoot people just like that

1138
01:15:30,59 --> 01:15:33,610
i've seen and of a lot of civilian
contractors who have been

1139
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:37,18
particularly violent and arm

1140
01:15:37,19 --> 01:16:15,330
and in very short sighted in terms what
they're doing

1141
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:19,400
saddam me an internal hard on themselves
the whole other issue 1

1142
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,400
luckily Asia what month are done the

1143
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,230
a saddam and why do not have a
conscience

1144
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:30,360
that he was up with a limp amount of
money

1145
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:36,179
not to lose only a little

1146
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,449
sounding

1147
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:42,900
much

1148
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,699
finance

1149
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:51,940
the relief I demand about the guys

1150
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:56,460
by early 2004 for luger a city of
350,000 people

1151
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:05,350
West Baghdad have become the center of
the Sunni insurgency

1152
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,900
on March 31st 2004

1153
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,910
for american military contractors were
killed

1154
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,10
and their bodies were dragged through
the streets of a Luger by cheering

1155
01:17:14,10 --> 01:17:14,790
crowds

1156
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:21,170
beginning in early 2004

1157
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:25,550
the National Intelligence Council a
powerful 12-person committee that sits

1158
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,820
on top america's intelligence community

1159
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,989
conducted several assessment serve the
growing insurgency

1160
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:34,839
which he presented to the white house
and senior administration officials

1161
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,960
well we're chronicling worked was a
deepening insurgency

1162
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,420
who is broadening it was not limited to
foreign fighters

1163
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:48,870
or disaffected batters what we called
the insurgency really is a multi-faceted

1164
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,960
deeply rooted they I it's not just a few

1165
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,420
about his dad and uRS is not just a a
few extremists from overseas

1166
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:02,489
but rather reflected multiple
motivations and frustrations among the

1167
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:03,900
iraqi people themselves

1168
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,230
has the economic situation was
deteriorating

1169
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:11,000
has people's personal security was
becoming

1170
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,20
weaker and has resentment at the
American occupation was growing

1171
01:18:16,20 --> 01:18:21,110
its K played at a

1172
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:25,509
several scenarios it said

1173
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:30,150
white could be lousy life could be okay
life could be better

1174
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:33,759
president haven't read it not even the
one-page summary

1175
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,350
over which we work so hard to produce
these findings to single readable page

1176
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:41,600
president and not read even the
executive summary correct

1177
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,179
they were just

1178
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:49,429
guessing as to what conditions might be
like with your estimate

1179
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:52,940
half the number of people in Iraq who
have been

1180
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:57,719
active at some level in the insurgency
active in some level

1181
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:01,420
if the if you say supporting providing
safe haven to

1182
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:10,510
I potentially you know well over a
hundred thousand people for

1183
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:18,890
filed

1184
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,409
despite the intensification of the
insurgency they were still not

1185
01:19:22,409 --> 01:19:23,170
sufficient

1186
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:27,140
armored vehicles for american soldiers
in Iraq we never had a single armored

1187
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,480
Humvee while we are in Iraq

1188
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,659
threw out 2003 we went to Iraq in 2004
with

1189
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:37,420
on armored Humvees and they were given
armor kits

1190
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:41,620
in kuwait which were just sort of cut
out doors with no windows

1191
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:45,670
arm hand the bullet-proof windshield and
that's about it

1192
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,909
if you're on the hadn't been armored
what do you think a damage

1193
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:54,299
that I D would have been I'm think it
would been daily why we soldiers

1194
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,120
have to dig through local landfills for
pieces of scrap metal

1195
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,670
and compromise ballistic last up armored
vehicles and why do we have those

1196
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:10,760
resources readily available to us

1197
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,910
it's essentially a matter of Physics it
isn't a matter of money

1198
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:18,389
it is a matter on the part of the army
%uh desire its it's a matter of

1199
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,350
production

1200
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:24,60
and and capability of doing it we have I
will be a plant closing down

1201
01:20:24,60 --> 01:20:27,650
in america you know I mean a I'm not an

1202
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,889
I'm not a factory expertise retool them
to to produce a member Tom the

1203
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:35,280
it shouldn't be that difficult you go to
war with the army you hang out

1204
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:44,849
another harming you might want or wish
to have it at a later time

1205
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:46,590
in November 2004

1206
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:51,100
the pentagon decided to attack for luger
in an attempt to recapture the city from

1207
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,390
the Sunni insurgency

1208
01:20:52,390 --> 01:21:05,320
for losers 350,000 residents were warned
to leave

1209
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,360
the battle destroys seventy percent of
the city and renders a hundred and fifty

1210
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,839
thousand people homeless

1211
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,590
despite intense combat many insurgents
escape

1212
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:21,540
forty marines were killed while the US
military was preoccupied with a Luger

1213
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:33,730
Shiite militias were taking over
southern iraq

1214
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:36,928
there's nothing like an army your and
major

1215
01:21:36,929 --> 01:21:43,150
I'm large elements have hundreds of
people trying to overthrow where

1216
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:46,739
or to change the situation in August
2004

1217
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:49,869
the holy city of Najaf is taken over by
the Mahdi Army

1218
01:21:49,869 --> 01:21:53,349
the Shiite militia controlled by muqtada
also order

1219
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:58,110
room

1220
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:02,619
essentially that turnover we got from
the army unit that we replace was

1221
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:05,699
that most things in Niger for

1222
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:10,320
pretty peaceful except there's this
three thousand-man militia force that

1223
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,389
occupies the centre

1224
01:22:11,389 --> 01:22:16,239
the city in runaround flying on the
moors landing

1225
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,769
Michael to the the first into the police
station

1226
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:23,770
reviews took up positions along side the
Iraqi police

1227
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:28,150
and defend it from a Russian but it
wasn't until the end of August that we

1228
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,409
actually did a full-scale assault

1229
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:38,59
on the old city just to collude

1230
01:22:38,60 --> 01:22:41,560
democracy cannot provide for the iraqi
people people will say

1231
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:46,30
to help democracy we need a strong man
and I can see the strong man already in

1232
01:22:46,30 --> 01:22:46,580
the offing

1233
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:50,40
his name is booked at the side and I
would say that this is not

1234
01:22:50,40 --> 01:22:54,40
a good choice for the future leader
earlier where you part

1235
01:22:54,40 --> 01:22:58,19
deliberations about whether to

1236
01:22:58,20 --> 01:23:01,250
capture or kill more titles hotter yes I
was

1237
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:05,520
did we see maternal side as a
troublemaker in a thorn in the side

1238
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,800
absolutely we wanted to arrest him it
was it gets back in my view to the

1239
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:10,180
matter

1240
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,780
trip strip the US military wanna be
diverted from their major mission

1241
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:18,450
to go after what would have been a good
probably short term but difficult to

1242
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:22,690
and I'm sure bloody battle and

1243
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:27,780
ultimately that's what won out after
elections were held in iraq on December

1244
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,480
15th 2005

1245
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,790
the United Iraqi Alliance which Muqtada
all starters party is a major

1246
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,740
participant

1247
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,980
took nearly half the seats in Iraq's
central government

1248
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:42,169
that's not easy being a Marine his some
you know to my buddies were killed

1249
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:48,500
by him and his militia and now looking
Iraq and see him as a rising politician

1250
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:53,610
Thrissur another Shiite group with
insiders Alliance

1251
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:57,349
is scary the Supreme Council for Islamic
Revolution in Iraq

1252
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:00,610
ski resort leadership lived in Iran for
twenty years

1253
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,780
and is frequently pro-iranian

1254
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,889
these two Shiite group which sometimes
engage in armed combat with each other

1255
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:12,40
are politically allied against soon
group Muqtada al solders Mahdi Army

1256
01:24:12,40 --> 01:24:15,300
continues to clash with US forces I'll

1257
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,820
level of activity that we see today from
a military standpoint I think

1258
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:23,200
curly decline I think they're in the in
the last throws at you will love the

1259
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,000
insurgency

1260
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,240
when secretary rumsfeld and

1261
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,219
and Vice President Cheney made their
comments about the insurgency

1262
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,90
dying out being a few defenders Center
you

1263
01:24:35,90 --> 01:24:39,30
new that the intelligence estimates
already

1264
01:24:39,30 --> 01:24:42,160
indicated that they were wrong I had
been due

1265
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,380
iraqi times a new with the facts on the
ground were

1266
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,700
they'll have to speak and they will be
judged by their own

1267
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:57,460
words and actions but to I knew with the
fracture

1268
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,260
starting in 2005 the administration's
slowly began to correct

1269
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:05,470
some other two mistakes it accelerated
training up the Iraqi army

1270
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:08,820
and appointed a Muslim diplomat so many
calls out

1271
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,309
as ambassador I'm in June 2006

1272
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:16,80
ambassador columns out sent an ominous
cable to come to Lisa rice

1273
01:25:16,80 --> 01:25:20,430
iraqis working for the embassy could not
tell their families where they worked

1274
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:25,330
for fear of being killed they ask what
will happen if the Americans evacuate

1275
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:29,440
many plan ahead for their own abduction
I'm

1276
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,519
six months later the day after
Republicans lose control of congress

1277
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,120
president bush announces Donald
Rumsfeld's resignation

1278
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,269
the new secretary of defense Robert
Gates is a pragmatist who had been

1279
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:42,880
privately critical to war

1280
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,570
I am making a change at the secretary
defence to bring a fresh perspective

1281
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:51,9
as to how to achieve something I think
most Americans want which is a victory

1282
01:25:51,10 --> 01:26:00,479
on

1283
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:06,979
me

1284
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:10,389
by the time Rumsfeld has replaced the
rock is out of control

1285
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:13,719
the country is increasingly dominated by
militias

1286
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:19,119
insurgents criminals and warlords mixed
areas are purged by ethnic cleansing

1287
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:24,150
Shiite militias have infiltrated the
police using them for sectarian killings

1288
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:27,638
kidnappings and violent deaths have
reached several hundred

1289
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:32,969
per day go and move the ball

1290
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:37,229
Garnett outlets in the we have so many
kinds of militia

1291
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:41,139
you have the multi-millions your you
have the bed that means they have many

1292
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:42,550
uses in this country

1293
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:47,320
and the all on her the democratic reform

1294
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,619
at least some people and Kim

1295
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:53,848
security is terrible and many
neighborhoods

1296
01:26:53,849 --> 01:26:57,360
where the ever-present threat of car
bombs and ID's

1297
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,89
was with the unabomber hand

1298
01:27:00,90 --> 01:27:03,210
on in the world No up with no think
it'll be

1299
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:06,340
who is this love the bulbous open

1300
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:10,850
the heart a blog moving within the
heinous crime and you

1301
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,370
I didn't like my 30 Morgan kidnappings
especially

1302
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:17,990
sheer money-making gangster stuff
kidnapping over

1303
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:22,500
or small boat ride from the hotel you
know car just stopped grab the boy and

1304
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,220
drove off

1305
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,20
parents get around to note in all
somehow have to raise as much money in a

1306
01:27:26,20 --> 01:27:26,550
week

1307
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:30,000
it's not what you just have one or two
or three kidnappings because 100

1308
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,360
and you get overwhelmed on my phone I
would probably a military man nothing

1309
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,429
them a honeymoon but no I'm you know you
will do it anymore you know to whom and

1310
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,790
what I did have a good man and I'm going
on

1311
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:45,870
just a delusion individuals who are

1312
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:49,920
asking for helper or or soon don't

1313
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,500
ask for help anymore why reported to the
police one we don't trust 'em

1314
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,200
to they may be committing some other
crime uniformed use just

1315
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,519
perforated all over the place so you
really have watsup

1316
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:04,240
rogue elements and people better using
your working into the guys in the

1317
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,200
security services

1318
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,269
now you can see people usted once menso
sis

1319
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:13,180
we don't know more on fake checkpoints
and the street style

1320
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:17,170
people passing and look into their ID's
and see if they were

1321
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:20,670
shots sony's kurds arabs and then

1322
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:27,120
you know can have them out tell them and
the same place

1323
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,120
when I said goodbye to my husband

1324
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:34,190
I think I'm not going up

1325
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:38,99
by late 2006 Baghdad had fallen into
your anarchy

1326
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,290
the US military controlled the Green
Zone

1327
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:46,30
and the area around Baghdad Airport
iraqi security forces controlled areas

1328
01:28:46,30 --> 01:28:47,259
in the east and south

1329
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:51,570
the Sunni militias controlled several
predominately Sunni neighborhoods

1330
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:55,699
Moqtada al solders Mahdi Army dominated
large areas

1331
01:28:55,699 --> 01:29:00,599
including the enormous Shiites love
Soccer City scary throw ball Shiite

1332
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,170
militia

1333
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:04,429
the bottom brigade controlled wealthier
Shiite areas

1334
01:29:04,429 --> 01:29:07,750
neighborhood organizations controlled
many small zones

1335
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:11,130
large areas were essentially controlled
by no one

1336
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:15,60
if

1337
01:29:15,60 --> 01:29:18,449
0 I'll

1338
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:21,549
from a study conducted by Harvard
professor Linda Bilmes

1339
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:25,919
and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz as a
bit early 2007

1340
01:29:25,919 --> 01:29:31,519
the US has spent 379 billion dollars
directly on the war in Iraq

1341
01:29:31,519 --> 01:29:36,90
future operating costs are estimated at
$389 billion dollars

1342
01:29:36,90 --> 01:29:39,329
the costs a veteran's health care and
lost productivity

1343
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:43,49
those serving in Iraq is $482 billion
dollars

1344
01:29:43,50 --> 01:29:46,719
the costs of demobilization and
replacing military equipment

1345
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,869
which is being used up six times faster
than normal is a hundred and sixty

1346
01:29:50,869 --> 01:29:51,858
billion dollars

1347
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:56,309
the increase in oil prices do the war
have cost the US economy

1348
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:59,829
400 and fifty billion dollars and

1349
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:04,249
in total the economic cost to the war is
projected to reach 1.8

1350
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:07,499
trillion dollars I'm

1351
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:11,949
suffering from most dramatic migraines

1352
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:18,558
and post-traumatic epilepsy sometimes

1353
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:22,599
I have Batman what he's

1354
01:30:22,599 --> 01:30:26,780
a while hopping but I am NOT scare them

1355
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:29,889
do you feel emotionally okay home

1356
01:30:29,889 --> 01:30:33,869
some time to slow I'm

1357
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:37,18
sometimes yes sometimes no

1358
01:30:37,19 --> 01:30:40,579
still have troll you know dealing with
them

1359
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:45,530
home house will have my apartment now
sometimes

1360
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:49,509
the big big cost

1361
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:53,719
in terms of veterans disability is for
the many hundreds of thousands of people

1362
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:54,939
who come back

1363
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:59,639
and they find that they can't work and
hold down a job in the way they used to

1364
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:03,189
because they're just not quite the same
as they were before

1365
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:08,550
how hot does it get in this country his
120 yesterday

1366
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,300
up

1367
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:14,340
mascot checked I ever sign ago I
solutions have been there now on the

1368
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,330
third jury duty

1369
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:19,240
and someone don't see an end to it they
think they'll be back there for their

1370
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,330
fifth sixth and seventh was a duty
before the sands

1371
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:26,870
we don't have enough troops how could we
protect against a possible conflict in

1372
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:27,590
Pyongyang

1373
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:33,130
a possible conflict with Iran other
potentialities in the world what we've

1374
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:34,860
got everything tied up

1375
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:38,330
with regard to Iraq and Afghanistan Iran
is

1376
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:42,90
Ardley given %ah

1377
01:31:42,90 --> 01:31:45,280
how much we dislike the Iranian regime

1378
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,509
the single greatest beneficiary the war
in Iraq

1379
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:54,450
we eliminated their historic enemy for
them and put them on top

1380
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,559
and no Persian Gulf I mean when you have

1381
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,200
massive civil war violent nasty civil
war on top with twenty percent the world

1382
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,450
oil supply that will probably engulf
other regional players Iran Saudi Arabia

1383
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:10,139
Jordan and Syria maybe even Egypt iraq

1384
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,200
disintegrates and becomes an arena of

1385
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,750
single much we could become like the
kingdom

1386
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:20,510
I'm its wearer terrorists all over the
world would find

1387
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:23,570
refuge iraq goes back to some sort of

1388
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:27,139
Islamic fascist regime like we had in

1389
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,310
under the Taliban in Afghanistan

1390
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:32,840
and we're back to September the town
2001 acceptance

1391
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,140
much larger scale and

1392
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:40,890
to let the dogs in all mine in their
disposal when we were first starting

1393
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:45,60
the reconstruction way you would serve
joked that they were five hundred ways

1394
01:32:45,60 --> 01:32:46,200
to do it wrong

1395
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,540
territory ways to do it right what we in
understands that we were

1396
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:54,50
can go through all five hundred what do
you think all those mistakes for me

1397
01:32:54,50 --> 01:33:02,850
I don't know I have no idea puzzling
president bush

1398
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:06,980
was missing in action on the planning
for the post-war

1399
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:10,879
he deferred to his vice president and
the secretary of defense

1400
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,680
the control over those decisions why on
earth

1401
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,70
if you were present in the United States
would you plan to use military force and

1402
01:33:18,70 --> 01:33:20,400
then divorce yourself from essentially
the

1403
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:25,960
most important aspect love that use and
that is the aftermath who is in charge

1404
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:26,740
this war

1405
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:29,360
I don't wanna go through all this time
it was he was the president the

1406
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,259
vice-president secretary defence

1407
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:35,490
those around around all those people do
you include national security adviser

1408
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:38,690
for the vice president you include now

1409
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:42,40
that was the dinner team that produced

1410
01:33:42,40 --> 01:33:46,300
the thinking behind the war my mistake
was probably not find a way to get

1411
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,300
myself more involved in the planning
process

1412
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:53,740
this so that the dissolution the army
would have been a surprise visit

1413
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:57,750
well I'm accuray still about my day in
court I'm a loss but that money

1414
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:02,10
system ought to be participatory

1415
01:34:02,10 --> 01:34:05,610
and ought to include people are going to
say this

1416
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,469
this makes no sense mister president

1417
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:11,800
this is a bad idea I don't think that
kind of decision making process

1418
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,620
existed him the Bush administration hi
sorry didn't feel my soft participating

1419
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:21,650
in such a decision making price the
administration never asked for any

1420
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:25,330
estimator community assessment Iraq
before we went to war

1421
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:28,769
nobody seem to be interested in

1422
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,890
with community had to say I think it's
more a matter that mines were made up

1423
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:32,470
the time

1424
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:35,650
the course was set whatever

1425
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:39,129
analysis on these sorts of issues was
too

1426
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:43,380
and the decision-makers felt they had
already done it themselves

1427
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:47,650
Vice President Cheney of course is made
takes me the same positions at Secretary

1428
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,960
Rumsfeld it on the war

1429
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,280
does he still have your complete
competency don't expect him to stay

1430
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:56,40
campaign is over yes he does and he'll
be here for the remaining see well

1431
01:34:56,40 --> 01:35:00,100
there are nights when I don't sleep very
well

1432
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:03,860
that I for myself for not pushing the
issue

1433
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:07,99
and I think I shoulda gone kicked his
door and into

1434
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:12,340
damnit listen this was a mistake we need
to do something to rectify it

1435
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:16,000
but I never had the opportunity to do it

1436
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,360
and trying to kick in the door you know
with ambassador whose

1437
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:24,630
essentially the you know those are above
iraq

1438
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:28,710
you know for colonel to try and do it
just wasn't going to happen you couldn't

1439
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:30,140
get past the front door

1440
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,370
if my speaking out heads even in them
infinitesimally

1441
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:38,30
to the criticism that counts

1442
01:35:38,30 --> 01:35:43,139
this administration then that's good I
don't pretend to say that I'm

1443
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:47,590
have been effective in that regard but I
i just can't hold my peace any longer

1444
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:50,740
we will bring to the iraqi people food

1445
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:56,269
and medicines and supplies

1446
01:35:56,270 --> 01:36:02,310
and freedom

1447
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:07,530
and

1448
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:11,99
would be

1449
01:36:11,99 --> 01:36:13,150

smell it

1483
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:43,40
