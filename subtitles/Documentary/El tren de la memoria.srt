1
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,600
Father, I want..

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,760
...to confess.

3
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,760
What have you done?

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,240
Nothing, father.
I haven't sinned,...

5
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,880
...but I intend to commit
all the evil I can.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,280
What?

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
-Why?
-Because it's necessary.

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,640
I've discovered it.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,040
I've deciphered the code.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,560
Listen to me.

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm speaking as a friend.
Why do you keep at it?

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,960
We've been trying for years.

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,680
We both know it is...

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,840
...impossible.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,680
You'll only harm yourself.

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,080
Now, will you listen to me?

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Have you told anyone else?

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,280
-Will you help me?
-Yes.

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
We don't have much time.

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,400
Remember one thing.

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,680
Our enemy is powerful.
He will do away with us...

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
...if he gets the chance.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,240
He may have heard
this conversation.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Holy God!

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,200
Father...

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Can we bear this cross?

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,720
Yes.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,880
If we stay united,
we'll manage it.

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,040
With God's help.

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,120
EUROPE'S GATEWAY

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,040
Give me a few coins, father.
It's for the child.

33
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
I hope you rot in Hell!

34
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,640
...by the Poiice.

38
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880

...with the siogan
"Ciean up Madrid",...

if you want to know what
your future wiii be, caii me.

42
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
Taxi! Taxi!

43
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Happy are the merciful,...

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,240
...for they shall have mercy
shown them.

45

Happy are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

46
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,560
Happy are the peacemakers,
for they shall see God.

THE FUTURE iS iN YOUR HANDS.
New Athenaeum Lecture Haii

48
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,920
-Why did you give me this?
-To read it, of course.

49
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,040
Who sent you?

50
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
The agency.

51
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,160
Give me a break.
Throw it away, if you want.

52
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
-Let me do my job.
-You know who I am, don't you?

53
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
What is this?

54
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,960
Is it "Candid Camera"?

55
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,320
I'm in no mood for cameras.

56
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,600
-I want to be one of you.
-You want to hand out leaflets?

57
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,440
I want to see the Devil.

58
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't give a fuck
what you want to see!

59
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,240
Go away,
you're scaring people!

60
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,280
I always get stuck
with the crazies!

61
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Fuck it, anyway!

62
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,920
What is this?

63
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,360
You want to pay for one
and take four?

64
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
Don't fucking come back!

65
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,920
Shit! Another glass case.

66
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,680
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

67
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm looking for this.

68
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,240
Heavy stuff.

69
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,200
Look in that drawer.

70
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,720
-You're a priest, right?
-Yes.

71
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
In that gear...

72
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Well, I'm really
a theology professor.

73
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
That's Catechism, isn't it?
I studied Ethics, you know.

74
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
And look where I ended up!

75
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,200
May I hear this one?

76
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,920
Heavy, right?

77
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,800
It isn't bad.

78
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,960
-Can you play it backwards?
-Yeah, sure.

79
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,680
It'll sound the same,
but it fucks up the turntable.

80
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,800
No, no, no, it isn't that.

81
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,840
What are you looking for?

82
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm looking for a message,
a signal.

83
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,600
Listen to this.

84
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,280
They're not famous
but they're good.

85
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
The words are real sharp.

86
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
Lots of message.

87
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,240
And they're local guys.

88
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
It's a different sound.

89
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,040
Well, it's a demo.

90
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,000
Wait till they make a record.

91
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,640
Here, take it.

92
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,120
I won't pay.

93
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
No problem.

94
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Really?

95
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,600
On the house.
I like your taste.

96
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
A pleasure meeting you.

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,960
Going on a trip?

98
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
-Actually, I've just arrived.
-Tomorrow, you can...

99
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,400
...see them in Hell.

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
Where?

101
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,240
In Hell. It's a music venue.
Great name.

102
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,120
Impossible to forget.

103
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760
But tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
I doubt if I can go.

104
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
If you need a hostel,
I know one.

105
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
I'll write down the name.
My old lady runs it.

106
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
A nice friendly atmosphere.

107
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,840
Here, call round.

108
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
Thank you.

109
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,800
So long.

110
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
SATANNiCA

111
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,040
García's Boarding House.

112
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
Good evening.

113
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,480
-Who is on the iine?
-This is Mari Carmen.

114
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,200
Where are you caiiing from?

115
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,360
-From Vaiiadoiid.
And what do you want to know?

116
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,240
My husband is unempioyed.
Wiii it take him very iong...

117
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,480
...to find work?

118
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Let's see, Mari Carmen.

119
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,600
Mari Carmen, your husband
isn't going to find work...

120
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,720
...for a iong period of time.
At ieast five years.

121
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,120
-But there's something eise.
-What?

122
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
A serious heaith probiem.

123
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,880
-For my husband?
-No, for you.

124
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,400
I'd like a room.

125
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,080
The only one left
is being done up.

126
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm not fussy.

127
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,760
I can't accept anyone
at this time.

128
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,680
The boy didn't tell me
about that.

129
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,480
What boy?

130
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
One who works in a record shop.

131
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Come in.

132
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,320
The room costs 3,000.
The bath tap doesn't work.

133
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,040
No visitors or pets allowed,
and I'll need some I.D.

134
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
Thank you.

135
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
The front door key.

136
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,280
And I'll always be here
to open this door.

137
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,520
Thank you.

138
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,440
Can you hear me?

139
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,200
Yes, yes.

140
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,480
i think you shouid
get ready for the worst.

141
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,440
-Are you staying a week?
-No, just tonight.

142
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,880
This is too much.

143
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,600
It doesn't matter.

144
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,120
This is the room. I told you
it was being done up.

145
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,800
It's perfect. Thank you.

146
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,840
-Need anything?
-No, not just now.

147
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,800
All right. Happy Christmas.

148
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,800
I've told you before.

149
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
You accept nobody at night!

150
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,000
-You open the door, that's all.
-lt was a priest.

151
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,880
Even if it was the Pope!

152
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,920
You can't trust anybody.

153
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,080
They pull a knife
and that's it.

154
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,160
The world is full of bastards!
The woman on the second floor...

155
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,320
...was robbed on the stairs
by a guy with a syringe.

156
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,920
She got off lightly.

157
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Look at what this street
is like at night time.

158
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,400
Full of whores, blacks,
drug addicts, killers.

159
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,560
It's disgusting!

160
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
You know what?

161
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,200
I wish that one of them
would come here.

162
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,360
First, I'd blow his balls off
with a shotgun!

163
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,680
For being a coward!

164
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,800
Then I'd break his bones.

165
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He'd be in a wheelchair
the rest of his life!

166
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,120
He'd know what suffering was!

167
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
He's really a priest?

168
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,640
He wore a soutane.

169
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,640
And so?

170
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,880
Look, your son sent him.
And this is Christmas Eve.

171
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
If he's a friend of my son,
that's even worse!

172
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
He paid 25,000 pesetas
for one night!

173
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,040
That's different.

174
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,040
He probably taught my son
at the Jesuits.

175
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,920
I don't know.

176
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,760
I still don't like
what you did.

177
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,080
-I'll speak to him.
-He seems very nice.

178
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,800
OCCULT SCiENCES

179
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
Demon Magic

180
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,600
"i can heip you achieve
the impossibie." Cavan.

181
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,920
You have to pay for the book.

182
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
What? What book?

183
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,520
Name?

184
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Angel.

185
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
-Angel what?
-Angel Berriartua.

186
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
-Are you a priest?
-Yes.

187
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
Priest. That's great.

188
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,320
"The Magic World
of Professor Cavan."

189
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,120
Aren't you a bit old
to be stealing books?

190
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,280
I need that book.

191
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
I need lots of things too,...

192
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,360
...but I work all day
to pay for them.

193
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
I can't buy it.

194
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,160
-You can't?
-No.

195
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,720
Why can't you?

196
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,480
You have no money?

197
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,120
-No, it isn't that.
-So what is it?

198
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
I must learn to do evil.

199
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,440
Why is that?

200
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,360
I have to contact Satan.

201
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,440
Satan?

202
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
That can't be easy.

203
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
No, that's why I need the book.

204
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm a theology professor.

205
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,360
I've studied the Apocalypse
of St. John for 25 years,...

206
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,160
...and I've discovered that
it is just a cryptogram.

207
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
-A kleptogram?
-No, a cryptogram.

208
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,560
It's a message in code.

209
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,880
A secret message
hidden behind the words.

210
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,120
-And you've discovered it?
-Exactly.

211
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Last week.

212
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,360
I based my work on a numerical
transcription of the Apocalypse.

213
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,240
At first, I used Tritheim's
Steganography. Have you read...

214
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,960
...Tritheim?

215
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
Tritheim? I think not.

216
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,240
Well, it's fundamental.

217
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,440
It inspired me to see
the Apocalypse...

218
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,320
...not as an allegory
but as an equation.

219
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
Each letter has its own number.
So, for example,...

220
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,120
...Daleth is worth four,
and Synn...

221
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,680
...is worth three hundred,
so we can...

222
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

223
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Could you come up
to the toy department?

224
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm busy now.
I'll come up later.

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,560
We can do this
with all the words and...

226
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,120
Father, does anyone else
know this?

227
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,600
Yes, of course.
But he died.

228
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
-Two days ago.
-I'm sorry.

229
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,120
Don't worry, I believe you.
We can sort everything out.

230
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,840
But what does the message say?

231
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,480
The message is a figure,
a date.

232
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,120
The date of the end
of the world.

233
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
Today, to be exact.

234
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,320
Yes, that is very important.

235
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,720
Just wait here for a moment,
please.

236
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,120
One second.

237
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,520
Check the asylums to see...

238
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
...if a priest has escaped.

239
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,240
And tell them to send someone.

240
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, father...

241
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,120
Mr. Cerezo!

242
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,720
Are you all right?

243
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,280
Mr. Cerezo!

244
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,360
Look, this is all burned.
Totally burned.

245
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,920
Hey, father!

246
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,640
-ls your room all right?
-Yes, it's fine.

247
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
I must talk to you,...

248
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,120
...Jose Maria.

249
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
If there's any problem,
I'll get them to change you.

250
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,840
Jose Maria...

251
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
Hot stuff. I've been trying
for a year to shag her.

252
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,720
-But it's no go.
-What?

253
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Shag her. Know what I mean?

254
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,400
It was no go. She's from
a village in Toledo.

255
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,160
I hear you're in the new room.
I'm Rosario, Jose Maria's mother.

256
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,560
A pleasure.

257
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,680
Will you have some rabbit?

258
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,320
No, I have to talk
to Jose Maria.

259
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
We've got lots.

260
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
He's working now,...

261
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,400
...in a record shop,
but he's really an artist.

262
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,560
Fuck off!

263
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,480
He's doing a drawing course
just now.

264
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
But as the shop won't
give him a contract...

265
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,760
Enjoy your meal.

266
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,800
I bet you that we'll have
rabbit again tonight.

267
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,640
She always buys
the fucking special offers!

268
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,600
May I ask you a favor?

269
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,880
Sure, anything.

270
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,280
Grandad!

271
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,640
This is my grandad.

272
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,720
He likes going around
the house starkers.

273
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,320
This is a friend,
Father...

274
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
Angel Berriartua.

275
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,720
I love him.

276
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,920
This is just...

277
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,080
...to jazz him up a bit,
because he's pretty old now.

278
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,640
Grandad...

279
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,400
That's it.

280
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,720
They say it's bad circulation.

281
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,480
The other day he said
he saw the Virgin.

282
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,840
He's too much.
Want some acid?

283
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,320
No, thank you.

284
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,960
If it weren't for me,
my fucking mother...

285
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,520
...would put him away.

286
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,840
Jose Maria, I have a mission.

287
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
Where? In Africa?

288
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,560
No, I have a mission
to carry out.

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,120
Something I have to do
here in the city.

290
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,400
-You're a Satannic follower?
-Yeah, sure.

291
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,680
Can you invoke the devil?

292
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,000
-I have to invoke the devil.
-Why?

293
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,160
Because of the Apocalypse.

294
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,560
-The film?
-No, no.

295
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,080
The book in the Bible.

296
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,000
Never mind.

297
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,160
Tonight, the Antichrist will be
born, but I don't know where.

298
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,960
-So I must invoke the Devil.
-Heavy!

299
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,560
I'm a sinner now.

300
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I've betrayed Christ
to make salvation possible.

301
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm one hell of a sinner too.

302
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,000
I must sell my soul to the devil
but I don't know how.

303
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I stole a book,
but it's no good.

304
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
It doesn't explain it
very well.

305
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,040
It's Cavan, from the TV!

306
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,160
My mother loves him.
He's a bastard.

307
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,840
There isn't much time.
Can we do anything?

308
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,680
Cool it, we'll manage it.

309
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,200
THE DARK ZONE

310
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,320
Here he is, the investigator
of the occuit,...

311
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
...the magician of mystery,...

312
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
...the master...

313
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,640
...of the supernaturai.

314
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,120
The man who knows
the present,...

315
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,440
...the past and the future.

316
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,520
The internationaiiy known
Professor...

317
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,680
...Cavan.

318
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,000
Tonight's program is going
to be very speciai.

319
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,600
We're not going to taik about
UFOs or miracie cures.

320
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,000
Nor wiii we be taking
your caiis.

321
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,960
Tonight we have with us
a guest who is...

322
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,120
...exceptionai.

323
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,120
Someone about whom

324
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,600
...but oniy a few reaiiy know.

325
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,840

326
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
Heavy!

327
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,520
How do you feei now it's over?

328
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,320
Great, thanks to you
and the Dark Zone team.

329
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,920
Juan Carios Cruz
is eieven years oid.

330
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,080
A month ago, Juan Carios
had a strange iiiness...

331
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,320
...which no doctor
couid diagnose.

332
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,040
Juan Carios behaved
as if he were someone eise.

333
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
As he said,
"Like i had a man inside".

334
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,840
The Dark Zone team got a caii
from his desperate parents,...

335
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,600
...unabie to find any reason
for their son's behavior.

336
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,040
Soon after, we went
to their home.

337
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,920
This is what happened.

338
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,560
it's you!
At iast, you're here!

339
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,640
-Where is he?
-in his room.

340
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
Take it easy, ma'am.

341
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Whatever happens in there,...

342
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,160
...remember it's for
your son's good.

343
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,840
Let's go!

344
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,120
This way!

345
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
What a fucking set-up!

346
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
Here! The boy is in here!

347
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,680
Hoid him down!

348
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,840
Quickiy!

349
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,360
Our Father, who art in...

350
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,080
That's the man I need.

351
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,680
That's for sure.

352
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,080
I have to talk to him.
Come on.

353
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Wait till the program's over.

354
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,560
i exorcise you
by the biood of Christ...

355
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,680
...and return you
to your iair!

356
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,280
Our Father,...

357
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,960
...who art in Heaven,...

358
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
...haiiowed be Thy name.

359
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,000
Thy kingdom come.

360
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
Juan Carios...

361
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,680
Juan Carios, how are you?
Are you aii right?

362
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,840
What happened?

363
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,120
Heavy!

364
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,840
That's him.

365
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Yes, that's Cavan,
the creep.

366
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,160
Let's go!

367
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,480
Last week's program
was real heavy.

368
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,360
-Hurry, we're losing him.
-Cool it.

369
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,400
I've got him.
It was about a chick...

370
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,840
...who was raped by aliens.
Did you see it?

371
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,640
If you'd seen her!
She looked like a real slut.

372
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
I bet you anything
she provoked them.

373
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't have a television.

374
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,720
You don't?
What do you do at night?

375
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,880
Pray.

376
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,240
Pray? But you must have seen
programs like...

377
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,000
..."Final Questions"
or "Sister Citroen".

378
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,160
No, that was the first
program I've ever seen.

379
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Fuck!

380
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,640
Stop! Stop!

381
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,400
He didn't indicate!

382
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,840
Ciean up Madrid

383
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
I'll leave the money here.

384
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,000
There he is!

385
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,800
Didn't you see
"Jesus Christ Superstar"?

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,320
It was fucking great.
"Hosanna, hey...

387
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,960
...sanna, sanna sanna hey,
sanna hey, sanna!"

388
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,840
Or the other one that went,
"Jesus Christ, Superstar!"

389
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,800
-Stop! He's parking!
-All right.

390
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,080
Here, father,
it'll bring you luck.

391
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Ennio! This is Susana!

392
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,680
i'm on my way over.
We can have dinner together.

393
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,320
But remember, tomorrow we're
taking my mother to iunch.

394
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
See you in a iittie whiie.
So iong. See you soon.

395
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,800
Good evening.
You must listen...

396
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,000
Who are you?

397
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,000
I am Angel Berriartua,
from the University...

398
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,320
Who gave you this address?
This is my home.

399
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,360
Yes. I'm from the University
of Deusto...

400
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,520
Please, call the program
for an appointment.

401
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Or write a letter.

402
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,120
But we can't talk now.
Good-bye.

403
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,680
But I've discovered
something incredible!

404
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
That's great,
but this isn't the time.

405
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,280
Call me tomorrow.
I'll deal with it personally.

406
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,440
No, it has to be tonight!

407
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Why can't it be tomorrow?

408
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,040
The Antichrist is coming!

409
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,120
All right, let's see.

410
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,440
Leave me your address.

411
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,320
I'll call you
tomorrow morning,...

412
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,960
...you come to the program
and we'll discuss...

413
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,840
...the Antichrist. All right?

414
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,360
Wait, I'll get my diary.

415
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,240
Now, your name was...?

416
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,000
My God! What have you done?
Are you crazy?

417
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
I'm just desperate.

418
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,600
Now you'll listen to me...

419
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,760
...carefully.

420
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,720
Have you read Tritheim?

421
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,520
Pope John Paui ii receives
Spanish theoiogians

422
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,280
Heavy, man!

423
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,040
-You can't park here. Move on.
-What?

424
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,720
-Move on.
-Am I in the way?

425
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,600
-You're badly parked.
-My pal's coming now.

426
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,680
-ls this your car?
-No, it's my mother's.

427
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,160
Your papers, please.

428
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,080
It's always
the same fucking story!

429
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
You see?

430
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,760
Metraton can even substitute
Shaddai. But unfortunately,...

431
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,920
...this system only works
with single words!

432
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,640
That's a shame.

433
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,680
There had to be something...

434
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,400
...that had confused thinkers
over the years. Isn't that so?

435
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,440
What? Yes, yes.
Please, continue.

436
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,760
Well, I found what it was!

437
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,040
All the Christian cabbalists
were trying to find a message.

438
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,520
A word behind the Apocalypse.

439
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,600
The Word of God.

440
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,400
They were wrong.

441
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,520
The message isn't a word.
It's a number.

442
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,960
A number!

443
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,840
The sum of the value
of all the words in the text.

444
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,160
Two million...

445
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,320
...one hundred and twenty six
thousand, four hundred and ten.

446
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,440
That number is a date.

447
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,680
2, 126, 410 days in the Jewish
calendar of the time.

448
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,840
Understand?

449
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,160
A date, a specific day
in the calendar!

450
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,360
Yes, a day.

451
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes. The Day of the Beast.

452
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,320
The Jews counted time...

453
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,640
...from the beginning
of the world,...

454
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,320
...which they dated 3,761 years
before the birth of Christ.

455
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,840
Given that they used
a lunar calendar,...

456
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,840
...and we use a solar one,...

457
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,880
...that is equivalent to
December 25, 1995.

458
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,320
You mean, tomorrow.

459
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,800
No! Tonight, before dawn.
What is the Apocalypse about?

460
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,640
I don't know,
I can't remember.

461
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,800
The beginning of the end
of the world.

462
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,640
If we don't prevent it,...

463
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
...the Antichrist
will be born tonight.

464
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,840
But I need your help.

465
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
You must help me
contact the Devil.

466
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,840
What?

467
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,360
I know the date,
but not the place!

468
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
Where will it be?

469
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,480
I don't know.
I haven't the slightest idea.

470
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,160
To find out,
I have to join them.

471
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,400
I must sell my soul
to the Devil.

472
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,720
I'll be at the ceremony tonight
and I'll kill him there.

473
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,240
I'll kill the Antichrist,...

474
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,400
...and the world may be saved.

475
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,280
That's why I need to contact
the Devil, and you can do it.

476
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,640
But this is all...
This can't be happening!

477
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,560
Will you be much longer?

478
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm badly parked again
and we'll have to move soon.

479
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,960
You're the TV guy?

480
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,040
-A pleasure.
-Who is this?

481
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,760
I'm Jose Mari.

482
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,240
Neat place!

483
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,720
These masks are plastic,
aren't they?

484
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,080
If you want to rob the house,
go ahead,...

485
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
...but there's no money.

486
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,080
How can I make you believe me?

487
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,720
All right. If you want me
to believe you, I do.

488
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,680
But why is it going to be here?
It could be somewhere else!

489
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,840
No! It will be here,
in Madrid!

490
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
You don't believe me.
There are hundreds of signs!

491
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,840
Look.

492
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,360
Newly born babies are
disappearing. Just look!

493
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,680
Fifty cases!

494
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,000
Desecrated graves.

495
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,080
100 cases here in Madrid
in just one year!

496
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,600
Is that not enough?

497
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,640
It just proves you're crazy!

498
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,800
And if it is true,
how will you fool the Devil?

499
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Will you turn up
like it's a wedding?

500
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,560
No, it won't be
like a wedding.

501
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,160
There won't be thousands
adoring him. Nothing like that!

502
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,920
-Oh, no?
-No!

503
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,640
Damn!

504
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,120
The Devil tries to imitate God
in order mock him.

505
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,840
The birth of his son will
imitate the birth of Jesus.

506
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,240
Like a secret,
but visible to all,...

507
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
...as in Bethlehem.

508
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,520
Will the Wise Men be there too?

509
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,520
-We'll be the Wise Men.
-Us? Fucking great!

510
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,480
And is that asshole
going as the pageboy?

511
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
I don't like...

512
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,360
...your attitude.

513
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,840
Listen carefully. I am
sacrificing eternal life...

514
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
...to fool the Devil...

515
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,720
...and to kill the Antichrist!

516
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,960
Great! Kidnapped by a saint!

517
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,480
Quite the opposite.

518
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,120
I'll take every chance
to commit evil.

519
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,160
The Devil will trust me.

520
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,320
The first thing...

521
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,440
...is to draw...

522
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,680
...the pentacle.

523
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
It's in the middle pages.

524
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,800
A circle with symbols.

525
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,720
You must draw it on the floor,
and then we stand inside it.

526
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,760
-So the Devil can't pass it.
-That's right.

527
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,280
What else?

528
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,400
Be patient! There are
lots of things to remember!

529
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,440
Calm down.
You know what's vital.

530
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,840
A sword.

531
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,560
A sacred sword, or a large knife.
It's like a magic wand.

532
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,720
There'll be one in the kitchen.

533
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,240
What else?

534
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,840
An Amanita muscaria.

535
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,240
A mushroom? What for?
Are you trying to fool me?

536
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,320
No, mushrooms are psychotropics.
You know, like drugs.

537
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,280
Yeah, I've tried those.
It's like a kind of acid,...

538
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,440
...like LSD.

539
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,880
I have some here.

540
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,920
It isn't for me, father.

541
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,640
Some pals of mine
are having a party.

542
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,440
Got the lucky gloves?

543
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,960
Yeah, this is it.

544
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,880
Will it do?

545
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,000
This is absurd!

546
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,160
Don't you see that this is
just a farce for assholes?

547
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,240
Assholes who watch my program
and buy my book!

548
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,960
-That's the truth!
-Are we back to that?

549
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,120
You think that I enjoy this?

550
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,840
That I like using violence?

551
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,240
I have no other choice.
It's the only solution.

552
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,080
You should collaborate.

553
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,560
We need...

554
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,240
...a goblet,
with four consecrated hosts,...

555
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,720
...anointed with
a maiden's blood.

556
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,240
Got any maiden's blood?

557
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,560
-That isn't in the book.
-I know.

558
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,320
Not everything is.
That's why you need me.

559
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Look, without the maiden's
blood,...

560
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,680
...the invocation
will be of no use!

561
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,000
I think it's time
to forget it!

562
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Excuse me.

563
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,640
I've made a mistake.

564
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,800
Susana! Run!

565
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,520
Get away! He's crazy!

566
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,160
Darling!

567
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,120
What are you doing?

568
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,680
What happened?

569
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,240
-She fell down the stairs.
-My God!

570
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,400
It should have been deliberate
but it was an accident.

571
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,360
Christ! What a dame, father!
How did you do it?

572
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,760
I could only find
sliced bread...

573
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
...but I cut some
of the symbols on it.

574
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,640
Good, thank you.

575
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,840
You do the pentacle.
To what?

576
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,880
-You said we needed some blood.
-Wait a minute!

577
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Now what is it?

578
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,240
-She's no use.
-Why is she no use?

579
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,000
She's no use.
She isn't a maiden.

580
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,520
She isn't a virgin.
Her blood is no use.

581
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,240
Sure she isn't a virgin?

582
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,000
Absolutely. I swear it.

583
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,640
And you need a virgin's blood.

584
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
Otherwise, it's no good,
I told you.

585
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,960
You're right.

586
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,560
Jose Maria, finish the pentacle.
I'll be out for an hour.

587
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,640
-Where are you going?
-To find some blood.

588
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,520
You think you can find
a virgin in one hour?

589
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,960
Yes.

590
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,680
With God's help.

591
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,760
"Christmas Eve is coming,
Christmas Eve is going.

592
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,440
We are going too
and we won't be back again."

593
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
You're soaked!

594
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,400
It's raining.

595
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,000
-Will I fix you something hot?
-No, no, no.

596
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,840
Well, yes. A coffee.

597
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,640
"The Virgin is combing
her hair,...

598
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,960
...in amongst the veils..."

599
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,920
-Are you alone?
-No way!

600
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,480
Madam is asleep,
nothing will waken her.

601
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,720
So I have to prepare
everything.

602
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,480
-ls there a celebration?
-Christmas Eve.

603
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,840
Of course, Christmas Eve!
What was I thinking of?

604
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,280
-Won't you have something?
-No, I won't.

605
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,800
You could have some tea,
or camomile.

606
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,480
I just had some, and anyway,
I have to fix the salad.

607
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,720
I won't insist
if that's how it is.

608
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,720
All right then, I will.

609
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,680
Are you staying for dinner?
We have some lovely rabbit.

610
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Rabbit? That's nice!

611
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,680
But I can't, I'm in a hurry.
I have to go out again.

612
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,640
-May I ask you a question?
-What is it?

613
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,520
Are you a virgin?

614
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,320
-What?
-Are you a virgin?

615
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,280
Don't worry, I'm a priest.

616
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,080
I'm asking like I was
your father or mother.

617
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,160
No, no, I don't mind.
It's just that...

618
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,400
...I wasn't expecting it.

619
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
You took me by surprise.

620
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,760
-You don't have to answer.
-I don't mind!

621
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,360
-Mmm...
-What?

622
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,520
Yes, I am.

623
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,240
Until I get married,...

624
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,120
...nothing doing.

625
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,080
That's very good, child.

626
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,400
Was Madam behind this?

627
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,440
-lf she thinks her son and I...
-No, I just wondered.

628
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,360
He's never touched me!

629
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560
He's a drug addict,
he's a pig, and he's fat!

630
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,480
I don't know what to do.

631
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,720
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He won't bother you again.

632
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,560
-Really?
-Yes. I'm here to help others.

633
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,760
Have your coffee.

634
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,320
-I don't feel like it.
-Have it at once!

635
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm a bit edgy.

636
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,800
I get edgy and...

637
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,360
-I'm very edgy, that's all.
-I can see that. What's wrong?

638
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,360
-lt's very serious.
-What is?

639
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,560
I can't explain it all now,
there isn't time.

640
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,600
-I need your blood.
-What?

641
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,640
Not all of it.
Just a little bottle.

642
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,840
Why do you want my blood?
For a transfusion?

643
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,160
No, for an invocation.
I have to invoke the devil.

644
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,720
This will sound odd,...

645
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,320
...but we had a girl
who wasn't a virgin,...

646
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,240
...and as it seems
we must have a virgin...

647
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,760
...I thought of you.

648
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,600
No, I don't want to.
I don't like the idea, really.

649
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,560
Look, you needn't worry.

650
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,760
It's a real emergency.

651
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,200
Keep away!

652
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,400
Now, don't be like that.
It'll only take a moment.

653
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,760
Look, we can do it with this
and no one will ever know.

654
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,920
-I'll stick this in you!
-Look...

655
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,480
Mina!

656
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,960
Mina!

657
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,040
Where are you?

658
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,000
Mina! That girl!

659
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,960
Yes?

660
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,240
-is Tere there?
-What?

661
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,680
-is that the whore house?
-No, it isn't.

662
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,160
You've made a mistake.

663
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,800
You want the house opposite.

664
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,320
The whores are over there!
People come here to sleep!

665
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,760
I'll call the police.

666
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,480
Mina! Where are you?

667
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,400
Mina! Are you asleep?

668
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,480
Where the hell are you?

669
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,360
Mina! Is that you?

670
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,280
No, it's me.

671
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,440
Excuse me, father.

672
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,360
I can't find Mina.

673
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,160
Do you know where she is?

674
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,640
I've been in here for ages,
I've seen nothing.

675
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,440
Are you ill?

676
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,480
No, I'm perfectly well,
thank you.

677
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,440
Why is the light off?

678
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,880
The light!

679
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,600
That's much better.

680
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,960
Don't worry about me.

681
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,400
It was the rabbit...

682
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,640
-Police?
-This is poiice headquarters.

683
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,400
-There's a murderer in my house.
-Name, address and i.D. number?

684
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,680
What? What did you say?

685
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,760
Give me your name,
address and i.D. number.

686
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,080
Heiio? Heiio?

687
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,160
Murderer!

688
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,320
What are you doing?

689
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,160
You don't have to fuck up
the floor!

690
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,440
The book says you must do it
with the magic knife.

691
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,800
I put that in
for the sake of it.

692
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,960
Fuck you!
You shouldn't have put it!

693
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,760
All you TV people
are real fuckers!

694
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,280
You're always
laughing at people!

695
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,880
-You're in real trouble.
-Who, me?

696
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,280
Yes, you.

697
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,000
Why?

698
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,560
This is a kidnapping,
and that woman...

699
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,720
...may be dead.

700
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
You could go down
for a few years.

701
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,960
You're aiding a psychopath,
a dangerous madman!

702
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,400
Who knows what
he's up to now?

703
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,720
All I'm doing
is drawing something.

704
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,320
But you're helping him.
You're helping...

705
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,480
...a murderer.

706
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,240
Listen to me!

707
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,920
Can you hear me?
Untie me!

708
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,520
Lunatic!

709
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,920
Do you want money?

710
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,600
-Say something!
-That'll be the cops again.

711
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,440
Damn the bastard!

712
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,400
Fuck it!

713
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,800
That fucking tow truck!
For Chrissake!

714
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,160
-What's up?
-I'm sorry.

715
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,920
-Where's my car?
-We waited for ages.

716
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,000
Then we called the tow truck.

717
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,680
Some friends are expecting us
at a party and...

718
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,400
Susana!

719
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,120
What's going on?

720
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,520
Untie me! Hurry!

721
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,800
He's coming back!

722
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,720
-What happened?
-Untie me! Get the knife!

723
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,560
Hurry!

724
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,520
Are you in trouble?

725
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Come on, hurry up!

726
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,880
-What are you doing?
-Calling the police!

727
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,480
There's no time.
Get the fucking knife!

728
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,560
Sorry!

729
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,960
Good evening!

730
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,120
Now, don't panic!

731
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,640
Careful!

732
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,080
He's coming! Hurry up!

733
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,480
Forget about that! Hide!

734
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,160
She's gone.
She went to call the police!

735
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,720
Get out, Susana!

736
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,680
Run, Susana!

737
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,560
I brought this.

738
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,320
Will it help?

739
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,320
A tape? What's it for?

740
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,760
You know, demonic music.

741
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Heavy? You want to play heavy?

742
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,440
It's Death Metal.
It isn't the same.

743
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,920
Sattanica. They're very good.

744
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,440
-Right.
-lt's a form of invocation.

745
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Some have to be played
backwards.

746
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,720
Look, do whatever you want.
Listen to it backwards.

747
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,720
Play heavy if you want,
but I'd rather you didn't.

748
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
You're the expert.

749
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,040
Thank you.
Is everything ready?

750
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,520
Knife, bread, LSD,
immaculate blood.

751
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,800
In under an hour!

752
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,920
Let's get started, please.
And in silence.

753
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,560
Read this.

754
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Out loud.
It's your pact with the Devil.

755
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,640
"My lord and master Satan,...

756
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,880
...I recognize you as my God
and promise to serve you.

757
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,080
I now renounce Jesus Christ.

758
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,040
I promise to adore you
every day,...

759
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,160
...to do all the evil
I can,...

760
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,160
...and to draw as many
as I can to do evil.

761
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,640
I surrender to you my body,
my soul and my life,....

762
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,800
...dedicated to you
for ever,...

763
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,120
...with no intention
of repentance."

764
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,920
That's it.

765
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,600
-Now, sign it with your blood.
-Heavy!

766
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,320
And now?

767
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,480
Burn it.

768
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,480
Now what?

769
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,960
Nothing. That's all.

770
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,720
What did you expect?
Are you convinced?

771
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,640
-Nothing's happening.
-Of course not.

772
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,720
This is just messing around.

773
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,960
I told you. The Devil!

774
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,040
It's incredible!

775
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,200
Be quiet!

776
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,840
Will we try the music?

777
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,400
No, we won't.
We're going to wait.

778
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,160
Christ!

779
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,440
You see? It was scared off!

780
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,160
It couldn't cross
the pentacle!

781
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,160
My God!

782
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,960
Have they gone?
What happened?

783
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,800
Nothing, it's all right.

784
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,000
-lt's better if you go home.
-What? And leave you here?

785
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,480
Go home
and I'll call you later.

786
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,560
They aimost kiiied us,
and you want to stay here!

787
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,520
What's wrong with you?

788
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,440
I'm perfectly all right.
Nothing happened.

789
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,480
Now, come on. Let's go.

790
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,720
Don't worry,
I'll call you tomorrow.

791
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,200
Nothing's wrong.
We'll talk tomorrow.

792
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,600
There are hundreds
of combinations.

793
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,600
Thousands of millions.
There are 15 letters.

794
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,160
A permutation of 15 elements
with three repeated twice,...

795
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,880
...and two, three times,
giving us a total of...

796
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,400
...4,540,536,000 possibilities.

797
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,080
My head's spinning. I think
none of them makes sense.

798
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,040
-Almost none.
-We use all the letters?

799
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,800
-Yes.
-That's it.

800
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,280
This is not a game.

801
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,440
Holy God!

802
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,200
Don't answer.

803
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,680
It might be Susana.

804
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,200
It isn't Susana.

805
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,080
I can't help it!

806
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,840
-ls there another way out?
-No.

807
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,560
We must get out of here!

808
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,840
Come on!

809
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,440
Follow me!
Don't just sit there!

810
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,000
Come on! Hurry!

811
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,000
-lt's him. He's come for us!
-The window!

812
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,040
This way.

813
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,280
We're going to die!

814
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,800
-Stop laughing!
-This is very high!

815
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,840
Don't push. We have
to hold on to the bars.

816
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,680
-Hurry!
-Don't push me! I'll fall!

817
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,080
Don't look down!

818
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,840
Be careful!

819
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,440
Be careful!

820
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,520
Take it slowly.

821
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,280
We're at the top.

822
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,080
Only six more letters!

823
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,280
-Just as well!
-Wait for me!

824
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,320
Cool it, father.

825
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,640
We'll wait for you.

826
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,040
Don't crowd me!

827
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,400
What are you doing?

828
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,760
-Be careful!
-Cool it, man.

829
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,760
Fuck, this is high!

830
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,640
Look up here, folks!

831
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,600
Be careful, you fool!

832
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,440
I can't stop!

833
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,960
I can't stop!
We're so high up!

834
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,440
-Don't look down!
-Look!

835
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,440
Shut up!

836
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,960
You'll knock us off!

837
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,680
Hey, cool it, man.

838
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,040
Going down!

839
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,520
I'm going to kill myself!

840
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,840
Fucking great!

841
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Let go of me!

842
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,520
-Let go!
-Climb up!

843
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,360
Now, be careful. We're going
to move down bit by bit.

844
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,560
-He isn't thinking straight.
-Am I not?

845
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,200
What if I jump off right now?

846
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,840
Stop talking rubbish!

847
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,800
We'll all be fucked!

848
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,840
We're going down!
We're going down!

849
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,080
Look, father!
Look, I'm flying!

850
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,400
Like the angels!

851
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,040
My God!

852
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,960
Don't let go of me!

853
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,360
Don't let go of me!

854
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,680
Santa Claus!

855
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,640
Santa Claus is in the house!

856
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,640
Mom! Dad! Come here!

857
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,760
Santa Claus has come in
through the window!

858
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,160
Are you ready, love?

859
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,280
Let's see Santa Claus.

860
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,600
-Happy Christmas.
-Good-bye.

861
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,320
And so ended
the attempted kidnapping...

862
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,560
...of Ennio Lombardi,...

863
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,800
...better known as
Professor Cavan...

864
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,760
...from "The Dark Zone"...

865
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,000
...shown on this station.

866
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,280
The motive for the kidnapping
is unknown,...

867
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,520
...and those responsibie,
as yet unidentified,...

868
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,160
i've just heard the news!

869
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,560
i rang the hospitai
but you'd gone!

870
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,360
How are you?
Wiii i get you a chair?

871
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,440
-Do they know where they are?
-We have no idea!

872
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,600
Just as weii.

873
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,440
You shouid be in hospitai.
How are you?

874
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,280
Leave me be! i want to taik
to the TV guy!

875
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,360
-Why?
-We're on in two hours.

876
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,680
-What?
-A speciai program.

877
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,520
And we stop
the Christmas programs?

878
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,440
i think you must be in shock!

879
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,720
That is absoiuteiy impossibie!

880
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,200
What you asked for...

881
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,680
This? This is garbage! Shit!

882
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,040
it's aii they couid find
in Madrid!

883
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,680
There must be more!

884
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,200
Have you checked
the program on sects?

885
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,200
That's true!
What about the sects?

886
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,240
Very well.

887
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,200
If that's all there is,
you're fired.

888
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,520
It would be easier if we knew
what we were looking for.

889
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,240
Don't you fucking listen?

890
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,840
I told you!

891
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,560
A place, a fucking site!

892
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,040
I don't know.

893
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,000
A building, a square, gardens.

894
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,080
The place where Satanists meet
here in Madrid!

895
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,040
But don't bring me another boy
possessed by the Devil!

896
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,600
But we only had an hour.
We didn't even have any dinner.

897
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,360
We need time.

898
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,240
If I don't get it by tonight,
you can shove your dinner!

899
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,840
Ennio, wait!

900
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,120
We can't wait.

901
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,920
-Calm down!
-We can't wait!

902
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,880
Mr. Cavan, your autograph?

903
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,960
Is someone going to clean this,
or do you expect me to do it?

904
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,880
Ennio! Ennio!

905
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,280
Mr. Cavan...

906
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,280
Can you leave that for later?
We're trying to work.

907
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,360
-How are you?
-What the fuck are you doing?

908
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,040
Excuse me, happy Christmas.

909
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,840
Can't you see we're busy?

910
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,120
I'm glad that you're better.
Will you sign your book for me?

911
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,600
My wife and kids
love your program.

912
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,760
This book is shit. A fraud.
Tell your wife and kids that.

913
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,440
-Fuck!
-What?

914
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,440
-I've lost my pen.
-Use this.

915
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,120
You're a genius!

916
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,880
We'ii siay them tonight!

917
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:32,040
Everyone eise has carois
and we have the Devii!

918
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,040
We'ii have to do a re-run.

919
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,240
-Your wife's name?
-Mari-Angeles.

920
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,160
Dump the program.

921
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:40,800
What?

922
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,440
Forget the program!

923
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,880
Are you crazy? Why have you
sent everyone to iook for...

924
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,560
...the Devii's tempie?

925
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,200
The Antichrist
will be born tonight.

926
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,120
What?

927
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,640
Shut up.
Here you are.

928
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,440
Thank you.

929
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,840
I got a fright when I saw you
on the News, climbing...

930
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,640
Why don't you fuck off?

931
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,040
Wait a minute! The book...

932
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,640
Thank you.

933
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,960
What is it, Cavan?
Aren't we paying you enough?

934
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,360
Do you want to be fired
and go to another channei?

935
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,160
Are you trying to annoy me
so we'ii throw you out?

936
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,880
You hurt my eye!

937
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,920
What are you iooking at?

938
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,120
in aii the time...

939
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,720
...we've worked together,
you've never iistened to me!

940
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,880
You know that?

941
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,640
Keep moving.

942
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,440
Keep moving, don't stop.
Keep moving.

943
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,400
We're stuck.
The cops are all over.

944
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,840
Time is running out.
It'll be dawn in a few hours.

945
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,440
We won't last five minutes
out there.

946
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,800
What will we do?

947
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,000
We must be very close by now.
If only there was a...

948
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,160
What? What do you want?

949
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,840
A sign. We need a sign.

950
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,920
Fuck!

951
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,160
NEW ATHENAEUM

952
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,040
Have science and technology
left it meaningless?

953
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,320
The answer is no.

954
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,040
The First World War,...

955
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,640
...Hitler's rise to power,...

956
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,640
...or Russia's conversion...

957
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,560
...are pure facts.

958
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,080
Proof of the clairvoyant power
of Michel de Nostradamus...

959
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,240
...the great futurologist,
scorned by science,...

960
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,320
...but praised by experts
who studied his work.

961
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,880
Those who discovered...

962
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,360
A neat place, father!

963
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,280
We can stay here
until it all cools down.

964
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,600
The most important thing
about Nostradamus was his...

965
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,160
Why didn't I realize?

966
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
It will be here!

967
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,680
...thus showing us
humanity's future.

968
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,120
-What is humanity's future?
-What are you doing?

969
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,120
Well, that is the subject
of this talk.

970
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,960
We shall try to analyze
the work of Nostradamus...

971
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,480
...from a perspective...

972
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,800
The Antichrist
will be born tonight.

973
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,960
Let's see.

974
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,040
As anyone who has studied
the subject knows,...

975
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,480
...Nostradamus never talks
about a specific date,...

976
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,840
...but about
the Third World War,...

977
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,680
..and when the Antipope...

978
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,680
Nostradamus has nothing to do
with all this.

979
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,000
-lf you have a question...
-Yes.

980
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,080
I have one.

981
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,440
Afterwards, please.

982
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,440
-lt'll be here, won't it?
-We'll be thrown out.

983
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,720
Why not admit it?

984
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,000
It's going to be here, I know.
Answer me.

985
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,560
After this talk
we'll have questions.

986
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,920
Don't try to fool me, too.

987
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,080
Listen, I am one of you.

988
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,200
You must believe I'm with you.
I sold my soul to the Evil One.

989
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,960
Will you please sit down?

990
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,320
Trust in me! Trust in me!

991
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,040
Just sit down!

992
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,160
Father, come on! Let's go!

993
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,320
I signed with my blood.

994
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,840
We're asking you politely.
Get out!

995
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,280
What's wrong?

996
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,840
-Why? What's wrong?
-Father, let's go!

997
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,720
Wait! Listen!

998
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,640
Wait! Listen!

999
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,040
Wait!

1000
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,480
What is this?

1001
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,640
Attention, children.

1002
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,600
On the junior floor
of our store...

1003
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,040
...you'll find all the toys
you requested for Christmas.

1004
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,440
And the Three Wise Men
are here...

1005
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,400
...to get your letters.
Happy Christmas!

1006
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,480
There he is!

1007
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,640
Excuse me, you can't...

1008
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,240
Stop, you bastard!
Get in, father!

1009
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,960
Hurry up! Start the car!
Get us out of here, fast!

1010
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,680
Where are we going?

1011
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,320
We're losing them.

1012
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,840
Where are we going?

1013
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,960
-We have to go back.
-How can we? It's full of cops.

1014
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,080
I must speak to him.
He can't have gone far.

1015
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,040
That speaker?
He's in Buenos Aires by now.

1016
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,080
What are you looking at?

1017
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,640
There he is! There he is!

1018
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,160
-Stop the car!
-What are you talking about?

1019
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,920
-Be careful!
-lt's him!

1020
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,080
Stop the car!

1021
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,960
Stop the car!

1022
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,960
Listen!

1023
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,080
Listen!

1024
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,800
Wait!

1025
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,400
Wait!

1026
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,840
Tell me where he'll be born!

1027
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,200
Where?

1028
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,640
What did I do? Let me go!

1029
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,480
Where will the birth be?

1030
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,720
Come on!
We haven't got all night!

1031
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,160
-What are you talking about?
-Come on!

1032
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,400
Will I kill him?

1033
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,120
But I...
I've never hurt anyone!

1034
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,960
All I do is give talks!
I swear, that's all!

1035
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,240
Leave me alone!

1036
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,480
Don't hurt me, for God's sake!
Please!

1037
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,000
He knows nothing.

1038
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,320
Will I let him go?

1039
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,800
Run, bastard!

1040
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,880
Nostradamus! Big mouth!

1041
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,640
And watch what you do!
I know your face!

1042
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,080
Asshole!

1043
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,480
Come on, get up!
We can't stay here!

1044
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,880
-I'm so tired.
-We have to get a car!

1045
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,440
-Why?
-So that we don't get caught!

1046
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,120
It's no use.
He's playing with us.

1047
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,920
Who?

1048
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,920
The Devil. Don't you realize?
He's laughing at us.

1049
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,920
Yeah, I guess,
but we still have to move.

1050
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,680
There's something
I haven't told you.

1051
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,320
Tell me another day. We...

1052
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,640
Your mother fell down
the stairs.

1053
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,680
-What?
-Well, really, I pushed her.

1054
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,080
She tried to kill me,
when I went for the blood.

1055
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,720
It was an accident.

1056
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,040
-So the blood we used...
-Mina's.

1057
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,760
-ls she dead too?
-I only gave her some pills.

1058
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,880
Heavy!

1059
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,720
-So Mina was a virgin?
-Yes.

1060
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,840
How do you know?

1061
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,400
She told me.

1062
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,800
Fuck the old lady, anyway.

1063
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,520
But what will happen...

1064
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,680
...to Grandad?

1065
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,400
Go and see him.

1066
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,760
Yeah, and leave you
alone here.

1067
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,080
-I can look after myself.
-Sure!

1068
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,480
Some chance!

1069
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,080
Look, you wait here
for five minutes,...

1070
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,720
...and I'll come back
with a car.

1071
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,280
AT LAST HEAVEN iS SENDiNG YOU
THE SiGNAL YOU WERE WAiTiNG FOR.

1072
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,240
Clean up Madrid

1073
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,920
-You're one of them.
-What?

1074
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,640
I know everything.

1075
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,200
It'll be here.
Today is the Day of the Beast.

1076
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,880
No, Satannica are on tonight.
You can check dates at the bar.

1077
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,240
Stop shooting up!

1078
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,800
That's enough!

1079
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,640
Christ!

1080
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,760
What did they do to you?

1081
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,080
Christ!

1082
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,880
Shit! The bastards!
I shouldn't have left you.

1083
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,080
Shit!

1084
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,040
Come on! Let's go!

1085
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,840
I said I'd be five minutes.

1086
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,400
Couldn't you have waited?

1087
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,080
Shit!

1088
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,080
Here.

1089
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,960
Now what?

1090
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,880
His name is Angel Berriartua.

1091
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,920
He is a theology professor
at the University of Deusto.

1092
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,360
-Hello?
-The Dark Zone.

1093
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,520
-Hello?
-Yes?

1094
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,080
Get me Professor Cavan.

1095
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,440
Tell him that the priest
is here with me.

1096
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,120
-What?
-He's right here.

1097
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,280
Who are you?

1098
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,880
Say I'm the one
who fucked up his floor.

1099
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,360
Wait a moment.

1100
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,400
-Yes? Hello?
-Cavan?

1101
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,600
Cavan! This is Jose Mari.
Wait a minute.

1102
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,520
Father! It's Cavan!
He's alive. He's on the TV.

1103
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,200
He wants to talk to you.
He's been looking for you.

1104
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,920
Come on, that's it.

1105
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,960
Just a bit more.

1106
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,360
Come on, take the phone.
Look, there he is.

1107
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,560
is that you?

1108
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,880
I can see you in the shop.

1109
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,720
-What are you doing?
-Trying to help.

1110
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,240
That's how you help?

1111
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,400
The best way to find you
was by using the program.

1112
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,560
Now, listen.

1113
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,840
i'm on to something.
Where are you?

1114
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,960
I don't know. In Hell.

1115
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,880
Please, listen to me!

1116
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,080
i'm with you.
We have to talk!

1117
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,200
i think i've found it.
You hear?

1118
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,040
-May I ask a favor?
-Whatever you want.

1119
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,560
Call the police.

1120
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,680
What?

1121
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,080
Tell them to come and get me.

1122
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,320
What is this?

1123
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,120
Do you think this is a trick?
That i'm in with the police?

1124
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,000
Yes, I suppose so.

1125
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,640
Listen to what
i'm going to say.

1126
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,160
This is a warning...

1127
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,600
...for the 10 million assholes
watching this fucking program!

1128
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,240
The end of the world
is tonight!

1129
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,640
You understand?
This very night!

1130
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,920
Christmas Eve is fucked!
Christmas is fucked!

1131
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,120
it's all fucked!

1132
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,480
While you are in your homes
happily watching the TV,...

1133
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,320
...outside on the streets,...

1134
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,920
...the Antichrist's reign
is beginning!

1135
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,000
i make my living
telling the future.

1136
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,680
So now you know.

1137
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,200
is that what you wanted?

1138
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,600
Are you listening?

1139
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,240
i've found the place
where he's going to be born!

1140
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,800
There is still time
before dawn.

1141
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,640
-I think I was mistaken.
-How? in the date?

1142
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,680
-in everything.
-How do you mean?

1143
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,560
This is madness.

1144
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,880
-Maybe poor circulation.
-What?

1145
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,160
Maybe I'm mad.

1146
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,920
The three of us saw
that thing in my house!

1147
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,560
You see what you want.

1148
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,400
i don't care if we're mad.

1149
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,560
Fuck! Can you hear me?

1150
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,560
Listen, i've found
the mark of the Devil!

1151
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,960
The mark of the Devil?

1152
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,240
He'll be cut off!

1153
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,040
Put in more money!

1154
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,280
I'm out of change.

1155
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,120
Tell me where you are!

1156
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,320
-Shit!
-We cut the transmission.

1157
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,640
You've screwed up the program!

1158
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,080
We interrupted everything
so you could find a madman!

1159
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,000
Then you go and lose him!

1160
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,640
You!

1161
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,480
-What did he say?
-What?

1162
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,360
-When I asked where he was?
-I don't know.

1163
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,400
-lf it isn't taped, you're dead!
-He said "I don't know" !

1164
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,680
What else?
After that, what else?

1165
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,240
I don't know. In Hell.

1166
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,560
What does it matter?
This is Hell!

1167
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,080
We have a minute
before we're back on.

1168
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,440
Sit here and calm down.
Say anything.

1169
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,280
Say it's the end of the world,
whatever you like, but say it!

1170
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,160
Don't destroy me, Cavan.
The whole country is watching!

1171
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,680
-I need a newspaper.
-What the fuck for?

1172
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,840
Music Venue: Hell

1173
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:05,880
Let's go!

1174
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,000
What's this?

1175
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,320
This is all you've got?

1176
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,640
-They're photocopies.
-And the signatures?

1177
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,720
Satan. So what?

1178
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,960
It's the document we used
in the invocation.

1179
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,320
Notice anything...

1180
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,000
...about the signature?

1181
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,840
-Marks.
-Right.

1182
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,600
Now look at the other
documents. You see?

1183
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,000
They're repeated.

1184
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:37,800
In all the signed pacts
kept since the 15th Century.

1185
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,960
The same mark.

1186
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,440
-I still don't understand.
-Fuck it!

1187
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,880
One hand made the signatures
through the centuries!

1188
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,160
That proves nothing.

1189
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,680
They were copied, that's all.

1190
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,880
All right.

1191
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,120
Jose Mari,
take the steering wheel!

1192
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,040
Keep on driving.

1193
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,880
All right,
they could be copies.

1194
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,520
Now, look at this.

1195
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,040
He's a boy we exorcised
on the program.

1196
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,880
The one we saw in the bar.

1197
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,440
Do you still not understand?
It's the mark...

1198
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,880
...of the Devil!
Did the boy copy it?

1199
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,520
Look at the wounds!

1200
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,320
It's the same sign!

1201
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,240
The Devil does it
to his people with a claw.

1202
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,720
His real signature.

1203
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,200
Let me see.

1204
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,280
Be careful!

1205
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,920
What are you doing?

1206
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,480
Stop the car!

1207
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,080
You still don't see!

1208
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,080
Listen.

1209
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,440
-What is the sign of Christ?
-Just forget it, please.

1210
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,400
Answer me!
What is the sign of Christ?

1211
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,160
-The cross.
-Exactly. The cross.

1212
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,040
The cross.

1213
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:03,080
-You're drawing it for me?
-And Christians...

1214
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,840
Where do they celebrate
Christ's birth?

1215
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,880
-ln a church.
-ln a church.

1216
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,720
In a church.

1217
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,240
And...

1218
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,360
...what is a church?

1219
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,760
Come on!

1220
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,640
Answer.

1221
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,480
What is a church?
A cross, fuck it!

1222
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,160
An enormous
three dimensional cross.

1223
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,480
A cross with doors
and windows.

1224
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,400
You still don't see?

1225
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,080
Look.

1226
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,480
This...

1227
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,480
...is the Devil's mark.

1228
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,280
Remember?
You said it yourself.

1229
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,760
The Devil always tries
to imitate Christ.

1230
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,760
He's the dark side of God!

1231
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,920
If God's temple is a cross,...

1232
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,840
...Satan's temple...

1233
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,520
...must be like this.

1234
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,640
Well, you have it right there.

1235
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,680
We've found it.

1236
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,480
You realize?

1237
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,720
A secret visible to all.

1238
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,600
Just like you said...

1239
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,520
-We must go down!
-What for?

1240
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,200
They'll come up after us!

1241
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,840
-But we mustn't fail now.
-Come on, you have to hide!

1242
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,280
Isn't he on the TV?

1243
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,920
He's the bastard
who tells the future.

1244
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,120
My wife loves him.

1245
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,680
Know what?

1246
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,800
I foresee things too.

1247
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,440
You doubt it?

1248
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,880
Listen to this.

1249
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,720
I see that very soon...

1250
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:45,720
...you're going to have
a health problem.

1251
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,120
Something permanent.

1252
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,640
But first, a carol.

1253
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,920
"On December 25,
boom, boom, boom!"

1254
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,520
Get away!

1255
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,200
Now, father! Quickly!

1256
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,240
Go on! Get going!

1257
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,880
-I think he's laughing.
-He's a joker.

1258
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,440
You think we're funny?

1259
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,600
This is not a game.

1260
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,440
Let's liven things up.

1261
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,000
Clean up Madrid

1262
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,000
Here he is, the investigator
of the occult.

1263
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,680
He knows the present,
past and future.

1264
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,280
The internationally known
Professor Cavan!

1265
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,440
Thank you.

1266
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,400
Today we begin a new era
in "The Dark Zone".

1267
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,640
After a nine month break,...

1268
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,440
...we have returned
to arise from the ashes.

1269
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,480
We will always remember
Ennio Lombardi,...

1270
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,880
...the former presenter,
a great professional,...

1271
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,040
...a great friend and
a brilliant communicator,...

1272
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,040
...who disappeared in such
dramatic circumstance.

1273
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,880
Wherever you are, my pubiic
sends you this applause.

1274
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,960
But let us now
turn to the future,...

1275
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,920
...in that mysterious world
we explore...

1276
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,720
...in "The Dark Zone".

1277
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,280
He's got no style.
He can't move.

1278
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,880
We'll lose our audience
with that idiot.

1279
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,160
What really fucks me about this
is that I can't tell anyone.

1280
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,320
About what?

1281
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:38,040
Fuck it! We saved the world
and nobody knows it!

1282
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,080
They wouldn't understand.
Forget it.

1283
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,520
A brilliant communicator!

1284
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,720
What rubbish!

1285
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,360
Come along.

1286
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:02,640
Lean on me.
