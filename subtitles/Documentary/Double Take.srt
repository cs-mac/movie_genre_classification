1
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,391
Where would I be without my baby

2
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,941
The thought alone might break me

3
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,521
And I don't wanna go crazy

4
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:05,115
- But every thug needs a lady
- Tired of being lonely

5
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,237
Come on

6
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,072
Don't you know that I love you

7
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,095
- Hey-Hey, good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Yes, it is.

8
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,891
Oh, I don't see your driver.

9
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,645
I gave him the day off.
It's his birthday.

10
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:33,018
- Knicks? Courtside?
- Yeah, baby.

11
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:36,356
- Mr. Chase, you are the man.
- Ah, just say hello to Spike for me.

12
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:39,111
Oh, I'll do the right thing.

13
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,860
What is this? Fifteen a grand a month,
I gotta listen to this racket?

14
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,402
- Oh, well. I'm out of here.
- You have a good day.

15
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,201
- Be careful out there, huh?
- Nothing can touch me today.

16
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,078
- Give me that, punk!
- Mr. Chase.

17
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,828
- Mr. Chase, you all right?
- Yeah.

18
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,962
Stop, thief!

19
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:08,089
- Come on, boy.
- You sure you're all right?

20
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,804
I'll slice your little ass up.

21
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:20,767
Now you need a nut doctor.
Get on before you get spit on.

22
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:26,284
Hold it! Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

23
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,696
- This what you do to the hero?
- You got the wrong guy!

24
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:33,361
- Do I look like Puffy?
- Shut up!

25
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:36,162
- You got the wrong guy!
- Hey, that is not the guy.

26
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,288
- What? What the hell you mean, it's not the guy?
- He got the briefcase back.

27
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,288
- That is not the guy.
- Are you sure?

28
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,925
- I'm positive.
- Now, you heard the man. Raise up off me!

29
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,679
- What?
- Just... Really.

30
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,471
I'm Muslim. I don't like
no parts of no pig!

31
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,772
- Look, you okay?
- Man, I hope I don't need no stitches.

32
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:02,310
I ain't got no insurance.

33
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,976
I'm really sorry about this.

34
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,445
And my mama got cancer.

35
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,582
- I said cancer.
- I think this will cover it.

36
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:17,536
Common cold is cool.

37
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,295
- Well, uh, take care of yourself.
- You be careful out here, man.

38
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,787
- I will. You get that looked at, all right?
- All right.

39
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:26,665
- Hey, you pigs know where the nearest emergency room is?
- Okay, okay.

40
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,611
Hey, you see
two guys come past here?

41
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:58,375
- What?
- Two guys. Big guy. Little guy. Came past here just a second ago.

42
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,919
- I saw no one. I don't know. I didn't see anybody.
- Shit!

43
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,921
- Good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Hey, Julie.

44
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:12,754
Good morning, Mr. Chase.

45
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,634
Are you all right?

46
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,561
What is it?

47
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,183
Look, I may have only been here
two months...

48
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:25,891
but I know you well enough
to know when something's wrong.

49
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,191
What gave me away,
wrinkled suit or bad attitude?

50
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,604
Definitely the attitude.

51
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,197
I'll work on it.
What you got for me?

52
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,954
The Henderson wire transfers
came in from Switzerland...

53
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,324
and financial. Com
just announced a split, and...

54
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,788
I think this will make
the rest of your day a little better.

55
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:45,285
The Don Carlos transfer
came through this morning.

56
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,001
- It's a little more than we expected.
- Don't tease me.

57
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:50,249
106 million more.

58
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,171
- Stop kidding.
- I never joke about money.

59
00:06:57,975 --> 00:07:00,847
Good morning, Daryl.
What's the matter with you?

60
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:05,266
Don Carlos came in.
106 million over.

61
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,394
- 106 six million. You sure about that?
- Yep.

62
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:11,155
That's a lot of money for a Mexican
soda company, don't you think?

63
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:14,239
I'll have to see about this. Oh!

64
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:18,109
I'm sorry. I know it's late. Can you
get us all into Chloe's show tonight?

65
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,537
- I'll pull a few strings. How many do you
need? - Well, our $ 106-million mystery man...

66
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,830
is coming into town:
Thomas Chela.

67
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,085
- Mr. Don Carlos himself. To what do we owe the pleasure?
- I don't know.

68
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,163
- We got to show him a good time.
- Oh, absolutely.

69
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:32,008
I can also check over his last quarter
financials to make sure everything tracks.

70
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:35,758
If you find anything,
I want to see it.

71
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's
somebody in your office, Mr. Chase.

72
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:43,804
- Not now, Shari.
- I think you should see him. He says it's a family matter.

73
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,980
Look, a broker is a smoker.
You ever heard of E-Trade?

74
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,308
Yeah, you can do
that shit for free.

75
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,447
I'm Freddy Tiffany, internationally
known, I might add. All right.

76
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,903
My nigga!

77
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:58,696
Hey, you got any job openings?
This is some easy-ass shit.

78
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:00,944
Oh, yeah. Let me call
Human Resources. Shari?

79
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,244
Hook a brother up.

80
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,701
Man, how'd a brother like you
get a big-ass office like this...

81
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:09,878
with fancy furniture
and whatnot...

82
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:13,083
without the benefit
of some kind of mischief.

83
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,460
You keep campaigning for this
ass-whooping, you gonna get elected.

84
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:21,215
Cool. Look. I was just jokin' about
the phone, man. Wasn't nobody on it.

85
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,262
And I feel kind of bad
about what happened earlier.

86
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:26,724
- What is that?
- It's your money.

87
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,396
Is that Chloe Kent?

88
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:39,364
Hey, that's that La Perla supermodel.
Man, I'd sure like to wax her drawers.

89
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,906
I'll let her know.

90
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:45,744
Hey, ain't no need for all this shit.
How's your mama? We went out.

91
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,074
- Hey, look, girl, what you need is a thug in your life.
- Come on.

92
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,208
You know damn well
you like danger, girl.

93
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:53,996
- You from the projects. You from the projects.
- I could kick his ass.

94
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:56,048
Dance to the beat
and shuffle my feet

95
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,507
Can you dance
Can you dance to the beat, beat, beat

96
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,321
- Charles. - Daryl, how
are you? - I'm good. You?

97
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,987
- Oh, good. Real good.
- Morgan, you look beautiful.

98
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,918
- Thank you. So good to see you.
- Great to see you.

99
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,790
- Thank you.
- You mind if I steal him for just one second?

100
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,550
- Only for a second.
- One. - Sorry.

101
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,124
Oh, now, this is a party.

102
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,298
- C.A.?
- Hmm?

103
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,596
Charles, we have a problem.

104
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:49,218
Don Carlos Cola does not exist.

105
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:51,850
Shari called eight different distributors,
and no one had ever heard of it.

106
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,430
- Oh, I like that girl.
- Hey, this is serious.

107
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:58,024
Northeast National has a fiduciary interest here, and
you know as well as I know, my name's on those documents.

108
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:00,568
- And I'm not going to jail.
- Slow down, Daryl.

109
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:04,441
We can't go charging in without hard evidence.
If it's there, we'll find it. We'll find it.

110
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:07,026
Look, I'm calling the S.E.C.
First thing in the morning.

111
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:10,326
We'll do it together, all right?
All right?

112
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,750
- All right.
- All right. Uh, there he is.

113
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,588
- Thomas! Thomas!
- Hey.

114
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:20,588
- May I introduce Daryl Chase?
- Oh, this is the man.

115
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:25,089
The one who has been working so hard
on building my future. Oh!

116
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:30,555
- This is my companion. Maque Sanchez.
- Ah!

117
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,814
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chase.

118
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,652
106 million.

119
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,733
Uh, some quarter you had.

120
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:52,363
- Some quarter.
- Well, why don't we all sit down?

121
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,497
Yes, why don't we?

122
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,661
I didn't realize that was so funny.

123
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,671
Mr. Chase, you have such
a beautiful accent.

124
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,750
Where did you learn
to speak Spanish?

125
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:06,339
Uh, if you could, um...
for one second.

126
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:09,004
Thomas. Tell me.

127
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,599
Did you reallocate additional working
capital towards a Don Carlos ad campaign?

128
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,356
Oh, I really like you.

129
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,940
I'm so glad
you are on our side.

130
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,109
So am I.

131
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:27,899
Tell me. When are you gonna
come visit us in Mexico?

132
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:35,116
You know, I got no plans
in the foreseeable future.

133
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,782
Oh, but you would have
so much fun.

134
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:45,041
Uh, Chloe! I, um... They
just invited us to Mexico, honey.

135
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,090
- Looks like a nigga got busted.
- Ooh, Superfly.

136
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:56,134
- And what is your name, beautiful thing?
- Oh! Maque.

137
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,179
I'm thinking about "macking" you too.
Get butt-naked and you're mine, girl.

138
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm telling you. I'm gonna get
a piece of that right there.

139
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:07,360
- What are you doing here?
- I'm enjoying myself. And how about you?

140
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,529
- Hey, why don't you enjoy yourself over there?
- Ha! Yeah.

141
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,124
It's obvious this rude nigga here don't
wanna introduce me to you "peoples. "

142
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,791
- So I figure I'll introduce myself.
- One second. I'm very sorry.

143
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,924
I am Freddy Tiffany,
internationally known, I might add.

144
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,084
How you doin', baby?
Look at you, girl.

145
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:31,008
I don't care. We could knock
the cobwebs off of it, me and you, girl.

146
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm telling ya.

147
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:36,428
What is up with your eye, G.?

148
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,138
Oh, I get it. That way you can scope
on her without pissing her off.

149
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,473
You know what you need
is some Visine and some Windex.

150
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:45,937
- Much money as you making, you could afford a better eye.
- Hey, what's up, Daryl?

151
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,900
- Everything cool?
- No, everything is not cool.

152
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:52,276
The little leprechaun pimp here, and
he is messing up our entire evening.

153
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,445
- Now, get rid of him.
- Who?

154
00:12:56,164 --> 00:12:58,157
Look at...

155
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:08,548
Hey!

156
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:21,264
I am so sorry.

157
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,108
- You wanna tell me what the problem is?
- Nothing, all right?

158
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,948
Daryl, I can't believe you were flirting with
his girlfriend or whoever the hell she is.

159
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:34,525
- Chloe, I wasn't flirting.
- Oh, give me a break, please!

160
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,573
Did you think she was cute?
Was that it? You thought she was cute?

161
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:57,051
Freeze!

162
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:02,426
- Sweep it, Martinez. Sweep
it. - We got it! - Shit. Chloe.

163
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,688
It's okay, Mr. Chase.
We're the good guys.

164
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,851
Martinez! What do you got?

165
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:10,269
- All clear!
- Baby, you okay?

166
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,521
- What happened?
- I don't know.

167
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,531
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

168
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:21,245
Sorry to barge in. Timothy Jarrett McCready,
CIA. This over here is Agent Martinez.

169
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,240
- He's dead.
- Martinez, take care of her.

170
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:28,373
- Hey! Back off.
- What?

171
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,335
I'm sorry.

172
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:36,091
Mr. Chase, we need to talk.

173
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,514
Relax. They're with me.

174
00:14:39,601 --> 00:14:43,894
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- All secure. - You got 'em?

175
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,563
- Mr. Chase and Miss Kent are now in our protection. Yeah. 
- Wrap it up. 

176
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,726
We'll do.

177
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,606
Clean.

178
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:57,821
Mr. Chase, we've been working a deep cover
operation in Mexico. It involves drug trafficking...

179
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,452
extortion and the murder of Governor
Eduardo Quintana in Chihuahua.

180
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:06,074
- Okay, that... What does that have to do with us?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,706
Have you ever heard
of Don Carlos Cola?

182
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:12,544
It's a dummy corporation that's a front
for the Gutierrez drug cartel.

183
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,716
They've been laundering money
through this corporation for years.

184
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:19,338
This morning they made
a $ 106-million deposit to your bank.

185
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,804
Daryl, what's going on?

186
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:30,142
Have you ever seen these two men?

187
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:32,357
No. Have you?

188
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:38,407
- No.
- That is your house guest from tonight.

189
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,484
I gotta assume you're going
somewhere with this.

190
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:43,531
Those two guys are on
the Gutierrez payroll.

191
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:47,322
In fact, they've been hanging around
the neighborhood for the last few days.

192
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:51,332
Wait a minute. That's the guy
that was on stage with me.

193
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:54,755
Well, now, this asshole you ought to
arrest. Anything you need, I'll testify.

194
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,961
Yeah, that's Freddy Tiffany.
He's an absolutely crazy man.

195
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:00,259
- Stay away from him.
- Wait a minute.

196
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:06,185
- How long have you been following me?
- Protecting you, Mr. Chase.

197
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:09,473
There are people out there who want you
dead. I'm not gonna let that happen.

198
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:13,432
But for me to help you,
you gotta trust me.

199
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,564
Daryl.

200
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:25,035
Look, I gotta get back to Mexico
for a few days and wind this thing up.

201
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:30,626
Agent Martinez is gonna stay here and provide
protection for both of you until we get this case solved.

202
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:34,708
Meanwhile, if anything goes wrong...
anything...

203
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,205
Mr. Chase, you call me.

204
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:46,553
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

205
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,219
Good luck.

206
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,389
Hey, you guys.

207
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:01,940
- Good morning, Julie. What's going on?
- Hi, Mr. Chase. Shari's been calling you every few minutes.

208
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,322
- I think there's something really wrong.
- Yeah, I know. She just paged me.

209
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:06,902
- Is she okay?
- She's hysterical. She couldn't even talk.

210
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:10,200
And then these two guys
showed up looking for you.

211
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,284
- In my office?
- Yeah. They're in your office with Mr. Allsworth.

212
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,369
- Who are they?
- I have no idea.

213
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:20,505
- Oh, shit.
- Mr................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. Mr. Chase?

214
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:24,721
- Can I get you more coffee? No? A bagel or...
- Excuse me, please, please. Mr. Chase.

215
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:29,634
Mr. Chase?

216
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,345
- Step aside! Mr. Chase!
- Move!

217
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,690
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

218
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:38,899
Come on! Move!

219
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:42,521
Shari, it's me, Daryl.

220
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,486
Shari?

221
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:48,695
Hey!

222
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:52,406
I don't wanna see you naked,
but if I have to...

223
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,419
Hang up and call again. 

224
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:17,013
If you'd like to make a call... 

225
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:23,353
Freeze!

226
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:40,084
Oh! Oh, shit. No.

227
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,509
- Well, you did it again.
- Hey, it happens.

228
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:53,638
- No! No! No!
- Come on, guys. How'd the wife... How'd the wife get in here?

229
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,808
- Hello? Is that you, Daryl?
- Hello? McCready, is that you?

230
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,650
Hell, yeah, it's me. I'm in trouble.
They think I killed two cops.

231
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,526
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yeah, sure. Hold on. My secretary, she is dead.

232
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:09,564
Those two guys you showed me the pictures of,
they showed up at my office this morning. 

233
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,736
- Look, I'm in trouble.
- Excuse me.

234
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:16,621
- Woman, woman, step off, all right?
- But you're not using the phone.

235
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,326
I got the phone now. You happy?
Look, the shit just hit the fan here.

236
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,543
Get your ass up here
and get me out of this.

237
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:25,003
Okay. First you gotta
get out of New York.

238
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,835
What are you talking about?
Are you listening to me?

239
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:31,423
I didn't kill anybody.
I don't wanna leave New York. Stop it!

240
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:34,884
- You wanna take your
chances with NYPD? - Shit.

241
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,100
Look, I'm black. I'm not stupid.

242
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:40,438
Okay, get your black ass to Mexico
where I can protect you.

243
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:42,980
Meet me in the town of La Questa.

244
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,354
La Questa. All right.

245
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,816
Listen, Daryl, don't use
your credit card, don't show your ID.

246
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,944
If you do, they'll find you,
they'll kill you. 

247
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:55,741
Just get to Mexico. 
Don't look at anybody. 

248
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,911
Don't wave at anybody.
Don't talk to anybody.

249
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:02,327
Yo, bitch, what up?

250
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,296
What's a uptown nigga like yourself
doin' down here with us common folk?

251
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:11,595
Figure a bitch like you
be in a limo, G-five, G-nine.

252
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,013
You know, that kind of shit.
You know, me and the Big Apple, baby.

253
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:20,057
It's like the 1900s.
It's over. It's over, baby.

254
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,016
You know, you one rude Negroid.

255
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:27,402
Didn't your mother ever tell you to talk to
people when they talk to you? Be sociable.

256
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:31,781
See, I know what your problem is. Your
father fondled you as a child, didn't he?

257
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:33,989
See, what you need
is some couch time.

258
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,200
Just sit down
and let it all out.

259
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,909
It happened to me... me and my grandfather.
I remember I was three years old.

260
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:43,043
- Hey, listen to me. I'm serious.
- It was only when he was on that moonshine.

261
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:45,618
Please.

262
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:49,545
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

263
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,919
Hey, hey, hey, baby. Hey, hey, hey. Hey,
baby. It's gonna be all right.

264
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:55,337
Come here. Daddy love you.

265
00:20:57,183 --> 00:21:00,848
All right, in, baby, yeah.
Get your bitch ass back in the bag.

266
00:21:06,984 --> 00:21:09,226
Nigga, nigga, nigga.

267
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,531
You got the NYPD "shoot a brother
41 times" after your ass.

268
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:15,942
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No wonder you're nervous.

269
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,823
- I need to get to Mexico.
- And people in hell need ice water.

270
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:21,950
A fat woman wanna be skinny.
A midget wanna be tall.

271
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:24,615
- You wanna be white.
- I'll take that as a yes.

272
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:27,831
- Come on, man.
- Hey, hey. Watch the clothes, man.

273
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:30,877
- If you're gonna help me, help me. But just...
- Oh, he need some help.

274
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,925
Well, look here. If you don't wanna go to the
penitentiary, you might wanna listen to your new partner.

275
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:40,509
Okay. Everybody, meet my new partner.
My new partner.

276
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:44,813
Top of the day. How's it going? How you doin'
there, sir? I'll be over there in a couple of hours.

277
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:47,518
Don't worry about it.
We got it all under control.

278
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,774
Hey, hey, smile, man.
You look suspicious.

279
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:55,860
That's what I'm talkin'
about there too.

280
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,701
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Loosen up the walk, too, man.

281
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:02,036
You know what I mean?
Put a little pep in the step.

282
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:04,079
That's right. That's right.
Take it back to the hood.

283
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:08,544
It's all good in the hood. It's
all good. How's it going there, sir?

284
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:13,256
I want you to check the numbers on the ticker
tape and I'll get back to you at 7:00. All right?

285
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:17,126
Look, bro, just act black.
That's all you gotta do.

286
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:21,428
Say, blood.

287
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:23,924
- What it is, jive turkey.
- Hey, hey, hey, bro...

288
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,012
All right, mama.

289
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:30,441
What's the last movie you seen, man?
Car Wash?

290
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:32,814
Man, you can kiss my ass.
Car Wash was a good movie.

291
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,608
Final boarding call
for the Empire Builder...

292
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,156
with service to Newark... 

293
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,111
Hey, Mr. Chase!
In the blue suit!

294
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,957
- Mr. Chase!
- Hey, hey, hey! What is your problem? Get your hands off of me, mister!

295
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,533
- All right, I'm sorry. We made a mistake.
- Of course you made a mistake.

296
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:51,916
And I demand an apology
from the both of you.

297
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:55,456
What is this all about? A white man
in a suit with a black man in a suit...

298
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,422
African-American male, 6'1 "to 6'3",
wearing a blue suit. 

299
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:02,047
- Why you puttin' your hands on me?
- Did you say blue suit?

300
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,762
Copy that. 

301
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,844
You'll love it.

302
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:10,265
- How rude.
- I'm talking to you!

303
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:12,599
- Whoa! Whoa! Would you just get on the train?
- Just get on the train.

304
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,310
- Some kind of Feds, huh? - We
gotta go. - I know my rights!

305
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:20,947
What do you want? There's not
gonna be any Rodney Kings going on.

306
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:26,241
- Hey! Oh, I'm doing good.
- Hey, how are you, sir?

307
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,952
- You got your ticket?
- Yes, yes, yes. How you doin', sisters?

308
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,829
This is their first time on a train. I'm trying
to tell them how much fun they're gonna have.

309
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,206
Oh. There's a first time
for everything.

310
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,871
You must not do that, young man.

311
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:41,212
Look, we're not trying
to give you a hard time, Mr. Allsworth.

312
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,554
But imagine how we feel when two
of our fellow officers turn up dead.

313
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:49,350
Well, why don't I ask the commissioner about it
tomorrow when he comes to my house for cocktails?

314
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,439
Yes, he is a friend of mine.
And so is Daryl Chase.

315
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,442
A very good friend.
I brought him into this firm.

316
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:59,821
He is the best and the brightest. I refuse to
believe that he has anything to do with this.

317
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,860
Okay, good. Now we're all very clear
on what you refuse to believe.

318
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:06,320
So why don't I tell you what we do
believe? We believe you're full of shit.

319
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,828
And we believe Daryl Chase is up to no good.
Now, we followed him all the way to Penn Station.

320
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,202
- Where do you think he was going?
- Vacation, maybe.

321
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,461
Vaca... Did he... Did he maybe have a
little vacation time stored up, Mr. Allsworth?

322
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:20,082
- What's your point?
- My point is that we've notified the authorities everywhere...

323
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:24,174
Mexico, Canada, Oz. Wherever he goes,
they're gonna catch him.

324
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:28,889
But just in case there's a slight possibility that
he contacts you first, do me one little favor.

325
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,808
Pick up the phone,
give us a call, okay?

326
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:36,230
- Good day, Mr. Allsworth.
- Goodbye, Mr. Allsworth.

327
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:40,814
- You know, I actually believed you were NYPD.
- You did a very good job too.

328
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:58,462
You know, most people who wear these
are actually missing a tooth.

329
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:01,881
- I just liked the way it looked.
- You would.

330
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:05,882
It look good on you, though, bro.
It look good.

331
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:09,554
Hi. Just the man I'm looking for. I need
two phone lines put in this room if I can.

332
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:13,686
I need an Internet access on one, fax on the other,
paper at every stop... New York Times... 

333
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:16,641
He needs a fax.
He needs a fax.

334
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,940
I got all your money.

335
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:23,067
Look at that, girl.
Smell it.

336
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,939
That's right. Can buy
a whole lot of dog food with that.

337
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:31,161
Whole lot of dog...

338
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,239
You're a little cutie pie,
you know that?

339
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,536
- Those things are not included in the price of a ticket.
- All I need...

340
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:39,582
is two phone lines in this room:
One with Internet access...

341
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:43,005
- You're being rude, just like you were today to those two nuns.
- One with a fax.

342
00:25:43,092 --> 00:25:46,461
- Making new friends, are we?
- Good morning, sir. How are you? Having a nice trip?

343
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,546
I'm having an excellent time.

344
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,221
Look. Whatever my friend needs here,
you put that on my tab.

345
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:55,179
You got it, sir.
Whatever you say, you got it.

346
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,844
What a gentleman. You gotta love him.

347
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,564
You were rude.

348
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:04,060
Racist asshole.

349
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:07,024
Ah, you're gettin' a taste
of your own medicine.

350
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:10,366
Now you're startin' to find out
it wasn't the brother in the suit...

351
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,575
but it was the suit
that was on the brother...

352
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:15,236
that got you
your so-called respect.

353
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:20,459
Nice watch, ain't it?

354
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,712
Yeah, uh, it's... it's real classy.

355
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,667
Look, uh, Freddy, I appreciate everything
you did helping me get on this train.

356
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:31,759
And I ain't gonna forget it. But when we get
to the next stop, we go our own separate ways.

357
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:36,261
- Your services are no longer required.
- Oh. Oh, well, ain't that a bitch.

358
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:41,394
It's just like you rich people. When
you get done using us downtrodden...

359
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,025
hood recipients...

360
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,482
you wanna kick us to the curb.

361
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:50,696
Throw us to the wolves
like some naked sheep.

362
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:54,117
What the hell do naked sheep got
to do with ghetto recipients, Freddy?

363
00:26:54,204 --> 00:26:57,537
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I give you this much.

364
00:26:57,624 --> 00:27:02,036
You know, you probably went to some kind
of accredited school, college and whatnot.

365
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:06,671
- Yeah, I went to Harvard. So what?
- Well, you know, I went to H.K. U...

366
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,465
Hard Knock University.

367
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,709
And that's what you gonna
need to get out of this.

368
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:14,387
They ain't gonna take no book smarts.
Street smarts.

369
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:17,179
- I don't need you, Freddy.
- You saying you smarter than me?

370
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,475
- I'm saying I'm smarter than you.
- You smarter than me?

371
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:23,608
- I'm smarter than you.
- Your neurons are firing quicker than mine are.

372
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:27,143
I got your Bulgari ring, your watch...

373
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:30,487
your Italian suit
that caresses me, oh, so well...

374
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:34,274
and a phat wad of cash...
that you said was two Gs...

375
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,536
ah, in what used to be
your inner pocket.

376
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,825
And I got all of that
in less than ten seconds, girl.

377
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:43,407
Did you hear her? Say it again, baby.

378
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,337
Ten seconds. But you smarter than me.

379
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:54,428
Come on. Let's burn some ants.

380
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,005
We're gonna burn some bugs
with these here.

381
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:11,446
What are you doing here?

382
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:15,363
Well, according to the two D cups
on your watch, it's dinnertime.

383
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:17,694
You got dinnertime money?

384
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:22,496
I'm just jokin'. I'm just jokin'.

385
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:26,534
- You know, your credit's good with me.
- Excuse me, sir.

386
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:29,832
Here's the paper you wanted.

387
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:32,082
That's for him.

388
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:35,130
- Thanks, Guido.
- It's Vito.

389
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:38,257
- Whatever. - Thank
you, sir. - Anytime now.

390
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:43,058
- Why don't you just bury your head in his ass?
- Let's see. One dinner...

391
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:46,230
- You gentlemen ready to order?
- Ah, yes, yes.

392
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:48,984
I'm going to have...

393
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:51,393
Let's see here.

394
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:53,610
The prime rib, medium rare.

395
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:57,233
And bring me some Grand Marnier
over the rocks.

396
00:28:57,326 --> 00:29:01,703
That's the way we used to have it when I
was in Harvard. Chauncey made the best ones.

397
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,625
I'm gonna have the yard bird
burnt to a crisp.

398
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,583
Now, I need you to spit on that
with a little bit of hot Tabasco.

399
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:15,542
And I'm gonna wash all that down
with a 40 dog of Schlitz malt liquor.

400
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:19,005
I'm sorry, sir. I don't believe
we have Schlitz malt liquor.

401
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:29,809
No Schlitz malt liquor?
No Schlitz malt liquor?

402
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,850
Well, ain't that some shit. How you
gonna run a successful business...

403
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:36,187
and you ain't got
no Schlitz malt liquor?

404
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,531
You ain't keepin' it real.
You ain't representin'.

405
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:43,532
What you doin' up in here, boy?
Uh, uh, uh, shit.

406
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:47,072
- I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Ya do that.

407
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,374
Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air-looking mo...

408
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:52,795
He do look like
the father on the Fresh Prince. 

409
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,511
Hey, uh, look, bro.

410
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:10,015
We ain't gettin' nowhere by fightin'.
Why don't you just talk to me?

411
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:13,807
I mean, how bad can it be?
It ain't like you murdered anybody.

412
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:18,486
Man, what kind of shit are you into?

413
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:22,321
Freddy, do you remember my assistant,
Shari? You met her at the office.

414
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,782
The one with that phat ass?

415
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:27,742
Yes. Well, she's dead.

416
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:31,451
I'm sorry, man. My bad.
I'm sorry to hear that.

417
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:34,913
L- I went to her apartment and, uh...

418
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:38,791
I don't know what happened, man. These two cops
wound up dead, and they think I did everything.

419
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,182
What's up with the CIA, bitch?

420
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:52,014
- Ah, here you go, gentlemen.
- Uh, thank you. You're a scholar and a gentleman.

421
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:54,100
Compliments to the chef.

422
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:57,229
How do you know
about the CIA, Freddy?

423
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,536
I, um... I can't really
talk to you about this.

424
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,582
Is that why we're on our way to Mexico?

425
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:16,540
I happen to know Mexico
like the back of my hand.

426
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:19,169
I am internationally known.

427
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,832
I done mischief everywhere.

428
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:27,088
Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil...
all them Mexican countries.

429
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:30,767
- That I believe.
- Well, since you're starting to believe me...

430
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:33,226
we been watched
for the last three states.

431
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:39,396
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I'm serious as a heart attack.

432
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:42,322
By Curly from the Globetrotters
over your right shoulder.

433
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:50,528
Don't look.
It'd call attention to yourself.

434
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,997
See, you need me more than you think.

435
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:04,165
'45 was a good year, sir.

436
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,673
Yeah. Appreciate that.

437
00:32:17,024 --> 00:32:19,312
- Man, I gotta run.
- Run where?

438
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:22,486
To the bathroom. Man, that prime rib
is running through me.

439
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:24,814
Well, I hope you can hold it.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

440
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:28,987
Oh, come on, man. Damn!
You heard me say I gotta go, man.

441
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:33,327
Excuse me, uh, sir.

442
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,536
- Could you help me with this door here?
- Sure.

443
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,786
Appreciate it.
Let's see what you got on you.

444
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,746
I know you ain't got no condoms.
Too ugly.

445
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:48,216
- We got your monkey ass.
- Lookie here. A ugly picture of you. You know this dude?

446
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:51,176
- Hell, no.
- Well, he seems to know you.

447
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,020
Shit! Who is this, Freddy?

448
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,942
I have no idea.

449
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:06,649
- That was a good plan, man. Thanks.
- Oh, anytime.

450
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,111
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He had a gun?

451
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,828
"Had" is the key word
in that sentence.

452
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,492
- Hey, Freddy.
- Yeah?

453
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,994
Freddy, there's a body out here.
What you want me to do?

454
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:26,751
Walk away from it before people think you had
something to do with it. I'm using the bathroom!

455
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:48,571
- Man, you really hit me, man.
- Man, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna check your hinges.

456
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:53,318
- Shut up, man, before you get us busted.
- I done met you down here like you told me to.

457
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,074
- Dribble, Curly, dribble. Go to your lanes.
- You bust me in the head.

458
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:03,248
- Hey, how's it going this evening?
- Fine.

459
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:05,830
- Can I bother you for a paper?
- Go right ahead.

460
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,004
Let's see what we got here.

461
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:17,058
Uh, look, these papers...

462
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:19,813
never made it on the train.

463
00:34:19,897 --> 00:34:21,853
Sir, I ain't got change for a hundred.

464
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,225
- They ain't never made it on the train.
- They're gone.

465
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:33,400
All aboard...

466
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:35,485
the night train!

467
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:41,161
No problem. I'll take care of it.
Hope you're having a nice trip, sir.

468
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,872
- Wonderful. Put that on my bill.
- Shit.

469
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:48,670
Well, well, well,
look who made the paper. Page three.

470
00:34:48,757 --> 00:34:52,340
"Wall Street Banker Wanted
for Questioning in Multiple Homicide. "

471
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:54,420
No, no, no, keep reading.

472
00:34:54,513 --> 00:34:56,554
There's a $ 100,000 reward...

473
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:02,098
for your whereabouts and/ or capture.

474
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:05,973
- Are you gonna turn me in, Freddy?
- You know, the thought had crossed my mind.

475
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:10,362
No, bro. Just relax.

476
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:14,065
- You wanna take a seat?
- No, I'm okay.

477
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,112
- You mind if I cop a squat?
- Not at all.

478
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,243
All right. Join me, man.

479
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,406
Go on. Take a load off.

480
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,458
Look, Daryl.

481
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:36,588
I believe you're innocent.
I had to be sure.

482
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:41,010
You know, I treat each case
with a certain amount of trepidation.

483
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:47,139
Uh, I'm really not Freddy Tiffany.

484
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,558
My real name is Fred Tiffany.

485
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:53,353
I had you fooled with
all that street shit, huh?

486
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:55,571
Yeah.

487
00:35:55,658 --> 00:36:00,700
Mr. Chase, I'm with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

488
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:03,114
I'm protecting you
on the way to Mexico.

489
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:05,829
And once we get there, we're
gonna flush out the real criminals.

490
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:09,667
Man, you got everybody after you.
You got the CIA, the FBI...

491
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:13,669
NBC, UPN, you pick a nigga,
as-salaam alaikum. 

492
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:45,409
- What happened to him?
- Oh, he's just drunk, man. I'm just trying to wake him up, you know.

493
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:50,041
Ya all right, baby?
Ya all right, brother?

494
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,295
Get your ass off this train.

495
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:03,592
- What the hell! What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up!

496
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:05,676
Help!

497
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,226
What are you doing? No!

498
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,329
- You're in trouble.
- I am?

499
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,119
Yeah, you are. No pets on my train.

500
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:37,859
Ah, damn! I had it!

501
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,732
I'm gonna whoop his Wall Street ass.

502
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:54,451
How's your mama? We went out.

503
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:58,541
What you lookin' at? You know,
you'd make a nice nine-piece.

504
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:02,296
Your ass and a couple of biscuits.
You know black people like chicken.

505
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:06,429
You see any flies around me? Huh?
I'm just playin'. I'm just playin. '

506
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:13,595
- Take care, now.
- Good luck to ya.

507
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,811
Thank you.

508
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:27,648
Hey, what's happening, ese?

509
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:31,787
Hotter than a Mexican whorehouse on
nickel night with a $5 rebate, I hear.

510
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,163
Mr. Funny Man, eh?

511
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:38,619
And how long do you plan to honor us
with your presence in Mexico?

512
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:42,496
I'm just gonna be here a couple of days.
But let me ask you somethin', now.

513
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,212
Where them big-booty Mexican bitches be
hangin' out? You know what I'm sayin'?

514
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:48,920
- Identification, por favor. 
- Identification. No problem. No problem.

515
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:53,142
You better alert the governor
that Freddy Tiffany is in the house.

516
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:56,097
- Freddy Tiffany?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

517
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:59,308
That's internationally known
Freddy Tiffany, fool.

518
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:04,395
We'll alert the governor that
Mr. Internationally Known has arrived.

519
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:08,023
- Internationally known.
- Just un segundito. 

520
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:11,035
Handcuff his ho when a nigga
like me step up in the place.

521
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,164
Tell you right now.
Ain't that right, Delores?

522
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:19,959
In, bitch.

523
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:22,833
I'm gettin' tired of you.
Tell you that right now.

524
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,916
Put on a little music.

525
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,934
Goddam.

526
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,479
Arriba, arriba,
Speedy Gonzalez.

527
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,978
Let's go!

528
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:01,973
Oooh, shit!

529
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:05,978
You wanna live, get in the car.
You wanna die, get in the car.

530
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,558
I know how to duck us into Mexico.

531
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:20,318
Think! Just think, Daryl!
How is it I'm outside your apartment?

532
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:23,119
How do I know where
your office is, Daryl?

533
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,707
How am I at the bottom
of the escalators at Penn Station?

534
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:30,165
Huh? I'm the FBI.

535
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,879
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

536
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,673
And the name is Fred Tiffany,
by the way!

537
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:40,260
Most highly decorated agent
at the whole Bureau!

538
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:43,388
But you wanna believe
a drug dealer, McCready.

539
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,646
If I wasn't a Christian...

540
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,105
Delores, sit still, bitch.

541
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:07,791
Hey. Hey, that's one
of those old-school hip-hop beats.

542
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,453
That's like some Run D.M.C.

543
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,709
That's more like Grandmaster Flash.

544
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,555
No, no, no. That's definitely Run D.M.C.
Man, listen to the grooves.

545
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,019
Come on.
What you know about hip-hop?

546
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:31,400
- You got that. You got that.
- Huh? This is "mus-ack. "

547
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:34,190
Man, it's kind of phat, though.

548
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,400
- I like the little mariachi horns, man.
- Yeah, that's tight. That's tight.

549
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:54,091
- What you doin'? Leave that on.
- Oh, all right.

550
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,462
You don't know nothin'
about that music.

551
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,928
- What?
- Mus-ack.

552
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,685
Definitely don't know nothin'
about dancing to no mus-ack.

553
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:09,055
Son, you better recognize,
all right? I got skills.

554
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,056
- Skills?
- Serious skills.

555
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,229
Oh, show me some of them skills,
Mr. Wall Street Executive.

556
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,273
- Is that a challenge?
- Yes, that's a challenge.

557
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,988
Hold this.

558
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,450
- Why, sure.
- I'm D.C., boy.

559
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,112
Well, let me check Chocolate City out.

560
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,292
Dark chocolate.

561
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:34,332
Free your mind,
and your ass will follow.

562
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,418
Aww.

563
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,847
You might be from the projects.

564
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,474
- Ah, son!
- That had to hurt.

565
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,722
- All right.
- Here. Limp your way back over here.

566
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,983
- Let me show you how it's done.
- Please take the stage.

567
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,027
Tag, I'm it.
Let me show you how I used to do it...

568
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,569
before I joined the Bureau.

569
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:05,192
See, we used to take it up
like that there, nice and easy.

570
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,987
Then we... huh, huh, huh...
bring it around like that.

571
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,620
- Ohhh.
- Then we'd... huh... bring it.

572
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,916
Drop it like it's hot.

573
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:16,791
Tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick...

574
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:19,088
tick, tick, tick.

575
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,666
Take it back to Beat Street, baby.
Look out!

576
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,919
Crazy legs.

577
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,133
You gotta hit it like this
and bring it down like this.

578
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,051
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:35,439
Ah, hell, no! Come back here!

580
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:40,068
- I'm gonna whoop your ass!
- Bye-bye, biatch!

581
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:48,411
I'm gonna kill him.
Let's walk, girl.

582
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,820
You got four legs. You walk. Shit.

583
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,955
Come on.
Double-time, double-time.

584
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:11,059
Just follow the stairway

585
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:15,307
To this lonely world of mine

586
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,390
Somebody's here. All right, bye.

587
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,065
- Hi.
- Hi. May I help you?

588
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,234
- Yeah. Just checking in.
- Okay.

589
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,034
- Um, reservation?
- No.

590
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,823
- Cash or... cash.
- Yeah.

591
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,710
Twenty, forty, sixty.

592
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:50,217
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but what is that smell?

593
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:57,136
- That smell is the wave of the future.
- This shit smell?

594
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,397
- Emu.
- Oh, that's what those birds are.

595
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,980
- Those are... Those are emu.
- 98% fat-free.

596
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:10,066
All your protein and nutrients with the
savory flavor of chicken and steak combined...

597
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,407
all in one easily farmable bird.

598
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,490
Well, I tell ya, that sounds nutritious.
Good luck with that.

599
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,953
- Can I get a key?
- Key.

600
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,038
Thank you.

601
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,470
Take it easy.

602
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,889
Tiffany? Tiffany.

603
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,866
Damn, if I were him, I'd have shot the
son of a bitch that took that picture.

604
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,908
Have you bumped your head?

605
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,240
Hey, little darlin'.

606
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,748
Our ship has just come in.

607
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,128
- Uh, yeah?
- Hey, McCready, this is Daryl. 

608
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,638
- Daryl Chase.
- Mr. Chase, where in the hell are you?

609
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:19,300
I'm at an emu ranch in, um...

610
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:23,772
- Shit. Where am I? "Rancito. "
- You mean, Texas?

611
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:27,938
Yes, Texas. I was trying to get into Mexico to
see you.  I almost got killed at the border. 

612
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:31,398
They thought I was Freddy Tiffany. By the
way, this guy keeps showing up everywhere.

613
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,406
- How the hell does he keep finding me?
- I told you to stay away from Tiffany.

614
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:40,738
I'm trying to stay away from Tiffany. I just
told you he keeps showing up everywhere I go.

615
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,290
Plus, he claims you're at the centre
of some drug trafficking scheme.

616
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,213
Of course I'm at the centre
of it. I'm with the CIA.

617
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:51,043
Right now I'm watching a bunch of drug
smugglers load up a plane full of cocaine.

618
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,508
They think I'm their friend.
That's what I do.

619
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,680
I watch the bad guys.
Stop listening to a murderer.

620
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,436
Listen, your murderer
thinks he's with the FBI.

621
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,350
- He was kicked out of the Bureau two years ago.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

622
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:07,140
- He really was with the FBI?
- He's out on a 5150. A mental.

623
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:11,398
You are with a class-A psychopath.

624
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:15,818
Mr. Chase, stay put.  We're coming to rescue
you and take Mr. Tiffany into custody. 

625
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,579
- Don't move. 
- I don't believe this.

626
00:49:18,662 --> 00:49:21,450
Fine. Hey, McCready. McCready?

627
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,700
- Hello? Daryl.
- Chloe?

628
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,998
- Daryl, Jesus! Where the hell are you? 
- I don't have time to explain that right now. You all right?

629
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:33,254
- Miss Kent, remember what I said.
- No. I got a million cops asking me questions, Daryl.

630
00:49:33,344 --> 00:49:36,927
I don't know if you're alive. I don't know if you're
dead. I don't know what's happening to our lives.

631
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,062
- Okay, partner, we're in business.
- You guys wanted lunch?

632
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,101
- Whoa, ho, ho. We almost got this.
- I got the prefix.

633
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:49,149
Look. Does the word Pentium
mean anything to either one of you?

634
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:51,726
Will you get this away from the equipment,
please? Take it away from the equipment.

635
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:54,312
- Is Martinez still there with you?
- Yeah. 

636
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:57,407
- Don't stay on the phone too long. 
- Chloe, I know all this doesn't make sense to you right now. 

637
00:49:57,492 --> 00:50:00,410
- But I promise you, it's all gonna be fine. 
- Stay on the line.

638
00:50:00,495 --> 00:50:03,248
- Stay on the line. Don't hang up.
- Daryl, I'm scared.

639
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:06,202
- You better hang up the phone.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet! Okay, I got the fourth digit.

640
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:09,460
I promise, it's all
gonna work out fine.

641
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:11,455
- Stay on the line. Stay on the line.
- You better hang up.

642
00:50:11,548 --> 00:50:13,458
- Stay on the line.
- Baby, I love you.

643
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,791
- Five digits! - I love
you too. - Hang it up.

644
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:17,761
- Six digits. - Now.
- One more thing.

645
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:20,718
Hang up the damn phone!

646
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:27,478
You know, you like a piece of faeces
with peanuts... a pain in my ass.

647
00:50:29,942 --> 00:50:34,521
- I see you brought your little white girlfriend with you.
- Shut up!

648
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,820
Probably been on the phone
with McCready, huh?

649
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,659
Probably told you I was on a 5150.
Mm-mmm.

650
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:42,495
It's a 1718.
I don't even know what that is.

651
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:47,744
You know what that is? What is it?

652
00:50:47,835 --> 00:50:51,500
- A button?
- No. It's a transmitter.

653
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:59,006
- What is it? What is it?
- A pager.

654
00:50:59,095 --> 00:51:02,713
No. This is a tracking device.

655
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:06,591
That's how I knew where you were
every time you made a move!

656
00:51:06,686 --> 00:51:09,060
Why do you think I had us change
clothes at Penn Station...

657
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:14,438
under the auspices
of being a criminal, mister?

658
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:18,360
And the dog... Oh, the dog is the centre
of this entire investigation.

659
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,986
Oh, yeah.
You didn't know that, did you?

660
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:24,860
- No. I was under the auspices that it was a tracking device.
- Shut up.

661
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:27,197
Get up. You coming with me. Get up!

662
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,160
Ooh, ooh, I'm sorry. You may want
to hold on to that tracking device.

663
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:37,590
That's all right.
I can throw a bullet at you.

664
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:40,381
Don't you go nowhere.
You wait right there.

665
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:45,048
Baby, you keep guard, all right? Hey, wait
a minute, fool! Come here! Hold on, mister!

666
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:50,469
I threw a ring down the toilet

667
00:51:50,563 --> 00:51:53,268
'Cause that's
where our love went

668
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,691
All right. Let me guess.
Somebody tried to kill you.

669
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:04,321
T.J. McCready miraculously
shows up and shoots him.

670
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:07,198
- Yep. That's it.
- That's the oldest trick in the book, man.

671
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:09,578
At the Bureau,
we call it the double take.

672
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,575
If you'd have looked twice,
you'd have seen what really happened.

673
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:15,291
- So that didn't really happen?
- Nah. It's all smoke and mirrors.

674
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,295
See, Thomas Chela is Minty Gutierrez.
They're one in the same.

675
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:22,587
The Gutierrez drug cartel ring a bell?
He's the guy with the glass eye...

676
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,008
floatin' all over his shit, kind of got
that Sammy Davis thing happening, man.

677
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,726
Hey, wait a minute. You mean
Don Carlos Cola is a drug front?

678
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:35,016
Exactly. Governor Quintana was working
with the United States Government.

679
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:38,274
I get the drop that somebody's
tryin' to assassinate him...

680
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:42,774
get there a couple of minutes late,
get caught on camera inside his house.

681
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:46,365
Thus the dilemma I find myself in
at this particular junction.

682
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:51,115
- Man, you didn't even do this then.
- Hell, no. I didn't murder nobody, unfortunately.

683
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:54,623
Governor Quintana, he was trying to slow
the drug flow into the United States.

684
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:56,335
I mean,
how good is that for the kids?

685
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,129
- That's some serious shit, Freddy.
- Yeah. No shit.

686
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:01,627
- You're being framed.
- Exactly.

687
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:03,710
By the same people
that are trying to frame you.

688
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:06,804
- You FBI. You can go talk to them. They can clear me. They can clear you.
- No, no, no, no.

689
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,350
This is my point exactly. The FBI
has no jurisdiction in Mexico.

690
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:15,516
I'm not even supposed to be playin'
right now. This is some rogue shit.

691
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:20,149
- You lookin' at a rogue.
- Fred, I had... I had no idea.

692
00:53:20,235 --> 00:53:22,063
- You a rogue.
- A rogue.

693
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,571
- Rogue.
- Don't patronize me, man.

694
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:29,782
I'm sorry. My bad.

695
00:53:30,997 --> 00:53:36,073
You just a big rogue.
I won't p-patronize you, you big rogue.

696
00:53:43,926 --> 00:53:46,002
- All right. See you later, rogue.
- Man, you might want to listen...

697
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:49,132
to some of this shit
if you want to live past tomorrow.

698
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:54,099
- You ain't goin' nowhere without me.
- With an IQ of a tree

699
00:53:54,186 --> 00:54:01,518
Honey, that ain't all
You've seen the last of me

700
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:03,567
Yeah!

701
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:09,022
I'm sorry, man. Really. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I've been... I've been rude.

702
00:54:09,118 --> 00:54:12,237
- He fits the description.
- I'm gonna call it in.

703
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:26,917
Shit on a stick!

704
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:39,681
What the hell?

705
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,526
Shit.

706
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:50,485
Get this gun out of my ass!

707
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:59,911
You've got to admit,
that "rogue" shit was pretty... Aw, shit!

708
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:03,745
- Your dumb dog bit me!
- That's what you get.

709
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:17,218
- Damn! You got sheriff crackers out there thinkin' that you're me.
- What?

710
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:41,114
Damn it, Molly Jo!
Mike, how'd you get out of the pen?

711
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,127
You shit in that pool,
and you're gonna end up lunch meat.

712
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:54,632
Shit! It's the Pepsi truck!
Shit!

713
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,008
Shit! Shit!

714
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:01,760
Mother's Cookies!
Mother's damn Cookies!

715
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:09,480
Fiji Water. Damn Fiji Water.

716
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:20,944
Freddy, when McCready gets here,
this is all over. Will you calm down?

717
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:24,996
Those are McCready's men out there.
Don't you get it?

718
00:56:30,717 --> 00:56:33,587
- What are you doin'?
- Calling a strike team.

719
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:38,719
Find the right goddam pen,
have a strike team here in 30 seconds.

720
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:41,809
Coming soon: The Black Rogue. 

721
00:56:50,736 --> 00:56:55,197
Joe, Steven, get those trucks out
of here. Luther, come with me.

722
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:58,485
"Dear Strike Team.
It's me, Freddy.

723
00:56:58,577 --> 00:57:03,404
Send help soon.
Signed, Rogue. "

724
00:57:03,498 --> 00:57:09,123
- Move it out!
- You ain't gonna think everything's so damn funny in just about a minute.

725
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:12,962
Gunfire!

726
00:57:13,926 --> 00:57:16,215
Hey! Gunfire!

727
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,802
Come on, Tiffany!

728
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:23,509
I am not Freddy Tiffany!
I am not Freddy Tiffany!

729
00:57:29,024 --> 00:57:34,896
I fall to pieces

730
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,111
We got a border to cross!

731
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,486
- I'm Freddy Tiffany! I'm Freddy Tiffany!
- Hell, yes, you are!

732
00:57:41,578 --> 00:57:44,365
Get me out of here!

733
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:52,536
I fall to pieces

734
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:55,667
Oh, shit!

735
00:57:55,759 --> 00:58:00,468
How can I be just your friend

736
00:58:00,556 --> 00:58:06,891
- What the...
- You want me to act

737
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:10,264
- Like we've never kissed
- Let's go, bitch.

738
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:14,770
You want me to forget

739
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:17,399
Pretend we've never met

740
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:21,357
- You'd better be worth a lot of damn money; that's all I can say.
- You mother...

741
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:27,620
And I try and I try
but I haven't yet

742
00:58:27,707 --> 00:58:35,003
You walk by
and I fall to pieces

743
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:39,300
You walk by

744
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:43,596
And I fall to pieces

745
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,594
We made it, baby!

746
00:58:57,363 --> 00:59:01,028
Hey, man, what's goin' on?

747
00:59:01,115 --> 00:59:04,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's my meal ticket, there!

748
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:07,778
I'm sorry about this mess, but I know
you know where them big-booty bitches...

749
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:12,992
Get off of me!
Don't tell me to shut up!

750
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:15,328
- You don't know who I am.
- Put him back in here with Daddy.

751
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:20,251
Now, listen, Mr. Funny Man.
Enjoy your visit, huh?

752
00:59:21,802 --> 00:59:23,878
Okay. I'm going.

753
00:59:27,516 --> 00:59:29,509
Kiss my ass, Paco!

754
00:59:55,045 --> 00:59:58,330
Come in, Mr. Tiffany!
Come in!

755
00:59:58,422 --> 01:00:02,088
Step into my office.
Sit down.

756
01:00:06,305 --> 01:00:08,382
Have a cigar, Mr. Tiffany.
Here.

757
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:10,431
Here. Go on. Go on.
Have a cigar.

758
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,134
Here. Very good.

759
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,767
Go ahead. Go ahead. Huh?

760
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:25,360
You have no idea what it means
to meet you, Mr. Tiffany.

761
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:29,067
This is a great moment.

762
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:32,032
I take it you and Governor Quintana
weren't exactly friendly.

763
01:00:32,123 --> 01:00:34,792
Oh, I loved Governor Quintana!

764
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:38,708
He was a great man
who was trying to make a difference.

765
01:00:38,796 --> 01:00:43,173
Oh, that is, of course, why he
bought the farm, as you Americanos say.

766
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:49,380
But he will always be held
in the warmest place of my heart.

767
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,013
Let me ask you something,
Capitn. 

768
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:56,392
What? Wh-What is that?

769
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,941
You all smiling at me like I'm Regis
and I got a million dollars.

770
01:01:01,027 --> 01:01:03,778
- Very funny.
- What's up with that?

771
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:07,148
That is because there will
be promotions for all of us.

772
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,452
You know...
the men who captured you.

773
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:19,376
Well, before you boys break out the
pinatas and start drinkin' tequila...

774
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:22,835
- I'd like to make my phone call.
- Huh?

775
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:27,135
My phone call.
To T.J. McCready with the CIA.

776
01:01:28,262 --> 01:01:30,718
I think he'll explain
who I really am.

777
01:01:30,806 --> 01:01:33,558
A phone call?
You want to make a phone call?

778
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:41,847
He wants to make a phone call!

779
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:46,318
This is not America,
my friend.

780
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:48,481
You do not get a phone call.

781
01:01:51,034 --> 01:01:54,450
Next, you will be wanting us
to call Johnnie Cochran, huh?

782
01:02:04,715 --> 01:02:07,917
Wh-What is this?

783
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:10,630
- I'm not Freddy Tiffany.
- What?

784
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,469
I'm Daryl Chase. Looks like
Foghorn Leghorn over here screwed up.

785
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:16,597
I say... I say,
ain't that right, boy?

786
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:26,732
What is the meaning
of all of this?

787
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,192
Now, hold on. Just wait a second here.
Let me think.

788
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:33,360
You realize I can bring you up
on charges for trying to trick me?

789
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:34,945
- Now, wait a goddam minute.
- Huh?

790
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:36,578
- I am tellin' you, he...
- Boss, boss.

791
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:43,039
- What?
- Really?

792
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:50,463
Well, we shall see.

793
01:02:54,305 --> 01:02:56,843
There is somebody here
to see you.

794
01:02:56,932 --> 01:03:00,597
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

795
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,844
- Who?
- Your senorita.

796
01:03:09,404 --> 01:03:11,443
Federico.

797
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:15,658
- Wait. I know you, right?
- You know me?

798
01:03:15,744 --> 01:03:19,492
You know me? Well, I should hope so
that you know me.

799
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:26,336
Look, I don't know what's with the
accent, but we met at the La Perla party.

800
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:29,624
No, we did not meet at La Perla.
We met at the other place.

801
01:03:29,715 --> 01:03:31,839
- You know what I'm talking about.
- I'm Daryl Chase.

802
01:03:31,926 --> 01:03:36,588
- You are not Daryl Chase! You are Federico!
- No, no. No, see, I'm Dar...

803
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:39,930
We met at the La Perla party.
Remember?

804
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:43,267
- I don't know her.
- Well, you... you just said you did.

805
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:45,393
Okay. We met at a party...

806
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:50,937
I met her, but I don't, you know, know
her, you know, in the biblical, like she...

807
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:53,566
You know me!
You know me mucho times, okay?

808
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:55,945
- Mucho times.
- I don't know this girl.

809
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:02,489
- Why? Why are you doing this to her?
- Look. I don't know...

810
01:04:02,582 --> 01:04:04,741
what greasy, grubby nigga she been
laying up in the bed with.

811
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,621
- I ain't got nothin' to do with this.
- That is not a very nice thing to say.

812
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,583
I'm not lyin'!
I do not know her!

813
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:15,457
Captain...

814
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:20,556
I never talked
to this "macarena" girl!

815
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,724
I love you, Freddy!

816
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:31,982
This a bad time
to talk about that reward?

817
01:04:32,652 --> 01:04:34,729
Don't worry about a thing, girl.

818
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:38,486
'Cause when we get to Mexico,
I'm a Mexican and you a chihuahua.

819
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:42,525
So you gotta learn how to habla Espanol
when we get there, you know.

820
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:50,493
Hey, girl. Look at this:
An invasion of Texas.

821
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:55,084
Hey, y'all have a good time in America!
And my name is Paco if anybody asks.

822
01:04:55,176 --> 01:04:57,631
Bark in Spanish.

823
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,471
Well, that was good, girl. Sure you
ain't got no chihuahua in you?

824
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:05,468
I mean,
how hard can this be?

825
01:05:06,395 --> 01:05:08,720
On our way to Mexico. 

826
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:13,562
Oh, hell, yeah. We cruisin', baby.
Look at that. Yeah, this is good.

827
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:15,774
Oh, shh...

828
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,038
Shit!

829
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,879
Delores!

830
01:05:36,841 --> 01:05:42,678
Delores!
I see you, baby! Here I come!

831
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:54,269
Hang in there, girl. Ah.

832
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:58,226
Ah, I told you Daddy'd be here.
Ai-yai-yai.

833
01:06:00,531 --> 01:06:02,987
It's my baby. Thank you.
Thank you.

834
01:06:03,076 --> 01:06:05,484
- 'Preciate it. 'Preciate it.
- No, no, no, no.

835
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:09,033
No, no, no.
Black man going to Mexico.

836
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:12,124
Y'all can go to Compton.

837
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:14,915
I'm going to Mexico!
Look.

838
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:17,292
Over that way! No!

839
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,125
U.S.A.

840
01:06:19,217 --> 01:06:24,258
Me and the dog can take all y'all. Bring it
on! Bring it on! Watch it, baby. Bite 'em!

841
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,632
Keep missin' with me.
All of ya. No. Look out.

842
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,349
- Here you go, Mr. Allsworth.
- Hmm? Thank you.

843
01:06:37,444 --> 01:06:41,655
- Mm-hmm. - This is a good
thing you're doing, Chloe.

844
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,112
The CIA won't let anything
happen to him.

845
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,407
You're doin' the right thing
by helpin' us out.

846
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,902
I'll do whatever it takes.

847
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:57,871
I ain't gettin' out!
Yeah, drop me off right here!

848
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,586
Thanks for the ride, suckers!

849
01:07:16,982 --> 01:07:18,975
Shit.

850
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:32,412
Hello, Mr. Chase.
I trust you had a pleasant trip.

851
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:35,907
- You have no idea.
- I've come to get you out of here.

852
01:07:36,002 --> 01:07:38,837
Let's go.

853
01:07:40,548 --> 01:07:42,505
Thanks, man.

854
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:48,095
Shit.

855
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,802
Daryl, wait up. I need to step over here
and take care of some paperwork...

856
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:53,513
and get your things, and then you can
tell me about everything.

857
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,175
The sooner I get out of here,
the better.

858
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:59,356
- What happened to your leg?
- A dog bit me.

859
01:08:02,068 --> 01:08:05,733
Oh. Here you go, amigo.

860
01:08:05,822 --> 01:08:07,697
Freddy Tiffany.

861
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:18,042
Let me guess.
Somebody tried to kill you.

862
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,797
T.J. McCready miraculously
shows up in the nick of time...

863
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,251
and shoots him.

864
01:08:25,051 --> 01:08:27,423
Shit.

865
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:44,440
And the dog? Oh, the dog is the centre
of this entire investigation.

866
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,978
Shit.

867
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,660
Shit.

868
01:08:52,744 --> 01:08:54,736
Shit.

869
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:02,159
Hey, Martinez.

870
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,275
Daryl, you want to step over here
and sign out?

871
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:26,937
Daryl?

872
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,774
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- Who?

873
01:09:32,867 --> 01:09:34,990
Chase. He made me.
He's on the move.

874
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:37,569
- We didn't see him.
- He's on foot. He's running. Let's go.

875
01:09:37,664 --> 01:09:39,621
What in the shit were y'all doin'?
Let's move it.

876
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,664
We gotta find him.
We gotta find him. We gotta find him.

877
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,331
Oh! Sorry.

878
01:09:58,435 --> 01:10:01,638
Don't move!
Now, you heard me. Don't move.

879
01:10:07,694 --> 01:10:10,979
- Freddy?
- Yeah, it's me.

880
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:21,660
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.

881
01:10:21,749 --> 01:10:24,454
All right?
I'll get you through this.

882
01:10:24,544 --> 01:10:27,747
- I thought you was crazy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look.

883
01:10:27,838 --> 01:10:30,875
- We gotta get the hell out of here.
- No, no. I gotta get to New York.

884
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:34,003
McCready's dirty like you said.
Martinez left Chloe.

885
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:36,087
- I don't know if she's dead.
- Look, look, look. She's gonna be fine.

886
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,631
Chloe's going to be fine. Remember
my partners Norville and Gradney?

887
01:10:39,725 --> 01:10:42,298
Partners? Wait, wait, wait.
The drug dealers?

888
01:10:42,394 --> 01:10:45,265
They're FBI agents. They've
been down with me the whole time.

889
01:10:45,355 --> 01:10:47,396
It's a covert operation.

890
01:10:49,068 --> 01:10:52,272
Let's get the hell out of here before
we end up with bullets in our head.

891
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:56,441
Oh, shit!

892
01:10:59,912 --> 01:11:02,404
Down, bitch!

893
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:06,828
- Do I look like I'm goddam moving?
- I'm talking to the goddam dog!

894
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:19,763
- Who is that?
- Oh, you're gonna like this.

895
01:11:19,848 --> 01:11:22,683
Oh, yeah? What am I gonna
like about this?

896
01:11:22,768 --> 01:11:25,224
The new guy,
bought and paid for.

897
01:11:25,312 --> 01:11:28,348
Send him up, Minty.
Send him up.

898
01:11:33,695 --> 01:11:37,741
I can't begin to tell you how you guys
have screwed things up for me.

899
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:41,573
You are a bunch of stupid,
incompetent jackasses...

900
01:11:41,662 --> 01:11:44,866
who don't know
how to do a simple job.

901
01:11:47,626 --> 01:11:50,034
And you...

902
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:52,881
If you are any indication
of the efficiency...

903
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:55,717
of the Central Intelligence Agency,
let me tell you, my friend:

904
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:58,838
Your government is in deep water.

905
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,681
Minty, in every operation
there are a couple of snags.

906
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:04,766
You go off like a loose cannon,
kill Governor Quintana...

907
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:08,683
get bit by his dog and have
the stupidity to leave it behind...

908
01:12:08,772 --> 01:12:10,564
connecting you to the crimes
and me as well.

909
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:12,808
And you call that "snags"?

910
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:19,197
And you...

911
01:12:19,282 --> 01:12:23,410
You assured me
that my money was safe...

912
01:12:23,495 --> 01:12:25,534
safe from prying eyes.

913
01:12:25,622 --> 01:12:29,573
Well, Minty, it was,
until you transferred $ 106 million...

914
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:31,792
into your account
in a single day.

915
01:12:31,879 --> 01:12:33,872
Daryl would've had
to be dead not to catch it.

916
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:36,087
See, Minty? A snag.

917
01:12:36,175 --> 01:12:41,050
Minty, I will handle your accounts
personally if things get any worse.

918
01:12:41,138 --> 01:12:43,675
And exactly how much worse
are they supposed to get?

919
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:47,763
- I can handle Daryl.
- That time is all passed now.

920
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:54,103
I am going to take care
of Daryl myself, my way.

921
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:56,315
Oh, hey,
I don't like the sound of that.

922
01:12:56,403 --> 01:13:00,151
- That is music to my ears.
- Gentlemen.

923
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,861
- Hi, baby.
- Come here.

924
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:08,036
- What happened to you?
- Stinkin' mutt bit me.

925
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:10,281
Damn thing's bitin' everybody,
right?

926
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,747
Yeah. That little furball
has got sharp teeth.

927
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:18,913
Minty, I'd like
for you to meet Agent Gradney, FBI.

928
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:24,134
Let me guess, huh? You...
You want a piece of the action, hmm?

929
01:13:24,222 --> 01:13:27,555
- I'm worth it.
- Yeah? Show me how you're worth it.

930
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:30,809
Well, why don't we ask Maque here.

931
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:33,517
- Isn't that right, sweet thing? - Hey.
Wh-Wh-What do you think that you're doing, huh?

932
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:38,483
She's Tiffany's partner.
Always has been.

933
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,444
She was a plant
from the beginning.

934
01:13:41,823 --> 01:13:44,824
Now, that bite mark's the only thing
that connects you to this murder.

935
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:49,453
We make sweet thing disappear here,
along with that stinkin' mutt...

936
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:52,374
FBI doesn't have much of a case,
now, do they?

937
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:55,459
Whoa. You are better
than I thought.

938
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,014
Damn!
Elliot was a good man...

939
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,343
and there wasn't too many good men
at the Bureau.

940
01:14:11,435 --> 01:14:15,350
They put me on a 5150
because I give a damn.

941
01:14:18,109 --> 01:14:20,434
I'm sorry
about your friend, man.

942
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:25,483
There's somebody special in there
I want to get out.

943
01:14:31,914 --> 01:14:34,452
It's payback time.

944
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,559
- No wonder the Bureau kicked him out.
- Hey, hey, hey. Watch it. Slow!

945
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,985
I am Freddy Tiffany, FBI!

946
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:08,240
- Oh, look at that fool.
- Lookie here. Lookie here.

947
01:15:08,326 --> 01:15:11,113
Keep your hands off me! You know
damn well you got orders not to shoot.

948
01:15:11,204 --> 01:15:14,738
You know what's goin' down?
I'm going to arrest all you crackers.

949
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:16,741
- You can believe that and then some.
- Hey, Tiffany.

950
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,992
- What?
- I think you forgot about me.

951
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:23,381
- No, I didn't.
- Freeze! Freeze.

952
01:15:23,465 --> 01:15:26,004
You, I'm just going to kill.

953
01:15:26,092 --> 01:15:28,964
Martinez, drop your gun.

954
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:31,047
Drop it.

955
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,217
- You all right, baby?
- I'm better now.

956
01:15:37,312 --> 01:15:39,518
Get your ass over there.

957
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:44,185
You, Jones!
Get your bitch ass over there!

958
01:15:44,278 --> 01:15:47,527
- Daryl, handle your business.
- Here, sweetie.

959
01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:49,653
Thank you, baby.
You know how I like silver guns.

960
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:51,983
T.J., where is Chloe?

961
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,366
Banker boy, how do you plan
on gettin' out of here?

962
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:58,239
Your life is worth less
than a Mexican food stamp right now.

963
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:03,161
I'm going to ask you again.
Where is Chloe?

964
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:06,873
Eh, Mr. Chase,
Chloe is in perfect health.

965
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:10,336
If you don't believe me, take a look
out that window. See for yourself.

966
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:12,718
- Please.
- Thomas...

967
01:16:12,806 --> 01:16:17,184
if I don't like what I see,
you're all dead men.

968
01:16:17,269 --> 01:16:21,646
- Daryl, this is not like you.
- I think the brother means business.

969
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:24,139
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

970
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:36,741
- Hey, baby!
- Well, what did you expect, huh?

971
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:42,285
Your girlfriend in chains and shackled
in a deep, dark wine cellar, huh?

972
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:45,164
We are all civilized here,
Mr. Chase.

973
01:16:45,255 --> 01:16:48,007
- What about Governor Quintana?
- Unfortunately...

974
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:51,923
Quintana didn't want to be part
of our happy little family.

975
01:16:52,012 --> 01:16:55,215
That's why I'm sure you both
will be more cooperative than he was.

976
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:57,678
More cooperative?

977
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:02,435
C.A., you piece of shit.
You were like a father to me.

978
01:17:02,522 --> 01:17:05,688
Well, you're still like a son
to me, Daryl.

979
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:09,939
That's why all of this can
be resolved very simply and cleanly.

980
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:15,569
- C.A., shut up.
- Hey, uh, Minty. I got a question.

981
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,452
How is it you can afford the CIA,
a banker from Wall Street...

982
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:22,248
but you can't seem
to buy a better eye...

983
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,621
than that marble
you got rollin' around in your skull?

984
01:17:25,878 --> 01:17:29,496
- Oh, you got some balls, Tiffany.
- That's what your mama said.

985
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:33,041
Okay, Minty. Enough
of this cops-and-robbers bullshit.

986
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:37,549
- Call in the guns.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

987
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:40,760
- I beg your pardon?
- I have always known...

988
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:43,390
that Maque Sanchez
was with the FBI.

989
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:48,770
God, Charles,
I have got well over $600 million...

990
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:52,858
in your American banks right now,
which your government has frozen.

991
01:17:52,947 --> 01:17:56,150
The only chance I have of ever
recovering any of my money...

992
01:17:56,242 --> 01:18:01,318
is to turn all of you over
to the Justice Department...

993
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:05,078
which Mr. Tiffany and Miss Sanchez
happen to be members of.

994
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,540
My God. You set me up. That's
why you made that goddam deposit.

995
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:13,383
- You started all of this.
- Ah, that's right.

996
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:16,421
And you clowns just confessed
to everything we need.

997
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,012
Considering the caliber
of your work...

998
01:18:21,099 --> 01:18:25,049
you are all lucky to be able to walk
out of here with your lives.

999
01:18:25,145 --> 01:18:28,017
Betrayal. Ain't it a bitch?

1000
01:18:29,484 --> 01:18:31,809
- Drop the gun, or I'll kill her. -
Put it down. - I swear I'll kill her.

1001
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:34,109
- Drop the gun, Tiffany.
- Put the gun down now.

1002
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:36,354
- Tiffany, you son of a bitch, I'll kill her!
- Put it down!

1003
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:38,737
- Will you stop it, Freddy?
- Drop the gun. - Put it down!

1004
01:18:38,826 --> 01:18:41,743
- Shut up! - Put it down
now! - Goddam it, Freddy!

1005
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:44,154
- Put your gun down! - I'll kill
her! - You want to go there with me?

1006
01:18:44,248 --> 01:18:45,825
- Relax! - I'll kill
her! - Let's go there!

1007
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,375
- Freddy! - Me
and you! - Shut up!

1008
01:18:47,459 --> 01:18:48,574
- Shoot him! - Huh?
What? - Shut up!

1009
01:18:48,669 --> 01:18:51,540
- Freddy!
- I'll roll you like a Philly blunt and smoke your bitch ass!

1010
01:18:58,262 --> 01:18:59,755
They shot Minty!

1011
01:19:10,857 --> 01:19:12,897
Cover me, baby.

1012
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:21,484
Cover me!

1013
01:19:27,249 --> 01:19:29,575
Clear! Come on!

1014
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:12,581
- Martinez?
- What?

1015
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:17,340
- You play golf, right?
- What?

1016
01:20:17,424 --> 01:20:21,552
I know your families used to run around
with leaf blowers cuttin' lawns.

1017
01:20:21,637 --> 01:20:24,886
- But you play golf, right?
- No, man.

1018
01:20:24,973 --> 01:20:26,598
Why don't you come out here
and show me?

1019
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:29,470
Well, here's a little lesson
from Tiger.

1020
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:30,675
Fore!

1021
01:20:46,369 --> 01:20:49,654
Yeah, he's dead.
Just about out of here.

1022
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:59,912
You really are from the projects.
You didn't hit a damn thing.

1023
01:21:01,593 --> 01:21:06,136
Now, let me show you how a shooter
never, ever misses.

1024
01:21:08,975 --> 01:21:11,846
Oh, no!

1025
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,976
Oh! Oh!

1026
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:24,186
He wasn't lying.
He didn't miss once.

1027
01:21:26,825 --> 01:21:28,735
Looks like it's the last one.

1028
01:21:28,828 --> 01:21:32,825
They're going to hang a sign over
your cell: "Over one billion served. "

1029
01:21:38,295 --> 01:21:42,423
- You never know, do you?
- Hello, Daryl.

1030
01:21:44,843 --> 01:21:47,299
Chloe.

1031
01:21:47,387 --> 01:21:49,712
Shari?

1032
01:21:49,806 --> 01:21:52,678
Sorry, Daryl.
We had to get you out of New York.

1033
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:54,725
It was our only way
to flush out T.J. McCready...

1034
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:58,063
and connect him with Charles Allsworth
and Gutierrez.

1035
01:22:01,569 --> 01:22:04,736
- So they're... they're with...
- They're all with me.

1036
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:08,736
Just one big, happy FBI family.

1037
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:12,241
I trusted you, and you...
you used me.

1038
01:22:12,329 --> 01:22:14,369
We did what we had to
to save your life.

1039
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:21,540
Daryl, baby, it's over,
all right? And we're safe.

1040
01:22:29,762 --> 01:22:34,923
- Can I hug an FBI agent?
- No. But you can hug a friend.

1041
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:37,260
That'll work.

1042
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:43,099
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1043
01:22:46,071 --> 01:22:49,072
- Take care of yourself.
- No doubt.

1044
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:54,651
You still got a phat ass.

1045
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:02,540
Freddy, I can't believe
you're from Malibu.

1046
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:05,381
Malibu High. Class of'84.

1047
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:08,632
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Thank you.

1048
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:12,799
Then I went to Hawaii. I was on the pro
surf circuit for about three years.

1049
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:16,555
Hey, hey, hey.
Your brother came in first.

1050
01:23:16,642 --> 01:23:20,641
Brother from Malibu.
Chloe, look at this.

1051
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:22,853
- Oh, what's so funny?
- Nothin'.

1052
01:23:22,941 --> 01:23:25,692
- I know you're not laughin' at my man.
- Have you seen this?

1053
01:23:25,777 --> 01:23:27,769
Yes, I have.
I think he looks cute.

1054
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:30,564
Thank you.

1055
01:23:30,656 --> 01:23:34,274
Okay, baby. Okay.
It's all right.

1056
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:41,120
Hey, uh... uh, Daryl,
you didn't touch that, did you?

1057
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,879
Oh, this?

1058
01:23:48,132 --> 01:23:51,750
Yeah, I know. It can scramble
a strike team in less than 30 seconds.

1059
01:24:02,606 --> 01:24:08,026
I don't want
nobody else but you

1060
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:11,729
Oh, see?
See what I'm talkin' about?

1061
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:16,485
I don't want
nobody else but you

1062
01:24:20,832 --> 01:24:23,915
Go in! Go in! Go in!

1063
01:24:37,641 --> 01:24:40,178
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1064
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:43,435
Don't care
if the bank was free

1065
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,224
Hey, fellas! Stand down!

1066
01:24:58,286 --> 01:25:01,037
Shake, shake
Shake, shake your body

1067
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:12,710
Shake, shake
Shake, shake your body

1068
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,876
Compliments of Freddy Tiffany.

1069
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:22,093
- Why you lie to me
- You may not know me but I know you very well

1070
01:25:22,185 --> 01:25:25,352
Now, let me tell you
that I caught you in a lie

1071
01:25:25,437 --> 01:25:27,679

1073
01:25:29,942 --> 01:25:33,192

1074
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:35,355

1075
01:25:35,448 --> 01:25:38,199

Now watch yourself
Yeah, now you're by yourself

1092
01:27:03,869 --> 01:27:06,194
I smell cologne
Damn, it's strong

1093
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:08,826
- How'd you get it on
- On your heart, girl

1094
01:27:08,915 --> 01:27:11,454
You messed up your hair
Make-up's everywhere

1095
01:27:11,543 --> 01:27:14,213
- Ooh, yeah
