00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,680
Soon Shin.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,490
Teacher.

4
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,710
- Mi Ryung.
- Teacher.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,210
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,050
Soon Shin, I need to talk to you.

7
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,450
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,410
- Get off.
- Can we talk please?

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,080
- Soon Shin...
- Let's go.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,500
- We need to talk.
- Let's go, Mi Ryung.

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,920
- I'll go get a doctor.
- Okay.

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,540
What's wrong with you, Mi Ryung?
Get your head straight.

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,280
What were you going to say to her?

14
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,120
You said her name is Kyung Sook, right?

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,400
You didn't throw away that picture yet?

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,530
You said her name is Kyung Sook, right?

17
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,550
Since when did they know each other?

18
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,600
Why are you asking me that
this early in the morning?

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,560
You said she chased him.
Didn't they date each other?

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,150
How serious was the relationship?

21
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,940
What are you doing all of a sudden?

22
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,270
You said you weren't jealous
of her the other day.

23
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm not jealous.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,260
Mother, tell me the details.

25
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,790
Jeong Ae.

26
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,700
Have a seat there.

27
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,850
What is it?

28
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,220
Is Soon Shin's birth mother Kyung Sook?

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,160
She is.

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,260
No.

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,630
Why are you hiding it from me?

32
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,570
Just tell me.
She is, isn't she?

33
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,170
I said no.

34
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,620
I don't want you to
talk about this anymore.

35
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,910
I am okay now.

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,890
I don't care if that's
Kyung Sook or whoever now.

37
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,460
So don't be so curious about it.

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,580
- Jeong Ae.
- Mother, please.

39
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm home.

40
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,640
Were you talking about important stuff?

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,120
No. It's nothing.

42
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,730
<i>[Song Mi Ryung]</i>

43
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,750
Soon Shin.

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,280
I guess she felt sorry for me.

45
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,080
What were you doing, Mr. Hwang?
Why didn't you pick her up early?

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
This could have been bad.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
- I...
- What else were you doing?

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,630
She was carried to a hospital by Soon Shin.
Does that even make sense?

49
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,940
I'll keep my eye on her.

50
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,780
Thank you, Yeon Ah. You can leave now.
You must be busy.

51
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,070
No. Don't mention it.

52
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,770
I want to stay here tonight. I'm going to
go home when I see you're getting better.

53
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,500
It's okay. I'm all better now.
It was just stomach cramps.

54
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,650
Are you kidding me?
You still look pale.

55
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,780
I said I'm okay.
You can leave.

56
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,060
Why don't you go upstairs and rest?

57
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,250
I said I'm okay!

58
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,220
I want to be alone.
Please go home. Please.

59
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,060
Mom...

60
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,430
What are you doing today?

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,980
What? I'm not doing
anything special. Why?

62
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,620
Then come to the
mineral spring with me.

63
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,220
I haven't done any exercise
in a long time.

64
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,210
Don't say no to that. Let's go take
a walk and get some fresh air.

65
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,870
You also need some exercise.

66
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,550
Grandma, can I join you too? No.
How about we all go together?

67
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,910
Aunt Soon Shin, I have to go to class.

68
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,770
I'm sorry. I have to go work.
I have a lot to finish.

69
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,100
Yeah. I know you guys are busy.
Just take care of your stuff.

70
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,810
I only need Jeong Ae.

71
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,450
Grandma, let Soon Shin and me join you.

72
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll make some Kimbob.

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,540
That sounds great.

74
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,890
You're okay with that, right?

75
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,560
You said you are going work.

76
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,350
Why are you so dressed up?

77
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,440
I'm not dressed up.
Bye.

78
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,830
Are you going somewhere?

79
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,490
I'm meeting my college colleague.

80
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,370
I see.

81
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,580
I was going to ask if you want
to go to the mall with me.

82
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,500
You need some summer jackets anyway.

83
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,270
Go with Chan Mi today.

84
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,730
You can also buy what you want with this.

85
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm okay.
I don't need anything.

86
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
I have some money too.

87
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Buy some clothes for you. I make money too.
You don't have to work as hard as before.

88
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,070
Go hang out.
The weather is nice.

89
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:04,440
Thank you. You're a good son.
You're the only one who makes me happy.

90
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,250
Don't drink too much with your friends.

91
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,040
Take care of your body.

92
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,910
Yes, Mom.

93
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,590
Why are you so late?

94
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,900
Is everything okay?

95
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,750
My family will come out soon.

96
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,890
They asked me to go on a
hike but I lied to them.

97
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,340
Let's go before anybody sees us.

98
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,150
Okay.

99
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,500
Mom, give me a cup of coffee too.

100
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,140
Sure.

101
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,820
You can have this.

102
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,180
Hey, did Mi Ryung
say something to you?

103
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,120
Like what?

104
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,650
I told you how she was being
so rude to me, right?

105
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,720
Didn't she apologize about that?

106
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,300
No.

107
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,580
How could she do that?
How could she not call me to apologize?

108
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,130
That's who she is.
Just let it go.

109
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,070
Yeah, maybe I should.

110
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,260
I'm going to work.

111
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,910
You work on Sunday too?

112
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,390
- Yeah.
- Did you get a haircut?

113
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,730
Hey, Soo Jeong.

114
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,510
<i>Did you make it home safely that day?</i>

115
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,430
That day?

116
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,070
Oh, that day...

117
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,610
Yes, I did make it home safely.

118
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,790
Mi Ryung.

119
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,750
How could you do this to me?
Don't you feel sorry for me?

120
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,100
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,350
I must've been very drunk that day.

122
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,120
<i>But still.</i>

123
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,970
You shouldn't have done that. Do you know
how much I was embarrassed and humiliated?

124
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,060
Doctor Park was too.

125
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,900
I know. I'm sorry.

126
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,340
Are you really sorry?

127
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,650
Then you should've
called to appologize.

128
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,010
How could you say I spoiled my
kid in front of everybody?

129
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,440
Of course, it's not like I don't understand.

130
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,080
This is why I keep telling you
to get married.

131
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,580
If you live alone for a long time,
your mind gets twisted.

132
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,290
You should get married
and have a baby.

133
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,250
That's providence of nature.

134
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,980
But if you don't follow that,
your mind gets twisted.

135
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,310
Are you done talking, Soo Jeong?

136
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,080
<i>Don't be so upset about what I say.
I was really upset that day.</i>

137
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,380
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,150
Just like you said,
my mind gets twisted.

139
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,250
You happy now?

140
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,330
Who was it, Mom?

141
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,540
What made her so change like this?
Honey, what's wrong with her?

142
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,460
It was Mrs. Song, wasn't it?

143
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,690
Oh my God.
Her mind is getting sicker.

144
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,570
You are so harsh on her.

145
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,930
What did I do?

146
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,210
I can't tell if you're making
fun of her or comforting her.

147
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,140
Oh my.
How could you say that?

148
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,800
Find out what I meant.

149
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,830
Hey, Yi Jung.
What does that mean?

150
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,610
I think he's taking her side.

151
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,370
What?

152
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,530
Oh my God,
you prepared food by yourself?

153
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm going out for a walk.

154
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,080
Okay, ma'am.

155
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,140
Don't you feel great being outside,
Grandma?

156
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,910
Yeah.

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,120
This place reminds me of Dad.

158
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,830
I wish Dad was here with us now.

159
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,180
Yeah. Your dad came here with you a lot.

160
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,410
He took care of you more than anybody.

161
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,180
- I didn't understand why he did that but now..
- Mother...

162
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,290
Jeong Ae, Chang Hoon is a bad son.

163
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,990
How could he leave us like that?

164
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,870
We all miss him a lot.

165
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,750
Grandma...

166
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,940
She just misses Dad a lot.

167
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,630
Grandma, have some fruit.

168
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm okay. You eat.

169
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,680
Long time no see, Chang Hoon.

170
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,330
Long time no see.

171
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,720
You live in this neighborhood?

172
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,470
Yeah.

173
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,580
What are you doing here?

174
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,200
I also live in this neighborhood.
I just moved here.

175
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,290
I see.

176
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,780
It's nice seeing you.

177
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,570
I'm out of breath.

178
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,180
Do you want to take a rest?

179
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,280
No. Let's keep going.

180
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,780
Have some water.

181
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,590
Sure.

182
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,830
Grandma, you've gotten so old now.
You went on hikes with us sometimes last year.

183
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm healthier than other women my age.

184
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,710
You're right.

185
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,590
The air is so fresh here.

186
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Teacher Song.

187
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,940
Who is she?

188
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,860
She's Teacher Song Mi Ryung.

189
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,500
An actress.
She taught me acting.

190
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,350
Are you feeling better?

191
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,710
Yes, I'm better.

192
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,330
Bye.

193
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,060
That's Song Mi Ryung?

194
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,150
Yeah. She lives in the upper town.

195
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,490
- Mom, let's go.
- Okay.

196
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,260
Let's go.

197
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,970
Mi Ryung.

198
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,530
Why are you so surprised?

199
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,920
Il Do, put this house up for sale.

200
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,140
What?

201
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,110
Put this house up for sale right now.
I'm moving out.

202
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,080
Why so sudden?
Did something happen?

203
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,470
Mom, are you okay?

204
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,330
Yeah.

205
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,490
I didn't know she lives
in this neighborhood.

206
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,480
What a small world.

207
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Don't tell Grandma about this.
There's nothing for her to know.

208
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,580
Don't tell her.
Understand?

209
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,900
Give me a glass of water too.

210
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,790
Jeong Ae, the woman we saw...

211
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:50,500
Oh my God, I totally forgot to do the laundry.
What was I thinking?

212
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,370
I'll talk to you later.

213
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,840
Aren't you hungry?
Are you not going to eat?

214
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,130
What?

215
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,400
What are thinking about?

216
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,430
Nothing.

217
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,640
- Isn't this delicious?
- Yeah, it is.

218
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,140
- Yoo Shin.
- Yes?

219
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,950
Can we just tell our family about us?

220
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,030
Did you forget the rules? We break up
the moment our families find out about us.

221
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,970
I know,
but we can't avoid them forever.

222
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,350
And it's tiring to hide this from out families.

223
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,620
It will get more tiring if they know.

224
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,570
Yon know how it is
between your mom and I.

225
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,840
She's not going to stand it
if she finds out we're dating.

226
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,150
Mom isn't that bad.

227
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,030
If you two try to understand each other...

228
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,010
Do you know what she said to
me at your family restaurant?

229
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,460
Did something happen?

230
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,390
Never mind.
I would rather not tell you.

231
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,230
By the way, who did you meet that day?

232
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,390
- What?
- That day.

233
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,210
You didn't even answer my call.

234
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,590
My director invited me to his house.

235
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,360
Why did he invite you to his house?

236
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,280
We just had dinner.

237
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,370
Drink the coffee before it gets cold.

238
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,900
I'm home.

239
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,130
Hey, Mom.

240
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,050
How was the hike?
Was it okay?

241
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,610
Yeah.
Go take a rest.

242
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,530
Hey.

243
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,650
Did something happen while hiking?

244
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,900
Nothing happened except
we ran into Teacher Song.

245
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,480
Teacher Song?
You mean Song Mi Ryung?

246
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,680
Yeah, we ran into each other.

247
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,580
What does that matter to Mom
that she looks so depressed?

248
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,400
What's wrong with Mom?

249
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,460
She looks really depressed.

250
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,090
How is Song Mi Ryung?
Is she pretty?

251
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,110
She is.

252
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,680
I think she got depressed because
Song Mi Ryung is pretty.

253
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,290
That's not true.

254
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,820
Mom is so much prettier.

255
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,470
I know you love Mom.
But that's not true.

256
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,280
Mom aged a lot
after Dad passed away.

257
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,410
And you helped her get old to
by making Mom upset.

258
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,870
She is Kyung Sook.

259
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,470
I'm sure she is Kyung Sook.

260
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,510
I need to get over this.
I have to.

261
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,740
<i>[Lee Soon Shin]</i>

262
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,710
<i>[Choi Yeon Ah]</i>

263
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,460
Teacher, I made abalone porridge for you.

264
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,850
I heard you haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

265
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,490
Please have one bite at least.

266
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,580
I said I'm okay.
Why did you make that?

267
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,440
Can't you tell me what's wrong?

268
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,080
Did something happen at the studio?

269
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,280
No.

270
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm really sad when you do this sometimes.

271
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,330
When I get sad or tired,
I tell you everything.

272
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,340
What am I to you?

273
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,810
Don't say that.
I'm just tired.

274
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,700
- Is she that sick?
- She just had severe stomach cramps.

275
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,780
She's okay now.

276
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,840
- How did you know that anyway?
- I called him.

277
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,600
He's the head of her entertainment company.
I think he doesn't care about his actresses.

278
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,810
Don't you think you're
being careless with her?

279
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,380
So what happened?

280
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,710
Are there some problems with a
movie director or something?

281
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,550
A problem I don't know about?

282
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,680
It's not that.

283
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,870
Yeon Ah, you're making it a big deal.

284
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,430
You don't look so well though.

285
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,130
I skipped my exercise and was busy with
interviews and shootings. That's all.

286
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm old, you know.

287
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,100
I didn't take care of my health.
I will from today.

288
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,960
Is that all?

289
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,080
What else would there be?

290
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,840
You must be busy.
You can leave.

291
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,160
But still...

292
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,480
You sure you canceled the
contract with the girl?

293
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,590
Who?

294
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,740
Lee Soon Shin?

295
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,780
Yeah.
Soon Shin.

296
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,770
You helped me do it.

297
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,300
Joon Ho.

298
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,200
Can we talk?

299
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,410
Thank you.

300
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,580
So what is it you want talk about?

301
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,750
You have changed, Joon Ho.

302
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,610
Why are you being so cold to me?

303
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,420
Am I?

304
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,270
Well... You've always been like this.

305
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,310
When we were dating,
you were like this.

306
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:38,490
'This guy really loves me
and only cares about me.'

307
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,250
I was sure about that.

308
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,500
But once you get mad,
you're like a different person.

309
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,070
You were so cold to me.

310
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,180
What do you want to say?

311
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm really confused now.

312
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,750
Wasn't it me you wanted
a few weeks ago?

313
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,090
You made the bet just
because so you can have me.

314
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,060
That's what I believed.

315
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,370
I honestly wanted you to win the bet.

316
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,060
Was I wrong?

317
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,030
Yeon Ah.

318
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,370
Just like you left me
because you changed...

319
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,970
I changed too.

320
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,230
I'm not stupid enough
to believe in love anymore.

321
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:58,470
Is this because of Lee Soon Shin?

322
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,320
Do you like her?

323
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,780
- No.
- Then what is it?

324
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,900
Fine. I made the bet
because of my pride.

325
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,810
I was only thinking about winning
the bet and making you lose.

326
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,230
But wh?

327
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,440
What made you change?

328
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,700
Don't you feel sorry for her?

329
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,310
We used Soon Shin for our little game.

330
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:36,670
If you were her,
how would you feel?

331
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,550
I'm just cleaning up
the mess that I made.

332
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,800
I can at least do that for her.

333
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,020
I have to go.
Bye.

334
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,620
Is that true?
Did that really happen to you?

335
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,790
I was reading it for fun, you know.

336
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,460
- Soon Shin.
- Yes?

337
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,250
Are you still attached to that?

338
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,680
Attached to this?
No.

339
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,600
I got fooled more than enough.
I'm not attached to this at all.

340
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,350
Never ever.

341
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,880
I'm taking a shower.

342
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,860
No matter how hard I think,
this isn't right.

343
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,850
We promised that if
the business goes well

344
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,030
we're going to prepare for the GED so I can go to
college for me and you can finish high school.

345
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,760
I don't remember that.

346
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,870
Now you remember?

347
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,080
That hurts, man.

348
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,350
It's supposed to hurt.

349
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,100
Wait here.

350
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,700
You came to buy some books?

351
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,010
Yes.

352
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,460
You read this kind of book?

353
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,490
No. I'm reading it for translation.

354
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,090
- Translation?
- Yes.

355
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,680
You must be so good at English.

356
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,510
So you can read this book as
if you read a Korean book?

357
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,460
No, no.
I'm not that good.

358
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,060
You have to be good to translate this.

359
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,490
The English words I know are...

360
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:58,310
Thank you. I'm sorry. Big Bang. Top. Sister.
And mother, father, gentleman.

361
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,250
That's it.

362
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,290
<i>[GED for College]</i>

363
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,250
This isn't my book.
When I was in a jail... No, no, no.

364
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,250
- I meant the bakery...
- Hey, dude.

365
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm leaving.

366
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,530
Good luck on the GED.

367
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,660
Fighting!
Fighting GED.

368
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,140
Actually...

369
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,150
I couldn't get into college.

370
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,160
Because my family was poor.

371
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,890
My parents passed away
when I was little.

372
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,000
And I was raised by my grandma.

373
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,490
Her one and only wish was
to see me go to college.

374
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:20,650
I couldn't fulfill her wish before she died.

375
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:28,570
Since my business is going well,
I just want to try.

376
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,240
Your grandmother will
be so happy in Heaven.

377
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,790
I'm...

378
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,230
I'm Seo Jin Wook.

379
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,610
Pardon?

380
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:54,310
Come to think of it, you don't
even know my name yet.

381
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,400
I'm Lee Hye Shin.

382
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,660
I see. Hye Shin.

383
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,970
Grandma, Jin Wook is starting to study.

384
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm all grown up now.

385
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,480
You should've waited for me.

386
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,190
You left me too quickly.

387
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,200
I miss you.

388
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:39,530
<i>Please welcome Son Mi Ryung
and Choi Yeon Ah.</i>

389
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,810
What a brazen woman...

390
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,650
- How long have you been there?
- Go back to that chanel.

391
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,780
What?

392
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,070
I want to take a look at that woman.

393
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,800
Go back to that channel.

394
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,520
Mother...

395
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,610
You don't have to hide it from me.
Why are you trying to hide this from me?

396
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,990
What am I hiding from you?
I'm not hiding anything from you.

397
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,730
Yeah, I understand how you feel.

398
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,380
You don't have to tell me.

399
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,230
I understand.

400
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,150
Where are you going?

401
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,220
Where do you think I'm going?
I'm going to go water the garden.

402
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,110
Hello...

403
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,230
Mrs. Lee, what are you doing here?

404
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,320
Have a seat over there.

405
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,230
S-sure.

406
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,850
You shouldn't do this to me.

407
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,770
Pardon?
What are you talking about?

408
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,370
Soon Shin is Kyung Sook's daughter,
isn't she?

409
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,780
What?

410
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,800
What does Kyung Sook do for living?

411
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,160
Tell me where and what she does.

412
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,920
I know you know everything,
but you're hiding it from me.

413
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,590
Mrs. Lee...

414
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,950
Song Mi Ryung is Kyung Sook,
isn't she?

415
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,130
She is...

416
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,200
No, Mrs. Lee.
It's not that. It's...

417
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,890
The beacon does not shine on its own base.

418
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,350
I'm home.

419
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,910
Hey.

420
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,720
Hello.

421
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,530
Long time no see, Chan Mi.

422
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,560
What are you doing here?

423
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,910
Is everything okay?

424
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,390
She came to visit me.
That's all.

425
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,460
Mrs. Lee, would you like Sprite?

426
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,500
Are you making tea?
Make some ginger tea for Grandma.

427
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,760
She's not home.

428
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,620
Where did she go?

429
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,260
Hello?

430
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,420
<i>Hi, Mrs. Lee.
It's Shin Joon Ho.</i>

431
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,150
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

432
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,340
What is it?

433
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,120
Have a seat, please.

434
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,810
How have you been?

435
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,600
Good.

436
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,830
Is Soon Shin doing well?

437
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,050
Yes, she's doing well.

438
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,450
I thought we were done talking about this.

439
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,810
Yes, you're right.

440
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,850
I'm sorry for making you worry
about your daughter.

441
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:29,870
I just want to ask you one last favor.

442
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,450
What favor?

443
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:40,500
Soon Shin was so happy when
she was learning acting.

444
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,980
I'm positive about that.

445
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,930
I think she shouldn't give up on what
she wants just because of me.

446
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,620
Mrs. Lee, please help her act again.

447
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,430
I admit that I wasn't trustworthy.

448
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:07,720
Help her go to a different agency
and keep learning how to act.

449
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,480
She will do just fine.

450
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,830
Mother, you must be hungry.
I'll go prepare dinner.

451
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,740
You! Why didn't you tell
me about this earlier?

452
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,100
Follow me.

453
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,130
I heard everything.

454
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,230
I've given it a lot of thought,
and I think it's Kyeong Sook.

455
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,750
Where did you hear that?

456
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:04,800
That was why she was so crazy
about being an actress?

457
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,830
Blood sure is thicker than water.

458
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,570
Now everything makes sense to me.

459
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,070
How did you go through this
by yourself?

460
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:32,640
You must've been so painful
to go through this.

461
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,600
Mother...

462
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,060
Please let's just pretend
none of this happened.

463
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,990
I have been through this already.

464
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,280
I'm okay now.

465
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,870
I even talked to that woman.

466
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,360
You met her?

467
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,040
You met Kyung Sook?

468
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,520
Yeah. We talked and it's all done.

469
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,180
She doesn't want Soon Shin back.

470
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,200
She told me to raise her.

471
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,980
What?

472
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,910
She really said that?

473
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,110
Yeah.

474
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,020
She's so shameless.
She's so spiteful.

475
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,250
You should've pulled out
her hair or something.

476
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:25,580
Wait. I'm going to go
talk to that bitch.

477
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,760
Please don't do that.

478
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,880
Don't do that?
Aren't you mad?

479
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,630
Aren't you upset?

480
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:39,970
I'm going to go talk
to her and scold her.

481
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,970
Mother, I told you it's all over.

482
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:48,710
If Soon Shin finds out about this,
things will be more complicated.

483
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:54,690
Mother, I really want to forget about this.

484
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,740
Chang Hoon...

485
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:13,100
You caused all these problems
and then left us?

486
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

487
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,370
- Hi.
- There you are.

488
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,330
- Boss.
- Yes?

489
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,870
I'm working only until this week.

490
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,500
I'm done training the new waitress.

491
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,210
I heard that.

492
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,950
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

493
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,450
The weather is nice.
Do you want to get some coffee?

494
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,880
The weather is really nice.
Do you want to go to a park?

495
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,590
Sure.

496
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,610
So what's your plan for the future?

497
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,150
I don't know.
I'm going keep looking.

498
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,670
Then how about you keep working here
until you find what you want to do?

499
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,560
Actually, I want to do that too.

500
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,020
But if I keep coming here, I'll be attached
to this whole acting thing. I feel so small.

501
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,890
Why do you think like that?
Don't feel small.

502
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,460
You're the best, Boss.

503
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:57,140
You know what, Soon Shin?
I wish you could keep acting.

504
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,360
What?

505
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,750
You were so pretty while doing that.

506
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,880
When?

507
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,690
When you were preparing for the audition.
You looked so happy.

508
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,780
You were glowing and pretty.

509
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,640
Try to read your heart.

510
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,980
Think of what can really
make your heart beat.

511
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,670
I think there's only one way
to find the right answer.

512
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,200
It's your heart.
See if your heart is beating.

513
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:48,900
Cheer up! That's your strength. No matter
what you go through, you're always cheerful.

514
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,500
An iron will, Lee Soon Shin.

515
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,470
Thank you, Boss.

516
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,130
Let's go.

517
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,260
I don't care about her anymore.
It's all over now.

518
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,470
I did what I could do for her.

519
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:27,520
She smiles at everybody.

520
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,170
She laughs easily.

521
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,020
- Something bad happened.
- What is it again?

522
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,590
- It's about Song Mi Ryung.
- What is it?

523
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,210
You remember her rumor that
might have been an issue?

524
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,190
Rumor?

525
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,240
They're trying to make a big
issue out of that again.

526
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,090
They said her past is all
fake and she had a daughter.

527
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,460
What?

528
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,680
I thought the rumor faded away.

529
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,630
I think someone is writing
a follow-up story.

530
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,540
What should we do?

531
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,900
Where's Mr. Hwang?

532
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,400
What do you want, Reporter Park?

533
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:14,340
What do I want?
There's nothing I want.

534
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,990
Reporter Park, I'll do anything.
I'll do everything you want.

535
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,480
Just tell me.

536
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,710
Don't do this.
I don't work like this.

537
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:29,070
Then why are you so obsessed with this?

538
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,130
Why in the world are you doing this?

539
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:38,470
What's so good about ostracizing her?

540
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,640
You...

541
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,180
Give me one second, Reporter Park.

542
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,840
Hi, Mr. Shin.

543
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,850
Yes, yes.

544
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,190
I'm sorry.
I have another appointment.

545
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,830
Wait.

546
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,620
Reporter Park. Wait!

547
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,020
Here comes the chicken.
Enjoy.

548
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,650
Hello, Mrs. Lee?

549
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,450
<i>Where's Song Mi Ryung's house?</i>

550
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,920
What?

551
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,540
<i>Tell me. Where is it?</i>

552
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,860
Are you going to go see her?

553
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,690
Excuse me.
Let me ask you something.

554
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,270
Sure.

555
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,600
I heard Song Mi Ryung
lives around here.

556
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,250
Do you know where she lives?

557
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,870
Mother.

558
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,020
Where did she go?

559
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,810
Bok Man?

560
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,610
<i>Is Mrs. Lee home?</i>

561
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,430
No. She was home a second ago.
But she's not now.

562
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,750
<i>This isn't good. I think she's
on her way to see Kyung Sook.</i>

563
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,030
What?

564
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,520
You have a visitor.

565
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,070
- Who?
- She said she's Soon Shin's grandmother.

566
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,320
What?

567
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,280
Long time no see, Kyung Sook.

568
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,460
You live in a nice house.

569
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,770
It's such a nice house.

570
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
Have a seat.

571
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,610
- You can go home.
- Okay.

572
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,740
Kyung Sook,
you shouldn't have done that.

573
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,090
Don't call me like that.

574
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,770
I'm Song Mi Ryung.

575
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,160
Why are you to tell me to do that?

576
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,320
To me, you're Kyung Sook.

577
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,660
Kim Kyung Sook.

578
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,940
Where are you going at this late hour?

579
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,120
Hye Shin, you should come with me.

580
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,220
Where?

581
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,190
Your grandmother went to
see Song Mi Ryung.

582
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,220
What?

583
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,540
Let's go.

584
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,350
Is there anything you want
to say to me now?

585
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,620
What do you mean?

586
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,480
You haven't changed at all.

587
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,490
You're as brazen as before.

588
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,300
Are you even a human being?

589
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,050
How the hell could a human
do a thing like this?

590
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,830
What do you mean?
What did I do?

591
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,070
Do you know what problem
you caused my family?

592
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:24,380
Do you know what my daughter-in-law
had to go through because of you?

593
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,620
How am I supposed to know?

594
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:32,320
That was your daughter.

595
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,050
You left her with my family.
How could you even live with that?

596
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,770
Aren't you ashamed of showing yourself
in front of everybody as an actress?

597
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,260
Well... I guess you could do that
because you've lived such a lowly life.

598
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,590
You probably don't know
what's right and wrong.

599
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,370
Watch your mouth.

600
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:58,470
Tell me everything from the beginning.
I know Chang Hoon is not that type of person.

601
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,590
He didn't even blink his eyes at you.

602
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,870
What happened?

603
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:12,330
You still fall at his feet,
just like the old times.

604
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,110
Why do you always think
whatever you want?

605
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,140
Who was clinging to whom?

606
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,230
You don't know anything.

607
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,750
What?

608
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,900
You think it's unfair that your
family raised my daughter?

609
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,060
Then why didn't you approve of
me and Chang Hoon's marriage?

610
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,710
I have nothing to say to you.

611
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,080
I didn't tell him to raise my daughter.

612
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,700
That's what Chang Hoon and his wife decided.

613
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,450
I didn't tell him to do that.

614
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,180
If you came here just to ask you
that question, please leave.

615
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,280
How dare you come to my place without my
permission? Do you even know who I am?

616
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,500
Kyung Sook...

617
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,410
I'm not Kim Kyung Sook.

618
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:02,780
Didn't you hear from your daughter-in-law?
I told her to think that none of this happened.

619
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,040
- You're such a bitch.
- Don't swear to me! How dare you?

620
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:14,170
You said I live a lowly life. I don't think
you have the right to say that.

621
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,360
Il Do, show her the door.

622
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,490
I think this old bag lost her way.

623
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,990
What are you doing?

624
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,880
How could you do this to me?

625
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,020
Get off!

626
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,520
Get off!

627
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,160
You're a bitch!

628
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,790
- Mother!
- Grandma!

629
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,180
I'm sorry, Jeong Ae.

630
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,120
I'm so sorry.

631
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:26,370
My son did what he wasn't supposed to.

632
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,320
I'm sorry.

633
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,330
She's such a bitch!
A bad bitch.

634
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,420
She didn't even say sorry.

635
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,670
Mother.

636
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,840
Why did you go there?

637
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,790
Stop drinking.

638
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,230
Il Do, that old bag thinks
I'm still Kim Kyung Sook.

639
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:00,270
How dare she treat me like this?

640
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,200
Calm down.

641
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,810
- Go upstairs and rest.
- Who told them to raise her?

642
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,560
Who told them to do that?

643
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,540
Get up.

644
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:18,540
If she's so upset about this,
should I take her back?

645
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,370
She's my daughter.
I can take her back.

646
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,850
- Are you crazy?
- Why not? You think I can't?

647
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:27,030
Don't even say that.
Don't even think about it.

648
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:31,660
Don't you know what situation you are in?

649
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,220
If this is exposed to the public,
what do you think it's going happen to you?

650
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,990
What's going to happen to me?

651
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,730
Mi Ryung.

652
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,780
Aren't you afraid of Soon Shin's father?

653
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,500
You think you can keep in touch
with her family?

654
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,920
What have I done wrong?
What did I do? Tell me.

655
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,790
People are going to find
out eventually anyway.

656
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:03,030
Even that old bag knows about this.
This isn't a secret anymore.

657
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,960
Wake up. You're going to lose
everything you have then.

658
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,800
I'm not going to lose anything.

659
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,490
I'm going to take her back from that family.

660
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:16,470
Don't stop me.
I'm going to take her back!

661
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,480
