1
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:14,238
What I'd like to do today is
get your version of what happened.

2
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:17,831
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,040
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

4
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:25,122
Egg Shen, bus driver.

5
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,886
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

6
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:36,802
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

7
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:42,933
Thank you.
Now, before we get to the meat of this thing,

8
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:46,359
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

9
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,197
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

10
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:52,982
- Oh, God. Will you leave him alone?
- Mr Shen, please.

11
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:59,365
You could be in a great deal of trouble. Half
a city block explodes in a ball of green flame.

12
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,495
Green flame! All hell is breaking loose here.

13
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,159
And there are people
who say you're involved,

14
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:10,297
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

15
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:15,178
- Now, if you’re protecting Jack Burton...
- You leave Jack Burton alone!

16
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:20,352
We are in his debt. He showed great courage.

17
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:28,480
OK.

18
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:32,319
But if I'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

19
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:34,863
that still don't make any sense to me.

20
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:37,029
Like...

21
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:40,077
do you really believe in magic?

22
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,830
You mean Chinese black magic?

23
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,920
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

24
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:52,546
Are you still serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as well, I suppose?

25
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:55,803
Sure. And sorcery.

26
00:01:56,974 --> 00:02:02,430
And I suppose that you expect me
to believe in sorcery as well?

27
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,929
- Of course.
- Why?

28
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,350
Because it's real.

29
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,520
How can I know that, Mr Shen?

30
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:13,692
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

31
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,987
Please.

32
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:25,287
See? That was nothing.

33
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,581
But that's how it always begins.

34
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,045
Very small.

35
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,741
This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express
and I'm talkin' to whoever's listen in'.

36
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,988
It's like I told my last wife.

37
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,118
I says "Honey,
I never drive faster than I can see."

38
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,160
"Besides that, it's all in the reflexes."

39
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:21,300
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

40
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,310
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

41
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,313
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom wall,

42
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:31,397
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you’ve paid your dues,

43
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:37,441
you just stare that big sucker back in the eye
and remember what Jack Burton always says.

44
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:42,529
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Yes, sir, the cheque is in the mail."

45
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:05,009
Well, you see, I'm not sayin' that I've been
everywhere and I've done everything.

46
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:09,100
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing planet we live on here,

47
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:14,565
and a man would have to be some kinda fool
to think we're all alone in this universe.

48
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,731
I can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!

49
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,608
All right, even! Another even! Come on!

50
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,653
You want one more? All right!

51
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,369
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

52
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,327
Learn how to play some fan-tan here,
buddy-boy!

53
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,711
Three!

54
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,688
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I tell ya?

55
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,744
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? In English?

56
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,578
Something about beginner's luck.
It doesn't translate. But he quits.

57
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:37,704
He quits? What is this? It's a brand-new day
and he's still got 100 bucks in his pocket.

58
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:42,673
I'm not gonna complain, because I'll bet
I'd have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

59
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,846
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time I'm down here,

60
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:49,975
you'll gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the hell happened.

61
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,516
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.

62
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:53,766
No!

63
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,566
Not next time. Now.

64
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,945
Is this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

65
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,235
I thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

66
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,945
was a couple old friends,
both of us Californians.

67
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,612
Shit, Wang. It's only a game.

68
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,127
Nothin' or double.

69
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,299
This knife cuts this bottle in half.

70
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,583
- Nothin' or double.
- Bullshit.

71
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,252
- Nothin' or double.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

72
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,433
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.

73
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,725
1,148, Jack.

74
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:42,652
OK. But not that bottle.

75
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:46,906
This bottle.

76
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,495
OK.

77
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,452
You're outta your mind, Wang. God bless ya!

78
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:11,549
- It's all in the reflexes.
- It always works at home.

79
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:17,394
Have me over for dinner some year and prove
it. In the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

80
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,352
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

81
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:25,732
- I'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?
- You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

82
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:30,698
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
I don't got that kind of money on me.

83
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:33,740
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

84
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:36,162
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

85
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,665
I do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

86
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,327
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

87
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:45,755
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- If need be.

88
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,962
- I'll follow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

89
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:55,054
- It reminds me of an old Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in.

90
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:59,557
- You were gonna follow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

91
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:03,309
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girl. I don't wanna talk about it.

92
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,690
- A girl? Where from?
- Peking.

93
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,480
This is a big day in my life. I should
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

94
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:13,362
A girl from China? All right, I never done that.

95
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:18,246
I picked up girls from everywhere else,
but never from China. Is she pretty?

96
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,002
- I'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

97
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:27,335
I've known her since we were kids.
I haven't seen her in five years.

98
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:30,179
I came here alone.
I worked my fingers till they bled.

99
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,339
Before you knew me, I slept on the floor.

100
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:35,764
I saved every nickel to bring her here
because I love her so much.

101
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:41,972
I can't eat, sleep or think properly without her
any more. She'll put my whole life in order.

102
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,770
Boy, listen to me. Real tough guy.

103
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,980
You sound a little nervous, pal.

104
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:53,987
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

105
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:06,789
Flightnumber26 has just arrived
at gate number seven.

106
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,384
Whoa. Who is that?

107
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,518
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

108
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:23,395
- How can you tell from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

109
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:27,187
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

110
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,069
Trouble, huh?

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,121
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- Absolutely not.

112
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:49,625
- Would you consider jumping right into...
- Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

113
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:54,295
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

114
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,803
- It's Miller time.
- You know what I say when it's Miller time?

115
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,307
Wait a minute!

116
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,770
- Don't!
- Don't what?

117
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:10,479
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

118
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,272
Tara!

119
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:52,143
Miao Yin!

120
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:03,577
Excuse me.

121
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:13,508
Let's you and me have a little talk, friend.

122
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,301
What?

123
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,426
Where'd you get that?

124
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,139
Wait a minute, pal.

125
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,312
Get that one!

126
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,609
Come on, Jack!

127
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:58,969
Where?

128
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:02,380
Call the cops!

129
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,738
Son of a bitch must pay!

130
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:33,630
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girl?

131
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:38,176
You tell me! How come it's not safe to walk
in Central Park or to give a stranger a lift?

132
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:43,800
- Because the world's full of crazy people.
- The American girl knew something was up.

133
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,132
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.

134
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,181
She's a what? Oh, come on!

135
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:53,474
- What the hell...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

136
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,774
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

137
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,901
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

138
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:08,876
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

139
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,627
Sit back and enjoy yourselves, see?

140
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,418
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

141
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,008
We call Gum Shan - Mountain of Gold, see?

142
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:24,299
Leaving behind their wives and children.

143
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:28,971
Working for years to complete
the transcontinental railroad,

144
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:33,391
saving all their pennies.
And then they sent for their families

145
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:37,527
to help build this beautiful Chinatown
you see outside your window

146
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:40,648
this fine warm day.

147
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:13,813
- Go right, down that alley. Lords of Death!
- What alley?

148
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,772
Go right! Now!

149
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:39,922
- Where the hell are we?
- Come on, Jack.

150
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:46,170
Excuse me, ma'am.
I don't suppose you saw a...

151
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,226
No.

152
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:54,518
Keep moving.

153
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,041
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeral.

154
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:27,800
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

155
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,839
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

156
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:36,635
Maybe we should try a different alley.
What do you say?

157
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,360
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

158
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,988
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?

159
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,034
Holy shit!

160
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:53,410
These guys are animals, Jack.

161
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:28,123
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.

162
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:30,128
A what?

163
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,427
Don't make a sound.

164
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:42,766
Who's that?

165
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,466
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

166
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:14,978
Jack!

167
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:22,316
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

168
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:42,004
- Don't look, Jack!
- I already did.

169
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:44,174
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

170
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:48,216
- I can't see!
- It's OK. It's only temporary. Over here.

171
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,723
Bend over.

172
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:55,225
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,901
I ran straight through him, Wang.
How the hell did I do that?

174
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:01,563
- You didn't. It only appeared that way.
- Right!

175
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:06,654
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, I'm goin' home. Keep your money.

176
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,906
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

177
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,332
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

178
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,416
- My truck!
- Forget it!

179
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,899
Lords of Death controlled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

180
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:47,488
Great! Who wiped out all those
yellow turbans? Those guys were winning.

181
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:55,660
He says it was the Storms. The Three Storms.

182
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:58,127
Three guys did all that? Listen.

183
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:02,130
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

184
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,465
Fast!

185
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,646
Lucky us. We made it.

186
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:21,602
- All right, where's my truck? I'm outta here.
- Isn't your truck insured?

187
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,235
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it later.

188
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:27,859
- Smart man calls the cops.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

189
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:28,949
So do I!

190
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:36,207
Mutual Fidelity Insurers of Sacramento.

191
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:40,543
Well, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
I pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

192
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:46,672
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

193
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:51,393
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

194
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:56,436
I don't know what that means. All I know is,
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

195
00:24:56,524 --> 00:25:01,980
in the middle of an alley, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

196
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,152
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

197
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,825
- with light comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, please.

198
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:14,786
- When did this happen?
- It didn't, not like he says.

199
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:20,748
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. Tall guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

200
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,413
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

201
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:27,635
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

202
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:32,134
I'm gonna tell you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?

203
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:35,762
All right, look. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

204
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:39,354
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

205
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:42,859
- Eddie's the new maît re d' here.
- And a whole lot more.

206
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:46,529
Well, I don't know my policy number.
It's in the glove compartment.

207
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:49,451
Just look under B-U-R-T-O-N, will ya?

208
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:52,157
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

209
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:55,907
Boy. The guy you always told me about.

210
00:25:56,876 --> 00:26:00,624
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like hell!

211
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:02,919
Hello. Hello?

212
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,584
Oh, Christ!

213
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:07,760
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stole it after you ran away.

214
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:11,546
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

215
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,013
- We'll find it for you.
- Damn right you will.

216
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:18,978
And my money. And time is money to a guy
like me. And your phone is dead, by the way.

217
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:24,521
- How do you think I feel? I lost a whole girl!
- The Lords of Death were only on a joyride.

218
00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:26,770
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

219
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:30,482
They just wanted a girl to sell
and Miao Yin got in the way.

220
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:33,068
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

221
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:37,659
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

222
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:40,123
- That was his funeral.
- It was a war, Eddie.

223
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:44,708
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's only me, Gracie Law.

224
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,962
Great.

225
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:49,301
Just passing the neighbourhood
on a dark and stormy night?

226
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:52,424
- This is my neighbourhood.
- Sure it was a war.

227
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:56,845
And anybody that showed up was gonna join
Lem Lee in the hell of being cut to pieces.

228
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:59,641
- Hell of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta hells.

229
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:04,108
- And what the hell is Gracie Law doing here?
- She can't get enough of me.

230
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:06,815
He wishes. Look, you know me.

231
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:10,321
I'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

232
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:12,697
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

233
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:16,653
But I have it on good advice that the punks
that jumped me and took his truck,

234
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:20,911
they took the girl they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick sale. Who was she?

235
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:25,498
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

236
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,209
If we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

237
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:32,055
- violence out of the question...
- Hold it! Slow down.

238
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,595
- I'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

239
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:38,135
Jack, listen. I need more of your help.
I can't pay you today, OK?

240
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,719
- Shit.
- How can I? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

241
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:45,690
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

242
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,398
It's like leather bucket seats: double the price.

243
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:53,316
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

244
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,286
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomised.

245
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:01,125
He becomes the dream.

246
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,996
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.

247
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,463
Please, help me.

248
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:07,914
I got a great idea.

249
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,846
- Relax.
- I am relaxed.

250
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:26,440
Look, this is as far as I go,
because I'm a dead giveaway, see?

251
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:30,477
I'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

252
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:33,242
- Not while I'm around.
- It's all up to you now, Jack.

253
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:35,484
My destiny rests in your capable hands.

254
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:38,198
- I'll do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

255
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:39,913
- I'll try.
- Look stupid.

256
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,826
He does.

257
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:45,998
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

258
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:49,922
The cab driver said... He told me that I could...

259
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:53,258
Well, that the White Tiger would...

260
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:56,386
Just a minute, please.

261
00:29:02,437 --> 00:29:06,898
Excuse me for a second, guys.
I think I know that car.

262
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,943
What's she doing now?

263
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:15,989
Strange girl.

264
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,578
That building there. The White Tiger.

265
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,583
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I will, if we have to.

266
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:31,005
I'll go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

267
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:35,634
Just sit tight. We've got one of our best men
inside right now, stirring the pot.

268
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:56,116
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

269
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,533
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

270
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,826
I mean, it's not deductible, is it?

271
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:07,078
Mrs O'Toole will take care of your needs.

272
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:09,292
Boy, I wish these were in colour.

273
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:13,127
Because what I really am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

274
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:15,838
And price is no object, Mrs O'Toole.

275
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:19,971
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

276
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:22,845
Chinese girls do not come with green eyes.

277
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:44,116
- Too long. Let's go in.
- It's only been ten minutes.

278
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,282
Give the guy a chance.

279
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,540
- So how long you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

280
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:54,547
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

281
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:59,710
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

282
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:03,506
Maybe. Take your tie off, please.

283
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,804
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

284
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:12,399
Holy shit!

285
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:49,874
Green explosions? People flyin' in and out?
That was not real. I wanna talk to the cops.

286
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:52,910
I want my truck back.
Now where the hell am I?

287
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:56,288
- My office. Sit down.
- You sleep in your office?

288
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,256
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

289
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:05,176
- Yeah, sort of. It's hard to explain.
- Try real hard.

290
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:08,181
If the Storms have Miao Yin,
there's one place they'd go.

291
00:33:08,266 --> 00:33:12,346
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

292
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:15,689
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

293
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,982
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

294
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,651
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

295
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:24,194
Who the hell are you, anyway?

296
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:27,782
I'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the Berkeley People’s Herald.

297
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,283
I've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

298
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:37,285
It's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

299
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,298
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. I'm going!

300
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:42,708
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

301
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,755
It's OK, Tara. You can go back to sleep.

302
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:48,171
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

303
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:52,809
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civil rights, making sure she gets a chance.

304
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,809
This is just so shocking. I mean,
I must just be so monumentally naive.

305
00:33:56,899 --> 00:33:59,141
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...

306
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:02,401
Wait a minute! I'm a reasonable guy,

307
00:34:02,488 --> 00:34:05,061
but I've experienced
some unreasonable things.

308
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:08,941
- It depends on how you look at it.
- The hell it does! So somebody

309
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:11,409
- tell me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

310
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:13,656
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

311
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,662
- I'm going now, alone if I have to!
- Where? It's pouring out.

312
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:24,422
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

313
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,294
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in like...

314
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,016
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

315
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:36,020
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- I'd go with you...

316
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:39,023
I know. There's a problem with your face.

317
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:43,187
OK! You people sit tight,
hold the fort and keep the home fires burning.

318
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,814
If we're not back by dawn, call the president.

319
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:02,212
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. You ready, Jack?

320
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:04,374
I was born ready.

321
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:10,630
I love working nights.

322
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,717
Don't get up. Phone company.

323
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,261
All right, boys, where's the main panel?
Probably through here.

324
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,154
Wang.

325
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:39,491
Good work, Jack.
I think they actually fell for it.

326
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:46,250
Well, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

327
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:50,505
- I'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

328
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:57,060
What does that say?

329
00:35:57,144 --> 00:36:00,062
- Hell of boiling oil.
- You're kidding!

330
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:02,437
Yeah, I am. It says "Keep out."

331
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,320
We've got to do something!

332
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,115
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

333
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:24,331
- I don't think I've had the pleasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

334
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,995
Egg's kind of our local authority on Lo Pan.

335
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:29,665
- He's helping us out.
- It has been almost two hours.

336
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:33,095
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

337
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:38,388
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's clouds and thunder.

338
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:41,848
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

339
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:45,771
But finally we shall bring order out of chaos.

340
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:53,445
- Look.
- Yeah.

341
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:56,488
What you got here is two
people dragging a third.

342
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,655
Miao Yin!

343
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:16,803
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

344
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:24,686
Jack, check this out.

345
00:37:25,984 --> 00:37:28,060
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?

346
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:30,858
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

347
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:46,286
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

348
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:51,254
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

349
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,762
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just like your salad bar.

350
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:59,891
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

351
00:37:59,975 --> 00:38:06,477
All movement in the universe is caused by
tension between positive and negative furies.

352
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:10,979
- So when the furies are out of balance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

353
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,238
Then the people
turn into demons and live for ever.

354
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,654
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to plague the living.

355
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:23,988
Well then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

356
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:30,122
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

357
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:35,710
All right, out this hatch and up the cable.
Does that sound like a brilliant idea or what?

358
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:38,721
The cable is three storeys high
and covered with grease.

359
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:42,722
Exactly. It's real and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

360
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:44,603
Yeah, in deep shit.

361
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:49,888
- What?
- What the hell...?

362
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,273
- Shit!
- See?

363
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:56,280
You think they'd let us
walk in and out like the wind?

364
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:59,071
Yes.
I thought that was your whole damn point!

365
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:01,533
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

366
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:04,540
- This is salt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

367
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:08,243
- I'll buy another one.
- But there's only one Miao Yin!

368
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,315
Jesus Christ! Where are we?

369
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:40,899
Hell of the upside-down sinners!

370
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:59,554
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

371
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,253
Shit, Jack. I don't like the looks of this.

372
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,306
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

373
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:15,496
Oh, boy.

374
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,543
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan,
all right?

375
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,919
David Lo Pan?

376
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,595
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

377
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:28,682
- I don't get this at all. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

378
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,849
- You are not put upon this world to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

379
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:34,813
Nothing you can understand.

380
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,142
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

381
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:43,903
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

382
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:48,369
You are not looking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girl with green eyes.

383
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:51,789
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

384
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,497
Or I'm not about to waste another 2,000 years.

385
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:58,122
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

386
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,501
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.

387
00:42:01,594 --> 00:42:03,670
But I can!

388
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:07,307
Tell me about Miao Yin.

389
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,680
What province is she from? Hunan?

390
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:14,522
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a holy man. I must know.

391
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:18,142
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourself.

392
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:28,073
Mr Burton, if you have an influence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

393
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:32,206
Otherwise I will send both of you to
the hell where people are skinned alive.

394
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,662
It's that simple. Understand?

395
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:39,460
- Are you crazy? Is that your problem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

396
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:44,673
My problem is this place.
This place is my tomb. I'm buried here.

397
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:50,883
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

398
00:42:52,562 --> 00:42:55,100
And all I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

399
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,439
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

400
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:03,947
to make me whole and young again, so that I
may rule the universe from beyond the grave.

401
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:07,364
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?

402
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,443
No, not me, Mr Burton.

403
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:15,372
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my blood.

404
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,702
A girl with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

405
00:43:19,796 --> 00:43:22,667
a girl brave enough
to embrace the naked blade.

406
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:24,964
- When I find her, I will marry her.
- Never!

407
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,460
Ch'ing-ti will be happy and my curse lifted.

408
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:30,389
You can rule the universe
from beyond the grave.

409
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,881
- Indeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.

410
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:35,384
Whichever comes first.

411
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:40,354
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit? 2,000
years and he can't find a broad to fit the bill?

412
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:43,562
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriously wrong.

413
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:49,361
There have been others, to be sure.
There are always others, are there not?

414
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:53,615
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

415
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:56,079
how seldom it works out.

416
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:59,995
And yet we all keep trying, like fools.

417
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,879
Who are these people? Friends of yours?
Now this really pisses me off to no end!

418
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,553
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Yin? In this building?

419
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:13,265
- Safe.
- Where is she?

420
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,885
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!

421
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:21,398
Go ahead. You want bad publicity?
Give us the run-around.

422
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:25,695
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

423
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,567
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

424
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:32,986
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

425
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:35,451
What's it gonna hurt?

426
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,866
I can help you.

427
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,271
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

428
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:16,579
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeletons.

429
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:19,784
- Where's the light coming from?
- The floor.

430
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:38,806
With the easing of trade restrictions,

431
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:43,807
next year we'll start importing
a lot of strange things from Peking.

432
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:46,936
What sort of strange things?

433
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:49,435
Are we going up or down?

434
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,606
It feels like down.

435
00:46:11,344 --> 00:46:13,835
Great. Thank you, Jack.

436
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,924
I think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

437
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:24,930
Two, three feet thick, I'll bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

438
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,938
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

439
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:31,650
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

440
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,864
Which Lo Pan? Little old basket case
on wheels, or the ten-foot-tall roadblock?

441
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:41,911
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not tellin' me.

442
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,408
Myths and legends.

443
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,455
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

444
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:50,877
Insult me.

445
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:56,343
It's about all sorts of scary things:
an ancient army of the dead,

446
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,965
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

447
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,217
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

448
00:47:02,312 --> 00:47:06,310
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

449
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:11,642
and imposed upon him
that horrible curse of no flesh in 272 BC.

450
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:16,949
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

451
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:20,034
and pretend not to believe them.

452
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:23,539
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

453
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:28,999
I don't blame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for real.

454
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:31,579
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

455
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:39,047
Blindfolds!

456
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,283
You make one move...

457
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,327
Now, let's try that again.
Don't make me kill you, tough guy.

458
00:48:12,173 --> 00:48:14,130
Come on, Jack!

459
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,668
- Come on!
- How?

460
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:13,183
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

461
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:18,519
We're all in: me, Gracie and Margo. Uncle Chu
and Egg are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

462
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:20,109
- Right.
- Here, Jack.

463
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,276
I'll trade ya.

464
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,033
All right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.

465
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:28,744
There, I think. Down there.

466
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,166
No pathetic excuses.

467
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:44,380
I smell the blood of human beings.
Find them. Boil them until their flesh falls off.

468
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:46,884
You heard me!

469
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:45,109
Empty.

470
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:50,123
I need you, Miao Yin.

471
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:55,120
You, whose eyes flash like emerald lightning.

472
00:50:56,171 --> 00:51:00,121
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

473
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,762
Please.

474
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:07,346
Let's go. It's clear.

475
00:51:13,188 --> 00:51:15,264
Safety!

476
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:20,730
Wang!

477
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,365
First time you ever plugged somebody?

478
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:31,954
- Course not.
- Come on!

479
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:35,619
You wanna go up or down?

480
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,787
- Up or down?
- Up.

481
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:04,483
All has become strange.

482
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:11,367
A world so unreal and yet,
at once, so frightening.

483
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:37,850
Open up or I'll blow his head off!

484
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,943
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

485
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:47,896
and your souls speed with his
to the hell of the oily dragon!

486
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:17,261
- You all right?
- Yeah.

487
00:53:21,985 --> 00:53:23,859
- Margo!
- Jack!

488
00:53:23,946 --> 00:53:27,728
- Where's Gracie?
- On the floor next door. She's a wildcat.

489
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:31,488
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

490
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:11,522
That way maybe.

491
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,196
Wang, haul ass!

492
00:54:32,013 --> 00:54:33,921
Come on, keep movin'!

493
00:54:35,558 --> 00:54:37,100
Margo, jump in!

494
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,058
- In there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

495
00:55:12,386 --> 00:55:14,876
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

496
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:19,216
Where are we?

497
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,599
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

498
00:55:24,733 --> 00:55:26,809
Where's Jack?

499
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,729
Jack!

500
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:34,774
Jack?

501
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:38,862
Jack!

502
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:47,457
- Sorry, I'm just thrilled to be alive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

503
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:57,922
- It's like some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

504
00:55:58,015 --> 00:56:02,014
Will you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

505
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:04,226
I can't concentrate when you do that.

506
00:56:04,314 --> 00:56:08,312
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, really!

507
00:56:10,862 --> 00:56:14,861
- Where's Jack?
- It's OK. Everybody relax. I'm here.

508
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,365
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you call it?

509
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:21,205
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

510
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:26,035
Seawater from the bay fills this room. They
divert it through pipes to different chambers.

511
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:29,662
I bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

512
00:56:57,408 --> 00:57:00,907
All right, we're almost outta here.
From here on, it gets normal.

513
00:57:00,995 --> 00:57:03,202
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.

514
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:06,788
I count to three, open the door, and we go.

515
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:08,833
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?

516
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,412
Follow the leader. One, two, three.

517
00:57:15,427 --> 00:57:17,171
We may be trapped.

518
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,548
Hide!

519
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:26,391
- Hide?
- Hide! They only saw me!

520
00:57:30,275 --> 00:57:32,813
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

521
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,287
Time to go.

522
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:33,164
The bus is right outside in the parking lot.

523
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:59,270
Here's the deal. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handle that?

524
00:58:59,365 --> 00:59:00,312
Can you?

525
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:04,316
Well, what a night's work!
You got a problem like that again,

526
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,246
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

527
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,576
Come on, come on.

528
00:59:12,795 --> 00:59:15,914
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

529
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:20,546
Let's go! Open the doors!

530
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:26,095
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

531
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:29,635
Duck!

532
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:48,822
We made it. Holy shit, we made it!

533
00:59:49,497 --> 00:59:52,368
- Where's Miao Yin?
- Inside.

534
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,667
Somewhere inside.

535
00:59:57,714 --> 00:59:59,339
Where's Gracie?

536
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:18,941
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

537
01:00:23,074 --> 01:00:25,908
Let me go! Let me go!

538
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:06,154
What does it mean?

539
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:08,947
Two girls with green eyes?

540
01:01:09,037 --> 01:01:11,160
After all these years.

541
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:16,786
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

542
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:20,954
This one has fire as well!

543
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:24,962
Listen,
I've had it up to here with you maniacs.

544
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:29,180
I wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddler David Lo Pan in person.

545
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:34,306
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girl one-on-one!

546
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:36,929
Where is he?

547
01:01:46,198 --> 01:01:51,073
You know what this is?
This is like some radical Alice In Wonderland.

548
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:55,325
- That's what this is.
- Then you've got a best seller on your hands.

549
01:01:55,415 --> 01:02:01,371
- Call the police. You're not a one-man army.
- Cops got better things to do than get killed.

550
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:06,544
Here he is, Jack.

551
01:02:06,636 --> 01:02:10,301
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

552
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:13,675
- Any of 'em savvy English?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?

553
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:15,595
All right. You got any guns?

554
01:02:15,686 --> 01:02:21,143
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

555
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:24,318
I'll stick with these. You comin' with us, Egg?

556
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:29,313
Of course, Jack. It's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'll never make it out alive.

557
01:02:29,407 --> 01:02:31,981
- I'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

558
01:02:32,078 --> 01:02:35,825
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

559
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:38,487
You're stayin' here with Eddie and Uncle Chu.

560
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:41,620
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

561
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:46,339
- You mean like you've got on Gracie?
- Are you kidding? I just want my truck back.

562
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:49,759
What do I know?
She's not even your type. All brains.

563
01:02:49,845 --> 01:02:51,921
Come on, let's go!

564
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:04,396
Play your cards right, you live to talk about it.

565
01:03:27,342 --> 01:03:29,418
Oh, boy.

566
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:33,679
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

567
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:37,049
Yes. Miao Yin.

568
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:40,145
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

569
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,763
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

570
01:03:43,857 --> 01:03:45,897
Yes.

571
01:03:45,984 --> 01:03:47,941
- No, no.
- Yes.

572
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:55,447
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

573
01:03:55,536 --> 01:04:01,824
My soul swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formlessness.

574
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:06,249
Until I find her and marry her.

575
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:07,714
Marry her?

576
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:13,006
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

577
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:19,619
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

578
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:34,301
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door will get you nowhere.

579
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:38,010
- Here, let me hold that.
- A brave man likes to feel nature on his face.

580
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:41,353
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

581
01:04:53,453 --> 01:04:56,157
- He lives here?
- He owns the block. He's a rich guy.

582
01:04:56,247 --> 01:04:59,581
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

583
01:04:59,668 --> 01:05:02,584
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

584
01:05:03,922 --> 01:05:06,922
Well, all set?

585
01:05:07,926 --> 01:05:10,499
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

586
01:05:29,823 --> 01:05:31,695
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

587
01:05:31,782 --> 01:05:34,700
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

588
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:37,786
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.

589
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:39,947
Afraid? Are you kidding?

590
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:58,475
- Where in the hell are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

591
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,403
That is not water.

592
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,952
Black blood of the earth.

593
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:08,335
- Do you mean oil?
- I mean black blood of the earth.

594
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:13,629
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the world upside down.

595
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:18,378
Many normal people were killed.

596
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:24,722
Many unnatural people roam free

597
01:07:24,813 --> 01:07:29,391
to commit great offences against the gods.

598
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:20,752
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

599
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:25,887
I will marry both women.

600
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:30,425
Prepare them.

601
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:47,113
What is that?

602
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:52,830
- It sounds like...
- Something breathing underwater?

603
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,579
Yeah.

604
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,466
You will come out no more!

605
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:10,223
What? What'll come out no more?

606
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:12,554
Come on.

607
01:10:12,648 --> 01:10:14,723
Dammit!

608
01:10:27,537 --> 01:10:29,613
Miao Yin?

609
01:11:08,203 --> 01:11:10,326
Hey, Wang!

610
01:11:10,414 --> 01:11:12,987
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

611
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:31,222
It's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.

612
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:34,264
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

613
01:11:34,355 --> 01:11:36,264
Christ!

614
01:11:39,068 --> 01:11:40,182
Later.

615
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:44,904
We're getting close. Real close.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

616
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:49,487
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

617
01:11:49,578 --> 01:11:52,069
the First Sovereign Emperor...

618
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:57,159
He subjugated Lo Pan, made him of no flesh.

619
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:02,043
- Only an evil dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

620
01:12:02,132 --> 01:12:07,340
In order to be whole again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

621
01:12:07,429 --> 01:12:10,099
and marry her to appease the God of the East.

622
01:12:10,182 --> 01:12:13,302
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kill her.

623
01:12:13,394 --> 01:12:15,220
Kill her? No!

624
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:19,439
Well, let's go. What are we talkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

625
01:12:19,524 --> 01:12:23,024
We are getting ready to strike the final blow.

626
01:12:23,112 --> 01:12:26,777
- If we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

627
01:12:26,865 --> 01:12:29,653
...then the power in this flask
will be our only hope

628
01:12:29,743 --> 01:12:34,654
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the ultimate evil spirit.

629
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,748
Yes. Only a dream can kill a dream.

630
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,999
I've waited for this for a long time, Jack.

631
01:12:44,217 --> 01:12:46,838
The evil dream will die.

632
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,465
Wing Kong outside.

633
01:13:21,254 --> 01:13:24,787
- Were they real?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

634
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:26,957
What's in the flask? Magic potion?

635
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:29,507
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

636
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:31,339
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

637
01:14:07,758 --> 01:14:12,219
I am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

638
01:14:14,473 --> 01:14:18,850
My God, no! Please!
What is that? Don't tell me.

639
01:14:18,936 --> 01:14:23,265
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

640
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:25,813
They have returned.

641
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:30,066
And this time they are not alone.
Egg Shen is with them.

642
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:35,827
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

643
01:14:35,912 --> 01:14:37,619
Egg Shen?

644
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:42,664
Egg Shen! You have come
a long ways to find me, but it is too late.

645
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:47,081
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I will marry them both.

646
01:14:47,173 --> 01:14:50,506
And then I will sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

647
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:54,839
and live out my earthly pleasures
with Miao Yin.

648
01:14:57,474 --> 01:15:00,725
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worlds.

649
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:10,183
You never know till you try.

650
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:12,355
Let's get outta here.

651
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:25,704
You know what I don't like?
Where is everybody?

652
01:15:25,795 --> 01:15:28,084
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

653
01:15:38,641 --> 01:15:42,425
We should not be in here, not this easily.
It's a setup, I'm tellin' ya.

654
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,972
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.

655
01:15:46,066 --> 01:15:48,817
So where is he, Egg? Where?

656
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:22,468
- Jack, here!
- What?

657
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,140
- Hollow.
- Fuck it.

658
01:16:32,779 --> 01:16:36,480
- I know. It's an elevator. It only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

659
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:40,488
- Hey, all right!
- Time for the medicine!

660
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:51,871
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactly?

661
01:16:51,965 --> 01:16:54,586
Huge buzz.

662
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,384
Good!

663
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:01,764
You can see things no one else can see,
do things no one else can do.

664
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,138
- Real things?
- As real as Lo Pan.

665
01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:08,307
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

666
01:17:08,398 --> 01:17:12,146
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
Sensational. What's in it, Egg?

667
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:15,021
Wind! Fire! All that kind of thing.

668
01:17:15,112 --> 01:17:17,603
Here's to the army and navy
and the battles they have won.

669
01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:20,404
Here's to America's colours,
the colours that never run.

670
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:23,199
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.

671
01:17:38,262 --> 01:17:41,677
I feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

672
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:44,766
I'm not scared at all. I just feel kind of...

673
01:17:45,768 --> 01:17:48,520
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

674
01:17:48,604 --> 01:17:52,554
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

675
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:00,944
Is it gettin' hot in here, or is it just me?

676
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:04,160
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

677
01:18:04,996 --> 01:18:08,697
Great Ch'ing-ti, equal with heaven,

678
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:14,746
come into our presence
and witness this holy matrimony.

679
01:18:14,839 --> 01:18:18,540
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate evil spirit.

680
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:27,264
And now, my beloved disciples,

681
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:29,760
the moment of truth.

682
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:32,392
The needle of love.

683
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:38,903
- I'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not until he's married.

684
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:41,610
- Then he's flesh.
- Then it's too late.

685
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,941
Ch'ing-ti!

686
01:18:44,035 --> 01:18:48,827
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

687
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:52,616
all I ask in order to conquer this universe

688
01:18:52,711 --> 01:18:57,088
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

689
01:18:58,883 --> 01:19:02,003
Yes! Guide my hand

690
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:06,967
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

691
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:11,681
Let him complete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

692
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:14,345
Come, my love. Give it to me.

693
01:19:27,538 --> 01:19:29,446
It's working!

694
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,159
I'm mortal!

695
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:43,586
Look out, guys!

696
01:19:59,193 --> 01:20:00,854
No way!

697
01:21:04,384 --> 01:21:06,673
Come, Miao Yin, it won't hurt.

698
01:22:07,532 --> 01:22:08,990
Shit!

699
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,530
Take her.

700
01:22:41,565 --> 01:22:43,853
Peasant magic!

701
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:21,304
You never could beat me, Egg Shen.

702
01:24:27,587 --> 01:24:29,047
- It's me.
- Are you all right?

703
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:32,298
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?

704
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:33,759
Wang!

705
01:24:33,844 --> 01:24:35,636
Come on.

706
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,716
Pull it apart. Come on!

707
01:25:06,919 --> 01:25:11,213
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. It's cooler up there.

708
01:25:11,298 --> 01:25:14,384
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

709
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:17,884
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet tall!

710
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:21,257
Seven. Don't worry.
I can handle him. I took something.

711
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:24,055
I can see things no one else can see.

712
01:25:25,313 --> 01:25:28,895
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

713
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:34,143
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

714
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:45,987
Oh, God. Is this really happening?

715
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:56,543
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

716
01:25:56,636 --> 01:26:00,550
I have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

717
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,424
No! I don't understand. I don't belong to you!

718
01:26:04,519 --> 01:26:08,351
No, you don't. You belong to Ch'ing-ti.

719
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:11,275
I must sacrifice you,
but I love you and I need you.

720
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:13,565
No!

721
01:26:13,653 --> 01:26:15,859
Here, take her! Take the bitch!

722
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:18,782
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

723
01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:22,410
I am! It worked!

724
01:26:22,495 --> 01:26:25,282
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

725
01:26:25,665 --> 01:26:31,004
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

726
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:33,293
Not so fast, gentlemen.

727
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:37,045
Is it too much to ask, Thunder?
Kill him! For me!

728
01:26:37,134 --> 01:26:41,962
It won't solve anything, Dave. Too many
people have been droppin' like flies already

729
01:26:42,056 --> 01:26:45,673
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

730
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:49,184
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
always says at a time like this?

731
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:52,272
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

732
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,775
Old Jack always says

733
01:27:03,286 --> 01:27:05,408
"What the hell?"

734
01:27:31,188 --> 01:27:32,648
It's a good knife.

735
01:27:35,068 --> 01:27:36,942
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

736
01:28:01,177 --> 01:28:03,668
It's all in the reflexes.

737
01:28:06,808 --> 01:28:08,516
Wang!

738
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:18,351
You all right?

739
01:28:18,444 --> 01:28:20,603
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

740
01:28:56,358 --> 01:28:58,434
I don't think he's gonna stop!

741
01:29:02,781 --> 01:29:04,275
Come on!

742
01:29:24,136 --> 01:29:26,627
- We got a problem.
- There!

743
01:29:58,336 --> 01:30:00,744
Come on, Jack!

744
01:30:02,674 --> 01:30:04,750
Jump, Jack!

745
01:30:14,895 --> 01:30:17,765
- This whole place is melting!
- Hello! Hello!

746
01:30:18,648 --> 01:30:22,776
- How'd you get up there?
- It wasn't easy! Stand aside!

747
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:29,697
Take it away!

748
01:30:49,304 --> 01:30:51,214
Hang onto this.

749
01:30:53,434 --> 01:30:55,426
Watch out, Wang Chi!

750
01:31:04,903 --> 01:31:06,979
Go for it, Wang!

751
01:31:27,718 --> 01:31:30,588
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

752
01:31:32,597 --> 01:31:35,170
There's my truck... My truck!

753
01:31:35,266 --> 01:31:37,722
Get in.

754
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:01,413
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?

755
01:32:01,501 --> 01:32:04,420
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

756
01:32:07,008 --> 01:32:10,791
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scale. Hang on!

757
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:21,808
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?

758
01:32:21,897 --> 01:32:23,474
Relax.

759
01:32:37,496 --> 01:32:39,786
Stop! Red light!

760
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:46,416
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

761
01:32:47,966 --> 01:32:49,079
Yeah.

762
01:32:49,174 --> 01:32:53,302
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feel good?

763
01:32:53,387 --> 01:32:55,463
Terrific.

764
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:59,055
The light's green. You can go.

765
01:33:17,661 --> 01:33:20,782
- What are you doin', Jack?
- I'll be right back.

766
01:33:20,872 --> 01:33:23,363
Where are you goin', Egg?

767
01:33:24,084 --> 01:33:26,160
My work's done.

768
01:33:26,878 --> 01:33:30,828
Lo Pan is dead and the evil spell's been lifted.

769
01:33:31,967 --> 01:33:35,418
Years ago I promised myself a long vacation.

770
01:33:35,512 --> 01:33:37,506
It is time to collect.

771
01:33:37,598 --> 01:33:40,932
Well, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

772
01:33:41,018 --> 01:33:45,597
Well, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

773
01:33:48,109 --> 01:33:52,403
- So what are you gonna call it?
- I don't know.

774
01:33:52,488 --> 01:33:57,647
Maybe you can come over to my place later
and help me find a title?

775
01:33:59,744 --> 01:34:02,995
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or double.

776
01:34:03,082 --> 01:34:05,834
Triple. You earned it.

777
01:34:06,168 --> 01:34:08,872
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

778
01:34:12,091 --> 01:34:14,664
Well, last chance. I'm a rich man now.

779
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:18,592
I can give up the open road,
sell my truck, settle down.

780
01:34:19,098 --> 01:34:21,670
Couldn't have that on my conscience.

781
01:34:21,766 --> 01:34:24,602
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

782
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:28,185
with a cosy little apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

783
01:34:28,273 --> 01:34:33,649
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or later
I rub everybody the wrong way.

784
01:34:35,657 --> 01:34:37,946
Well, let me think about it.

785
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:45,494
God, aren't you even
gonna kiss her goodbye?

786
01:34:49,296 --> 01:34:50,838
No.

787
01:34:53,049 --> 01:34:56,168
- See you around, Burton.
- Never can tell.

788
01:35:01,223 --> 01:35:03,299
Bye, Jack.

789
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:10,139
We really shook the pillars of heaven,
didn't we, Wang?

790
01:35:10,232 --> 01:35:12,938
- No horseshit, Jack.
- No horseshit.

791
01:35:35,008 --> 01:35:38,626
You just listen to the Pork-Chop Express
and take his advice

792
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,669
on a stormy night, when the lightning's
crashin', the thunder's roarin',

793
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:46,549
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

794
01:35:46,644 --> 01:35:49,598
Remember what old Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

795
01:35:49,689 --> 01:35:54,600
and the poison arrows fall from the sky
and the pillars of heaven shake.

796
01:35:54,694 --> 01:35:59,569
Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big old
storm right square in the eye and he says

797
01:35:59,657 --> 01:36:03,322
"Gimme your best shot, pal. I can take it."
