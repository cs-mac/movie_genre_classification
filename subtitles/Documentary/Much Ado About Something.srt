59
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,481
Hey, don't drink too much.

60
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:34,882
I'm not.

61
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:37,682
I'm not drunk.

62
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:43,082
I'd like to be drunk, though.

63
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,381
Just wait.

64
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,082
Time heals all wounds.

65
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:55,682
I'm sure you'll forget
about everything, with time.

66
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:01,381
About what you just said...

67
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,481
don't believe that drivel.

68
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,382
It's a lie.

69
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:12,382
I don't believe that.

70
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,082
Hello.

71
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,482
Um, what brings you here?

72
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,181
<i>You said that you weren't interested
in my Grandpa's fortune, at all!</i>

73
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:48,280
I don't have any interest in
that husband clause, yes.

74
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,380
But still, a deal must
be fair to both parties.

75
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:55,281
But you know, both parties need to keep
a promise for it to have any meaning.

76
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,682
<i>How about we save sleeping
with each other for later?</i>

77
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,481
You must be out of your mind!

78
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,082
Who said that I wanted
to sleep with you?

79
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:16,881
- What's with you?
- Ow!

80
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,381
Ow.

81
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:55,981
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

82
00:02:55,982 --> 00:03:03,682
<i>Congratulations on your birthday!</i>

83
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:08,482
<i>Come on, smile! These will
all be treasured memories.</i>

84
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,182
I think that I might
like you, Mr. Jae In.

85
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,482
I like kissing you, too.

86
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:05,381
Nobody can make me forget her.

87
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:23,982
- Back off.
- Hey!

88
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:35,682
Wow, he's gotten a lot more handsome.

89
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,682
Big Brother!

90
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,681
Oh, you're here?

91
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,481
Oh, it's Ji-sus!

92
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:05,081
No, I have to resist today.
Let's go, Big Brother.

93
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,882
Do you really need to be
holding onto me?

94
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,081
- You're not letting go?
- No!

95
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,481
How does this look, Big Brother?

96
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,380
Oh... yeah.
It looks fine.

97
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:30,881
Big Brother!

98
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,081
It looks nice on you.
Buy that.

99
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,681
You're really not going to go home?

100
00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:00,080
I told you, I have an audition tomorrow!

101
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah, but it isn't an audition
for potential fashion models!

102
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,681
You better go back to Canada
if you fail this audition!

103
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:06,880
Canada, Canada!
You're really being too much.

104
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,981
I'm trying so hard like this on my own
without relying on your money, though!

105
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,181
The least you could be doing is praising
me, and yet you're saying this?

106
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:13,981
Oh, fine.
Good job.

107
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,682
You really did a good job.

108
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,982
But still, you're going back to
Canada if you fail this audition.

109
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,880
DaDa. Ji Su has really
become a lot more skilled!

110
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:54,182
Should I go and get some
autographs from him?

111
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,782
What are you staring at?

112
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:03,182
Why that...
those little... ugh!

113
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,982
That rotten bastard!

114
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:11,481
DaDa. Want me to go down there
and kick him hard for you?

115
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:14,981
It's fine. Let's go.
I'm hungry.

116
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:17,681
This is why I'm saying that you
need to see someone, too!

117
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:18,781
Go on some arranged dates, or something!

118
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,481
I'll have tons of great rich guys
lined up, just waiting!

119
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,681
It's fine. I'm not even
completely over all this yet.

120
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:26,981
So it'd be unfair to the other person.

121
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,281
Unfair, my ass!

122
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,081
You can only win against
a man with another man!

123
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:36,682
Let's go.

124
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,381
<i>You're not going to give me a
"good job" stamp this time?</i>

125
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:58,682
Good... job.

126
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,981
There's nothing here.

127
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,441
It's not like I did anything to deserve
getting a "good job" stamp, though.

128
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:23,882
Pardon?

129
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,282
Oh, it's nothing.

130
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:54,080
If I had known that this
was going to happen

131
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:56,382
I would've given it my all
when I was dating him.

132
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:00,981
I would've done everything that
everyone else does, with him

133
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:04,481
so that I wouldn't have any regrets.

134
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,682
No...

135
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:18,882
Rather, I shouldn't have made
any memories with him.

136
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:49,580
So he really ended things with Da Hyun?

137
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:50,781
Yes!

138
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:55,181
He's really a lot scarier
than I'd thought!

139
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:57,980
Of course he is.
He's my grandson, after all.

140
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,882
One's work life and dating life
should be kept separate, after all.

141
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:07,281
A long, long time ago, there was a salt
merchant travelling through the hills.

142
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,881
And then, he ran into a scary tiger.

143
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:14,782
The tiger rushed at the salt
merchant, and swallowed him!

144
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:20,080
All right.
Relax, and take it easy.

145
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,481
Okay, right turn.

146
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,182
Wait, you have to signal!

147
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:31,081
Um, right turn?

148
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,182
Just keep going straight.

149
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:51,081
And the salt vendor received
a huge reward in the end!

150
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,682
After you finish your scheduled
activities for the morning, you...

151
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,301
The chairman called and told me
to remind you, sir, that...

152
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:10,282
you're having lunch with the second
daughter of the chairman of Ganghan Inc.

153
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,281
Looks like our chairman
is doing just fine.

154
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:15,882
Tell him that he needn't worry about it.

155
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:21,182
Are you... really going to marry
this person right away?

156
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,381
I'm the only direct descendant
of the Lee family line.

157
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:30,580
My grandfather won't stand for it
if I don't get married.

158
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,281
But if you marry the wrong person

159
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:35,281
we'll potentially have a
terrible Madam to worry about!

160
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:36,980
Please consider your options carefully.

161
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,882
My hands are tied, though.

162
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,381
We'll sign pre-nups
before getting married.

163
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:49,881
Of course, we must sign an M&A contract
for our companies before doing that.

164
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,080
Aren't you speaking
a bit too matter-of-factly?

165
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,681
I don't think there is any need
for either of us to waste time.

166
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,381
Aren't those the terms you agreed to
by coming out here, anyway?

167
00:12:56,382 --> 00:13:00,080
But still, I thought you'd
maintain a basic level of etiquette.

168
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,182
A marriage isn't a
business venture, after all.

169
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:11,782
How old are you?

170
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:15,881
28.

171
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm sure you've been to plenty of
meetings like this by now, at your age.

172
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,181
And yet you still aren't
familiar of the rules of our world?

173
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:26,281
This marriage is a deal.
It's strictly business.

174
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,981
Nothing more, nothing less.

175
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:31,980
Let's stop things here.

176
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:34,621
I feel like neither one of us can
fulfill the other's expectations.

177
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:44,881
Yes, Jae In is quite picky when
it comes to women. And so am I.

178
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:49,182
I'm sure you were well aware of the fact
that SH Group is a formidable force.

179
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:56,281
Director Lee didn't go home
yesterday, either?

180
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:57,282
No, ma'am.

181
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:01,182
I'm so worried for him,
he's overworking himself so much!

182
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:03,080
Don't worry!

183
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,980
That amount of work won't kill him.

184
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:06,580
Father-in-Law!

185
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,182
I'll be going, then.

186
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,382
Father-in-Law.

187
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:20,581
I... did the right thing, didn't I?

188
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,281
They broke up because that's all
their relationship amounted to.

189
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,381
They only liked each other
that much, is all.

190
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:31,781
So don't beat yourself up too much.

191
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:33,382
They have nobody to blame
but themselves.

192
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,881
Good work today everyone!
Gather around!

193
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:48,580
Make sure you all get home safe, okay?

194
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,581
- Yes, Teacher.
- Yes, Teacher.

195
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,581
And watch out for cars!

196
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:53,181
- Goodbye, Teacher!
- Goodbye, Teacher!

197
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,381
Bye!

198
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,681
Oh, Ru Mi!
Let me straighten that up for you.

199
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:58,480
- Goodbye, Teacher.
- Bye, now!

200
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,481
Okay!

201
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,080
Don't worry. I can guarantee you
this friend of mine is a good guy.

202
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,381
Is he really good-looking?

203
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,681
Yeah, totally!

204
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:24,781
He's like Won Bin and
Jo In Sung put together!

205
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:28,282
But the most important thing of all
is that he's an herbalist!

206
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:30,881
You're not lying to me, are you?

207
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:33,681
I'll kill you if he ends up being
a mommy's boy or a player!

208
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,080
Hey, DaDa.

209
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,181
I told you, I did an
initial scan of him already!

210
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:39,181
Man, I'm full.

211
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,381
Just try meeting him.

212
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:43,281
And if it doesn't work out
even after you've dated around a bit

213
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,181
I'll take responsibility for you,
so don't worry.

214
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:46,281
- Just leave it to me.
- Geez.

215
00:15:46,282 --> 00:15:49,281
I told you, no players!
So stop it with that, already!

216
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,182
Hey. It's because of you
that I can't get married!

217
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:56,882
You should eat more.

218
00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:16,181
Give me an employee discount, okay?

219
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,681
It's on me.

220
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:19,580
It's a gift from me to commemorate
you overcoming your heartbreak.

221
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,581
Wow! Wait, since you're
buying me things already...

222
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,681
Um... oh!

223
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,881
Buy me this, too!

224
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,682
Geez!
Don't make me yell at you!

225
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:34,581
I broke up with a guy, and
I was in tons of pain, you know!

226
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:39,681
Wow, you were never this sly before!

227
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,081
So you're not going to buy this for me?

228
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,582
Fine, fine!

229
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:51,081
What's wrong? She eats well now
and even smiles nowadays.

230
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:54,081
Da Hyun doesn't like cream spaghetti.

231
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,481
She usually can't even finish
an entire plate of it.

232
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,681
Oh my goodness!

233
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:03,181
Just ask me to buy you all
the clothes here, why don't you!

234
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:04,682
Wow.

235
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:53,682
<i>[Lee Jae]</i>

236
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:59,682
<i>[Lee Jae In]</i>

237
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,182
Yeah, Mom?

238
00:18:13,082 --> 00:18:15,281
Oh, it's Dad's acquaintance?

239
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,280
Then sure, I'll meet with him.

240
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,681
Okay, I'll do well.

241
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,882
Okay.

242
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,981
Oh... it's raining.

243
00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:22,082
<i>I think...</i>

244
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:24,781
that I might like you, Mr. Jae In.

245
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:55,781
Are you really thinking of finding
a school to work at in Jinju, too?

246
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,382
Ms. Da Hyun.

247
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:05,082
I'm sorry.

248
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,381
Ms. Da Hyun.

249
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,980
I'll drive you home.
It's raining, after all.

250
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:15,382
No, I can just catch
a cab right outside.

251
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,980
Um...

252
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:21,082
I'm sorry about today.
I haven't fully recovered yet.

253
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,382
Goodbye.

254
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,481
Thanks for bringing me to your hotel.

255
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:11,786
I'd heard that she was sick.

256
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,882
Did she lose weight?

257
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,381
Who are you?

258
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,181
My name is Jung Hyun Jin.

259
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:50,882
I'm your cousin's
ex-girlfriend's best friend.

260
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:55,682
So, um, Kim Da Hyun is my friend.

261
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:58,881
Excuse me.

262
00:22:58,882 --> 00:23:00,681
You should be showing
interest in this issue, you know!

263
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,882
You kidnapped my Da Hyun, after all.

264
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,381
I'm not the one who kidnapped her.

265
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,881
I saved her!

266
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:10,681
Let's be real, though. You didn't save
her because you wanted to.

267
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,280
You only did it because of that
high-and-mighty cousin of yours.

268
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,781
What is it that you want to say?

269
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:19,780
You know that Mr. Lee Jae In
and my friend broke up, right?

270
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:22,381
Well, I think I did hear
something about that, yes.

271
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:26,582
Those two were really good together.

272
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:29,281
So what?

273
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:35,082
How about we do
a good deed for those two?

274
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,681
I'm not that good of a person
to be interested in such things.

275
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:42,382
Also, I have no interest in
others' love lives.

276
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:49,382
Wow, what an asshole!

277
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:53,980
Fine. I guess Da Hyun can see other
men without any worries now.

278
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:56,781
It's not like Lee Jae In is the
only man on this planet!

279
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:02,981
- You have such a young-looking face.
- Oh, thank you.

280
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:15,481
Well, I like to read.

281
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:17,881
What do you enjoy doing?

282
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:21,181
Well, I like exercising and watching
movies. And watching movies alone.

283
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:22,281
Oh.

284
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,981
Shall we go somewhere else?

285
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,681
That'd be for the best, right?

286
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,981
If we stay, it'll just be
uncomfortable for both of us.

287
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:03,182
What?

288
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:05,781
- You know, Cousin...
- I told you to call me Big Bro.

289
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,882
You're only seven months
older than me, though.

290
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:11,881
Well, anyway.
Big Bro.

291
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:14,242
It's the first time I've seen you
be considerate of someone.

292
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,981
I have a debt to repay to that woman.

293
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:32,780
I've done all that I could.

294
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,182
Man, that stubborn ass.

295
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:40,382
Oh, I don't mean you.
I'm talking about your cousin.

296
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,381
Man, really.

297
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:44,980
I guess that's why he makes
so much money, huh?

298
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,081
Because he's so stupidly stubborn!

299
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:52,481
But still, my Big Bro... no, I mean, my
cousin... held himself back a lot.

300
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,582
Does he really not have any
feelings left for her, then?

301
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,381
Thank you for today.

302
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:03,980
I guess he didn't love Da Hyun
as much as I thought he did.

303
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,381
I guess I misunderstood.

304
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:10,181
Wait, no, that works out
for the best, then.

305
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,980
Since she can meet someone better
with no regrets.

306
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:15,081
At any rate, I've done all that I could.

307
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:18,980
So if I hear anything about contracts
or a kidnapping through the media

308
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,881
you'll have to take responsibility
for all that, Ms. Jung Hyun Jin.

309
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:23,280
My cousin is quite a
scary fellow, you see.

310
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,881
Sure, sure.
I know.

311
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:28,681
Also, I also know that it won't
benefit Da Hyun in any way

312
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:31,181
for rumors like that
to get around, either.

313
00:26:31,182 --> 00:26:35,280
So I had no intention of posting
an exposé about this online.

314
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:38,682
At any rate, thank you.
Goodbye, now.

315
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,781
Wait.

316
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,981
Wait, so are you saying
that you deceived me?

317
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,881
It was bad enough that
you threatened me!

318
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:50,081
Oh, what do you mean, threaten?

319
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:53,182
I was just a bit desperate, is all.

320
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,882
<i>[Will you delete this photo?]
[No]</i>

321
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,780
The meeting is starting, Director.

322
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:49,981
All right.

323
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:52,980
I've prepared a simulation
of what it'd be like for us

324
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,881
to achieve 80 percent
of our marketing goals.

325
00:27:55,882 --> 00:28:00,980
First, we'll establish an infrastructure
geared towards Canadian tourists.

326
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:04,481
And we'll prepare something
that most Canadians like...

327
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,082
Director!

328
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:11,481
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:16,081
Let's end the meeting for today. Can
you take care of the rest, Chief Park?

330
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,882
Yes, sir.

331
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,382
Is it okay for me to contact you again?

332
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:44,082
Sure.

333
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:02,082
Do you like that man?

334
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,281
Why are you asking me
something like that?

335
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,882
Is that why you told him that it's
okay for him to contact you again?

336
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:18,481
He's a good person.

337
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,780
It's about time for me to see
other people now, too.

338
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:23,981
That way, I'll be able
to get married, and...

339
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:28,882
Don't talk about other men.

340
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,981
This is none of your
business, Mr. Jae In!

341
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:39,481
What are you...

342
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:45,882
If just you can bear it, DaDa,
then so can I.

343
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,980
You'll have to quit
your job at the school.

344
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,280
There will always be security
guards around you

345
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:57,681
and there will be tons of reporters
bothering you all the time.

346
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,581
And I can't be with you every day,
like other men can.

347
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:05,081
My mother will be on my side,
but she might be mean to you.

348
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:08,681
But you can just ignore what
everyone else thinks, though.

349
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,381
You might not be able
to do anything for me.

350
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,382
Are you okay with that?

351
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:18,582
How... could I possibly
be okay with that?

352
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,781
But still, try and bear it.

353
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,581
Just do this for me, just this once.

354
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:28,981
I'll be good to you later,
when we're old.

355
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:41,382
There's...

356
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:46,781
nothing that has changed
about the two of us.

357
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:51,981
So... will we be able to start over?

358
00:30:55,082 --> 00:30:57,382
You're positive that
nothing has changed?

359
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,082
That's a relief, then.

360
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,182
I want to marry you.

361
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,382
Mr. Jae In.

362
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:17,582
I... I don't have the
confidence to say yes.

363
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:38,682
What a terrible guy.

364
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:41,682
I'd almost forgotten all about him, too.

365
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:44,582
I've been trying to forget about him,
so why is he here now?

366
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:47,981
What does he want me to do?

367
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:26,182
What are you so surprised about?
You're making me feel bad.

368
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,582
I didn't know
that I'd run into you here.

369
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:37,480
Well, what else was I supposed to move?

370
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:40,281
You wouldn't budge,
so I had to come to you.

371
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:46,681
Come on, just come with me.

372
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:49,482
I really don't have the luxury to be
considerate of your circumstances.

373
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:51,682
Oh my.

374
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:54,682
Do I have to drag you?

375
00:33:16,182 --> 00:33:17,980
Are you seeing anyone?

376
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:19,280
No.

377
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,882
Good. I'm not dating anyone either.

378
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:26,981
You really aren't?
I don't think that's quite true.

379
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:29,480
I told you, I'm not seeing anyone.

380
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,881
Unlike someone, who has someone
who drops her off at home and such.

381
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:34,082
I really didn't do that.

382
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:38,480
Well, I, at the very least, didn't go
shopping with someone all giddily!

383
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,981
What are you talking about?
What did you even see?

384
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,781
When did I ever go shopping?

385
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,780
Oh!

386
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:46,981
"Oh?"

387
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:50,082
What, you saw that but you didn't see us
going into the same hotel room?

388
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:53,280
Stop the car.

389
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,982
She's my younger sister!

390
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,681
She's from Canada.

391
00:33:57,682 --> 00:34:02,381
You said hello back then to
my aunt's husband, right?

392
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:05,682
Oh!

393
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:28,381
So, what's your answer?

394
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:33,881
Wait, no.
Your answer isn't that important.

395
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:39,481
Because no matter what
anyone says, I'm marrying DaDa.

396
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:42,482
We can't get married just because
the two of us want to.

397
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:45,880
You don't have to tell me that.
I already know.

398
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,981
Sheesh, you're such a preachy teach.

399
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,880
That's "Teacher," thank you!

400
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,361
I've told you that so many times,
and yet you still don't know?

401
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,982
Yes, Teacher!

402
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,181
Don't think too long and hard about it.

403
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,381
This isn't exactly a simple matter,
you know.

404
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:13,582
Do you really want to see me get married
to another woman and live a happy life?

405
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,581
I don't want that, either.

406
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:22,482
I don't want another man by your side,
or another woman by mine.

407
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:27,781
I don't know how you've been,
but I wasn't okay at all.

408
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:31,781
I wasn't okay either!

409
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:38,082
Then just stay by my side.
Let's stay together.

410
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:44,381
Other people break up because
they don't love each other.

411
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,781
So I don't know why we have
to break up because we do.

412
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,881
What... did you just say?

413
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:58,482
I love you, Da Hyun.

414
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:11,682
What is it?

415
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:15,181
You're such a terrible person!

416
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:18,281
Why are you only telling me that now?

417
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:28,181
My job is important to me.

418
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:30,582
And make sure you get
your family's blessing!

419
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:35,281
What?

420
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:42,281
I can deal with everything you said,
but not those two things.

421
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:45,481
I worked hard for ten years
to become a teacher!

422
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:48,381
So I'll think about it after I've been
a teacher for ten more years!

423
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,081
Okay.

424
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,581
It doesn't really matter to me. I'm just
worried that it might be tough on you.

425
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,981
I'll let you know if it is.

426
00:36:56,982 --> 00:37:02,081
And... no matter how much
I may like you...

427
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:05,280
I don't have the courage to be hated
by people who'll become my family!

428
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:08,081
So you have to get
your family's blessing, okay?

429
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:11,781
Then... you'll marry me?

430
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,182
You mean that, right?

431
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:22,582
Wait, no. You already said
you would, so no backsies.

432
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:24,381
Okay.

433
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:34,082
I love you, too.

434
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,581
Um, aren't you leaving?

435
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:50,182
Can't I sleep over?

436
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,081
No, you can't.

437
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:55,322
We're going to live together
when we get married, anyway.

438
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,280
Who knows what'll happen later on?

439
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:00,521
We'll have to actually get
married to know that for sure.

440
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,182
So, are you saying that you're
not going to marry me, then?

441
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,880
I told you, yes!
I will.

442
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:09,880
But only after we get
our families' blessings.

443
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:12,182
I'll take care of that, okay?

444
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:19,182
I barely got a wink of sleep
this entire time.

445
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:21,682
So can't you let me sleep here?

446
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:28,381
That company sure is strange.
They don't even let people sleep.

447
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,681
Go home and sleep.

448
00:38:32,682 --> 00:38:35,181
No, the reason why I didn't get
any sleep is because of you.

449
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,581
Just stay by my side, okay?

450
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,881
That's the only way I'll
be able to fall asleep.

451
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:56,681
Um, I don't have any clothes for
you to change into at my place

452
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,881
and it'll be really
inconvenient for you.

453
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,682
It's not too late for you
to go home now, and...

454
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,181
Is it mine?

455
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,082
Oh, are you awake?

456
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,581
So it is you.

457
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:10,481
Geez, you!
What are you doing?

458
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:14,482
I thought that it was just
a dream this time, too.

459
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:22,682
It's not a dream.

460
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:30,781
Yeah.

461
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:33,482
I don't think it is.

462
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,281
What a relief.

463
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,182
I'm tired.

464
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:30,380
<i>Are you dating her again?</i>

465
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:34,780
<i>I can't bear to see her dating
and marrying another man.</i>

466
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:36,880
<i>- No way.
