1
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,938
Johnny English.

2
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,246
Five years ago,
he was our top agent.

3
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,882
Yeah. Took his eye off the ball
in Mozambique.

4
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,290
Does it have to be him?

5
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,098
He's the only one our contact will talk to.

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,931
So where is he?

7
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:12,600
You came here
to forget your life of shame.

8
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:20,642
But the path you must tread to new life
will be not be easy, English.

9
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:33,088
<i>Our purpose here is simple.
To strengthen what is weak.</i>

10
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,535
<i>Make hard what is soft.</i>

11
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,381
<i>This will take time.</i>

12
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,027
Mind must be master of the body.

13
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:13,529
<i>Strong mind can separate the body
from its suffering.</i>

14
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,809
Good concentration, English.

15
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,370
Sorry? Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

16
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,049
<i>You are not young.</i>

17
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:36,219
<i>But with age comes wisdom.</i>

18
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,045
<i>When mind
is master of the body,</i>

19
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,751
<i>you will be warrior once more.</i>

20
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,864
Master, what is my destiny?

21
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,761
I'm in touch with a higher power.

22
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:35,243
MI7 wants you on
the first flight back to London

23
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,255
Master, am I ready?

24
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,892
No.

25
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,627
Window seat or aisle?

26
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,959
One moment, please.
Good morning, sir.

27
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,361
Toshiba British Intelligence.

28
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,967
For electronic products press one.
To speak to an agent, press two.

29
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,339
Certainly, sir.
Can I redirect you to our website?

30
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,898
www.spyingforyou.gov.uk.

31
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,568
Toshiba British Intelligence.

32
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,578
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

33
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,639
Johnny English.

34
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,216
Pegasus is expecting you.

35
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,043
Look into the camera.

36
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:21,986
Don't smile.

37
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,232
Pamela Thornton, Head of Ml?

38
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,164
Johnny English.

39
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,832
Have a seat.

40
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,738
You've been away for some time, English.

41
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,011
But you haven't been forgotten.

42
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,611
Come on.

43
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,076
People here often talk about
your adventures in Mozambique.

44
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,690
Well, Ml? has come a long way since then

45
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,959
The guns, the fast cars, and the
chauvinism are all on their way out.

46
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,128
Frankly, I didn't want to see you back.

47
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,202
You are everything
I came into this service to change.

48
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,374
But my hands are tied.

49
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:15,207
And there are times when one
has to go against one's better judgement.

50
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,116
We have a situation.

51
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,878
Indeed.

52
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,317
There's a good puss. There's a good puss.

53
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,124
There's a good pussy. Who's a good pussy?

54
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,564
- I'm impressed.
- Who's a good pussy?

55
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,136
Philby never lets strangers pick him up.

56
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,069
I'm very much atone
with the animal kingdom.

57
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:47,143
There's a good puss. I know,
I know. Who's lovely? Who's lovely?

58
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,909
Who...

59
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,487
We're all lovely.

60
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,084
Kate Sumner, our behavioural psychologist.

61
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,751
I've heard a great deal about you.

62
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,694
Glowing reports, I trust.

63
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,990
Tell me, Ms Sumner,

64
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,262
what exactly does
a behavioural psychologist do?

65
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,706
Monitor observable behaviour
for signs of internal psychology.

66
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,610
We read people.

67
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:26,107
Well, we must get together sometime.
I think you'll find me a real page-turner.

68
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,685
Ah.

69
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,394
So, Pegasus, this situation.

70
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,630
Ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher
has contacted us from Hong Kong.

71
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,966
He has intelligence of a plot
to assassinate the Chinese Premier

72
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,069
at the Anglo-Chinese talks next week.

73
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,638
We need you to go and find out
what he's got.

74
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,817
Well, in that case, Pegasus, count me in.

75
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,814
Agent One will meet you downstairs.

76
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:14,560
So, I just scaled the walls,
blew the whole place to kingdom come.

77
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,158
An hour later I'm sitting in the bar
with a White Russian in my hand.

78
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,402
Who was very lovely, too, I can tell you.

79
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,598
Simon.

80
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,277
Hello, Johnny!

81
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,038
Simon,

82
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,711
you look wonderful.
But, then, you always did.

83
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,109
Welcome back. How long has it been?

84
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,419
I don't know. Five years, three months
and six days, or something.

85
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,015
Of course, Mozambique.

86
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,198
That was a balls-up with a cherry on top.

87
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,058
Come on, let's get you sorted.

88
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,034
Welcome to the toy cupboard.

89
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,545
I won't leave you my number.

90
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,743
You know Patch.

91
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,718
Patch Quartermain, the man himself.

92
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,811
English.

93
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,049
Please, don't get up.

94
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,486
No chance of that.

95
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,087
Lost them testing the
B-6 exploding brogues.

96
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,723
Oh, I'm so sorry. How are you?

97
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,595
Have to be this one, I'm afraid.

98
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,596
Lost this to the D-10 doorbell.

99
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,403
Ah. Well, it's great to
see what's left of you

100
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,846
This is rather good fun, actually.
Top speed of 60 mph,

101
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,110
and I've managed to add the odd thing.

102
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,753
This way. I haven't got all day.

103
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,924
Don't!

104
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,462
Would you stop meddling, English?

105
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,995
Here she is.

106
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,760
Ah, the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

107
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,195
Truly the Rolls-Royce of automobiles.

108
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,865
Armour plating, all the bells and whistles.
Say "Bonnet."

109
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,638
<i>- Bonnet.
- Command accepted.</i>

110
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,302
Voice activation recognises only you.

111
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,305
Rolls has fitted
one of their experimental engines.

112
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:16,614
The nine-litre V16. Goes like the wind.

113
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,386
Only quieter.

114
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,720
Beautiful.

115
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:22,983
Keep up!

116
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,622
Here's what you'll be taking to Hong Kong.

117
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,796
- Ah, yes.
- A satellite receiver,

118
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,131
tracking device, Semtex chewing gum.

119
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,329
Now, what did I just say?

120
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,975
That's the new P-two digital dart gun.

121
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:47,243
Gentlemen. May I remind you all that MI7's
current weapon of choice is dialogue?

122
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,654
We do love it when you get strict, Pegasus.

123
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,657
English, you go to Hong Kong tonight.

124
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,819
Fisher will contact you there.

125
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,489
To ensure protocol is observed,

126
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,026
I'm sending someone with you.

127
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,194
Agent Tucker.

128
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,533
It will be an honour, sir.

129
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,670
Well, it'll be good
to have somebody to carry the bags.

130
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:21,442
You made a laughing stock
out of this service once, English.

131
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,350
Not on my watch. Clear'?

132
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,218
Crystal clear, Pegasus.

133
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,397
Just like old times, eh, Johnny?

134
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,934
I'm off to Switzerland.
Let's catch up when you get back.

135
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,130
There's nothing I'd like more, Simon.

136
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,374
Has anyone seen
the voice-changing travel lozenges?

137
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,873
Um...

138
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,552
No. No.

139
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,272
Come on, Tucker.

140
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,782
I'm not 21 till September, sir.
I'm not really allowed in.

141
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,789
Tucker, you're an agent working for
Her Majesty's Secret Service.

142
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,620
Just act the part.

143
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,105
Ten thousand dollars' worth,
please, my lovely.

144
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,274
Thank you.

145
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,340
And a receipt, please.

146
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,321
Be alert for contact, Tucker.

147
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,227
We're looking for
a Chinese man in spectacles.

148
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,160
Would you like another drink, sir?

149
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,468
Sir, the Chinese man in spectacles.

150
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,462
- One more beer.
- No more bets, please.

151
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,299
Contact.

152
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,978
Evening.

153
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,936
Your grandmother is sick.

154
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,168
What?

155
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,545
Your grandmother is sick.

156
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,673
Well, she's dead. That's how sick she is.

157
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,795
Is he dead, sir?

158
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,865
Yes.

159
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,386
<i>- Hi, Mum.
- What's the matter?</i>

160
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,259
No, no, no, no. Nothing's the matter, no.

161
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,559
I felt a bit funny last
night, but I'm okay now.

162
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,601
So, what have you got for us?

163
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:09,072
The people behind the plot to kill Xiang Ping,
the Chinese Premier. A group called Vortex.

164
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,406
Never heard of them.

165
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,074
Paid assassins. The best there is.

166
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,285
Come on, Fisher, I need names,
I need evidence!

167
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,695
Vortex has a secret weapon.

168
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,531
This is one of three keys that,

169
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,671
when used together, gain access to it.

170
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,799
Without this, Vortex is finished

171
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,302
How did you get hold of it?

172
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,779
It's mine.

173
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,176
I beg your pardon?

174
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,384
Vortex is three of us.

175
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,792
Come off it, Fisher

176
00:16:54,981 --> 00:17:00,863
<i>You, a hired assassin?
You couldn't hit a barn door with a banana</i>

177
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,224
And as for Vortex,

178
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,065
clearly you got the name
off a box of washing powder.

179
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,368
Vortex was in Mozambique.

180
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,701
What?

181
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,368
Yeah? Really?

182
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,178
Mum? Mum, Mum, I gotta go. Gotta go.

183
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,716
We were all there
that day, Johnny-boy.

184
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,546
- Excuse me. Sir!
- What?

185
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,683
Sir, there's a...

186
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,426
Quick, come on! Come on!

187
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,668
Madam, let me help you with that.

188
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,606
Here. Yes, I think you
should vacate the area.

189
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,681
There are some
very dangerous people about.

190
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,079
There we go.

191
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,386
Get after her, Tucker, get after her!

192
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,127
What?

193
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,645
Sir! Sir!

194
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,413
Over here, Tucker!

195
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,783
I lost her, sir.

196
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,117
Look what I found.

197
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,423
This way, sir! This way!

198
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,463
You get down to the street.
I'll take the roof.

199
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,673
<i>You are not young.
But with age comes wisdom.</i>

200
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,256
Hand it over, chimp.

201
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,519
Come on, Tucker.

202
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,285
Can I help?

203
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,760
I am commandeering this vessel
in the name of Her Majesty.

204
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,488
Right-0, Wing Commander.

205
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,691
How exciting!

206
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,484
Now, what's your poison?
Can I get you something?

207
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,986
We've got vodka, rum.

208
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,389
Your safety is our priority.

209
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,863
But you can help us by familiarizing
yourself with this leaflet.

210
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,805
Créme de menthe, a smidgen of port,
and that's about it, I'm afraid.

211
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,844
I'm Shirley.

212
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,739
Hello, Shirley.

213
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,653
Just a tad to your left, Shirley.
Thank you.

214
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,232
I say, Wing Commander!

215
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,975
- Well played, sir! Well played!
- Just like a gladiator!

216
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,029
Come on. Put 'em up.

217
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,961
Well played, sir! Well played!

218
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,713
More champagne, my lovely.

219
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,086
Certainly, sir.

220
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,421
Tucker' are you sure
you don't want a Shandy or something?

221
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,827
I have got to finish this
mission report, sir.

222
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,526
And Pegasus wants to see us
as soon as we touchdown.

223
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,434
The mission report?

224
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,865
Oh, come on, Tucker. Live a little.

225
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,672
You should learn to savour success.

226
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,506
Work hard,

227
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,506
play hard. Isn't that right...

228
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,842
Barbara?

229
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,593
Vortex is finished

230
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,032
But better still,

231
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,804
for years I believed what happened
in Mozambique was my fault.

232
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,737
Now I realise it was only partly my fault.

233
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,873
What did happen in Mozambique?

234
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:03,897
Excuse me, sir. We're coming in to land.
Can I stow that overhead for you?

235
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,162
Certainly.

236
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,935
Sir, I don't think he's a "Susan."

237
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,334
But then you're not a linguist,
are you, Tucker'?

238
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:18,643
It's not "Susan," it's "Shoooshan."

239
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:23,184
From the Xinzhou region,
unless I'm very much mistaken.

240
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,783
Thank you, Shoooshan.

241
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,133
Foreign Secretary.

242
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,369
I hope you've got something
for us, English.

243
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,604
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned.

244
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,806
He has every reason to be so.

245
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,208
There is a plot to kill
the Chinese Premier.

246
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:58,812
Masterminded by a group of
ruthless assassins called Vortex.

247
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,949
Good Lord.

248
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,017
The danger, however, has been averted.

249
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:08,362
Now that we have this.

250
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,697
- English?
- Now, I know what you're going to say,

251
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,300
it's a pretty small object

252
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,909
Well, it's often the little things
that pack the biggest punch.

253
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,679
- After all, David killed Goliath with a pebble.
- Sir.

254
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,855
The mighty Vortex has been slain
by my possession of this small key.

255
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,613
Shoooshan.

256
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,877
Susan.

257
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,252
We got it, but Fisher talked.

258
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,094
Understood. We'll deal with English.

259
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,439
You've got some more cleaning to do.

260
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,873
Mummy, Mummy! Mr Rhubarb's here!

261
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,945
Izzie, darling, why don't you
show him into the conservatory?

262
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,211
I'll be with you in just a minute.

263
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,811
Okay. Come on, come on, let's go!

264
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,820
- Shall we?
- Hurry up, Mr Rhubarb

265
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,455
Perhaps when you've found your key,
you'll give me a call.

266
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,554
I'm very sorry, Foreign Secretary.
I had hoped to have more for you.

267
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,964
Oh, God.

268
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,935
Pegasus! I've got her!

269
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,695
Come on, you witch.

270
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,828
English?

271
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,465
She was in Hong Kong! She's the killer!

272
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,099
She's my mother!

273
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,841
Couldn't she be both?

274
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,819
Mummy, Mummy, are you all right?

275
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,814
Let me get you a cup of tea.

276
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,456
- You'll be fine, Mummy.
- Who was that man?

277
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,331
Yeah, I think a cup of tea,
that's what's required.

278
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,734
Pegasus, I am truly, truly sorry.

279
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,676
Don't apologise to me. Apologise to her.

280
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,989
I cannot apologise enough, Mrs Pegasus.

281
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,667
It was a simple case of mistaken identity,
I'm afraid.

282
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,836
Now, I completely understand

283
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,838
how upset you are,
but I was hoping perhaps...

284
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,903
Sir!

285
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,615
Tucker! That's her!
It's the killer from Hong Kong!

286
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,448
- No, it's not her, sir.
- It is! This time it's really her!

287
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,523
- It's not her, sir!
- Yes, it is!

288
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,362
Make way!

289
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,197
Sir.

290
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,362
You murderous crone!

291
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,031
Granny! What's he doing?

292
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,072
Take that! And that!

293
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,710
Hey! Stop it.

294
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,240
English!

295
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
I've got her this time, Pegasus!

296
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:29,082
This is the witch who works for Vortex!

297
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,592
Want any more' you old hag?

298
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,457
- English!
- Granny!

299
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,668
You humiliate me
in front of the Foreign Secretary,

300
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:50,235
you lose our only lead on Vortex,
and then you try and kill my mother!

301
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,577
Twice!

302
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,110
Pegasus, we have another lead.
Vortex was in Mozambique!

303
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,451
They were responsible
for the death of President Chambal!

304
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:04,584
No! You were responsible
for the death of President Chambal.

305
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,298
Well, you certainly gave Mr Rhubarb
a run for his money.

306
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,774
Still, at least we know Vortex
was in Mozambique.

307
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,713
When you told Pegasus,

308
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:32,016
you displayed all four indicators
of someone telling the truth.

309
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,992
This is a facial action
coding system.

310
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,159
Its high-speed cameras
record microexpressions,

311
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,827
invisible to the naked eye.

312
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,166
It detects what we call emotional leakage.

313
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:54,175
Ms Sumner, I'm a trained agent.
I don't "leak."

314
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,308
I want to take you back to Mozambique.

315
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,411
Is that really necessary?

316
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,981
Take a look at this.

317
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,917
<i>I want to take you
back to Mozambique.</i>

318
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,387
There.

319
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,657
Could we call that leakage?

320
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:19,332
Now, play ball.
I'm taking a risk being here after hours.

321
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,202
If Vortex was in Mozambique,
perhaps you saw something.

322
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,207
I'm going to take you back there
using hypnosis.

323
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,778
Oh, please.
Spare me the new age mumbo jumbo.

324
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,872
Mr English' please. I'm a professional.

325
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,415
I'm not going to just snap my fingers

326
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,352
and make you say the first thing
that comes into your head.

327
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,945
Plump pillows.

328
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,718
Excuse me?

329
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,589
Brilliant mind. Beautiful face.

330
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,027
Incredible.

331
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,690
And completely out of my league.

332
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,467
Mmm.

333
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,907
I'd like to take you back to Mozambique.

334
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,713
Tell me what's happening, Johnny.
Where are you?

335
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,651
<i>President Chambal's
inauguration day.</i>

336
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,052
<i>Yes, you're head of security.</i>

337
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,753
<i>Everything's going perfectly.</i>

338
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,057
<i>Today we climb the mountain!</i>

339
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,995
Agent English.

340
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,894
<i>The people
have spoken, and the message is clear.</i>

341
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,401
<i>A future of peace and prosperity!</i>

342
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,672
The backup electrical supply has been cut.

343
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,941
No, it hasn't. It's been turned off.

344
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,945
Do you know how to turn it on?

345
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,918
I should be getting back.

346
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,253
Well, operations like this
are always difficult.

347
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,423
But it's very satisfying
when you get a result.

348
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,331
The President couldn't be in safer hands.

349
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,961
<i>The future belongs to Mozambique!</i>

350
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,099
<i>Thank you.</i>

351
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,940
The fireworks have begun.

352
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,140
The sound of freedom and celebration.

353
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:23,658
Easy, Johnny. Easy. Go back.
Before the Jacuzzi, what did you see?

354
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,789
Yes.

355
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,166
Fisher.

356
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,303
On the terrace with two others.

357
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:41,468
Yes. All three members of Vortex
were there that day.

358
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,911
Who can you see?
Who can you see, Johnny?

359
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,686
<i>Artem Karlenko.</i>

360
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,481
<i>Artem Karlenko, double agent.</i>

361
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,323
<i>Recruited by MI7 in Moscow.</i>

362
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,656
<i>Retired after his penchant for
killing people threatened his cover.</i>

363
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,659
Five years ago, he turned up here

364
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,326
as Sergei Pudovkin.

365
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,201
Rich, very rich.

366
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,399
A member of the exclusive
Oakwood Golf Club,

367
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,874
<i>which is where you'll
be meeting him.</i>

368
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,672
He's in a match play competition, sir.

369
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,679
I'm making you his opponent for the day.

370
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,016
Done it, sir.
You're booked in as Mr Peter Adams.

371
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,091
Thank you, Tucker.

372
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:35,027
If Karlenko is Vortex,
I want you to bring him in. Alive.

373
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,480
Mr Pussykin?

374
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,624
Pudovkin. And you must be Mr

375
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,054
Um...

376
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,392
Adams.

377
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,227
Beautiful car, Mr Adams.

378
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,130
Ah, the Royce.

379
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,298
<i>Ready, sir.</i>

380
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,235
Thank you.

381
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,401
Shall we?

382
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,239
Let's go.

383
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,747
<i>Command accepted.</i>

384
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,483
So, what line of business are you in,
Mr Adams?

385
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,747
Pudovkin.

386
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,318
Sorry. Yes, I'm Mr Adams, and you're Mr...

387
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,916
Whoever you said you were

388
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,927
- Well...
- Stop!

389
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,928
Sorry, I thought I had forgotten something.

390
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,795
Glove, sir'?

391
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,129
I may not know much about golf, Tucker,

392
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,725
but I know how to hold the bat.

393
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,662
Shot, sir.

394
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,403
So, what line of business
are you in, Mr Puddykin?

395
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,575
I made my money
in the removals business.

396
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,191
A friend of mine had shares
in a removals business. Titus Fisher.

397
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,954
You haven't come across him at all?

398
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,126
I warn you, Mr Adams,
not to stray into the rough.

399
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,032
You get in there, you might never come out.

400
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,194
I'll bear that in mind, Mr Puddykin.

401
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:30,102
Pudovkin. Please.

402
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,216
Shot!

403
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,717
As was my friend Fisher, actually.

404
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,655
In the back.

405
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,820
By his cleaner, of all people.

406
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,101
But they didn't take much.

407
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:06,833
Just a key

408
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,479
Break, left to right, I think.

409
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,780
Thank you.

410
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,767
In the trees.

411
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,183
Come on.

412
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,620
- Oh, my God.
- He can't die. He mustn't die.

413
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,714
Let's get him out of here. Come on!
Come on.

414
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,121
He's not looking good, sir.

415
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,892
We're getting you to a doctor.
You'll be fine.

416
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,362
You do know how to fly these, sir?

417
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,700
- It was part of basic training.
- Good.

418
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,638
It's just like riding a bike.

419
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,476
Yes. It's all coming back to me.

420
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:47,266
This is helicopter
Golf Hotel Zulu Zulu Tango.

421
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:50,778
We have a casualty on board.
Request guidance to nearest hospital.

422
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,176
<i>Where's your exact location?</i>

423
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,613
Our location? Location?

424
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,050
She shot out the navigation system.
Hang on.

425
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,430
- Runstock.
- Our location is Runstock.

426
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,626
<i>What is your altitude?</i>

427
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,600
What's our altitude?

428
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,464
About 18 inches.

429
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,577
Hello? Hello?

430
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,248
Sorry. I'll just move.

431
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,877
What now, sir'?

432
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,548
We'll have to stick to the road.
Let's follow the 1328.

433
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,147
There's bound to be a hospital in Dingham.

434
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,057
Look after him, Tucker. Look after him.

435
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,738
- I think we're losing him, sir.
- We can't lose him, Tucker.

436
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,439
He's our only lead. Try something else.

437
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:06,578
<i>Don't give up on us, baby</i>

438
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:12,651
<i>Lord knows we've come this far</i>

439
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:23,834
<i>We are
The angel and the dreamer</i>

440
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,175
<i>Don'! give up on us, I know</i>

441
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:34,272
<i>We could still come through</i>

442
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,192
Look, sir! Follow that ambulance!

443
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,793
Good idea.

444
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,178
Sir. Sir, quickly.

445
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,187
Karlenko. Karlenko!

446
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,091
The second key.

447
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:28,569
Vortex is KGB...

448
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,998
- Yes.
- CIA.

449
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,577
Yes? Yes?

450
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,552
MI7.

451
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:57,132
Unbelievable. A vole in MI7.

452
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,566
A mole, sir.

453
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,869
What?

454
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,468
There's a mole in MI7.

455
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,703
There's a mole and a vole?

456
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:13,748
No, sir. There's a mole, not a vole.

457
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,918
Well, I disagree. There's certainly a vole.

458
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,749
I mean, we know that much.

459
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,416
But what you're saying is
there might be a mole as well.

460
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,454
Pegasus.

461
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,626
There's a meeting at MI7
with the Prime Minister.

462
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:40,004
And here again, eyes down
and to the left, indicating dissent.

463
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,338
With Xiang Ping, it's all about the eyes.

464
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,141
Thank you, Ms Sumner.
If the talks go ahead, I'd like you with us.

465
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,410
Yes, Prime Minister.

466
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,344
Good evening, gentlemen.

467
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,853
- Mr English.
- Ms Sumner.

468
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:56,819
Right.

469
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:02,461
So when is the Prime Minister
going to grace us with his presence?

470
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,595
I'm the Prime Minister.

471
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,635
Yeah, you wish.

472
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,542
All right. So we're all here.

473
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,121
These talks with China
are of paramount importance.

474
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,520
Rogue slates in Southeast Asia

475
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,887
have begun secretly to develop
nuclear weapons.

476
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,859
It is vital that we get China onside.

477
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,794
Traditionally, China has been
impervious to our concerns,

478
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,129
but I believe Xiang Ping,
given the opportunity,

479
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,830
can and will help defuse this situation.

480
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,371
Well,
with his pro-West stance,

481
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,237
it certainly offers an opportunity,

482
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,301
but the talks can't go ahead
unless we can guarantee his safety.

483
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,405
I believe, with the correct security,
that we can.

484
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:55,575
If Vortex is operational
it's just too dangerous

485
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,552
I'm inclined to agree, Prime Minister.

486
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,186
There is a way.

487
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,525
The Swiss are willing
to lend us Le Bastion.

488
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,823
That's their government
fortress in the Alps.

489
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,726
It's a stunning example of
architectural engineering at altitude,

490
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,668
and completely impregnable.

491
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,197
I mean, that should solve
all our security issues.

492
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,841
Then the talks go ahead.

493
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,880
Pamela, I hope you've brushed up
on your Mandarin.

494
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:28,779
I'd like you in the room with me,
and your best man on security.

495
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,716
Yes, Prime Minister.

496
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,020
Where are we on Vortex?

497
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,250
English?

498
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:42,888
Vortex is three men.
Fisher was one, Karlenko was another.

499
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,900
Karlenko was killed today
on the orders of the third.

500
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,571
Any leads?

501
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,866
Yes, but I need time.

502
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,772
We do not have time.

503
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,040
We need to know the identity
of the third person in Vortex.

504
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,049
Give me 24 hours.

505
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,130
Another bottle of Romaine-Conti?

506
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,967
Of course.
And would you like to choose dessert?

507
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,095
Yes. You.

508
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,102
And bring two spoons.

509
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,643
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

510
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:35,744
Cheers.

511
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,253
So, come on, Johnny,
what was it you wanted to ask me'?

512
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:50,163
Simon, do you know what this is?

513
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,801
Some sort of key?

514
00:49:55,926 --> 00:50:01,433
Karlenko and Fisher both had one,
and they were both killed for them.

515
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,713
Well, I'll give it to the boys
at the lab and see...

516
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:13,153
Karlenko told me that the third man
in Vortex is in MI7.

517
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,324
And you believed him?

518
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:30,496
Simon, I have to ask you a question,
face to face.

519
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:37,142
Do you have any idea who it might be?

520
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:43,307
Johnny, I thought
you were about to accuse me.

521
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,819
No! I mean, honestly.

522
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,819
- What?
- Simon Ambrose, the evil mastermind!

523
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,825
- Don't. Stop it-
- The traitor in our midst!

524
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,326
You! You!

525
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:55,691
Simon, you are so funny.

526
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,498
Hysterical.

527
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,029
Oh, dear.

528
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:07,201
Would you excuse me
for one moment, Simon?

529
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,249
- Sir.
- Tucker, can'! this wait?

530
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,054
Sir, it's Ambrose.

531
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,424
Yes, I know it's Ambrose.
I'm having dinner with him.

532
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,192
No, he's the third man in Vortex.

533
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,869
Simon Ambrose?

534
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,364
He went to Eton.

535
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:40,971
Simon.

536
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:42,203
Leave it.

537
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,372
- What are you...
- Move.

538
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,575
- All right, all right.
- Come on, move.

539
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,379
Tucker.

540
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,745
- You said you never knew Karlenko.
- That's right.

541
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,415
Then how do you explain these?

542
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:02,053
I hacked into Karlenko's computer.
You and him in Mozambique?

543
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,093
Sometimes I have trouble myself, old boy.

544
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,612
You're Vortex!
You're the third man in Vortex!

545
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:54,876
Tucker, this is ridiculous.

546
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,051
Sorry, I'll be with you in just a tick.

547
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,116
It's true, I was in Mozambique.

548
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,319
What?

549
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,125
I was there because of Patch Quartermain.

550
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,029
Patch? Sorry, I'll just be one second.

551
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,999
He's the man you're after.

552
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,629
- You're bluffing!
- Sorry.

553
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:19,038
I work for a secret organisation inside MI7

554
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,837
set up specifically to bring him in.

555
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,680
A secret Secret Service?

556
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:27,180
Yeah? What's it called?

557
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,807
What's it called?

558
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:32,985
Armitage.

559
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,817
A secret secret secret service
called Armitage?

560
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,524
We answer only to the PM.

561
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,162
It's extraordinary, Simon...

562
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,031
Indeed, it is.

563
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,365
...That you'd think for one moment

564
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:54,567
that I would fall for
such a steaming pile of old baloney.

565
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,908
Well done, Tucker.
You're not Spy of the Month for nothing.

566
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,210
- Thank you, sir.
- Here, let me take that.

567
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,544
Now go home.

568
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:06,621
- What?
- You're the one talking baloney.

569
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,520
You're in way over your head, boy.
Now run along.

570
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,050
No! I won't go, sir. He's lying.

571
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:16,460
You've let me down,
you've let the Service down

572
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,624
and, frankly,
I think you've let yourself down.

573
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,396
- But I...
- Now get out!

574
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:31,406
Patch Quartermain, of all people.
Blowing his own legs off?

575
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:34,539
Now that's what I call deep cover.

576
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,448
And to think how much I admired him.

577
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,610
He hates you.

578
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,885
- Really?
- He always has.

579
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,255
He thinks you're a moron
with no place in MI7,

580
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:48,955
a jumped-up grammar school nobody
That's why he tried to destroy you.

581
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:54,834
Now, Johnny,
just because he ruined your life,

582
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,769
that's no reason for you to go rogue
and take him down on your own.

583
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,071
God forbid I should put a crazy idea
like that in your head.

584
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,078
Good night, Simon.

585
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,610
Johnny, that key you showed me.
We might need it to bring him in.

586
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,995
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

587
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,997
Silly tit.

588
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,133
Bingo.

589
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,766
- Arrange a meeting with our client
- Of course.

590
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,624
Pegasus.

591
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,624
We have the third man.

592
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,300
It's Johnny English.

593
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,634
Hello, Patch.

594
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,372
Looking for forgiveness?

595
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,486
It's all over for you now, English.
It's the end of the line.

596
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:23,584
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Patch?

597
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,992
After all, I'm just a jumped-up
grammar school nobody, aren't I?

598
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,020
What are you talking about?

599
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:36,703
I know that you are the
third man in Vortex.

600
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,038
No, Johnny. You are.

601
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,679
No, you are.

602
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,511
No. You are!

603
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:51,512
Standby, all agents.

604
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,851
And it all ends here.

605
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,054
<i>Take him.</i>

606
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,736
Johnny.

607
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:57,945
Hey! Watch it!

608
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,948
Got him! Move! Move!

609
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,117
Don't lose him. Go, go!

610
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,421
Halt!

611
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,336
Heading west into Vine Street.
Mobilise all vehicles.

612
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,472
Idiot!

613
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,391
You've lost him! I don't believe it.

614
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,844
Oi! Who do you think you are?

615
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:09,778
Gotcha.

616
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:43,077
<i>Agent English, pull over! Pullover!</i>

617
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,271
Stop ii!

618
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,477
Get after him.

619
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,966
Kate, Kate, I'm not Vortex.
I've been framed.

620
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,374
You must believe me.

621
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,534
<i>How will it be done?</i>

622
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:18,603
Same as in Mozambique.
One person, apparently working alone.

623
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,413
Who have you chosen?

624
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,676
Leave that with me.

625
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:31,582
My account in Zurich.
500 million US dollars, as agreed.

626
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,607
You've been out for hours

627
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:03,718
Well, you're lucky it
was just a flesh wound.

628
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,160
Now, look, I'm going to Switzerland tonight,
but you can stay here while I'm gone.

629
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:09,955
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

630
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:14,331
I've been going through the news footage
from the night Chambal was killed.

631
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,329
And there's something not right.

632
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,600
Seconds after President Chambal was shot,

633
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:22,007
the assassin collapses and dies.

634
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,341
And the autopsy says heart failure.

635
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:30,475
But, if you go through
the classified CCTV footage...

636
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,413
You all right?

637
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,583
Yeah, fine.

638
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:40,686
Take a look at this.

639
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:46,994
Fifteen minutes before
the assassination, look, he's manic.

640
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,764
He's completely lost control of his body

641
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,830
And then, suddenly, catatonic.

642
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,970
Here, wait.

643
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,507
There.

644
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:02,143
Someone was talking to him.

645
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:09,788
I don't think he had any idea
what he was doing.

646
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,349
I think Vortex's secret weapon...

647
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:16,359
Is a mind control drug.

648
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,831
And only one fits the symptoms.

649
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,467
Timox... Timoxylin Bubby...

650
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,404
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.

651
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:30,308
The CIA ordered its destruction
10 years ago.

652
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,814
And the agent in charge of its disposal...

653
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,579
Titus Fisher.

654
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:42,983
I don't know how to thank you.

655
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,826
I'd love a take-away.

656
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,857
Consider it done.

657
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,833
Flying low.

658
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,543
So, Johnny, what are you going to do
about Vortex'?

659
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:11,712
I don't know. If only Simon was here.
He'd know what to do.

660
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,255
Why do you think he's better than you?

661
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,880
Well, the man's a god.

662
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,182
Well, I prefer mortals.

663
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,792
Pure, complicated, maddening mortals.

664
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,295
I've come to realise
that what's really exciting to me

665
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:34,432
is great loyalty,
determination, and courage.

666
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,106
You have always fascinated me, clinically.

667
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,944
But now you...

668
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:49,588
Ms Sumner, your pupils are dilating.

669
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,788
Are they?

670
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,786
Your cheeks are colouring.

671
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,428
Eye contact deepening.

672
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,665
Heart-rate rising.

673
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:08,932
Ms Sumner,
I believe we're emotionally leaking.

674
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:15,513
- The bedroom, quickly.
- Absolutely.

675
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,412
Now!

676
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,428
- Hello?
- Hello.

677
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,828
- Oh, Simon.
- Hi, Kate.

678
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,957
You ready? I'll drive you to the airport.

679
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,662
How nice. I'll just get my bag.

680
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,973
You alone?

681
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,839
- No.
- Of course.

682
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,105
Been working?

683
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:48,945
Been brushing up
on the Chinese PM. You?

684
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,848
We're trying to track clown Johnny English

685
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:58,993
There's some questions
we want to ask him, about Vortex.

686
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,686
I don't suppose you've seen him, have you?

687
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,853
No.

688
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,962
Not hiding him away?

689
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:08,962
Not my type. Shall we?

690
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,160
Mmm-hmm.

691
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,404
Ambrose.

692
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,804
There's a Mr Adams to see you, Colin.

693
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:34,176
- Hello, Tucker.
- What are you doing here?

694
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,183
Every agent in the country is after you.

695
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,684
We were right about Ambrose

696
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,713
What do you mean "we"?

697
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,118
And if we can act fast, we can still...

698
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,454
You wouldn't listen, would you?

699
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,393
You think you know it all. Well' you don't!

700
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,293
Being an agent means everything to me.

701
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,629
And, thanks to you, I'm suspended!

702
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,027
Would you boys like some orange squash?

703
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,002
- No, thank you.
- Bye, thanks, Mum.

704
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:05,477
Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland.
We are in Tooting.

705
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:09,676
I am here because my country needs me.

706
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,985
And because it needs you, too.

707
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,938
<i>- Royce.
- Ready, sir.</i>

708
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,079
Come.

709
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,111
<i>Obstruction detected.</i>

710
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:09,608
Set the sat nav for Switzerland
Let's kick some bottom.

711
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:44,907
<i>You have arrived at
your destination.</i>

712
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,743
<i>Good luck, sir!</i>

713
01:11:56,312 --> 01:12:01,421
Le Bastion. One way up, one way down.

714
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,634
Come on. Let's get the stuff.

715
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:15,371
Whoa, look. The T-2 ground-to-air missile!

716
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,106
That's a D-7 bulletproof shield.

717
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,041
Take it from me, Tucker.

718
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:24,016
I was working with these
while you were stringing conkers.

719
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,581
The P-8 grapple hook?

720
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:57,979
Check.

721
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,747
- Estimated height?
- Thirty-five feet.

722
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,344
All yours, Tucker.

723
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,253
Can I just say, sir'?

724
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,186
This is just great.

725
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,561
Well, go on.

726
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,441
The D-16 ascender, and up we go.

727
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:24,868
Are you sure that's the ascender, sir?

728
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,538
Yes, yes, I'd know it anywhere.

729
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,376
<i>Agent in distress.
Agent in distress.</i>

730
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:43,789
<i>Agent in distress.
Agent in distress.</i>

731
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,262
<i>I am over here!</i>

732
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,098
Shut up! Shut up!

733
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,035
<i>I am over here!</i>

734
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,714
<i>Activating visual locator.</i>

735
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,244
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

736
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,889
<i>Intruders in Sector Four!</i>

737
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:27,166
Dear God, let me not die
at the hands of the Swiss.

738
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:31,806
Tucker, now listen. I want you to attack me

739
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:33,505
- What?
- After a struggle,

740
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:37,414
you can "arrest me"
and take me inside as your prisoner.

741
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,010
- Sir, I can't.
- Tucker, that's an order.

742
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:43,790
Hit me. Hit me.

743
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,150
Come on, harder.

744
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:50,997
- Better, sh'?
- Yes, much better.

745
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,636
I can see how people get a taste for this.

746
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:00,437
I got a better idea. I'll shoot you!

747
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,169
No, no, no.

748
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,300
- Die, Vortex scum!
- Tucker!

749
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,708
Agent Tucker!

750
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,679
It's Johnny English.

751
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,018
Bag him.

752
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,644
The glass can withstand
mortar attack.

753
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,983
The door's one-way.
You can get out, but no one gets in.

754
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,347
Excellent.

755
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,752
You ready, Slater'?

756
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,160
I'll have them send refreshments
to your room

757
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,428
when you're ready, Pegasus.

758
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:03,094
Thank you, Agent One.

759
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,572
I'll take it from here, boys.

760
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:19,116
Hold it right there!

761
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,886
Let me see your ID.

762
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,124
- Excuse me
- What the...

763
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:30,758
Stop!

764
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,968
Warning, this is a
designated conflict zone.

765
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,206
Sir'? Sir?

766
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,496
- Thank you so much
- You're welcome, Pegasus.

767
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,464
Pegasus.

768
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:21,412
Go on. Go on.

769
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:30,486
What the hell is that?

770
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:40,295
Sir'? Sir?

771
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,300
- English!
- Pegasus.

772
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,107
They're going to make you kill Xiang Ping!

773
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,472
You're insane!

774
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,310
Agent One, thank God.

775
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:59,814
He won't help you.
He's the third member of Vortex.

776
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,855
Aren't you, Simon?

777
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,157
Here to give you some Timoxy bubby...

778
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,197
Timoxy bubby

779
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,562
Timoxy bubby...

780
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:22,037
To give you a drug that will make you
obey his every command.

781
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,482
I'm intrigued, Simon.

782
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:38,051
How exactly
were you going to administer it?

783
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,556
By injection?

784
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:53,096
Some hideous gas through the air vents?

785
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,847
Or by spiking her drink?

786
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,511
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.

787
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:16,259
He'll enter the manic phase
any moment now.

788
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:20,525
I have to warn you that I've been
trained to resist this kind of thing.

789
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,868
You swine.

790
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:28,702
Agent One, what's going on?

791
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,370
He's quite harmless at this phase.

792
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,709
The drug will kill him,
but just before it does,

793
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:37,113
there'll be a short window
where he'll do everything I tell him to.

794
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,551
Poor Johnny.

795
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,624
You were never really Ml-7, Johnny.

796
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,959
You were never really one of us.

797
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:55,399
Now you're about to become
our most famous agent.

798
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:07,069
You'll now do exactly as I tell you.

799
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,912
You are a traitor to the Service
and to your country.

800
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,508
Shut her up, old chap.

801
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,249
- Duck.
- What?

802
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,582
I warned you.

803
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:23,087
Okay, Slater. Let's get him ready.

804
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:27,431
Ready.

805
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:31,204
Premier Ping,
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

806
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:34,005
You had a pleasant flight, I trust?

807
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,434
I was just asking the Premier
if he had a pleasant flight.

808
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,438
Kate, Johnny's back on the team.

809
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:43,846
What?

810
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,510
It's all checked out and the PM
and the Chinese have approved it.

811
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,519
- Approved what?
- He's standing in for Pamela.

812
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,681
Isn't it great?

813
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:04,568
Excuse me. Agent Tucker.

814
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:13,204
Good, good.
And your wife is well?

815
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:20,147
<i>Lock it up, Johnny.</i>

816
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:21,653
Wonderful.

817
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:24,723
<i>That's it.</i>

818
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:38,763
Premier, I am most grateful you have
agreed to meet me at this time.

819
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,410
It is our pleasure.

820
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,577
Maintain that tone, Prime Minister.

821
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,446
Avoid confrontation, keep eye contact.

822
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,185
I can assure you that the Chinese people

823
01:21:55,277 --> 01:22:00,283
have always regarded the British
people as completely horrible.

824
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,095
- Honourable.
- Honourable.

825
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,532
Completely honourable.

826
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,768
Of course.

827
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,373
I was very keen to meet...

828
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:34,560
Johnny, stand up and go to the water table.

829
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:43,059
Premier,
I believe the present danger

830
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,899
can be averted if we act swiftly.

831
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,064
Go to your right pocket.

832
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,803
We designed it for Pegasus.

833
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,575
Well, it's too bloody late now.

834
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:00,345
Just act natural.

835
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:16,328
- Prime Minister, traditionally...
- Somethings wrong.

836
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:18,996
...China does not respond well to advice...

837
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:20,767
Pull out the barrel.

838
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:26,777
Now, Johnny, I want you to kill Xiang Ping.

839
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:31,881
Oh, dear God, no.

840
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,021
He's being controlled.

841
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,556
By who?

842
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,523
Ambrose.

843
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:41,993
Shoot Xiang Ping!

844
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:50,968
Mind must be master of the body.

845
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:56,139
He's resisting it.

846
01:23:57,466 --> 01:24:00,640
His left hand is fighting the right hand.

847
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,977
Come on, Johnny.

848
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,489
If I can interrupt the frequency,

849
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:11,524
I could stop Ambrose
from communicating with him.

850
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,704
English, stand up!

851
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,181
Come on. Come on.

852
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,389
He'll be dead in 50 seconds, sir.

853
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,391
Tucker!

854
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:53,359
Come on.

855
01:24:54,356 --> 01:24:56,131
- Pull the trigger!
- I'm in.

856
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,158
Listen to me, this is Simon Ambrose,

857
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:22,057
<i>and I order you
to shoot Xiang Ping!</i>

858
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:27,059
Ten seconds, sir.

859
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:30,764
Fire!

860
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:43,141
Go, go, go.

861
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,275
Time to get out of here.

862
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:51,088
Hold your fire!

863
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,525
Stand down!

864
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:20,211
His pulse is dropping.

865
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:21,719
Don't lose him!

866
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,289
Come on, sir.

867
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:12,434
<i>Open your head, English,
and you shall be reborn.</i>

868
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:27,111
Almost there.

869
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:57,475
Thank you, Kate.

870
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:58,880
I was passing.

871
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,918
Sir.

872
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,385
Tucker!

873
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,056
Welcome back, sir.

874
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:06,450
Thank you, Tucker.

875
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:07,925
I won't kiss you, if you don't mind.

876
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,722
Well, whatever.

877
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:14,894
Where's Ambrose?

878
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:28,439
English?

879
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,777
Sir. What are you doing, sir'?

880
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:35,286
Guideline 17-5: Never question
a senior agent in the field.

881
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:36,616
No!

882
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:20,360
Ambrose' you five-star turd.

883
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,379
Another balls-up, Johnny.

884
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,218
Ooh.

885
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,725
What's the matter with you?

886
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:26,417
It's all over, Ambrose.

887
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:32,623
You can betray your country,
you can cheat your friends,

888
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:36,258
but you can't get away
from Johnny English...

889
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,620
So long, Johnny!

890
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,359
The D-7.

891
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:05,457
The bulletproof shield!

892
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,525
Hey! It's not working!

893
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,995
It's the T-2, sir!

894
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:14,835
- Is he... Oh, he's alive!
- It's the T-2!

895
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,503
Close it. Close ii!

896
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,305
Stupid thing!

897
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,026
Oh, Johnny.

898
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:41,065
The T-2.

899
01:32:44,993 --> 01:32:48,406
Tucker, you clever boy.

900
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,090
I couldn't be more delighted.

901
01:33:10,185 --> 01:33:12,256
Vortex's paymasters have been arrested,

902
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:16,199
and China has expressed its gratitude
to both Britain and the Service.

903
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,228
We owe English a great deal.

904
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:26,910
Well, reinstating his knighthood
is a truly lovely gesture.

905
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:28,412
And it will mean the world to him.

906
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,909
Her Majesty will be with him shortly.

907
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,759
Gotcha! Gotcha.

908
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,344
Got you!

909
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:40,647
Just about had enough of you,
you old cow!

910
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:43,655
You're going nowhere! Pegasus!

911
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:44,815
English!

912
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:49,191
It's her! It's the killer cleaner!
Finally, I've got her!

913
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,791
You never know when it's over, do you?

914
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:59,737
Well, it's over, over, over, over, over!

915
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,017
I don't know how to thank you.

916
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,613
I'd love a take-away.

917
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:41,357
Consider it done.

918
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:50,000
