1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,932
I didn't know what was happening to me.

2
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,799
I thought I was gonna die.

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,400
He kept saying to us,
"I have no idea what this is."

4
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,566
"I've never seen this before.

5
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,533
I've never heard
of this before."

6
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,000
"We don't know
what's wrong with you."

7
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:57,667
Dark and not seeing
any light of recovery.

8
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,300
We have, I think, a horrible epidemic.

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,566
When enough people are sick,

10
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,866
it's gonna be, "Who's answering for this?"

11
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,567
What did you know?
When did you know it?"

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,232
What kind of a breakdown
or series of breakdowns

13
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,799
in the medical system
can lead to a setting

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,199
where you have an illness

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,399
and people walking into
their average doctors' offices

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,267
may or may not be likely to get
effective treatment for it?

17
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,632
I would never, never have thought

18
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:47,132
that a bacteriological infection
producing the havoc

19
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,366
that it produces
can become so politicized.

20
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,800
The truth can be so brutally distorted.

21
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,432
When we moved to where we are now,

22
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,299
the people we bought
the house from said to us,

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,632
"Be careful of Lyme disease."

24
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,566
And then we met all the neighbors.

25
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,332
Every house, for sure,
had at least one case,

26
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,566
and many houses had...

27
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,566
All of the family had been infected.

28
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,000
All of them were sick.

29
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:49,699
Are you able to stand up, honey?

30
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,032
All right, I'm gonna shut this off

31
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,632
so we can take you
back in the house, okay?

32
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,167
Okay. Okay.

33
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,166
All the articles basically state

34
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:10,132
that this really isn't
that big of an epidemic

35
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,032
and that it doesn't really
do that much to your body,

36
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,999
and that it's just
a very easy, quick cure,

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,966
a couple weeks of antibiotics,
and you're good to go.

38
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,367
Obviously, those people haven't
actually seen what it does.

39
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:30,432
Pain, pain, pain, relentless pain.

40
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,433
No one would believe it.

41
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,799
I said to my best friend,
I said, "Look at me right now."

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,232
Look at me.
What do I look like?"

43
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,099
And he said, "You look great."

44
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,633
I said, "You cannot imagine
the pain in my body right now."

45
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,000
My case was sort of cut-and-dry.

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,099
A, I was a park ranger.

47
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,066
B, I knew exactly when I was bitten,

48
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,566
and I saved the tick
and brought it to my doctor.

49
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,366
C, I had a red rash,

50
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,566
and D, I had a rather classic case

51
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,432
of neurological Lyme disease
with all the usual trimmings,

52
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,132
but I brought all that to the doctors,

53
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,033
and it took five doctors
to figure it out.

54
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,799
"I don't think you're sick.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,266
I don't think there's
anything wrong with you."

56
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,566
Everybody's telling you
it's in your head.

57
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:25,866
You know it's not in your head.

58
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,432
We don't think
there's anything wrong with you.

59
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,632
"There is nothing wrong."

60
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,132
"We've done your labs.

61
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,966
Your labs are fine.
You're fine."

62
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,766
"There's no medicine
for someone like you.

63
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,866
"You're an attractive girl,
and obviously,

64
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:42,300
you don't feel like you're
getting enough attention."

65
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,733
This is my adrenaline now.

66
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,432
So if you want to see me get worse,

67
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll just do one length,
not even a lap, half a length.

68
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,767
I'll have to be hauled out
like the catch of the day.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,732
She's become very,
very good at hiding symptoms.

70
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,899
It doesn't matter how bad she is.

71
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,866
I mean, the girl cannot get out of bed,

72
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,199
and her catchphrase is,
"I'll do it myself."

73
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,632
- I can do it myself.
- That's right.

74
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,866
I mean, she can do...

75
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,599
I can go grab something in 30 seconds,

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,632
or she can take four hours
to crawl across the house,

77
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,100
and she will not let me go get it.

78
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,866
I know what my bad days are like,

79
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,132
and I do my best to try to prevent them,

80
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,866
so to know that I could get worse,

81
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,467
that's not something
I'm looking forward to.

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,300
The unknown is pretty scary.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,566
I live on the west side

84
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,400
of the northern Sierra Nevada
in California.

85
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm a writer now.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,566
I was a park ranger for 21 years

87
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,567
until I got Lyme disease and had to quit.

88
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:40,032
It began with profound fatigue.

89
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,232
Then I developed stabbing
and shooting pains.

90
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,232
I started having vision problems,

91
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,799
blurred vision,

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
and then came the memory loss
and the cognitive problems.

93
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,599
And once, I drove to my office,

94
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,299
a place I'd commuted to for 13 years,

95
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,799
and stopped on the way home

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,866
and called my wife on the cell phone

97
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,599
and told her that I wasn't sure
I could find my way home.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,232
I just wasn't
in good enough shape to drive,

99
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,633
couldn't remember how to do it.

100
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,400
If I hadn't had any kids,
I might have killed myself.

101
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,599
My life was so uncomfortable
to be in instead.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,399
I don't know that
I would have wanted to be here

103
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,132
had I not had stronger
family connections, you know?

104
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,333
Kept me here.

105
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:50,432
I'm an event producer
for U2 shows on tour.

106
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:54,932
I get to do the VIP parties
for all the band's guests.

107
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,999
I've loved this band since I was a kid.

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,467
I mean, I had the freaking
personalized license plate.

109
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,432
Everybody's in survival mode on tour.

110
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:15,266
It's insane.
It's completely insane.

111
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:19,100
The hardest thing is,
everybody thinks I'm normal.

112
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,866
At home, I was in bed
and feeling just so sick,

113
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:44,199
and just searing, searing pain.

114
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,566
It got worse and worse,

115
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,566
and I started having pretty bad
neurological problems.

116
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,832
I got to the point of just do or die,

117
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,666
just go for something

118
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,833
instead of sitting in my room,
rotting in my bed.

119
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,799
Over the last 12 years,

120
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,732
I've been diagnosed
off and on with lupus.

121
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,566
Chronic fatigue syndrome,
Crohn's disease.

122
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,599
- Fibromyalgia.
- Lupus, fibromyalgia, MS.

123
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,066
- Fibromyalgia.
- Rheumatoid arthritis.

124
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,299
Doctors thought I had ADD.

125
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,732
- Chronic fatigue syndrome.
- Chronic fatigue syndrome.

126
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,699
- Parkinson's disease.
- Syphilis.

127
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,232
- Multiple sclerosis.
- MS to ALS to nothing.

128
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,232
They were pulling anything

129
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,566
out of their hat they could think of.

130
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,266
Doctor after doctor
after doctor after doctor

131
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:33,766
after doctor misdiagnosing her,

132
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,899
putting her on some medication
that didn't work

133
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,367
and just thought we were both nuts.

134
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,566
There's evidence that Lyme disease

135
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:47,366
has been around for a long time,
but here in the United States,

136
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,099
it was the early 1970s
when a Connecticut mom

137
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,332
looked around her neighborhood

138
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,632
and noticed something
was not quite right.

139
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,732
Well, I was frightened, really,

140
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,332
and doctors, you know, were insinuating

141
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,667
that it was all in my head.

142
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:07,666
In the '70s, we were all
having strange symptoms,

143
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:12,332
headaches and stiff neck
and swollen joints.

144
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,399
As I looked around the neighborhood,

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,166
I realized that there were others

146
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,966
that were having swollen knees
and rashes.

147
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,832
Finally, when our symptoms
just weren't going away,

148
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,132
I decided to call
the state health department

149
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,199
and report this mysterious disease

150
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,533
that seemed to be coming to our area.

151
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,966
In 1981,

152
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:41,133
I discovered the causative agent
of Lyme disease.

153
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:47,432
My discovery was published
in the Science magazine

154
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:50,833
and considered as a breakthrough.

155
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,166
We didn't know how to treat it.

156
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,799
It was a newly described germ.

157
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,999
It looked like syphilis
under the microscope,

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,032
but that's as far as we got.

159
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,566
We also didn't have any idea
how widespread it was,

160
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:09,166
how much suffering it caused,
and the controversies to come.

161
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,399
Lyme disease is caused by bacteria,

162
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
the Borrelia spirochete.

163
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,232
It's spiral-shaped,
so it can drill through tissue

164
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:22,099
and get into just about any part
of the body.

165
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,566
The most common form of transmission

166
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,866
is through the bite
of several species of tick

167
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:30,032
commonly known as deer ticks.

168
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,832
There's bacteria inside the tick,

169
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,566
so when it bites you,

170
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:38,066
it just starts sucking up your blood

171
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,299
like Dracula would do.

172
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,266
While it's, like, sucking in the blood,

173
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,232
the bacteria will be released,

174
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,632
and then it just gets into the blood,

175
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:54,599
and it gets into your heart,
and then your brain,

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,933
and then you have Lyme disease.

177
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,299
It'd seem like for every thing

178
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,432
that I'd read about it
that it was harmful,

179
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,032
there was always something
I'd read about it that said,

180
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,399
"No, no, no.

181
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,066
It's actually
very easy to cure."

182
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:20,032
Well, when I saw this doctor,
you know, he said,

183
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,167
"You've got
a long road ahead of you."

184
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,832
I, Mandy, take you, Sean...

185
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,032
- To be my husband...
- To be my husband...

186
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,299
- To have and to hold...
- To have and to hold...

187
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,066
- In sickness and in health...
- In sickness and in health...

188
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,632
- To love and to cherish...
- To love and to cherish...

189
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,900
- Until death do us part.
- Until death do us part.

190
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:15,232
- ♪ It's not the pale... ♪
- Husband and wife.

191
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:19,299
♪ That excites me ♪

192
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,666
There's no difference
in how I feel about her now

193
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,566
and how I felt about her then.

194
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,966
We'll see if he says that

195
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,932
when I'm starting to get treatment

196
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,233
and I'm all...

197
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:36,199
♪ No ♪

198
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,900
♪ It's just the nearness of you ♪

199
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,400
♪ ♪

200
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,132
I think, like a lot of people
who've had Lyme disease,

201
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,966
I've been led to wonder
why it's not being treated

202
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,600
with the kind of seriousness
that it deserves.

203
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,066
This is not a rare disease.

204
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,866
It's thought of as a rare disease,

205
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:12,599
but in fact, there's nothing
controversial about the fact

206
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,299
that it's the most common
vector-borne disease

207
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,332
in America today.

208
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,866
It is far, far more common
and much more dangerous

209
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:24,032
to the average American
than West Nile virus is.

210
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,899
The Centers for Disease Control

211
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,366
reported over 35,000 new cases last year.

212
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,899
Yet because the disease
is so often overlooked,

213
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,299
they admit that the actual number

214
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,699
may be up to 12 times higher,

215
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,800
making Lyme disease
far more prevalent than AIDS.

216
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,699
In the past 15 years,

217
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,699
annual cases have increased fourfold,

218
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,632
and in the past two years alone,

219
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:55,166
cases have almost doubled.

220
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,566
The number of cases
of Lyme disease went way up

221
00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:00,732
in this country last year,
up by 41% to be exact.

222
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,432
A record number of Lyme disease cases

223
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,566
have been reported in the state
of Maryland this year.

224
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:07,899
New cases of Lyme disease
are up 50% in Massachusetts.

225
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,466
The CDC admits
there are at least ten times

226
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,699
as many cases out there.

227
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,599
The entire neighborhoods
and whole families

228
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,232
are being debilitated
by this infectious disease.

229
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,766
Health officials
are now calling it an epidemic.

230
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:24,766
I think there are hundreds
of thousands of people out there

231
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:28,099
who have Lyme disease who have
no idea they have Lyme disease.

232
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,566
There are doctors out there
who aren't looking for it.

233
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:34,032
He just kept saying,
"You don't have Lyme."

234
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,266
"You don't have
Lyme disease."

235
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,299
"You don't have Lyme."

236
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,599
He told me there was no such thing

237
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,999
as Lyme disease in North Carolina.

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,599
"Lyme disease doesn't
really exist in Tennessee."

239
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,799
"You can't have Lyme disease,
because you haven't been

240
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,232
to these areas in Long Island
or this area in Connecticut."

241
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,299
I've been told it isn't Lyme
hundreds and hundreds of times.

242
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,432
How do you know you have it?

243
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,632
"Why do you say you have it?"

244
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:56,266
He slammed his fist
on the table and said,

245
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,133
"Don't talk to me
about Lyme anymore."

246
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,599
It is a national health crisis

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,566
that is completely and totally
being ignored and squashed.

248
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,767
What is going on?

249
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,232
We have a major problem
with this disease.

250
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,932
We have a major problem
finding out who's got it,

251
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,366
treating them effectively and quickly.

252
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,066
It's far more expensive
to treat in late stages

253
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,799
and less effective than it is early,

254
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,899
and yet we don't respond early enough

255
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,066
with many of the patients,

256
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,132
and many of them get to late stage,

257
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,800
and they're sick
for the rest of their lives.

258
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,566
Okay, quiet.
No barking.

259
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,966
No barking.
Okay.

260
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,599
- Have a good day.
- I love you, my girl.

261
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,966
I'll see you later.

262
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,866
I'm a medical doctor
with a specialty in pathology.

263
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,566
I'm a general pathologist,

264
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,832
but I'm doing molecular studies now

265
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,632
in connection with my 20 years
of researching Lyme disease.

266
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,932
The research is something that I do

267
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,199
after I've done my day's work,

268
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,632
and if I have energy left,
I work into the night,

269
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:11,133
so I do the research on my own time.

270
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:26,632
Okay, hi, Travis.
My lab assistant Travis.

271
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,666
This part of the cellar is mine.

272
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,932
The rest of the cellar
is for other things in our life,

273
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,166
like Christmas ornaments.

274
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,766
This is my microscope.

275
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:38,567
I've owned this for 20 years.
It's a research microscope.

276
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:42,566
My work is building bridges

277
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,632
between what I can see
under the microscope

278
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:46,966
and what is going on in the human body.

279
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:50,732
The orthodox, conventional view
is that the bacteria

280
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,899
that causes Lyme disease
doesn't stay around very long

281
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,232
inside the human body.

282
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:59,032
That will be disproven,
and we will enter an arena now

283
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,799
where long-term, chronic infections

284
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,666
will be embraced
by the medical community,

285
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,567
and the patient will benefit.

286
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:12,232
Alan MacDonald is doing frontier research

287
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:16,799
about the role of Lyme disease,
Borrelia infection

288
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,666
in neurological illnesses,

289
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,432
and he's doing it against
substantial resistance

290
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,299
in the traditional academic community.

291
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,199
I'm one man working alone,

292
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,332
and there is great skepticism
that my work has meaning,

293
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,299
and I'm working hard
to get some evidence to say

294
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,467
that there is some meaning,
and time will tell.

295
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,566
Two groups of doctors
are pitted against each other

296
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,566
over just about every aspect
of Lyme disease,

297
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,566
from the very definition of the illness

298
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,300
to how it should be treated.

299
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,166
At the present time,

300
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,932
the traditional medical community

301
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,566
believes that there is
basically only an acute form

302
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,132
of the disease that is characterized

303
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:11,199
in a sound byte as "hard to get"
and "easy to treat."

304
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,966
For 10 or 15 years, there's been
a second group of Lyme doctors

305
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,732
that say, "No, that's not true."

306
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,566
"Lyme disease can be
a persistent, chronic illness

307
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,766
with many different symptoms."

308
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:27,432
So the question that is posed
at the present time is,

309
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,167
"Does chronic Lyme disease
really exist?"

310
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:45,966
We are driving from Orlando up
to North Carolina.

311
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,132
It's a little over 500 miles,

312
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,466
which is the closest spot
that we have to Florida

313
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,067
that actually has a clue about Lyme.

314
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,632
My biggest fear is that treatments

315
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,767
would be unsuccessful.

316
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,566
She could continue
to have a downward spiral.

317
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,600
Neurologically, she could have
things that are irreversible.

318
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:17,900
Yeah.

319
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,567
Okay.

320
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,299
While we're optimistic that
Mandy will steadily improve,

321
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,366
I'm skeptical that it's gonna be
smooth sailing.

322
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,566
She's so fragile,

323
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,299
and her central nervous system
is so irritable.

324
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,632
It doesn't take a lot to set her off.

325
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,399
We have to figure out what's the best way

326
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,066
to treat you intermittently
to get you to the best place

327
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,832
so that your immune system
is more in charge,

328
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,300
so that's a tricky business.

329
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,599
He said, "Well, we're gonna
have to do six to eight months"

330
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,199
"of antibiotic therapy.

331
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,599
"We'll have to put a catheter in,

332
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,899
"you know, to your superior vena cava,

333
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,699
and then you're
gonna probably get worse."

334
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,132
So I said,

335
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,566
"Well, by worse, do you mean,
like, emergency room worse?"

336
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,032
And he said, "Yeah."

337
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,266
Let's just do one at a time.

338
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:31,132
Let's do this one,
and this is as needed, right?

339
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,566
Lorazepam, and then here,
your supplements, that's fine.

340
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:34,999
These are all fine.

341
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,166
What I sense is that we're
at the beginning of something

342
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,599
that's gonna be huge,

343
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,099
just like I had that feeling
20-some years ago with HIV.

344
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,766
I've been seeing people
from all over the country.

345
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,666
They're sick.
They've got a complex illness.

346
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,999
They're being ignored.

347
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,899
It's gonna be
an explosive area of medicine,

348
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,899
and we're gonna learn
a lot about chronic illness,

349
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,566
and I think that's gonna help health care

350
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:56,527
in general tremendously.

351
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,799
I have seen probably 30, maybe
more, doctors.

352
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,866
- 30 doctors.
- About 15 doctors.

353
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,732
I've spent over $100,000 out of pocket.

354
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:15,066
- $150,000.
- $75,000 to $100,000.

355
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,832
I was misdiagnosed for 3 years.

356
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,466
- 5 years.
- 14 years.

357
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,699
15 years.

358
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
It's hundreds of thousands of dollars.

359
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,666
I'm guessing that my case,

360
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,666
which could have been
controlled with, probably,

361
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,566
a single bottle of doxycycline
at the time I was bitten,

362
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:44,366
probably would have cost
something like $25 or $50 total

363
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,566
plus the doctor visit.

364
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,932
As it is, I'm guessing
that my case has now amounted

365
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,067
to $75,000 to $100,000.

366
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,632
My concern is that
the majority of the patients

367
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:05,199
that I see here in this office,
this very office,

368
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,166
who come to me
because they've been treated

369
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,566
for chronic Lyme disease,

370
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,999
is that they don't have any evidence

371
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,566
of ever having had
Lyme disease once, ever,

372
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,599
not now, not a year ago,
not five years ago.

373
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,566
They didn't have the rash.

374
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,666
They never had a positive blood test.

375
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,766
They never had anything.

376
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:29,766
You see, class,

377
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,567
my Lyme disease turned out to be...

378
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,200
psychosomatic.

379
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,332
No, that means she was faking it.

380
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,132
No, actually, it was a little of both.

381
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,599
I was originally told
at the very beginning

382
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,799
that I had a very deep
psychological problem.

383
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,766
They were telling me it wasn't real.

384
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,699
They said I needed to see a psychiatrist.

385
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,199
"You need
to see a psychiatrist."

386
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,232
He told me, "No, it's not Lyme."

387
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:57,332
You don't have the rash.
You are depressed."

388
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,166
"You're faking it.
You need to get mental help."

389
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:02,099
"You're a teenager.
Get up and walk."

390
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,599
"She doesn't want to go to school.

391
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,266
You know, she's just depressed."

392
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:06,799
You think you're crazy, but I'm not.

393
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,799
I know I'm not crazy.

394
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
This thing screws you up big time.

395
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,666
Tallyho.

396
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,766
Let the drag begin.

397
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:20,366
Well, where we are now
is a town in Cape Cod,

398
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,567
and Cape Cod is considered to be
endemic for Lyme disease.

399
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,332
I'm good.

400
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,299
This is a male deer tick
that we picked up

401
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,167
from the ground on
our very first 30-second drag.

402
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,966
This is a deer tick nymph.
This is the second stage.

403
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:44,432
They'll feed on a host
for five days, maybe,

404
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,332
and that's how Lyme disease
is transmitted,

405
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,732
and it just doesn't seem possible

406
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:52,866
that this poppy seed-size thing
is gonna make you bedridden,

407
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,366
possibly for the rest of your life.

408
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:59,566
Now we're trying for a deer tick female.

409
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,466
That'll complete the trinity.

410
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,332
And here we are.

411
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,666
The trinity is complete.

412
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:07,732
There are two females.

413
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:10,766
Let's call them Thelma and Louise,

414
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,733
and they're on the hunt.

415
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:15,799
There's another male.

416
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,866
There's another nymph.

417
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:20,232
We got another nymph.

418
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:23,566
So our odds of getting
Lyme disease here are going up.

419
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:28,966
Despite years of education,
the incident of Lyme disease

420
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:32,466
has been raised by 40% from last year.

421
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,033
It's only going up.

422
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,099
This is all tick habitat,

423
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,567
everything we're driving by here.

424
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:46,032
And Lyme is turning up in states
where it's never been known.

425
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:48,766
I mean, I grew up
in this part of the world,

426
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,932
and we didn't have a problem
with Lyme disease

427
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,032
that we know about.

428
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,966
I'm convinced that in the long run

429
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,332
that what we're gonna learn is

430
00:25:56,333 --> 00:26:00,700
that we're seeing a process
of ecological change.

431
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:11,066
We're living in the largest
extinction in 65 million years

432
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,932
of other forms of life.

433
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,699
While many species are dying out,

434
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,099
viruses and bacteria
are finding new opportunities.

435
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,066
Warming climates, jet travel,

436
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,932
and human expansion
into wildlife habitats

437
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:29,599
are favoring diseases that jump
from animals to people,

438
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,400
diseases we're not prepared for.

439
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,566
It's possible that, years ago,

440
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:39,266
the patients were only getting
pure Lyme disease,

441
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,099
and this might explain
why the literature,

442
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,666
there's such a disparity,

443
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,966
where some people say, "Oh, no,
Lyme doesn't look like this."

444
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,132
What we're now seeing is,

445
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,566
these ticks are containing
multiple organisms.

446
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,866
They're not just containing
Borrelia burgdorferi,

447
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,299
the organism that causes Lyme,

448
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,899
but they're containing
ehrlichiosis, Babesia microti.

449
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,400
It's a malaria-like organism.

450
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,399
When you get Lyme
and ehrlichia and Babesia

451
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,699
and Bartonella henselae,
cat-scratch fever,

452
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,032
and Mycoplasma fermentans and viruses,

453
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,466
the immune system gets overwhelmed.

454
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:13,866
I'm not sure, years ago,

455
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,232
all of these co-infections
were present as they are now.

456
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,332
Now the patients
who are coming in to see me

457
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,866
are multiply co-infected.

458
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:22,199
They're much, much sicker,

459
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,700
and it's because
it's no longer just Lyme.

460
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:41,032
"Ticks are very sensitive to dryness.

461
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:44,032
"Their bodies desiccate easily,
and in dry weather,

462
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:47,566
"they hide deep in mossy
crevices on the barks of trees

463
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:51,366
"or in the leaf litter
or in wood rat nests.

464
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,432
"Damp weather, however,
makes them more active,

465
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:57,566
"and they come out and stand
around the tips in branches

466
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:01,266
"and blades of grass
by trails like hitchhikers

467
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,567
at a freeway on-ramp."

468
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,632
I want us to see clearly

469
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:13,632
how things are really going with nature.

470
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,699
We have not succeeded in developing

471
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,399
any level of independence from it,

472
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,367
nor, in fact, are our bodies
in any way independent of it.

473
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,099
We've always said,

474
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,866
"Well, you know, sooner or later,

475
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,566
"some of the damage
that we do to the Earth

476
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,766
can come back to people,"

477
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,432
but I think at some visceral level,

478
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,166
we've expected we could evade it,

479
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,899
and I think now

480
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,566
maybe some of that bill is coming due,

481
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:40,099
and we're beginning to see
some ecological changes

482
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,600
that are capable
of invading people's bodies.

483
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:50,566
A spirochete is a parasite
like a virus is a parasite.

484
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:54,166
It has to adapt
to different environments.

485
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,399
So you could have

486
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,366
a very virulent,
disease-producing organism.

487
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,399
You could have one that likes
to go to the joints

488
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,832
and doesn't want to penetrate
and cause injury in the brain.

489
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,633
You could have one that goes to the skin.

490
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,866
One of the hallmarks
of the onset of untreated Lyme

491
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,399
is a multisystem involvement,

492
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,767
different parts of the body,
things changing, moving around.

493
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:23,132
You might have a few weeks of body aches,

494
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,999
and then you might have
a few weeks of headaches

495
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,966
and a few weeks of real profound fatigue

496
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,466
and few weeks of confusion,

497
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,166
or you'll have pain in the large joints,

498
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,199
and then it'll switch
to the small joints,

499
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,432
and then, you know,
you're going to a neurologist.

500
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,332
Then you're going to a bone doctor.

501
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,099
Then you're going
to a stomach specialist.

502
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,566
Then you're going to a counselor,

503
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,432
and they get labeled as being crazy.

504
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:44,099
- Severe headaches.
- Cognitive problems.

505
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,966
- Fatigue, headaches.
- Cardiac arrhythmias.

506
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,766
It hurts on my foot.

507
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,666
Joint pain.
I have arthritis.

508
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,166
I'm tired.
I hurt.

509
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,632
- Involuntary movements.
- Brain fog.

510
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,466
I lost the use of my right arm.

511
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:02,232
- I became dyslexic.
- I had hallucinations.

512
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,366
- Blurred vision.
- Light sensitivity.

513
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,932
It's a long laundry list.

514
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,132
The tests for Lyme disease

515
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,066
were developed more than a decade ago.

516
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:13,232
They were controversial
back then, and in all this time,

517
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:14,999
no better tests have been approved

518
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,499
even though almost everyone agrees

519
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,666
there are problems
with the current tests.

520
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,799
About 50% of people
who actually have Lyme disease

521
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,966
are negative in their test results

522
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,232
with existing methods.

523
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,999
If you're unlucky
and you have real disease

524
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,332
but you test negative,
your disease is still real,

525
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,267
and you still require treatment.

526
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,367
When I got diagnosed
with Lyme, I thought, "Great."

527
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,899
"Fantastic.

528
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,366
"Finally, finally, I'm gonna
get rid of this thing.

529
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,532
Course of antibiotics,
I'll be good to go."

530
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:58,899
I could never have imagined
that it would be this long

531
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,932
with the possibility of being forever.

I'm very scared of...
Actually when the tour ends,

541
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:51,333
because I feel like my body
will collapse.

542
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:55,199
I'm a little...

543
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,166
You know, I'm definitely going
on adrenaline,

544
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:01,399
and the pain's getting worse and worse,

545
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,399
and I'm getting, you know,

546
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,367
more twitchy neurological things.

547
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,600
This is a brilliant distraction.

548
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:32,566
It's so weird, you know?

549
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:33,699
When you're a kid,

550
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,232
you think of what your life's gonna be,

551
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,999
and I'm 36.

552
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,666
I'm gonna be 37,
and by now, kids and a house

553
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:47,033
and, you know, it's not what I expected.

554
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,999
Lyme pushes you to the point of,

555
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,332
"What do you want?
What are you living for?"

556
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,933
It's not enough just to be alive.

557
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,700
I mean...

558
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,132
This is the height
of the season for baseball,

559
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:27,966
summer vacations, and Lyme disease.

560
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,632
The disease is now being
reported in almost every state,

561
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,566
and it's reached epidemic levels
in some parts of the Northeast.

562
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,732
The newest research indicates
the tiny bacteria

563
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:39,099
pose a special risk during pregnancy,

564
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,866
since an expectant mother
may not know she's infected.

565
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,666
We have examples of the infection

566
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,099
causing miscarriage.

567
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,232
We have examples of infection
causing death of the baby

568
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:52,632
at the time of birth
or shortly after birth.

569
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,566
I've had four miscarriages,

570
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:57,199
two of which were positive
for Lyme disease,

571
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,732
and we had an 18-week loss
that at 15 weeks was healthy,

572
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,566
genetically fine, and at 18 weeks,

573
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:08,167
the loss was proven
to come from the Lyme infection.

574
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,699
Elise came to me with Lyme disease,

575
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,632
and it just so happened

576
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:17,099
that as she was finishing up
the treatment, she got pregnant,

577
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,432
and we followed her with the pregnancy,

578
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,766
and she was doing fine initially,

579
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,207
and all of a sudden, she miscarried.

580
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,699
Two weeks later,
the OB came back and said,

581
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,899
"You were right.

582
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,866
"It was Lyme disease.
The baby was infected.

583
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,799
The fetus and the placenta
were infected, Elise,"

584
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,899
and concluded that
that's what took the life

585
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,299
of this baby at 18 weeks.

586
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,932
In utero fetal transmission
of Lyme disease to a fetus

587
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:42,866
is something that has been
of concern to patients

588
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:45,599
and physicians for many years.

589
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,866
We've looked carefully at that.

590
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,399
There have been numerous studies.

591
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,666
There's not been one documented
case of congenital Lyme disease.

592
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:56,266
Well, that's nonsense plain and simple,

593
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,799
and it's not only nonsense,

594
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,466
there's significant,
peer-reviewed articles

595
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:05,632
showing transmission transplacentally

596
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:08,666
and at autopsies.

597
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,566
It's just nonsense.
How could that not be?

598
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,632
It doesn't even stand up physiologically.

599
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,300
That makes no sense.

600
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:23,099
Trying to have another baby
has been very frightening.

601
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,866
When I get excited about having a baby,

602
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:26,866
I squish it.

603
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,232
I don't let myself get excited,

604
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,199
because I'm so afraid
of setting myself up

605
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,567
for that disappointment again.

606
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,132
And a day for me is like a lifetime,

607
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:43,332
and every visit to the doctor
is filled with fear.

608
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,866
Every time I listen to that
Doppler come down to my belly,

609
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:49,767
I wonder, "Is there going
to be a heartbeat today?"

610
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,866
At this point, I have had many women

611
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,966
who have gotten pregnant
who've lost the baby

612
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:57,966
or they give birth to a baby
that has Lyme,

613
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,599
and the babies don't have...

614
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,332
The developmental growth may be off.

615
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,899
Their IQ may be lower.

616
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,332
They may develop seizures

617
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,332
or some other type
of neurological problem,

618
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,566
and it's not picked up

619
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,367
because the mother
was not known to have Lyme.

620
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,032
You can't imagine this.
How could you?

621
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,800
You just can't.

622
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,966
Hi, my name is Jared.

623
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:35,099
Before my Lyme disease
got so bad, I was able to talk.

624
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,233
Now I have to use a communication device.

625
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:46,932
I wasn't a real healthy
pregnant mom with him.

626
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,366
Well, in retrospect,
I realize that I was sick.

627
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,766
I had Lyme disease,

628
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:53,800
and I did not realize
that that's what was going on.

629
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,699
I knew something wasn't right
from the time he was born.

630
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,999
I knew it.

631
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,566
I kept getting pooh-poohed
by the doctors.

632
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,232
They said, "Just let him be,
and it'll all work out,"

633
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,800
and it didn't work out.

634
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,332
At age six, we got the news
that he had brain damage,

635
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,900
and they didn't really know why.

636
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,632
They thought it was something
that happened in utero

637
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:34,432
and that the damage was done,

638
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:38,566
and then we were to just keep
moving forward,

639
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,566
but he didn't move forward.

640
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:41,800
He kept moving backwards.

641
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,766
Need you to bend, bud.

642
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,399
Lyme disease happened to be
everywhere around us by then.

643
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,232
It was as if every neighbor
was coming down with it,

644
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,666
and it was, like,
hitting me from every direction

645
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,432
as if, you know, "Wake up, dummy."

646
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,099
"You're not paying attention, you know?

647
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,933
There's Lyme disease
everywhere."

648
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,032
There's a gentleman that lives
right up on the hill up here,

649
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,299
and his previous wife passed away.

650
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,199
She had Lyme disease,
and now he's remarried,

651
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,199
and his new wife has Lyme disease.

652
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,066
This man here was very ill
from Lyme disease.

653
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,966
And the house over here to your right,

654
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,699
those people had it,

655
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,566
and the same
with the lady that lives here.

656
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:27,567
She has it.

657
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,066
I had put a lot of faith in the doctors.

658
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,699
I believed them.

659
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,799
I want to just shake them and say,

660
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,866
"How many more kids

661
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,832
"are you going to let go untreated

662
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,967
because you're not recognizing
what's happening here?"

663
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,332
I've never seen a child

664
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,832
who's had late-stage
neurologic Lyme disease.

665
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:55,133
We just don't see late
neurologic disease in children.

666
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,666
I used to do ballet,

667
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,267
and I was in The Nutcracker
a bunch of times.

668
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,966
That time of year
was always really crazy and...

669
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,899
Running around,
going to rehearsals and stuff,

670
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,200
but I loved it.

671
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:26,866
Her ankle was bothering her,
then her right knew blew up,

672
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,032
and they tapped into it,

673
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,732
and they found
that she had late-stage Lyme

674
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:30,693
and it was in her brain.

675
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,832
She just went downhill
very fast all of a sudden.

676
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,299
She couldn't pick up a knife,
pick up a fork,

677
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,232
couldn't write with a pencil,

678
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:51,800
and this all transpired
in the timeframe of overnight.

679
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,266
They insisted that she's making it up

680
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,966
and that she was gonna have
to go on psychiatric medication

681
00:39:58,967 --> 00:39:59,933
if she didn't stop it.

682
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,666
Rock bottom, to me,

683
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:16,167
was that summer
before we went to see Dr. Jones.

684
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,366
She couldn't hold her head up.

685
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:20,699
She couldn't sit up.

686
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,832
She couldn't talk anymore,

687
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,499
and not knowing
if they were gonna keep her

688
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,499
on the medication,

689
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,666
'cause they kept saying to me,

690
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,166
"No, only 28 days,"

691
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,932
and I said,
"Well, I'm going to Connecticut,

692
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,732
and I'm gonna see this other doctor,"

693
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,132
and them fighting me and saying,
"Well, he's controversial,"

694
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,567
and something in me just
kept saying, "No, you're going."

695
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,266
The thing that gives me most joy

696
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:48,566
in treating
the children with Lyme disease

697
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:51,433
is seeing them get well and cured.

698
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,832
I don't consider it a job.

699
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,499
I consider it to be, more or less,

700
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,233
like a calling than anything.

701
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,166
My practice consists
of over 9,000 children

702
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:11,166
from every state in America,
from South America,

703
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:13,432
from almost every province in Canada,

704
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:17,332
and from every continent abroad.

705
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,099
The practice is growing

706
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,332
at the rate of five to ten
new encounters per day.

707
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,199
They have very complex,
serious illnesses.

708
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,233
However, it's nice to see them get well.

709
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:42,966
Some of the Lyme-literate physicians

710
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:48,666
are practicing medicine
that is widely outside

711
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,699
of the standards of medical care.

712
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,099
The small group of physicians feel

713
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,932
that one can diagnose Lyme disease

714
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,766
on clinical grounds alone,

715
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:00,666
not necessarily relying
on any laboratory data,

716
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,099
and then, furthermore,

717
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,566
long-term antibiotics
are the right treatment.

718
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,832
That has never been shown

719
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:10,266
in any double-blind,
controlled, randomized trial.

720
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:11,832
I've worked here for eight years,

721
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,099
and I've seen many patients come and go,

722
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,299
and I've seen the success he's had

723
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,299
in his treatment regiment.

724
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,700
Yes, we do treat aggressively,
but I think that's what works.

725
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,566
In a way, it's like
the perfect storm of diseases,

726
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:29,799
because of the timing
of a couple different events

727
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,332
in the history of medicine.

728
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,466
1980, the United States said it was okay

729
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:39,399
for government institutions
and universities to patent

730
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,733
and profit from live organisms.

731
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,566
So the Lyme disease organism
was discovered in 1981,

732
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,466
and all of a sudden,
there was the equivalent

733
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:49,999
of an Oklahoma land grab,

734
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,999
people looking under their microscopes,

735
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,432
patenting pieces of the organism,

736
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,199
so the people that are credited

737
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,599
for being the Lyme disease experts

738
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,799
no longer shared information

739
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,166
about a new, really dangerous pathogen.

740
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,699
They hoarded the information

741
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,099
because they wanted
to protect future profits.

742
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,732
You have professors,
especially in the biosciences,

743
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,666
are trying to take their discoveries,

744
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,799
often made on the federal nickel,

745
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,466
and take them private.

746
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,133
They patent them.
They start firms.

747
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:25,566
What's commercialize-able
is driving the research agenda

748
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,199
in too many cases,

749
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,367
not what's medically necessary
and what's medically useful.

750
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:36,366
The other thing that happened
was the rise of managed care.

751
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:38,666
Insurance companies and HMOs realized

752
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,966
that if they can get researchers
in universities

753
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:44,799
to define diseases and write guidelines

754
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,566
for diseases a certain way,

755
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,666
then they could help manage
the escalating medical costs,

756
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,799
and really, what this means is,

757
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,732
the people who previously
protected public health,

758
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,299
so, like, the CDC,
the Centers for Disease Control,

759
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,566
and the NIH and universities,

760
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,032
who didn't have any commercial interests,

761
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:04,199
all of a sudden, they were
partners with big pharma,

762
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,766
and their motivations completely changed.

763
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:10,332
We no longer had oversight
and checks and balances

764
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:12,699
in our scientific system
in the U.S.

765
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,566
It was rife with conflicts,
and just now, 20 years later,

766
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:17,932
we're beginning to see what happens

767
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,567
when you have unchecked
conflicts in medical care.

768
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,066
Okay, today is July 5th,

769
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,967
and Mandy's having
a little bit of an episode.

770
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:51,067
It's a feeling of being
trapped within your own body.

771
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,199
So it's like being wrapped up
real tight like a mummy

772
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,566
so you can't move anything

773
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:02,799
and then having tape across your mouth

774
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,767
so you can't say anything.

775
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:13,233
But reality is, you got to kill 'em.

776
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:19,200
You got to kill the little bugs,
because they're taking over.

777
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,999
No, no, I was okay.

778
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,366
I was adapting my life
to what was going on.

779
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,567
Now I want it back, so it's a war.

780
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:52,366
It got so bad after the tour,
'cause I really did some damage,

781
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:55,000
wasn't willing to admit it
to myself or anyone.

782
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,199
I'm in Seattle, Washington,
to seek Dr. Klinghardt,

783
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,066
one of the foremost specialists
on Lyme disease.

784
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:05,799
This is great.
I feel horrible.

785
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,233
It's perfect.

786
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,266
He's the one that I respect the most.

787
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,667
He's the one that I trust.

788
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:19,932
I've purposely not let myself
fall into the whole trap

789
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,399
of doctor after doctor
and treatment after treatment,

790
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,667
because I'm waiting for the right one.

791
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:30,066
Come on back, Dana.

792
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,466
Look at this guy.

793
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,567
- Hi.
- I'm so happy.

794
00:46:38,233 --> 00:46:39,467
It's nice to see you too.

795
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,892
So talk to me first.
Give me all the information, -

796
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:48,909
- I need to be a better doctor to you.

797
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:51,458
So how do I explain seven years of...

798
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,158
Okay, so you've been ill for seven years.

799
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,358
Yeah.

800
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:55,592
37.

801
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,992
What have you done in terms of treatment?

802
00:46:57,993 --> 00:47:00,925
When I found out, I started antibiotics.

803
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:03,558
I did six months, and I was so ill,

804
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,892
and I just didn't see it as an answer.

805
00:47:07,893 --> 00:47:10,092
Lyme disease is one of the many microbes

806
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,625
that has entered our system,
and I feel, as a physician,

807
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:16,292
that things are getting
to a degree that's serious.

808
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,358
We're watching other mammals die out,

809
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,292
and kind of think,
"Well, I'm glad that's not me."

810
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:24,292
However, as our environment
becomes increasingly polluted,

811
00:47:24,293 --> 00:47:26,058
so do our bodies,

812
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:28,258
and then we'll grow the bugs in us

813
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:31,526
that are not compatible
with human life anymore.

814
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:36,058
So you have a tremendous amount

815
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,258
of inflammation in the gut?

816
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,458
The Lyme disease, you know,

817
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,225
leads to a suppression
of the immune system,

818
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,025
and then you grow these things in you

819
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,258
that we're always exposed to.

820
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:46,625
So I'm just gonna first do just a few

821
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:50,525
neurological tests on you.

822
00:47:50,526 --> 00:47:54,892
So you have a little bit
borderline Babinski reflex.

823
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:56,558
That's an upper motor neuron sign.

824
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,125
It means, you know,
sort of that significant levels

825
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,558
of toxicity in the spinal cord or brain.

826
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,725
It is a way for me to stage
how close you are

827
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:11,125
to possibly developing, like,
a more serious thing,

828
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:12,425
like MS, you know.

829
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,092
Older people often get Parkinson's

830
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:16,758
after they've had
undiagnosed Lyme, you know,

831
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:17,992
or Alzheimer's.

832
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:20,192
Younger people tend to, especially women,

833
00:48:20,193 --> 00:48:21,625
tend to get MS.

834
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:24,258
That really struck me today

835
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:29,358
how much I've been
in denial of this illness.

836
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,125
I mean, I've been feeling
really twitchy and just shaky,

837
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:37,725
a lot of neurological stuff that...

838
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:39,792
It's like I can't deny it anymore.

839
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:45,425
It's becoming very visible,
so I think I'm just in time.

840
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:48,792
You know, as a warning sign,
this is not a mild situation.

841
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:51,125
You know, sort of like... you have to do...

842
00:48:51,126 --> 00:48:52,558
Within the next few months,

843
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,792
you have to resolve the issues
that you can resolve, yeah?

844
00:48:55,793 --> 00:48:57,392
You have to promise that to me.

845
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,692
I'm ready.

846
00:48:58,693 --> 00:49:00,492
Yeah.

847
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:02,258
It feels like just emergency.

848
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:04,392
It's just a panic in my body

849
00:49:04,393 --> 00:49:07,925
that I've learned
to just walk around with.

850
00:49:07,926 --> 00:49:09,292
Yeah, this is Dana.

851
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:12,759
I am moving into 314.

852
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:16,725
I finally feel like I can let go of it

853
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:20,125
and give it to somebody else to take.

854
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,492
There's someone to take my hand
and get me through it.

855
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,193
I really felt like that today.

856
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:29,725
I can't believe I moved to Seattle.

857
00:49:29,726 --> 00:49:31,626
This is so crazy.

858
00:49:41,193 --> 00:49:43,258
The spirochete that causes Lyme disease

859
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:47,392
is Borrelia burgdorferi
and related Borrelia.

860
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:51,725
The model that I have used
to try to understand

861
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:55,292
all of the possible things
that Lyme disease can do

862
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:56,725
is the syphilis model.

863
00:49:56,726 --> 00:50:00,725
Stokes, Modern Clinical
Syphilology, 1945,

864
00:50:00,726 --> 00:50:02,225
W.B. Saunders, publisher.

865
00:50:02,226 --> 00:50:05,925
It gets into every organ system
of the body,

866
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:08,658
and there are chapters on
manifestations in the skin,

867
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:12,425
manifestations in dead babies,
manifestations in the bone,

868
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:18,592
manifestations in the brain,
and particularly, dementia,

869
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:22,158
'cause dementia in syphilis
was general paresis,

870
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:25,825
and general paresis
is as close as you could come

871
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:28,325
to a carbon copy of Alzheimer's disease.

872
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:30,692
The diseases are exactly the same.

873
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:36,292
If a spirochete, syphilis,
could cause dementia,

874
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:38,625
why couldn't the Borrelia spirochete,

875
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,892
over a long, long, long period of time,

876
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:43,026
cause Alzheimer's disease?

877
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:51,525
I extracted DNA from ten
Alzheimer brains that came

878
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:53,692
from the Harvard University brain bank.

879
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:59,358
These are the Harvard brain
DNA extracts in this tube.

880
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,558
Using molecular methods,

881
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,892
I was able to find the DNA
of the spirochete

882
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,658
which causes Lyme disease
in seven out of ten

883
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,192
of the Alzheimer brain specimens
that we received from Harvard.

884
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:10,126
That's incredible.

885
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:20,325
The results of the experiment
could not have been predicted

886
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:21,925
in anybody's imagination.

887
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:26,225
When seven Alzheimer brains
gave me, essentially,

888
00:51:26,226 --> 00:51:29,725
the same thing,
which is part spirochetal,

889
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:31,958
part human, linked up in one molecule,

890
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:34,026
I about fell off my chair.

891
00:51:43,993 --> 00:51:47,258
If my dream comes true someday,

892
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,692
that will redefine
the practice of medicine,

893
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:53,893
and that will redefine the lives
of millions of people.

894
00:51:57,893 --> 00:51:59,258
Since spirochetes are the cause

895
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:01,892
of neurodegenerative diseases
in syphilis,

896
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:04,525
could it be
that this spirochetal infection,

897
00:52:04,526 --> 00:52:07,125
Lyme disease,
is partly or wholly responsible

898
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:10,492
for some of the neurologic
degenerative diseases we face

899
00:52:10,493 --> 00:52:11,658
in this century?

900
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:14,058
Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease,

901
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:17,158
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,

902
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,926
those are named conditions
for which no cause is now known.

903
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:29,725
We never had a...
In the last five years,

904
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:33,892
a single MS patient,
a single ALS patient,

905
00:52:33,893 --> 00:52:37,425
a single Parkinson's patient
who did not test positive

906
00:52:37,426 --> 00:52:41,293
for Borrelia burgdorferi,
not a single one.

907
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:50,358
About three years ago,
I became ill with a disease

908
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:54,058
that was ultimately thought
to be ALS or Lou Gehrig disease

909
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,093
and had prepared to die
within about two years' time.

910
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,392
My neurologist tells me

911
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:11,525
that I was progressing so rapidly that,

912
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:14,958
without the diagnosis
of Lyme disease and antibiotics,

913
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:18,758
I would have continued
to decline, losing strength,

914
00:53:18,759 --> 00:53:20,492
eventually becoming bed bound,

915
00:53:20,493 --> 00:53:24,058
eventually unable
to talk or swallow or breathe,

916
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:26,658
and would have died
in a matter of a couple years

917
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:30,225
just like anybody else with ALS,

918
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:34,192
so I was started on high doses
of intravenous antibiotics

919
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:37,293
only to see what would happen
with no guarantees.

920
00:53:39,693 --> 00:53:41,692
To our amazement, within a month,

921
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:43,158
my energy improved,

922
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,458
so instead of being exhausted in an hour,

923
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,892
I could be up and about

924
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:49,592
and active for four or five hours.

925
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,325
We're now two years out,

926
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:54,258
and I find that if I go off
of the antibiotics,

927
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:55,892
I lose stamina,

928
00:53:55,893 --> 00:53:58,658
and I'm not yet back to my full self,

929
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:01,126
but the change is absolutely dramatic.

930
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:17,892
I said,
"I'm not getting tested."

931
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:19,093
I said, "There's no way."

932
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:23,058
"There's no way I have Lyme,
because I've been told

933
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,393
by the best doctors
that I have Parkinson's."

934
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:31,558
My name is Ben Petrick.

935
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,458
Baseball was kind of, like, my life.

936
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:37,058
I went from being
a gifted athlete to, you know,

937
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:40,793
there's times when I...
It's hard to put a shirt on.

938
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:51,926
I've been out of the game now
for almost two years.

939
00:54:58,093 --> 00:55:00,592
When you're diagnosed
with a disease like Parkinson's,

940
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:02,192
it's like a slow death sentence.

941
00:55:02,193 --> 00:55:03,558
That's kind of what you feel like.

942
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,092
There's no cure for it.

943
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,058
It's just kind of a slow deterioration

944
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:09,226
of your former self.

945
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:15,892
Recently, in the past month,

946
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:18,158
I have been tested for Lyme disease,

947
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:19,792
and the test came back positive,

948
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:22,893
and so I've gone and seen
Dr. Martz in Colorado Springs.

949
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:28,958
We're scared.

950
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,325
My wife and I are sitting there
going, "Do we want to do this?"

951
00:55:31,326 --> 00:55:34,525
'cause they're talking about
sticking something in my vein

952
00:55:34,526 --> 00:55:35,892
that's gonna go into my big artery

953
00:55:35,893 --> 00:55:37,025
that's gonna go into my heart.

954
00:55:37,026 --> 00:55:38,392
I'm going, "What?"

955
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:40,492
So, you know,
I said to Dr. Martz...

956
00:55:40,493 --> 00:55:42,292
And Dr. Martz is phenomenal,

957
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:44,892
and his story is just miraculous...

958
00:55:44,893 --> 00:55:46,892
And I said, "Should I do this?"

959
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:50,192
And he said, "Ben, if you were
a part of my family",

960
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:52,758
"I would chain you down
and not let you leave here

961
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:53,799
until you have this done."

962
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:07,892
Six months into the Lyme treatment,

963
00:56:07,893 --> 00:56:10,025
it's, without a doubt, better.

964
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:12,525
There's been no question in my mind.

965
00:56:12,526 --> 00:56:14,893
I feel like I'm getting back
to being myself.

966
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:18,892
Compared to what I had been
in the past, it's...

967
00:56:18,893 --> 00:56:21,526
It's... I mean, I think it's night and day.

968
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:48,126
Okay.

969
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,158
What I'm doing right... r-right now

970
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,893
is sitting in my wheelchair.

971
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:05,393
Sean doesn't like to videotape it.

972
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:12,658
So we've gotten
in a couple tiffs about that,

973
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:18,493
'cause I think it's important
for other people to see this.

974
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:25,025
There are times when I feel
like I need to get away,

975
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:28,992
not that I'm trying
to run away from her, but that...

976
00:57:28,993 --> 00:57:30,259
It's just too much.

977
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,925
Sometimes I need to go and do the things

978
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:39,992
that I used to do before this started

979
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:40,992
just to feel like,

980
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:43,258
"Okay, that life
is still there."

981
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,325
You know, I mean, just like her...

982
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:47,458
That feeling's there
for me too, and I just can't.

983
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:48,393
I know.

984
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:51,792
We were told it was gonna be a long road.

985
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:56,825
That doesn't mean that I don't
worry about it driving a wedge.

986
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:58,392
Doesn't mean that I don't think that,

987
00:57:58,393 --> 00:58:00,659
maybe, at some point,
Sean might change his mind.

988
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,192
Now.

989
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,692
All you've got.
Just all you've got.

990
00:58:51,693 --> 00:58:54,393
Come on.

991
00:58:56,259 --> 00:58:58,259
There you go, and back in.

992
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:04,553
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

993
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,392
I'm extremely nervous
about having this child.

994
00:59:13,393 --> 00:59:14,992
All of the tests that we have to do,

995
00:59:14,993 --> 00:59:18,058
the fear that he'll come out
and he won't be able to breathe

996
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,658
or there'll be something that's
happened from the Lyme infection

997
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:21,658
that we don't know about.

998
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,525
It is very, very scary.

999
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:26,025
Elise, more, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more.

1000
00:59:26,026 --> 00:59:27,692
Nice.

1001
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:28,693
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

1002
00:59:29,893 --> 00:59:31,593
Elise, push.
Here comes your baby.

1003
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:39,393
- It's okay.
- There you go.

1004
00:59:41,726 --> 00:59:43,393
Is he breathing?

1005
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:47,193
Look at his hands moving.

1006
00:59:49,426 --> 00:59:50,626
Placenta sample.
Here.

1007
00:59:54,026 --> 00:59:55,393
Look, I'm right here.

1008
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:02,025
Hi.

1009
01:00:02,026 --> 01:00:04,826
My God. Hi.

1010
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:07,726
I can't believe it.

1011
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:29,458
We would like to welcome you

1012
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,925
to John F. Kennedy
International Airport, New York.

1013
01:00:31,926 --> 01:00:36,693
The local time here
in New York is 9:30 a.m.

1014
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:43,292
Well, here we are
in East Hampton, New York,

1015
01:00:43,293 --> 01:00:45,058
a place I probably never would have seen

1016
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,758
if I hadn't gotten Lyme disease.

1017
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:51,092
I've come here
all the way from California

1018
01:00:51,093 --> 01:00:55,025
to see one of the top
Lyme specialists in the world,

1019
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,393
and I've been coming here
for the last four years.

1020
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:03,093
Are you nervous riding with me?
You should be.

1021
01:01:06,493 --> 01:01:11,158
As a park ranger before Lyme,
I was a highly confident person.

1022
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:12,392
What Lyme did to me is,

1023
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:16,558
it sort of removed
my ability to multitask.

1024
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,625
Now I can sort of do one thing at a time

1025
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:22,625
if I really focus on it.

1026
01:01:22,626 --> 01:01:24,392
See, we're not where
we should be right now.

1027
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:27,825
Do you notice this?

1028
01:01:27,826 --> 01:01:29,259
That's a really bad sign.

1029
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:41,625
Frustrating, you know?

1030
01:01:41,626 --> 01:01:43,525
It's frustrating
to be this far down the road...

1031
01:01:43,526 --> 01:01:45,258
Now it's been almost eight years...

1032
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:49,626
And to still be not back to normal.

1033
01:02:05,693 --> 01:02:08,125
When did you start
the combination therapy?

1034
01:02:08,126 --> 01:02:09,225
Last year, right?

1035
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,592
Yeah, I've been on it for a year.

1036
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:13,758
Are you still improving,
or have you hit a plateau?

1037
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,258
You know, the truth is,
I've hit a plateau.

1038
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:18,658
How much antibiotic is enough?

1039
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:20,725
How many symptoms that are still present

1040
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:22,658
reflect an active, ongoing infection

1041
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,658
versus just damage
that's gonna be there forever?

1042
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:27,658
Somehow, the spirochete can learn to live

1043
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:29,192
within the body and not be killed.

1044
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:30,592
It can hide from the immune system.

1045
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:31,925
It can hide from the antibiotics,

1046
01:02:31,926 --> 01:02:32,992
and both at the same time,

1047
01:02:32,993 --> 01:02:35,292
and there are patients who sometimes

1048
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,925
are in open-ended years of therapy

1049
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,392
because of this very problem.

1050
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:40,492
We have not been able

1051
01:02:40,493 --> 01:02:43,125
to demonstrate the persistence
of the bacteria,

1052
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:46,825
so to treat for months and months

1053
01:02:46,826 --> 01:02:50,792
is really based on guesswork,
on conjecture,

1054
01:02:50,793 --> 01:02:53,725
and not based on any scientific data.

1055
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:55,858
If I had not been able to find doctors

1056
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,858
who would soak me
in antibiotics for years,

1057
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,125
you wouldn't be talking to the guy

1058
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:03,292
that you're talking to right now.

1059
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:07,492
The folk myth is somehow that
antibiotics are bad for you.

1060
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:08,525
I just have to say,

1061
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:09,858
they're certainly not bad for you

1062
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:11,139
if you've got a fatal infection.

1063
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,658
This disease has taken over my
whole life.

1064
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:21,293
It's been a horrible journey.

1065
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:26,725
Every day, driving home,
I would think of driving a car

1066
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:28,658
off the road or something like that.

1067
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:32,125
I said to my mom, "You know,
it would be okay with me"

1068
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:34,892
if I didn't wake up this time."

1069
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:36,558
I said,
"God, take me home tonight."

1070
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,158
It was not even a request.
It was a demand.

1071
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:41,392
What's gonna happen to me?

1072
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:43,258
"I don't want to die."

1073
01:03:43,259 --> 01:03:45,058
I am scared.

1074
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:49,258
I'm very sad,
'cause I don't know what to do.

1075
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:50,625
I'm going downhill,

1076
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,925
gradually down, down, down, down, down.

1077
01:03:52,926 --> 01:03:55,592
The worst part is knowing

1078
01:03:55,593 --> 01:03:58,126
that you're just not a normal person.

1079
01:04:09,226 --> 01:04:10,725
Chronic Lyme disease,

1080
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:12,293
it's kind of the disease du jour.

1081
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:16,858
There's no evidence that I can find

1082
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:19,092
to support the concept

1083
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:22,758
that there is
a chronic Borrelia infection

1084
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:23,693
after treatment.

1085
01:04:25,726 --> 01:04:27,892
That kind of situation
has been referred to

1086
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:32,126
as post-Lyme syndrome
or post-Lyme symptoms.

1087
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,625
Those symptoms may be due
to the aches and pains

1088
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:38,193
of kind of daily living.

1089
01:04:43,593 --> 01:04:45,725
The Infectious Diseases
Society of America

1090
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:48,825
just published
their Lyme disease diagnosis

1091
01:04:48,826 --> 01:04:50,392
and treatment guidelines,

1092
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:54,393
and it's been a huge disaster
for the Lyme disease community.

1093
01:04:58,626 --> 01:05:01,825
They say that Lyme is easy
to treat and easy to cure.

1094
01:05:01,826 --> 01:05:03,892
They're saying that two weeks, typically,

1095
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:05,725
will cure most cases of Lyme,

1096
01:05:05,726 --> 01:05:08,958
and they say that chronic Lyme
doesn't exist.

1097
01:05:08,959 --> 01:05:10,258
If people have symptoms

1098
01:05:10,259 --> 01:05:13,458
beyond one two-to four-week
dose of antibiotics,

1099
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:14,592
they have something else,

1100
01:05:14,593 --> 01:05:16,092
and they send them to a psychiatrist

1101
01:05:16,093 --> 01:05:18,492
or give them some pain meds
or some steroids

1102
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:19,426
and send them away.

1103
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:24,858
If you look at the new IDSA guidelines,

1104
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,892
it's a very threatening document.

1105
01:05:26,893 --> 01:05:28,126
It's very restrictive.

1106
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,958
So it almost was designed
with a purpose in mind

1107
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:35,026
to restrict the treatment of Lyme.

1108
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:39,292
A handful of people
are pretty much the gatekeepers

1109
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:42,958
for information about this disease.

1110
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:44,692
Out of 400 references

1111
01:05:44,693 --> 01:05:46,892
that they posted
at the back of the guidelines,

1112
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:48,725
half of them were based on articles

1113
01:05:48,726 --> 01:05:50,792
that the panelists
or people in their labs

1114
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:52,125
had actually written,

1115
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:54,158
so it's not like
they went through and looked at

1116
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,792
the whole body of Lyme research

1117
01:05:55,793 --> 01:05:57,458
to come up with the best recommendations.

1118
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,492
They looked at a small group of articles,

1119
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:02,392
about half of which
were written by themselves.

1120
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,892
These guidelines are based

1121
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:07,792
on the best scientific evidence that...

1122
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:10,625
From more than 25 years of study.

1123
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:14,125
It completely ignores
a worldwide body of literature

1124
01:06:14,126 --> 01:06:16,592
that is in contradiction
to what they're saying.

1125
01:06:16,593 --> 01:06:18,792
We're not gonna ignore good science,

1126
01:06:18,793 --> 01:06:21,026
but the science isn't there.

1127
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:26,092
We had begun deliberations,

1128
01:06:26,093 --> 01:06:30,592
and we were going to go over
the late and chronic stage.

1129
01:06:30,593 --> 01:06:33,625
We never got to discuss late
and chronic Lyme disease.

1130
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:37,825
There seemed to be pressure from the IDSA

1131
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:41,058
to put out something,
even though we couldn't agree,

1132
01:06:41,059 --> 01:06:44,925
so what happened was,
Dr. Wormser did take over

1133
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:46,725
the chairmanship on the guidelines

1134
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:47,792
for Lyme disease,

1135
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:49,825
and we never met again.

1136
01:06:49,826 --> 01:06:52,025
We just said, "Here are the guidelines",

1137
01:06:52,026 --> 01:06:55,259
and you can sign them
and agree or not."

1138
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:00,392
They're written in almost legalese terms,

1139
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:03,425
like this could be a document
used in court cases,

1140
01:07:03,426 --> 01:07:04,892
maybe against physicians,

1141
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:08,025
or maybe for insurance companies
to justify cutting off treatment

1142
01:07:08,026 --> 01:07:10,092
to their patients
'cause these are the guidelines.

1143
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:14,392
Really, those guidelines
reflected the idea

1144
01:07:14,393 --> 01:07:16,392
of one or two people,

1145
01:07:16,393 --> 01:07:21,125
but they've been misused
by insurance companies

1146
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:24,392
who don't want to pay
for treatments because

1147
01:07:24,393 --> 01:07:26,225
that particular guideline says,

1148
01:07:26,226 --> 01:07:29,593
"We don't know
if chronic Lyme disease exists."

1149
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:52,392
Well, the insurance company
has refused to pay

1150
01:07:52,393 --> 01:07:54,192
$10,000 worth of bills

1151
01:07:54,193 --> 01:07:56,793
having to do with my trips
to see Dr. Burrascano.

1152
01:07:58,426 --> 01:08:01,625
They have now required me
to see another doctor.

1153
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,825
This particular doctor
apparently is a fella

1154
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:06,725
who works mostly
for the insurance company.

1155
01:08:06,726 --> 01:08:09,692
What he'll do will be
to cite the IDSA position

1156
01:08:09,693 --> 01:08:12,158
that there's no such thing
as chronic Lyme disease

1157
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,558
to support a conclusion

1158
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,858
that the insurance company's
already made about me.

1159
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,093
They don't want to pay.

1160
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,225
Rather than make the assumption

1161
01:08:43,226 --> 01:08:46,058
that two to four weeks
of antibiotics is enough...

1162
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:50,092
Where did anybody get that idea
from an infectious disease?

1163
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,692
Tuberculosis is not treated
in two to four weeks.

1164
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:56,292
Hepatitis, a year to treat that.

1165
01:08:56,293 --> 01:08:59,825
HIV, indefinitely.

1166
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:04,525
So we're not talking about new concepts.

1167
01:09:04,526 --> 01:09:07,458
We're talking about concepts
that have not been,

1168
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:09,793
for whatever reason, applied.

1169
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:20,058
This doctor's controversial
diagnosis and treatment

1170
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:23,158
of Lyme disease
with powerful intravenous drugs

1171
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,825
could very well cost him
his medical license.

1172
01:09:25,826 --> 01:09:28,858
The evidence will show
that Dr. Jemsek believed

1173
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,392
the IDSA guidelines
to be flawed, to be wrong.

1174
01:09:32,393 --> 01:09:34,392
I respect the IDSA tremendously.

1175
01:09:34,393 --> 01:09:37,058
I belong to the IDSA.

1176
01:09:37,059 --> 01:09:39,125
The Lyme philosophy
is run by about 12 people

1177
01:09:39,126 --> 01:09:40,258
who have been doing...

1178
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,058
The same 12 people for the last 15 years,

1179
01:09:42,059 --> 01:09:43,726
and they haven't really changed anything.

1180
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:47,792
I tried to influence the IDSA
through a series of letters

1181
01:09:47,793 --> 01:09:49,792
with the president and the chairman

1182
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:51,058
of the guidelines committee.

1183
01:09:51,059 --> 01:09:53,892
We pleaded with them
to open up the process

1184
01:09:53,893 --> 01:09:55,792
about Lyme guidelines.

1185
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:57,958
He has been working
really hard for the last year

1186
01:09:57,959 --> 01:10:01,592
to try and get the IDSA board
to listen to his suggestions

1187
01:10:01,593 --> 01:10:03,125
for the treatment of chronic Lyme,

1188
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:06,158
and now he's before
a medical board review,

1189
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,992
and it makes you wonder,
you know, is this a retaliation?

1190
01:10:09,993 --> 01:10:11,892
Furthermore, for each of these patients,

1191
01:10:11,893 --> 01:10:14,358
Dr. Jemsek prescribed
a course of not oral

1192
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:16,858
but intravenous antibiotics
to be administered

1193
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,292
to the patients for months on end.

1194
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:23,825
Long-term antibiotics
provide no additional benefit,

1195
01:10:23,826 --> 01:10:26,658
and it's not that this is safe.

1196
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:30,158
There are many complications
to long-term antibiotic therapy.

1197
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:34,258
I was a patient of his for 7 1/2 years,

1198
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:36,292
diagnosed with Lyme's disease,

1199
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:38,725
wholeheartedly believed him,

1200
01:10:38,726 --> 01:10:40,458
and never had Lyme's disease.

1201
01:10:40,459 --> 01:10:44,192
My wife did not sign up
to be a test subject.

1202
01:10:44,193 --> 01:10:47,825
She was told she could be cured

1203
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:49,692
to the disease that she supposedly had.

1204
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:52,158
Three years ago,

1205
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,625
you wouldn't have thought
she'd live another two months.

1206
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:55,825
He literally saved her life.

1207
01:10:55,826 --> 01:10:56,826
No question about it.

1208
01:10:58,726 --> 01:11:01,725
If I hadn't seen Dr. Jemsek,
if he wasn't available,

1209
01:11:01,726 --> 01:11:04,725
I don't know that I'd be here
talking to you.

1210
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:08,692
If Dr. Jemsek
doesn't get cleared,

1211
01:11:08,693 --> 01:11:10,492
there's a message that's gonna be sent

1212
01:11:10,493 --> 01:11:13,292
to the other doctors in North Carolina

1213
01:11:13,293 --> 01:11:17,092
that it's not safe
to take a Lyme patient on

1214
01:11:17,093 --> 01:11:18,092
and treat them.

1215
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:20,925
We can't have that happen.

1216
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:23,658
I don't know what we would do.

1217
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:25,092
It is difficult for doctors

1218
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:26,925
who want to stand up
and help these patients

1219
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:28,525
because is it a political disease

1220
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:30,125
and an economic disease

1221
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:33,192
as much as it is
a bacterial-borne infection.

1222
01:11:33,193 --> 01:11:36,758
My office was stormed by
the Board of Nurse Examiners.

1223
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,658
I got a letter around 2000

1224
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:42,225
saying that I was a subject
of an investigation.

1225
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:44,625
A complaint went in from a physician

1226
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:46,958
to the Virginia Board of Medicine

1227
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:52,525
stating that I was following
unusual practices in treating

1228
01:11:52,526 --> 01:11:54,393
Lyme disease patients.

1229
01:11:56,193 --> 01:11:57,925
Here we are in Raleigh, North Carolina,

1230
01:11:57,926 --> 01:12:01,092
and we're on day two
of the Jemsek trials.

1231
01:12:01,093 --> 01:12:03,458
We're going.

1232
01:12:03,459 --> 01:12:08,192
Dr. Jemsek's license
is suspended for one year

1233
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:11,792
stayed in the conditions
to be determined.

1234
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:15,559
That concludes the hearing
in this matter.

1235
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,858
A Charlotte doctor must
surrender his medical license

1236
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:21,925
for the way he treats Lyme disease.

1237
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:24,692
Less than an hour ago,
the state medical board ruled

1238
01:12:24,693 --> 01:12:27,758
that Dr. Joseph Jemsek
acted inappropriately

1239
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:29,525
when treating some patients.

1240
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:32,259
The board suspended
his license for one year.

1241
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:39,958
- I thank you all.
- Well, thank you.

1242
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:41,259
Thank you. Thank you.

1243
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:53,792
Medical boards don't act on their own.

1244
01:12:53,793 --> 01:12:57,158
They need a complaint
to initiate an investigation,

1245
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:58,925
and we've been told by the medical boards

1246
01:12:58,926 --> 01:13:00,625
that the great majority of complaints

1247
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,025
don't come from doctors or patients,

1248
01:13:02,026 --> 01:13:03,825
but they come from insurance companies

1249
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:07,559
trying to get rid of doctors
who cost them a lot of money.

1250
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:16,892
There has been for many years

1251
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:20,125
a controversy
within the medical community

1252
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:22,658
about how best to diagnose
and treat Lyme disease.

1253
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:27,058
We allege that Dr. Jones
prescribed an antibiotic

1254
01:13:27,059 --> 01:13:30,392
to a patient he did not know
and had never examined.

1255
01:13:30,393 --> 01:13:34,392
As a mom, my kids were sick.
I left no stone unturned.

1256
01:13:34,393 --> 01:13:36,958
I finally found somebody that recognized

1257
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,592
what their problem might be.

1258
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:41,458
It was treated, in my opinion,
appropriately,

1259
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,893
and my kids are better now because of it.

1260
01:13:46,926 --> 01:13:49,392
This whole thing
is kind of ridiculous, I think.

1261
01:13:49,393 --> 01:13:53,058
It was really nothing more
than a witch hunt

1262
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:54,526
on behalf of my ex-husband.

1263
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:00,692
He called me,

1264
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:03,192
and he said he was going
to lodge a complaint

1265
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:06,058
against every doctor
that I took the children to

1266
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:10,126
unless I agreed not to bill him
for half of the medical care.

1267
01:14:11,793 --> 01:14:15,192
How could my dad have done this?

1268
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:16,958
He said, "Well, you don't
have Lyme disease."

1269
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,392
Dr. Jones is just making it up
so he can get money,"

1270
01:14:19,393 --> 01:14:22,058
and I thought,
"You know what? No, he isn't,"

1271
01:14:22,059 --> 01:14:25,825
because I was always sick,
and then, when he told me,

1272
01:14:25,826 --> 01:14:28,225
my brother, and my family
that we had Lyme disease

1273
01:14:28,226 --> 01:14:30,858
and we got treated for Lyme disease,

1274
01:14:30,859 --> 01:14:32,392
we got so much better.

1275
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:36,392
Did you testify contrary
to Dr. Jones' opinion

1276
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:38,492
in a criminal case
in the last several years?

1277
01:14:38,493 --> 01:14:39,592
Yes.

1278
01:14:39,593 --> 01:14:41,893
Did you ever call him a "nut" in public?

1279
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:53,758
Patients develop physical complaints,

1280
01:14:53,759 --> 01:14:57,626
but it's got a psychological basis.

1281
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:07,125
Dr. Jones is the best
pediatric Lyme doctor

1282
01:15:07,126 --> 01:15:08,625
in the United States,

1283
01:15:08,626 --> 01:15:09,958
so the implications for me

1284
01:15:09,959 --> 01:15:11,525
is that if my son's Lyme comes back

1285
01:15:11,526 --> 01:15:13,392
or if we contract it again,

1286
01:15:13,393 --> 01:15:14,925
then what you'll be taking away

1287
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:18,592
is the one person that can truly help us.

1288
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:19,992
What kind of response would you get

1289
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:23,258
if this was a kid with cancer?

1290
01:15:23,259 --> 01:15:25,726
Everybody and their mother
would say that this is inhumane.

1291
01:15:28,259 --> 01:15:32,292
Dr. Jones is not
the heart of the problem.

1292
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:33,658
I think the opposition,

1293
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:36,892
they're going to use him
as an example if they can,

1294
01:15:36,893 --> 01:15:39,492
perhaps to frighten other doctors

1295
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,458
so that they won't want
to get involved in care.

1296
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,292
I was reviewed by the investigators

1297
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:47,125
for four years.

1298
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:49,492
As long as I'm not too well-known,

1299
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:51,092
it's okay to do what I do,

1300
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:54,192
but if I would become very
well-known or very outspoken,

1301
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:56,792
I think that I would probably
lose my medical license.

1302
01:15:56,793 --> 01:15:59,392
It got to the point
where I would tell people,

1303
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:03,692
"Don't tell the office you're
coming in because of Lyme."

1304
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:06,125
Let's leave this alone.
Just let us do our work.

1305
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:07,592
If you don't want to treat that stuff,

1306
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:10,125
that's fine,
but you can't make it go away.

1307
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:11,426
It's not going away.

1308
01:16:13,759 --> 01:16:15,092
Dear Lord and Heavenly Father,

1309
01:16:15,093 --> 01:16:16,525
thank you for this meal,

1310
01:16:16,526 --> 01:16:19,992
and help it nourish our bodies
and help us advance your kingdom

1311
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:23,292
and just let the truth prevail
for Dr. Jones

1312
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:26,593
and help him help others,
in Jesus' name, Christ, amen.

1313
01:16:49,993 --> 01:16:52,025
We're here today to remember Brett Paul.

1314
01:16:52,026 --> 01:16:54,092
- Doris Grade.
- Robert Baird.

1315
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:55,659
Geri Teitelbaum Fosseen.

1316
01:16:58,126 --> 01:17:02,925
I think it really points out
how dangerous this illness is.

1317
01:17:02,926 --> 01:17:04,858
We're the heartland of the nation,

1318
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,926
and our people are dying here
from Lyme disease.

1319
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:16,092
My son was 31 years old,
and he died from Lyme disease

1320
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:17,826
because no one would treat him.

1321
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,758
I keep wondering
what else I could have done.

1322
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:23,092
Should I have taken her to Europe?

1323
01:17:23,093 --> 01:17:24,425
Should I have taken her somewhere

1324
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:26,892
where somebody would have done something?

1325
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,992
But we don't seem to care
in this country.

1326
01:17:28,993 --> 01:17:31,258
They just didn't try to help.

1327
01:17:31,259 --> 01:17:34,825
When we tried to get medication for her,

1328
01:17:34,826 --> 01:17:37,692
it was almost impossible,
because the medical profession

1329
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:39,826
is afraid to give medication for this.

1330
01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:45,058
If I was asked whether
Lyme disease could be fatal,

1331
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:47,525
I would say not in my experience

1332
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:50,493
and not suggested by any
of the existing literature.

1333
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:58,225
My husband died
two months ago of Lyme disease.

1334
01:17:58,226 --> 01:18:03,592
It's specifically
on his death certificate.

1335
01:18:03,593 --> 01:18:07,659
By the time they
figure it out, it's too late.

1336
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:13,892
The last words my daughter spoke to me,

1337
01:18:13,893 --> 01:18:16,058
her last words to us,
"Mommy, they're gonna kill me,"

1338
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:17,159
and they did.

1339
01:18:22,259 --> 01:18:24,959
I am one of the many
that will speak for her now.

1340
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:28,159
She shouldn't have had to die.

1341
01:18:30,093 --> 01:18:33,925
I'm angry at the fact that
there's nobody there to help me.

1342
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:36,992
I'm angry at the fact that
this disease is being ignored.

1343
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:38,792
I'm angry at the fact

1344
01:18:38,793 --> 01:18:40,558
that there's a Hippocratic oath out there

1345
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:42,558
that these doctors
are supposed to heal me,

1346
01:18:42,559 --> 01:18:44,858
and they ignored me,

1347
01:18:44,859 --> 01:18:48,625
and they put a price on my life,
which was nothing.

1348
01:18:48,626 --> 01:18:52,592
Nobody was there to help me, and instead,

1349
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:55,959
they blamed it on me by saying
it was all in my head.

1350
01:19:09,693 --> 01:19:13,392
We were having dinner,
just, you know, watching TV,

1351
01:19:13,393 --> 01:19:16,126
and she started having a reaction.

1352
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:35,526
It was a mild seizure at first,
and it progressively got worse.

1353
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,392
She was having problems breathing,

1354
01:19:43,393 --> 01:19:47,393
and then stopped breathing all together.

1355
01:20:32,026 --> 01:20:34,258
The first doctor that we met with,

1356
01:20:34,259 --> 01:20:37,692
first statement was,
"Lyme doesn't do this.

1357
01:20:37,693 --> 01:20:38,733
That's not what you have."

1358
01:20:44,293 --> 01:20:47,592
Three of the doctors all asked
if she's seeing a psychiatrist

1359
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,526
because they all just assumed
it was in her head.

1360
01:20:52,693 --> 01:20:55,658
My body had been
losing ability for a long time,

1361
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:59,992
cognitive function,
physical ability to do things,

1362
01:20:59,993 --> 01:21:04,392
and I'd been keeping it down,
you know, working around it,

1363
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,725
adjusting my life, so you know what?

1364
01:21:06,726 --> 01:21:09,625
I don't want to hear it, and I'm sorry,

1365
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:12,125
but I have been dealing with it,

1366
01:21:12,126 --> 01:21:14,392
and now we have been dealing with it.

1367
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:16,158
That's ten years.

1368
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,893
That's a long time to be patient.

1369
01:21:21,426 --> 01:21:24,692
I mean, it's frustrating
to hear doctor after doctor

1370
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:27,658
after doctor say either,
A, "Lyme doesn't exist,"

1371
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:31,258
or, "Lyme doesn't do this," or, you know,

1372
01:21:31,259 --> 01:21:33,725
"Well, what you're experiencing
isn't Lyme."

1373
01:21:33,726 --> 01:21:36,192
It's almost like they've been
trained or programmed

1374
01:21:36,193 --> 01:21:37,893
that this is what they're
supposed to say.

1375
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,992
It's really madness, you know?

1376
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:53,225
There's something wrong.

1377
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:54,658
I don't hear it in any other disease,

1378
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,058
never heard it in my life.

1379
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,292
So there's something funny.

1380
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:00,193
I don't know what
that something funny is.

1381
01:22:04,526 --> 01:22:06,958
Attorney General Blumenthal
of Connecticut

1382
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:11,392
has taken the historic move
of starting an investigation

1383
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,292
into the panel members who wrote

1384
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:15,725
the Infectious Diseases
Society of America

1385
01:22:15,726 --> 01:22:18,592
Lyme Treatment Guidelines.

1386
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:21,592
He believes that they have conflicts

1387
01:22:21,593 --> 01:22:24,558
that may be corrupting their advice.

1388
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:27,392
Our investigation concerns
whether the antitrust laws

1389
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:30,558
have been violated, purposefully or not,

1390
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:32,992
by these guidelines.

1391
01:22:32,993 --> 01:22:35,192
They may restrict consumer choice

1392
01:22:35,193 --> 01:22:39,658
with tremendous implications,
not only for patient care,

1393
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:43,059
but also the economics
of insurance coverage.

1394
01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:49,925
Ideally, authors of medical guidelines

1395
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:51,492
should have no financial conflicts

1396
01:22:51,493 --> 01:22:53,092
when they make their recommendations,

1397
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:56,692
but if you look at the current
IDSA guidelines' authors,

1398
01:22:56,693 --> 01:22:59,392
6 of 14 of them or their universities

1399
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:01,592
hold patents associated with Lyme disease

1400
01:23:01,593 --> 01:23:04,392
or its co-infections.

1401
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,292
4 of the 14 have received funding

1402
01:23:06,293 --> 01:23:10,925
from Lyme or co-infection
test kit manufacturers.

1403
01:23:10,926 --> 01:23:12,892
4 have been paid by insurance companies

1404
01:23:12,893 --> 01:23:14,725
to write Lyme policy guidelines

1405
01:23:14,726 --> 01:23:18,092
or serve as consultants in legal cases,

1406
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,525
and 9 of the 14 authors
or their universities

1407
01:23:20,526 --> 01:23:21,658
have received money

1408
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:24,193
from Lyme disease vaccine manufacturers.

1409
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:28,725
The fact that 9 out of 14 authors

1410
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:30,592
have a direct conflict of interest

1411
01:23:30,593 --> 01:23:34,225
with somebody who's involved
in manufacturing products

1412
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:37,792
for any aspect of the disease
is completely outrageous.

1413
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:41,692
The Infectious Disease Society of America

1414
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:45,658
should establish a hard-and-fast rule

1415
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:48,992
that the people who serve
on guideline-writing committees

1416
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:53,292
not have any ties to any manufacturer

1417
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:55,925
that has a stake in the outcome
of those guidelines,

1418
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:57,692
period, end of story.

1419
01:23:57,693 --> 01:24:00,025
There are a lot of people
in the academic community,

1420
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:01,858
I think, that know
these people are wrong,

1421
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:04,792
but no one will speak up,
so, you know, at what point

1422
01:24:04,793 --> 01:24:07,892
will people say
the emperor has no clothes?

1423
01:24:07,893 --> 01:24:10,392
You know, when will
the voice of the people

1424
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:14,892
finally reach a level where
the truth will come out?

1425
01:24:14,893 --> 01:24:16,892
I mean, I think the truth
will eventually come out,

1426
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:19,092
but how many more people are gonna suffer

1427
01:24:19,093 --> 01:24:20,393
before the truth comes out?

1428
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:28,825
As citizens, we ought
to be astonished and alarmed.

1429
01:24:28,826 --> 01:24:30,292
Every year,

1430
01:24:30,293 --> 01:24:34,426
there's thousands and thousands
of people suffering.

1431
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:39,792
This is a total disgrace.

1432
01:24:39,793 --> 01:24:45,559
Write to the IDSA.
Chronic Lyme disease exists.

1433
01:25:02,226 --> 01:25:03,925
Good afternoon, everybody.

1434
01:25:03,926 --> 01:25:07,659
Continuing hearings on the case
of Dr. Charles Jones.

1435
01:25:12,393 --> 01:25:13,392
He had their records,

1436
01:25:13,393 --> 01:25:14,692
which did not confirm the history

1437
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,125
that the mother had given.

1438
01:25:16,126 --> 01:25:17,858
He'd been told that Nevada providers

1439
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:20,025
saw no reason to prescribe an antibiotic.

1440
01:25:20,026 --> 01:25:22,625
Nonetheless,
he prescribed for both children.

1441
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:24,458
I hate to sound conspiratorial,

1442
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:26,392
but I think I have a right to be.

1443
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:29,892
I think that it would be
advantageous for me

1444
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:32,525
as a Lyme-literate physician

1445
01:25:32,526 --> 01:25:34,492
and as the only pediatrician in the world

1446
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:37,592
who treats Lyme patients
to be out of the picture.

1447
01:25:37,593 --> 01:25:42,392
There's no charge
that these patients were harmed.

1448
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:46,925
In fact... how do we get past this
big elephant in the living room

1449
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:51,025
that these patients
were treated successfully

1450
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,959
and are now doing very well?

1451
01:25:56,959 --> 01:25:59,858
I'm 78 years old.

1452
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:01,758
In the worst scenario, I lose my license.

1453
01:26:01,759 --> 01:26:03,392
I don't think they're going to let it go.

1454
01:26:03,393 --> 01:26:04,393
I know that.

1455
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:14,592
Bye, Dr. Jones.

1456
01:26:14,593 --> 01:26:18,125
All I can do to help.

1457
01:26:18,126 --> 01:26:19,159
Thank you.

1458
01:26:25,626 --> 01:26:28,193
We all love Dr. Jones.
He's like a father to me.

1459
01:26:32,393 --> 01:26:35,792
If they succeed
in taking his license away,

1460
01:26:35,793 --> 01:26:39,658
I just don't feel that he's gonna feel

1461
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,425
like he needs to be here anymore,

1462
01:26:41,426 --> 01:26:47,059
and that's very sad to me.

1463
01:26:55,693 --> 01:26:57,392
I don't know where my daughter would be

1464
01:26:57,393 --> 01:26:58,693
without Dr. Jones.

1465
01:27:00,659 --> 01:27:02,059
We call him the Lyme pope.

1466
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,392
I was probably the 30th individual

1467
01:28:01,393 --> 01:28:03,058
who had been called
before a medical board

1468
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:05,625
for treating persistent Lyme disease.

1469
01:28:05,626 --> 01:28:08,825
They decided
to suspend my license with stay,

1470
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,525
which means
that I was allowed to practice,

1471
01:28:10,526 --> 01:28:12,458
but the damage was done.

1472
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:13,592
Within a few weeks,

1473
01:28:13,593 --> 01:28:15,192
Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina

1474
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:16,825
cancelled our contract,

1475
01:28:16,826 --> 01:28:19,293
and then they sued me for $100 million.

1476
01:28:21,793 --> 01:28:25,192
Financially, I've lost
essentially everything.

1477
01:28:25,193 --> 01:28:26,625
I've lost my clinic.

1478
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:28,458
I've sold the building,
and in a couple months,

1479
01:28:28,459 --> 01:28:29,619
I'll be closing the practice.

1480
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:43,425
They had the vision loss,

1481
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:45,492
and they were starting
to lose their hearing there.

1482
01:28:45,493 --> 01:28:47,825
They were really young
when they were losing it.

1483
01:28:47,826 --> 01:28:50,125
Christy, my oldest child,

1484
01:28:50,126 --> 01:28:53,592
died 6 1/2 years ago from Lyme's disease.

1485
01:28:53,593 --> 01:28:55,092
She was 19 years old.

1486
01:28:55,093 --> 01:28:58,158
Courtney is 25 years old.

1487
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,125
Can you say "doctor"?

1488
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:01,592
Say "doctor."

1489
01:29:01,593 --> 01:29:03,393
Doctor.

1490
01:29:08,459 --> 01:29:11,792
I'm glad somebody stepped in
and helped you,

1491
01:29:11,793 --> 01:29:14,658
that you found the right people.

1492
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:15,593
Yeah.

1493
01:29:21,393 --> 01:29:23,393
Hi, there, sweetie.
How you doing?

1494
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,025
You made significant progress.

1495
01:29:27,026 --> 01:29:28,125
I'm delighted with the fact

1496
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:29,758
that your multiple neurologic symptoms

1497
01:29:29,759 --> 01:29:31,092
are so much better

1498
01:29:31,093 --> 01:29:33,025
and that you're...
You have control of your body.

1499
01:29:33,026 --> 01:29:34,492
You can live in your own skin.

1500
01:29:34,493 --> 01:29:36,458
From someone who came unable to swallow

1501
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:38,392
and in, you know, an altered...

1502
01:29:38,393 --> 01:29:39,492
Bedridden.

1503
01:29:39,493 --> 01:29:41,392
Bedridden, altered sense of smell,

1504
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:43,492
and uncontrolled tremors and seizures

1505
01:29:43,493 --> 01:29:46,192
and couldn't stand up and... gosh.

1506
01:29:46,193 --> 01:29:48,026
- I'm looking good.
- You're looking good.

1507
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:55,392
Well, my greatest fear is that, you know,

1508
01:29:55,393 --> 01:29:57,992
like some of the couples
out there who have Lyme,

1509
01:29:57,993 --> 01:30:00,125
that both of us will be impacted by it,

1510
01:30:00,126 --> 01:30:04,625
and that he would have gotten it from me.

1511
01:30:04,626 --> 01:30:08,025
You know, he's complained about
a lot of aches and pains.

1512
01:30:08,026 --> 01:30:09,492
I'm not old, but I'm getting older,

1513
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:12,192
and there's, like...
There's things that I'm feeling

1514
01:30:12,193 --> 01:30:14,325
that probably happen to everybody.

1515
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:17,825
Like, one of my eyes right now...
I got to go to a vision guy,

1516
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,258
'cause one of my eyes is blurred out,

1517
01:30:19,259 --> 01:30:20,792
and I've always had 20/10 vision.

1518
01:30:20,793 --> 01:30:22,125
I mean, all of a sudden, this eye...

1519
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,292
And it wasn't... it was, like,

1520
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:25,092
an overnight thing, that suddenly,

1521
01:30:25,093 --> 01:30:27,225
I'm having issues with blurry vision

1522
01:30:27,226 --> 01:30:29,092
with my eyes, getting headaches,

1523
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:31,492
which I account
towards the blurry vision,

1524
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:32,492
but bottom line...

1525
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:35,192
Mono-like symptoms.

1526
01:30:35,193 --> 01:30:38,392
He goes horizontal, he's out.

1527
01:30:38,393 --> 01:30:40,725
Just feeling lethargic.

1528
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:41,925
I won't tell you that it's not

1529
01:30:41,926 --> 01:30:43,606
in the back of my mind
that it is possible.

1530
01:30:47,126 --> 01:30:48,725
Lyme is a distant cousin to syphilis,

1531
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:53,058
which is obviously sexually transmitted.

1532
01:30:53,059 --> 01:30:54,492
Now, if Lyme were found to indeed be

1533
01:30:54,493 --> 01:30:55,825
a sexually transmitted disease,

1534
01:30:55,826 --> 01:31:00,092
that would change the landscape
of the whole argument.

1535
01:31:00,093 --> 01:31:02,058
The only way the Lyme disease
is transmitted

1536
01:31:02,059 --> 01:31:06,792
is through the bite of an Ixodes tick.

1537
01:31:06,793 --> 01:31:08,225
We know about Lyme disease.

1538
01:31:08,226 --> 01:31:12,258
It's something
that we have a good handle on.

1539
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:13,826
That's really the bottom line.

1540
01:31:22,493 --> 01:31:24,092
Jared is a very happy baby

1541
01:31:24,093 --> 01:31:27,392
that just wakes up happy,
laughs all day, giggles.

1542
01:31:27,393 --> 01:31:29,293
He just loves life.

1543
01:31:33,193 --> 01:31:37,492
Jared's test came back positive
for the Lyme antibody,

1544
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:40,093
which means he may be infected.

1545
01:31:42,693 --> 01:31:45,758
He may end up getting very sick
someday because of it,

1546
01:31:45,759 --> 01:31:47,392
but we're very lucky right now.

1547
01:31:47,393 --> 01:31:48,626
He's doing well.

1548
01:31:56,926 --> 01:31:58,592
I don't want to say that.

1549
01:31:58,593 --> 01:32:00,393
I don't want to say he has Lyme disease.

1550
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:09,125
I don't like to use that term
right now...

1551
01:32:09,126 --> 01:32:10,059
not yet.

1552
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:22,058
The controversy in Lyme
disease is a shameful affair,

1553
01:32:22,059 --> 01:32:27,592
because the whole thing
is politically tainted.

1554
01:32:27,593 --> 01:32:32,525
Money goes to people that have,
in the past 30 years,

1555
01:32:32,526 --> 01:32:37,259
produced the same thing:
nothing.

1556
01:32:43,093 --> 01:32:45,025
Lyme disease is a significant disease

1557
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:48,058
we don't have a cure for.

1558
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:50,892
And that we don't have accurate testing,

1559
01:32:50,893 --> 01:32:52,825
that should scare people,

1560
01:32:52,826 --> 01:32:54,925
'cause how do you know if you have it?

1561
01:32:54,926 --> 01:32:56,925
How do you know how to fix it?

1562
01:32:56,926 --> 01:32:58,825
How do you know what to do?

1563
01:32:58,826 --> 01:33:03,392
And by the time you're
so disabled by the disease,

1564
01:33:03,393 --> 01:33:06,392
you're in a panicked state.

1565
01:33:06,393 --> 01:33:08,892
You want help.
It doesn't matter.

1566
01:33:08,893 --> 01:33:13,158
You'll pay anything
to get your health back,

1567
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:16,058
and the fact that doctors
who are willing to help you

1568
01:33:16,059 --> 01:33:20,158
and are legitimate doctors
willing to put their license,

1569
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:23,892
their life, on the line to help you,

1570
01:33:23,893 --> 01:33:28,626
and that it even has
to come to that, is scary.

1571
01:33:30,626 --> 01:33:33,825
Dr. Burrascano,
good luck in whatever you do.

1572
01:33:33,826 --> 01:33:35,592
You're a wonderful doctor.

1573
01:33:35,593 --> 01:33:38,525
Well, recently,
I decided to close my practice.

1574
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:41,558
The political climate
for physicians treating Lyme

1575
01:33:41,559 --> 01:33:44,692
is very difficult nowadays.

1576
01:33:44,693 --> 01:33:47,225
This is a doctor who was hauled before

1577
01:33:47,226 --> 01:33:50,025
the New York's medical review board,

1578
01:33:50,026 --> 01:33:52,458
I think on two occasions,

1579
01:33:52,459 --> 01:33:56,425
and threatened
with removal of his license.

1580
01:33:56,426 --> 01:33:57,758
You know, I look at these charts

1581
01:33:57,759 --> 01:33:59,692
and I think of the people
who've gone blind.

1582
01:33:59,693 --> 01:34:01,892
They've lost their hearing.
They are in wheelchairs.

1583
01:34:01,893 --> 01:34:02,992
I mean, it's terrible,

1584
01:34:02,993 --> 01:34:05,625
and especially because so many of them,

1585
01:34:05,626 --> 01:34:08,292
it could have been prevented
if they were properly treated

1586
01:34:08,293 --> 01:34:09,392
in the beginning.

1587
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:10,525
That's what kills me.

1588
01:34:10,526 --> 01:34:12,425
Man, such a waste.

1589
01:34:12,426 --> 01:34:13,425
Look at all this.

1590
01:34:13,426 --> 01:34:15,425
Such a waste of people's lives,

1591
01:34:15,426 --> 01:34:20,425
of money, resources, time,
and all it takes is knowledge.

1592
01:34:20,426 --> 01:34:23,292
I bet you that if these people,
all of them,

1593
01:34:23,293 --> 01:34:24,858
had seen a Lyme-literate doctor

1594
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:26,425
in the very beginning of their illness,

1595
01:34:26,426 --> 01:34:28,825
I'm sure more than 1/2,
if not more than 3/4 of them,

1596
01:34:28,826 --> 01:34:30,793
would never have gotten
to that stage ever.

1597
01:34:38,293 --> 01:34:40,592
Lyme can go in so many directions.

1598
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:42,658
There's the people
that are hit really hard

1599
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:45,392
that are actually crippled
and handicapped.

1600
01:34:45,393 --> 01:34:47,192
They're very visibly ill.

1601
01:34:47,193 --> 01:34:49,692
And then there's people like myself

1602
01:34:49,693 --> 01:34:53,525
that, you know, are invisibly ill,

1603
01:34:53,526 --> 01:34:56,792
like the walking dead.

1604
01:34:56,793 --> 01:35:00,459
Now there is a possibility
of getting my body back.

1605
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:09,393
I'm feeling the best I've felt,
probably, in years.

1606
01:35:10,993 --> 01:35:13,258
I feel like my brain is back.

1607
01:35:13,259 --> 01:35:15,425
I have more energy.

1608
01:35:15,426 --> 01:35:18,992
You know, I feel much clearer.

1609
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:23,425
This is the first bit of hope I've had...

1610
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:27,592
real hope, in... for this whole time.

1611
01:35:27,593 --> 01:35:29,992
It's almost like
I started building a bridge

1612
01:35:29,993 --> 01:35:31,392
to the other side,

1613
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:35,392
and I kind of was going that way.

1614
01:35:35,393 --> 01:35:37,392
Now I'm looking back like,

1615
01:35:37,393 --> 01:35:41,825
"I'm gonna go walk back
into my body and start again."

1616
01:35:41,826 --> 01:35:45,126
It's daunting.

1617
01:35:51,226 --> 01:35:55,225
I met a lovely gentleman
who's been really supportive,

1618
01:35:55,226 --> 01:36:00,392
and... I don't know.

1619
01:36:00,393 --> 01:36:01,792
For the first time, it just...

1620
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:04,759
It feels so good
to have someone's support.

1621
01:36:11,826 --> 01:36:14,759
I don't have to go it alone anymore.

1622
01:36:30,626 --> 01:36:32,225
I can't tell you how excited I am.

1623
01:36:32,226 --> 01:36:36,193
This is just a marvelous,
marvelous new concept.

1624
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,292
Up until this point, we had a hunch

1625
01:36:41,293 --> 01:36:44,758
that the bug had to be
hiding somewhere in the body

1626
01:36:44,759 --> 01:36:47,392
in a form which we couldn't really

1627
01:36:47,393 --> 01:36:48,625
put our fingers on

1628
01:36:48,626 --> 01:36:50,626
and we couldn't really find
with a microscope.

1629
01:36:55,659 --> 01:36:58,226
One night, as I was looking
at a culture of Borrelia,

1630
01:36:58,293 --> 01:37:00,693
I saw a large colony of organisms

1631
01:37:00,759 --> 01:37:03,926
protected by a gel-like substance,

1632
01:37:03,993 --> 01:37:06,259
and as I was reviewing the pictures,

1633
01:37:06,393 --> 01:37:08,626
it became clear
that this was very reminiscent

1634
01:37:08,693 --> 01:37:10,093
of what they call a biofilm.

1635
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:15,526
The idea of a Borrelia biofilm
is very, very powerful,

1636
01:37:15,593 --> 01:37:17,993
because biofilm explains in that one word

1637
01:37:18,059 --> 01:37:21,493
why some cases
of Lyme disease are chronic,

1638
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:22,826
why they're hard to treat,

1639
01:37:22,893 --> 01:37:24,493
and why, after antibiotic treatment,

1640
01:37:24,559 --> 01:37:26,959
they may relapse,

1641
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:28,402
because biofilms are, by definition,

1642
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:32,893
chronic, difficult to treat,
and capable of relapse.

1643
01:37:38,626 --> 01:37:40,259
It's absolutely revolutionary.

1644
01:37:42,393 --> 01:37:44,992
The major medical journals have published

1645
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:47,825
that chronic Lyme disease is not real

1646
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:49,992
and it's a psychosomatic condition.

1647
01:37:49,993 --> 01:37:55,059
The biofilm model dismantles
that entire argument.

1648
01:38:01,893 --> 01:38:05,125
The patients were right all along.

1649
01:38:05,126 --> 01:38:09,858
It's a great opportunity to say,
"Aha, they were right,"

1650
01:38:09,859 --> 01:38:11,126
and they were right.

1651
01:38:13,959 --> 01:38:14,893
They were right.

1652
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:20,426
Wait up.

1653
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:31,492
This disease nearly destroyed my life.

1654
01:38:31,493 --> 01:38:34,393
It got really bad.
It got really bad.

1655
01:38:37,259 --> 01:38:39,592
I'm happy to have my family still.

1656
01:38:39,593 --> 01:38:43,225
I'm thankful to them for staying with me.

1657
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:45,225
I'm back.

1658
01:38:45,226 --> 01:38:46,626
I'm glad to be here.

1659
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:54,625
If I'd stopped treatment
after even the first year,

1660
01:38:54,626 --> 01:38:56,225
I never would have made it

1661
01:38:56,226 --> 01:38:58,559
anywhere close to where I am now.

1662
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:03,758
Mind you, I had to fight for what I got.

1663
01:39:03,759 --> 01:39:05,092
In the current system,

1664
01:39:05,093 --> 01:39:07,025
I'd get maybe
a month of treatment, that's it.

1665
01:39:07,026 --> 01:39:08,925
Everything you have
is what you're going to have

1666
01:39:08,926 --> 01:39:10,292
for the rest of your life,

1667
01:39:10,293 --> 01:39:12,492
and yet all the improvement
that I've experienced

1668
01:39:12,493 --> 01:39:14,859
happens after the third year
of treatment.

1669
01:39:20,193 --> 01:39:23,758
And then there's the phase where
I start to get my life back,

1670
01:39:23,759 --> 01:39:26,025
and that's the phase I'm in now,

1671
01:39:26,026 --> 01:39:28,393
and it's like magic.

1672
01:39:32,393 --> 01:39:33,726
I'm so glad to be here.

1673
01:39:36,093 --> 01:39:37,593
I can't even say.
