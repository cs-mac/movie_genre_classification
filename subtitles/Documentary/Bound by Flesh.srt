how much trust it takes two people
to do something like this.

Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

437
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,980
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

481
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,570
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
Iike leaves.

482
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,530
[ Hissing ]

483
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,130
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

484
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
[ Hissing Continues ]

485
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,560
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

486
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,470
All night long
I listened to that sound.

487
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,230
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

488
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,030
[ Fluttering ]

489
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,560
Where is it now?

490
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,170
It's in his office.

491
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,160
I saw it this morning.

492
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,960
I need to go to the store.

493
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,210
It's in a case on his desk.

494
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,280
Does the case lock?

495
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,660
Yes.

496
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,190
- Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

497
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,150
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

498
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,100
Like each other?
They hate each other.

499
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,870
- Why?
- I don't know.

500
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Happened long before
I came around.

501
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,510
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

502
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,080
but, you know,
what can you do?

503
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,650
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

504
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,800
Who's Gino?

505
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,060
Gino Marzzone.

506
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,360
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

507
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,390
Yeah, that's his brother.

508
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,810
Shit.

509
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,340
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

510
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,020
Yeah.

511
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,520
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

512
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,980
Yeah.

513
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,660
Sweet Jesus.

514
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,560
It's perfect.

515
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,360
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

516
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,320
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

517
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,850
- Has Gino been to your place before?
- Yeah, twice.

518
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,770
- What happened?
- Caesar was really nervous.

519
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,950
He kept cleaning the apartment.

520
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,100
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

521
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,020
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

522
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,320
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

523
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,310
- Did Caesar ever see this?
- He does it right in front of him.

524
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,920
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

525
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,870
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

526
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,060
so he usually gets
right to the point.

527
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,780
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

528
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,930
They had a drink
and then they left.

529
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,040
- What did Gino drink?
- Scotch.

530
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,570
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

531
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,900
All right.

532
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,540
I have an idea
how to make this work.

533
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,720
[ Corky ] Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

534
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,210
What time did you say
they'd be there?

535
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,050
[ Violet ] The plane gets in
at 7:00, so I'd say around 8:00.

536
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,390
- [ Yawns ]
- [ Corky ] All right.

537
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,810
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

538
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,030
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

539
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,550
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

540
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,470
[ Caesar ] Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

541
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,040
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

542
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,110
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

543
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,140
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

544
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,090
[ Moans ]

545
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,770
[ Corky ]
You want him to relax, unwind.

546
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,190
You look good enough to eat.

547
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,070
[ Violet ]
Where will you be?

548
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,330
[ Corky ] I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

549
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,520
- [ Violet ] Waiting for what?
- [ Corky ] For the shower.

550
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,470
That's gonna be our signal.

551
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,190
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

552
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,030
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

553
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,220
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

554
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,710
An accident.

555
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,970
[ Caesar ]
Vi, what the hell was that?

556
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,540
Vi, you can't hear me?

557
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,570
- Ah, fuck!
- Caesar, it slipped.

558
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,530
- I was trying to get ready.
- How the fuck did you do that?

559
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,020
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

560
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,710
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fuckin' time!

561
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,670
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

562
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,430
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

563
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,040
Fuck, Vi!

564
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,900
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

565
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,200
[ Violet ]
What if he sees you?

566
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,850
[ Corky ]
He won't.

567
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,720
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

568
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,020
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking. What if?

569
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,510
If he does...

570
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,080
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

571
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,650
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

572
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,510
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

573
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,420
Hide it near the desk.

574
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,770
And at that point...

575
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,450
there's no turning back.

576
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,760
When I get the scotch...

577
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,790
how do I know
you won't just take off?

578
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,050
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

579
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,160
Trust.

580
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,270
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

581
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,230
with all the money
in the apartment.

582
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,420
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

583
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,800
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

584
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,990
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

585
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,020
You gotta be as real as you can.

586
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,630
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

587
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,010
you'll be covered.

588
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,310
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

589
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,870
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

590
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,100
he'll want to.

591
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,330
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

592
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,320
- What are you talkin' about?
- They just left, didn't they?

593
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,190
- What, are you drunk?
- They weren't just up here?

594
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,610
No, they're still on their way.

595
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,260
That doesn't make any sense.

596
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,860
- Why?
- I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

597
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,590
What?

598
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

599
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,340
- Nah, it couldn't have been.
- It was him, Caesar.

600
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,680
I'm positive.

601
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,940
Vi, that's impossible.

602
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,860
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

603
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,390
It was him.

604
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,040
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

605
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,230
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

606
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,410
and give Gino the scotch, but...

607
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,560
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

608
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,860
But...

609
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,120
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

610
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,260
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

611
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,180
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

612
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,710
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

613
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,510
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

614
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,470
There's only one way out.

615
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,660
He'll have to run.

616
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,220
And if he runs...

617
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,910
everyone will assume
he took the money.

618
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,830
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

619
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,170
[ Violet ]
Jesus, that's beautiful.

620
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,310
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

621
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,300
I had a partner once.

622
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,840
She fucked me.

623
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,560
I won't.

624
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,350
I think we're gonna find out.

625
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,800
- Oh, God!
- Caesar?

626
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,980
No.

627
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,550
[ Violet ]
C?

628
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,350
Oh, no.

629
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,230
Oh, God.

630
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,150
[ Groans ]

631
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,520
Vi.

632
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,170
Vi, I've been set up.

633
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,710
Johnnie?

634
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,210
That fuck!
