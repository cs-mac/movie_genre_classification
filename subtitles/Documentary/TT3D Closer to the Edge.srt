1
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,578
(Bike engine revving)

2
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,206
(Chris Mayhew) There is nothing
to compare it with.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,578
It's the most exhilarating place
in the world.

4
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,336
It's like being able to fly.

5
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,426
Just like growing wings.

6
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,598
If it's in your blood, you...
You can't get it out.

7
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,473
You just want more.

8
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,190
(Cameron Donald) You put
the earplugs in, the helmet goes on.

9
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,403
Everything goes quiet.

10
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,197
You know what's ahead of you,

11
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,158
and everything else around you
is forgotten

12
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
and it's time you get on with the job.

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,620
(Michael Dunlop)
My mind goes completely blank.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,282
And my mind just goes into madness.

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,379
(Bike engine revving)

16
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,998
(Crowd cheering)

17
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,788
(Alarm ringing)

18
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,837
(Guy Martin) Well, I suppose
it all revolved around

19
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,422
Mr Acum,
me primary school teacher, really.

20
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,804
And he didn't half put manners in us,
that man.

21
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,594
You know, in my day, like, and all that.

22
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,721
But I think, you know,
fuck it, what a boy.

23
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,978
Just, you know, if we was naughty,
he used to give us the slipper:

24
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,313
We knew we was getting it,
cos he used to warm it up on a radiator

25
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,310
before he give us it.

26
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,689
If we was naughty again, which was
mostly me, I was naughty all the time,

27
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,112
we used to have to pick stones up
so the lawn mower

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,450
wouldn't run over them.

29
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,120
He used to have his own putting green
out the back of school

30
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:20,164
and our main job was keeping the
putting green right and mowing grass.

31
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,619
And then, yeah,
I thought natural progression,

32
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,330
I wanted to go and race them.

33
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,756
I've still got my first engine
I ever had.

34
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,172
Suffolk Punch lawn mower engine,
I think it's down there.

35
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,169
Yeah, I just used to play with that.
It was all I wanted to do.

36
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,469
I wasn't bothered about...
You know, I had a few mates.

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,263
But I wasn't bothered about,
you know, girls.

38
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,928
I'm still
not bothered about girls, really.

39
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,308
I'm not gay or owt.

40
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:46,319
But I'm just, you know, I'd rather play
with lorries and tractors and engines.

41
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,729
Still, I haven't really grown up.
No, I haven't grown up.

42
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,240
- You got the key?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,324
Are we all right, then?

44
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,199
Right hand down, boss.

45
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,169
Road racers? A bit mad...

46
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,589
That's tight. You bastard.

47
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,433
What would you say...

48
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,227
A tile short of a roof?

49
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,188
One short of a six pack?

50
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,688
A few slates adrift?
We'd use that one a lot.

51
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,939
Lights are on but no one's home.

52
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,857
I can imagine,
from the outside looking in,

53
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,694
anyone that's racing the TT looks like
the lights are on but no one's home.

54
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,945
(Engine starting)

55
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,545
You're not a proper road racer
until you've won a TT.

56
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,957
I obviously aren't a proper road racer,
because I haven't won one.

57
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,008
But I'm trying. I don't give in.

58
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,264
Barry Sheene wasn't a big fan, was he?

59
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,929
He thought it was too dangerous, did he.

60
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,514
There you go, lager-shandy drinking
southern poofters, there you go.

61
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,554
That says it all, doesn't it? Yeah.

62
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,730
That's it, we're away now.

63
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,906
All right, boss.

64
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,612
We're getting there.

65
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,278
I was only watching that
the other night, the Dam Busters.

66
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,780
Yeah, it's mega, that. Wallis Barnes.

67
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,951
You know the idea
that got him into that was, um...

68
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,078
No. Not Napoleon...

69
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,377
Who was your boy, that used it in
the battleships? Beginning with an "N"?

70
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,250
Not Napoleon...

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,085
(Engine revving)

72
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,011
Different things
make different people happy, don't they?

73
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,013
Some lads love going to the pub,
I don't like being in the pub.

74
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,685
Some lads love shagging,
I don't like shagging

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,387
I don't mind it, but I'm not into it.

76
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,605
I'd rather just go and ride
me motorbikes or me pushbikes.

77
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,689
It's whatever you're into, isn't it?

78
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,644
If we was all the same everybody
would be at the TT. wouldn't they?

79
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,487
But different things
make different people tick.

80
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,656
And that makes me tick, and that's
why I'm gonna keep on going.

81
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,320
I just want to keep going
until I've won one.

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,279
Or won five, that's my plan, win five in
a week, that's not been done before.

83
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,072
I'll go and do that, then that's it.
I'll go and find the next job to do

84
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,831
I've got another big goal, this...

85
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,036
He's a massive... Well, not massive,
he's not massive, is he?

86
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,621
He's not massive.

87
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,456
People use that word, don't they.

88
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,917
I'll tell you what people word...
People use all the time.

89
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,294
Unbelievable.

90
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,964
Can't use that word, can you?
"Unbelievable."

91
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,473
When a man...
Like I've said this before,

92
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,134
when a man eats his own head, I will
then hold my hands up and say,

93
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,474
"Right, that was unbelievable."

94
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,479
Cos I can't believe
a man can eat his own head.

95
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,682
But, like we say, never say never.

96
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,358
(Commentator) Unbelievable,
absolutely unbelievable.

97
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,488
(Martin) Evel Knievel was
the big stuntman at the time

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,204
and I had a stars and stripes suit,
and a stars and stripes helmet

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,951
and I thought I was Evel Knievel,
you know.

100
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,583
My dad used to build me a ramp
and I used to jump 14 toy buses,

101
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,336
where Evel Knievel tried
to jump the 14 real buses.

102
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,044
I wrote to Jim'll Fix it,
for me to do a jump with him

103
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,174
and he never even replied back,
the miserable old goat.

104
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,336
It's always been in me.
I don't know any different.

105
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,171
I'm not really interested
in anything else, you know,

106
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,388
football, cricket or anything.

107
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,802
It's just been bikes
all the way through my life.

108
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,191
(Alarm sounding)

109
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,159
(Becky) He's still a little boy
at heart. He's crackers, really.

110
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,498
When I met him,
he'd just finished motocross

111
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,159
and he was wanting
to get into racing bikes.

112
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,164
And he always said, "I'm going to do
an Isle of Man TT race one day. "

113
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,751
And he said, "I just want to win a TT,
I'll get it under my belt and that's it.

114
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,752
"I'll, you know, never do it again- "

115
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,633
And he won his first 250 race,

116
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,098
and we're like, "Oh, that's it,
he's going to finish now. "

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,216
I thought, "Thank God for that. "

118
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,052
But it just makes that bug
grow even bigger; I think.

119
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,972
(John McGuinness) Even then,
when I was 10 years old,

120
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,477
I just used to watch it,
and it'd just blow me away.

121
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,893
I used to think,
"That's gonna be me one day.

122
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,402
"I'm gonna win one of these- "

123
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,442
if I had been sat there then,
and someone would have said,

124
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,691
you know, I'll have 15 wins, I probably
would have laughed at them

125
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,656
and fell off the wall,
but here I am with 15 wins.

126
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,071
But I still get that,
you know, jitters now.

127
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,749
You know, TT's coming. TT's coming.
Building up. Building up.

128
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,083
I get apprehensive, nervous.
Months before the TT, you know.

129
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,998
And when I think about it, it makes
me skip a heartbeat, really.

130
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,460
I have to have the house immaculate,
and the garage has to be immaculate.

131
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,843
Everything's got to have its place.

132
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,256
I'll mow the lawn, make sure
that's all right. Clean the cars.

133
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,759
So, just in case anything does happen,
then everything's ready.

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,930
I definitely think about it.
It's got to cross your mind.

135
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,895
It has to cross your mind,
cos it's there, all the time.

136
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,061
It's a reality that
you might not come back.

137
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,651
(Commentator)
John McGuinness 17.43,127,

138
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,237
under the lap
record from a standing start!

139
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,077
(Jared Leto) For two
incredible weeks each summer;

140
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,833
generations of men and women
have made the pilgrimage

141
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,999
to the lsle of Man to pit
themselves against the track,

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,498
which has achieved international status

143
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,167
and become synonymous
with speed and glory

144
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,305
At a time when the maximum
permitted speed on English roads

145
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,135
was just 20 miles per hour
and racing strictly prohibited,

146
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,642
a band of enthusiasts
intent on testing their bikes

147
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,315
and themselves to the limits
of speed and endurance

148
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,101
gathered on the Isle of Man,

149
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,986
and in 1907 the Tourist Trophy was born.

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,072
(Whirring)

151
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,074
You see? Look at the suspension.

152
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,955
You see?

153
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,995
And then we'll put it the other way.

154
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,581
Watch that.

155
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,009
Keep watching.

156
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,844
It'll do something.

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,641
See? Look at that. Hey?

158
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,519
(Ian Martin) Me and Guy have got
the typical father-son relationship.

159
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,640
(Guy laughs)

160
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,484
- Guy knows best, and I knows best.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,024
I'll put a brew on.

162
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,779
See, a Steadicam That's what it is.

163
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,026
Must have shockers in it or something.

164
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,111
You what?

165
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,741
Say, when you was
holding that thing you can jar

166
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,739
but that takes all the jar
out of the camera, doesn't it?

167
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,829
(Cameraman speaking)

168
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,710
Are they dear?
I bet it's dear that, innit.

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,412
Go on, how much is that arm there then?

170
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,837
(Cameraman speaking)

171
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,919
- Fourteen hundred?
- (Cameraman speaking)

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,667
Fuck off.

173
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,339
Fourteen grand?

174
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,631
Fourteen grand.

175
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,641
Fucking hell.

176
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,562
Fuck, have you seen that?
Fourteen grand.

177
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,821
(Ian) Me first TT was '74,

178
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,950
riding a Gus Kuhn Norton
Commando production bike.

179
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,078
I thought,
I'm gonna be a TT superstar here.

180
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,494
So I set off from...

181
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,666
How old was you?

182
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,744
I was...

183
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,456
How old was I?

184
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,458
1974.

185
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,919
Forty seven. What's that, then?

186
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:14,467
- I don't know. '74... '47. By heck.
- Anyway...

187
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,180
Come into Glen Helen,
up Craig Willie's hill,

188
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,432
cranked it in...

189
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,638
Down, down, down,
no further to go, bang.

190
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,764
Straight over the bank.

191
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,058
The bike finished up in three bits.

192
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,102
And I broke my back.

193
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,109
And I was back at the TT again
the following year.

194
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,113
My worst crash ever?

195
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,532
Probably North West, 2008.

196
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,993
Come off the Black Hill, lost the front,
on the apex of the corner,

197
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,794
not very fast, maybe 120 miles an hour

198
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,000
Hit the kerb with my arse
at 120 mile an hour.

199
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,832
I walked away. Walked away no bother.

200
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,128
The bike was nothing,
we could hardly salvage anything.

201
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,339
Everything was written off on it.
Everything.

202
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,300
I got away from that, but it scarred me.

203
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,056
It didn't scar me for life, it just...

204
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,309
Proper. I just thought another one
of those moments I thought, ooh.

205
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,811
But that's a buzz that,

206
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,680
you know, get it wrong, you're
an inch out here and that's it.

207
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,856
Yeah, it was a lot like that.

208
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,974
(Engine starting)

209
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,862
I'm not like
a sadomasochist or anything,

210
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,864
I'm not purposefully going out there
trying to kill myself

211
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,742
No, definitely not. The opposite,
really, I want to succeed, you know?

212
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,528
But that's the buzz you get
out of trying to do that.

213
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,828
You do end up in that position

214
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,663
where it looks like it's going
to be game over at any moment.

215
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,744
But, those positions, money cannot
buy the buzz you get out of it.

216
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,164
That thing that you get, that you
think, "That's it, game over,"

217
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,209
you don't go into a panic, you just,
"This is it, game over."

218
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,835
I've been in about four of them
since I've been racing,

219
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,256
and I've been racing 10 years now.

220
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,262
And all of those moments, I think three
of those moments were at the TT.

221
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,152
(Ian) I come to the gym
a couple of times a week,

222
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,572
and get out on my mountain bike
a couple of times a week.

223
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,326
I enjoy my training
and it keeps me focused on the job.

224
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,573
I don't like anything to
sort of let my riding slip.

225
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,328
If a bit of training's what it takes,
then that's what I do.

226
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,372
I've always been a bike fanatic

227
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,008
but my parents have
always been against it

228
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,467
and by the time I got to 15, I think
I wore my parents down that much.

229
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,636
They were a bit concerned
about me getting a road bike

230
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:25,018
so they got me a trials bike
and the minute I was 17, I took my test

231
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,353
and got a road bike,
so it backfired a bit on my parents.

232
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,728
But, you know, I met a group of lads
that blagged a caravan for free,

233
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,237
it was an absolute wreck.

234
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,240
Dragged it all over the country,
it was falling apart

235
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,912
and we got to race meetings, had a few
beers at a barbecue, raced all day.

236
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,537
It was just great
to experience that side of it.

237
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,537
Natural ability pulls you
through to a certain level,

238
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,215
but if I'm in a race and it
comes down to a tight battle,

239
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,839
and I lose the race basically
through fitness or something,

240
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,754
you know, I'd be devastated with myself

241
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,008
so I get very obsessed
about what I'm doing.

242
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,927
There's only one outcome for me.

243
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,392
To win the race.

244
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,318
(Leto) Every one of the 37 and
three-quarter miles of public roads

245
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,488
that makes up the course has
created a champion or hero.

246
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,033
Over 200 corners must be
negotiated up to six times

247
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,408
to complete the world's toughest
road race in the fastest time.

248
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,834
There are five races over a week
culminating with the Senior TT.

249
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,286
With speeds of up to 200 miles per hour

250
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,127
and the opportunity
for disaster around every corner;

251
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,125
its dangers are set in stone.

252
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,051
To date, 231 riders have lost
their lives on the TT course.

253
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,598
To win just one TT
is an outstanding achievement.

254
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,852
The legendary Joey Dunlop
has an unmatched 26 wins,

255
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,817
John McGuinness holds
the outright lap record

256
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,863
and Phil McCallan is the only rider
to have won four out of the five races

257
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,489
run each year

258
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,326
No one has ever won five out of five.

259
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,209
(Man) So, can I ask Fred Dibnah...
Sorry, I meant Guy Martin.

260
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,841
- So the laundry didn't come back?
- (Martin) No...

261
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,718
I get told off
for not saying the right thing,

262
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,888
or doing this, or doing that
and not wearing the right clothes

263
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,009
and what have you.

264
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,099
And it just sort of gets
on top of you sometimes.

265
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,727
Well, not gets on top of you,
but it takes the fun out of it all.

266
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,068
Whereas Wilson, for me, he's doing it
for the same reasons I'm doing it.

267
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,857
You know, doing it to enjoy it.
Doing it to win.

268
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,238
I see it as David and Goliath.

269
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,782
And that I think that's
what motivates me in many ways.

270
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,532
That Guy come back
to a small team and can win.

271
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,247
(Martin) Could you call it
a deal, Wilson?

272
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,324
There weren't a lot of
paper signing going on.

273
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,202
Just a firm handshake I think, Wilson.

274
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,250
I suppose I should say
to have a gentleman's agreement,

275
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,297
- we need two gentlemen.
- (Both laughing)

276
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,425
Well, I wouldn't say I was a gentleman.

277
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,794
(Mumbling)

278
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,219
Guy's all right.

279
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,547
Yeah, but we won't go
as far as gentleman.

280
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,137
You know when I was wanking, didn't you?

281
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,723
Oh, yeah, I used to regularly wake up
and see Guy pulling one out.

282
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,429
I had to go back
to bed for a few minutes

283
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,806
while he finished himself off.

284
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,106
Yeah, cos he used
to sleep above the cab.

285
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,605
I slept above you, didn't I?

286
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,478
You could tell.
I didn't really know that

287
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,605
until I broke my ankle right bad,
you remember that?

288
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,064
Your toes go, do you know?

289
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,904
When you're wanking. Yeah.

290
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,242
So you'd see Guy's toes twitching...

291
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,493
And you knew I was on it.

292
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,410
In the morning, his toes'd be going,
and I'd give him five more minutes.

293
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,656
- Crack a load off.
- Yeah. Get a load off.

294
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,242
(Engine starting)

295
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,620
(Leto) In the build-up to the TT.

296
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,419
Every other race meeting is
a chance to perfect the bikes,

297
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,916
impress new sponsors

298
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,173
and develop the speeds needed
to compete on the Isle of Man.

299
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,466
You having a brew?

300
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,639
(Martin) We're not here
for any lap times or fuck all, really.

301
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,842
We're not bothered
whether We're last or first.

302
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,017
We're just here to suss the bike out.

303
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,230
You need to be a good
mechanic to work with me,

304
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,765
and I'm a bit awkward
to get on with, I suppose,

305
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,392
because I'm very particular
about how I want stuff doing.

306
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,319
Most motorbike riders just get on it
and turn the throttle,

307
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,234
but I like to know
what makes that bike tick.

308
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,149
I like the whole idea behind
the old internal combustion engine,

309
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,943
and the way stuffs made.

310
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,616
You need to have a bit
of mechanical sympathy, don't you.

311
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,955
You can't go charging in there
like a bull in a china shop.

312
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,495
It's all gonna end in tears, isn't it.
You end up breaking gear boxes

313
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,043
and blowing engines up
and all that sort of caper

314
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,830
Still no quick shifting, we don't
know anyone that's got one.

315
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,046
No.

316
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,545
(Mayhew) Mechanical failures
are what all riders dread.

317
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,176
Sometimes they're over-revved,
and sometimes something breaks.

318
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,889
(Tyres screeching)

319
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,181
om My God.

320
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,360
You know, if a part breaks,
then it's just bad for everybody

321
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,817
in the TT particularly, because,
well, you only get one hit

322
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,444
and then you got to wait 12 months
to have another go.

323
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,073
(Martin) I don't have heroes
until Chris Mayhew.

324
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,320
Yeah, he's the boy. Mad, in a way.

325
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,498
Lovely bloke, into his dogs.
He nearly got his dog to talk.

326
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,247
Nearly. Likes his grandfather clocks.

327
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,664
Makes his own wine, he's got a grapevine
growing out of his garden.

328
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,166
Through a window, that he's chiselled
out in his conservatory,

329
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,255
that grows into his conservatory.

330
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,633
You know, gets his own grapes.
Makes his own wine.

331
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,047
That's a boy that, innit.
Not many folk do that.

332
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,807
(Engines revving)

333
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,597
(Mayhew) I got an entry
into the TT in '73,

334
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,013
And I crashed in both races.

335
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,442
So, I saw more of Noble's Hospital
than the track really.

336
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,192
What I do, basically,
is take a road engine

337
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,865
and turn it into a race engine.

338
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,911
My biggest boast, I think,
was in the hundredth year of the TT

339
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,576
Every single winning engine
or lap record machine

340
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,702
came out of this workshop.

341
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,585
You know, Guy I think, has got
the best bikes he ever could.

342
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,371
I shall obviously do my best

343
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,048
and Guy obviously will put
the finishing touches to it.

344
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,709
If he's happy, he'll be there.

345
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,387
I have every confidence
that if things work in our favour

346
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,511
we're going to come away with a result.

347
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,895
One thing I'm concerned about is
we mustn't start thinking it's our turn.

348
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,354
Cos it never is your turn.

349
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,274
But I think the ingredients are right

350
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,602
if they're mixed properly.

351
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,899
(Man chattering on PA)

352
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,405
(Leto) Northern Ireland's
North West 200 race meeting

353
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,156
also takes place on public roads

354
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,577
and is the very last chance to get
the bikes ready for the TT.

355
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,163
(Engines revving)

356
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,251
(Commentator 1) Heads down
for the lights above the track

357
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,678
and when they go out
this race will be underway.

358
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,968
And Michael Dunlop's
been mugged, hasn't he!

359
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,306
(Commentator 2) Onboard
with Michael Dunlop, then,

360
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,009
just looking what was
going on in front of him.

361
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,685
There you see him,
coming down over the hill.

362
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,474
165 miles an hour!

363
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,097
(Commentator 1)
That's a man's corner, that!

364
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,732
(Leto) Michael Dunlop and his brother
William are the next generation

365
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,940
of a road racing dynasty
that began with their Uncle Joey

366
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,949
and father Robert Dunlop.

367
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,327
(Dunlop) They were
the biggest road racers I think,

368
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,575
that the world has ever had.

369
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,457
So the inspiration I got
from them was just so much.

370
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,543
Growing up with two people,
you never seen them as heroes

371
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,376
or superstars, you just
see them as two normal people.

372
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,298
(Engine revving)

373
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,015
(Leto) Joey blew out the competition
when in 2000, aged 49

374
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,468
he won a third hat trick of TT races.

375
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,441
He was killed three weeks later
in a little-known race in Estonia.

376
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,352
Over 50, 000 mourners
attended his funeral.

377
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,242
His brother Robert
was almost killed in 1998

378
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,569
when his rear wheel collapsed

379
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,654
in an accident at the TT.

380
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,035
But raced for 10 more years
until his death in 2008

381
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,204
during the final practise lap
at the North West 200.

382
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,173
(Dunlop) He knew the circuit,
he knew it well,

383
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,668
and a mechanical failure happened

384
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,337
and it happens to the best of riders.

385
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,097
It was a sad loss to the sport,
a sad loss to us, you know.

386
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,386
But for some reason, I just thought
that Saturday I wanted to ride the 250.

387
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,851
(Commentator) Tears of joy
and look at Michael Dunlop.

388
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,478
(Leto) Two days after
witnessing his father's death,

389
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,566
Michael went on to win the race
and reduce the onlookers to tears.

390
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,823
(Commentator) What must be
going through his mind right now

391
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,492
because that was more than a race.

392
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,532
(Dunlop) You're only a young man,
you know,

393
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,404
all you have for life is a bit of craic,
you know what I mean?

394
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,582
And you don't think you're gonna
have to bring on a lot of stuff,

395
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,577
so I got turned from a boy into a man
in a very short space of time.

396
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,378
And I hope they're up there now,
and they're being looked after.

397
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,054
(Commentator 1) Conor Cummins!

398
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,390
(Commentator 2) Conor Cummins,
the Isle of Man rider;

399
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,758
he's fast, really very fast.

400
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,060
And he's down! Cummins is down!

401
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,063
I took the lead from Ryan, just as I
was coming out of the come;

402
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,808
the back end sort of stepped out on me

403
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,817
and high-sided me
over the top of the bike.

404
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,735
And I was really, really lucky
to come away unhurt there.

405
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,446
I just had to pick myself up,
dusted myself down,

406
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,244
and straight out on the bike
in the next race.

407
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,201
If you fall off a horse,
you get straight back on it.

408
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,079
(Leto) Guy has taken a tumble, too.

409
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,913
I'm all right, I mean,
bloody hell, it's not bad, is it?

410
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,339
That's been, damn, I've just done...
I done that.

411
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,417
And me finger, can you see me finger?

412
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,427
Didn't keep me eye on the ball,
you know, so much going on.

413
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,179
And, yeah, my fault.

414
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,508
Hit the kerb on the inside and took
the front, ended up in the grass.

415
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,469
Bike was OK, we had to put a new...
What did we have to do?

416
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,932
What did we have to do?

417
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,438
(Man speaking)

418
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,766
Engine cover. Water hose.

419
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,766
I didn't wreck it.

420
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,186
(Commentator) Michael Dunlop,
that's Ryan Farquhar, number 77...

421
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,113
Someone's blown up. That's Guy Martin.
Guy Martin, the engine has gone.

422
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,782
(Leto) In the second race,
Guy over-revs the bike

423
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,280
and blows up his engine.

424
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,861
(Commentator) He's completely
out of the race.

425
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,455
(Wilson Craig) This was
not a good meeting here,

426
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,165
as far as results are concerned.

427
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,957
We had a couple of things
that didn't go according to plan.

428
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,256
Aye, "a couple"? A bit more
than a couple, but yeah.

429
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,842
(Wilson) It has been a learning curve.

430
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,464
You may think
we're a bit old to be learning,

431
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,761
but we're still learning.

432
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,757
The upside, Guy will go
to the TT with that bike

433
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,263
and two brand new engines, brand new.

434
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,939
(Martin) Speed's not bad, need to work
on speed a little bit, but it's not bad.

435
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,974
Stability's good, handling's good,
tyres are good,

436
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,439
there's a few issues,
but we're happy now.

437
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,862
(Rita Martin) I'm going, and my ferry's
booked. I'm going in the camper

438
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,530
because otherwise you're sat at home.

439
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,488
You know, you're sat at home,
twiddling your thumbs.

440
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,706
You know, waiting for a phone call.

441
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,034
So you might as well
be there, among it all.

442
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,038
(Indistinct)

443
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,670
- You lock the door?
- Yeah.

444
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,697
(Leto) For over 100 years,
the Isle of Man

445
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,327
has attracted riders and race fans

446
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,543
to watch their heroes
race the mountain course.

447
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,834
The modest prize money means
that this close knit band of brothers

448
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,419
ride purely for the love of the sport

449
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,050
and the glory of winning.

450
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,087
(Rosie Sayle)
If you're born on the Isle of Man

451
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,136
you're sort of brought up
with motorbikes and races.

452
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,556
You've got the island
going from black and white,

453
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,896
quiet, rural country roads.

454
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,229
All of a sudden they've got teams
of bikers going down them.

455
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,570
It's just lovely to see
the island come alive.

456
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,813
(Whooping)

457
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,614
(John Kennaugh)
Stories, nothing but stories.

458
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,283
Spinning away
to the height of their glory.

459
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,078
It's a festival.
It's a coming together of everyone

460
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,704
who appreciates motorcycling

461
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,290
The stories that are told,
as you sit at the hedge,

462
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,706
or the marshals
in groups around the island,

463
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,625
are all lived and relived every year.

464
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,302
And we never get tired of swapping them.

465
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,263
(Fan) Let's just say there's a large
segment of the motorcycling population

466
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,270
in America that knows
well about the TT, as I do,

467
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,189
and probably have put it on their,
what we call a bucket list,

468
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,979
things to do before you kick the bucket.

469
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,521
To go to the TT and that's why I'm here.
I had the opportunity to come.

470
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,980
It's something I've always wanted to do.

471
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,948
My father and I talked
about coming here together

472
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,487
for years and never did.

473
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,032
He's passed away, so it's on me to come

474
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,454
and enjoy the experience

475
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,790
and share it with him
however I can later on perhaps.

476
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,538
Well, I've worn these leathers
for 27 years now,

477
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:41,458
and at least 27 years more
I will bring the leathers to the TT.

478
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,801
My name is Karen Anderson,
and I've come all the way from Australia

479
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,133
to watch Cameron Donald race the TT.

480
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,968
(Engine revving)

481
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,095
We've sat above here,
in a room on the balcony,

482
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,021
and we've watched the guys
coming around that corner,

483
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,481
and there was a lamppost there.

484
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,893
And the lamppost was padded, and
they would come round, dipping,

485
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,781
and then they'd do that in and out,
to get round the lamppost

486
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,361
And that to me was heart
in my mouth, heart in my mouth,

487
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,734
heart in my mouth, brilliant.

488
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,869
Yeah, I know what can happen.

489
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,578
(Both laughing)

490
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,374
But with her on the back,
you won't get too quick,

491
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,367
- else you get beat up.
- (Laughing)

492
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,250
It's a very hairy place. Very fast.

493
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,041
To watch the bravest men in the world.

494
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,512
And if it doesn't excite you,
you're not alive.

495
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,635
And that's a fact.

496
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,605
(Leto) Within hours of arriving,
Guy is unhappy

497
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,061
with the bike's suspension.

498
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,733
In particular the swinging arm

499
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,570
because of its importance
for a fast wheel change.

500
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,197
(Martin) Wilson. Can we put
the other swinging arm in

501
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,402
and get Simon to change the wheel?

502
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,862
It's shit.

503
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,205
And it's gonna go wrong.

504
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,203
If the bike was given to me
in the first place, Wilson,

505
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,830
then we wouldn't be
going through this problem.

506
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,541
And I did say this in the first place.

507
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,001
(Leto) Guy has upset
the authorities, too,

508
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,171
because of his plans to work
on the bikes away from the paddock.

509
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,593
(Martin) I was expecting
there to be tension,

510
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,429
because that's why I stayed out the way.

511
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,930
I've got the airbed that goes
in the back of my van,

512
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:16,927
and I've just been staying in my van.

513
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,810
When it comes to how
I want bikes preparing,

514
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,941
if they aren't right, that's it,
I'll just pack in and go home.

515
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,064
I won't stick my neck out if things
aren't exactly how I want,

516
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,604
and I'm so meticulous with things.

517
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,276
We're gonna meet in the middle,
we're gonna have to meet

518
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,990
in the middle, aren't we?
I can't have it all my way, can I?

519
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,237
Because Wilson's bought the bikes,

520
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,575
and put a lot of money into the bikes.

521
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,236
But I'm the one
risking me neck out there,

522
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,453
and that's why my head
needs to be right.

523
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,947
And Wilson's always said to me
from the off

524
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,158
that my head needs to be right,
and then to get my head right

525
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,962
it needs to be my way, which is doing
bikes with no interruptions.

526
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,334
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to meet
in the middle, me and Wilson.

527
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,961
The bikes will have to be
back here at a certain time,

528
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,134
and then I have to do certain bits

529
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,211
of nodding and smiling
and agreeing with people.

530
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,965
(Wilson) There's a contract.
The team gets X number of pounds,

531
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,760
so they expect Guy to be professional.

532
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,230
And Guy sometimes makes statements
that they don't like.

533
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,393
People like him. Maybe because
there's a bit of a rebel about him

534
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,398
and so on. So, we have to... We just
have to make do with what we have.

535
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,030
If I dictated to Guy it wouldn't work.

536
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,786
He's just a mechanic,

537
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,451
who is a brilliant ride;
a brilliant motorcyclist

538
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,203
The bikes are ready to race,

539
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,039
but he has to have
his touch to the bikes.

540
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,289
He knows I have given him
everything he has asked for.

541
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,800
So, it has to work this time.

542
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,262
And the bike will be checked
and checked again for anything.

543
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,181
And then you're in the lap of the gods.

544
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,984
(Martin) What's after the corner
makes a massive difference.

545
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,490
If you get this corner right
and make a proper job of it,

546
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,072
then you can make 10 seconds up,
because you don't brake

547
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,950
or let go of the throttle
for the next three miles.

548
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,327
But it's a man's corner,
get it wrong and you're...

549
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,374
Ballascary.

550
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,127
Ballagarey. Did you see the sign there?

551
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,879
But, yeah, get it wrong
and it's gonna hurt.

552
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,540
But you don't think
about things like that, do you?

553
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,716
If you wanna fast lap out, you've got to

554
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,794
throw your balls to the wall,
as it's said.

555
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,509
(Chattering on radio)

556
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,523
(Reporter) After a bright start today,
it will turn cloudy later this morning,

557
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,688
then, although staying mostly dry
this afternoon,

558
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,981
there could be
patchy light drizzle possible...

559
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,752
All right, boss? Good man.

560
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,057
(Mayhew) I think Guy Martin's
real rivals this year

561
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,184
will be manyfold.

562
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,725
Cameron Donald has always been a threat.

563
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,811
(Keith Amor) He's a bit highly-strung.
But he's fast. Really fast.

564
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,192
(Mayhew) Conor Cummins
is gonna be a big threat.

565
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,480
(McGuinness) Conor Cummins,
Local Manxman. He's fit. He's young.

566
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,111
(Mayhew) Ryan Farquhar
has gone ahead of Joey Dunlop

567
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,160
in national wins in Ireland
and he's phenomenal.

568
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,786
(McGuinness) The Dunlops
are coming strong,

569
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,165
Michael's really aggressive,
and got that will to win.

570
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,326
Definitely wouldn't want to
get in a ring with him, anyway.

571
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,295
Keith Amor again, he's like
a dog on a lead, you know?

572
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,465
He's just chomping at that bit
to go fast and win.

573
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,633
(Amor) You never know
what Bruce you're gonna get.

574
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,303
If Bruce wakes up in the morning
and decides he wants to beat us all,

575
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,379
he'll probably go beat us all.

576
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,260
(Conor Cummins) You never
bet against John McGuinness

577
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,424
he's the man at the minute.

578
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,350
(Cameron Donald) He's the man
with the results on the board.

579
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,599
He's the man that when you go quickly,
he usually raises the bar

580
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,139
and goes a bit quicker again.

581
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,974
(Amor) Nobody knows
how fast John can go.

582
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,276
Nobody has actually
taken John to that next level.

583
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:53,818
(Cummins) You never
underestimate anyone.

584
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,604
Someone could come out from the woodwork

585
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,115
that you just didn't really expect
and shock you.

586
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,863
(Mayhew) I don't know much
about Hutchinson, to be truthful.

587
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,778
He's one of the quiet men in the sport.

588
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,621
Just does the job, I think.

589
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,533
(McGuinness) He reminds me a bit
of myself you know, 10 years ago.

590
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,833
He's absorbing everything,

591
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,120
understanding what it takes
to win at a big race now.

592
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,418
Guy, you know, I think every man
and his dog in the world

593
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,340
wants flipping Guy Martin to win.

594
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,838
Pit stops count
toward the overall lap time

595
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,677
but there's some ingredient missing
at the moment,

596
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,385
and it just seems to find him.

597
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,140
to see if we can borrow
the swinging arm back out of his bike,

598
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,968
At the end of the day.

599
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,182
And nobody wants to win it
more than I do.

600
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,683
(Leto) As speeds increase,
so do the dangers

601
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:37,275
and it was this that lost the TT
its world championship status.

602
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,490
But winning at the TT
requires more than just speed.

603
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,658
It relies on mechanical perfection,

604
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,820
supreme mental and physical endurance,

605
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:49,033
a huge dose of good fortune
and a very fast pit stop.

606
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,087
A tank of fuel and a set of tyres
will only last two

607
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,418
of the four or six laps required.

608
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,333
Pit stops count
toward the overall lap time

609
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,845
And then we'll go up tomorrow morning
and put it back in the bike.

610
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,009
- Thirty-three.
- Bloody hell! Well done, lad.

611
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,478
But if we have one mistake,
it goes to 40.

612
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,399
I could do with your help.

613
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,726
to do a fast pit stop.

614
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,898
It just happens the bike I had
last year was sold to a bloke

615
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,860
on the Isle of Man, and I've begged
and pleaded with him

616
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,899
to see if we can borrow
the swinging arm back out of his bike,

617
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,068
to put back in my new bike
for this year

618
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,371
So he said,
"Pop up and nick it this afternoon."

619
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,707
And then we'll go up tomorrow morning
and put it back in the bike.

620
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,460
I could do with your help.

621
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,217
(Leto) Guy's father has decided
not to come to the race this year

622
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,721
(Martin) It's a bit of a hard pill
to take, really, me dad not coming.

623
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,427
You know, he's a good man
to have involved

624
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,891
he's rode the TT for 15 years and
he knows exactly how things need to be.

625
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,887
he's rode the TT for 15 years and
he knows exactly how things need to be.

626
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,096
That'd give me confidence,
if he was involved.

627
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,728
And now he's not here.
It's not fucked the job,

628
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,559
but it's made it a lot harder.

629
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,439
And it took my eye off the ball
a little bit, but what do I do?

630
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,653
Can't sit and cry about it, can you?

631
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,407
Martin Finnegan, really good friend
of mine in racing, in racing.

632
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,083
I was at his wedding.

633
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:18,627
In, I think it would have
been November time of 2007.

634
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,751
Yeah, in 2007.
And then his funeral was in

635
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,588
April time of 2008.

636
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,756
You know...

637
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,135
Teammate of mine,
Darran Lindsay, was killed in 2005.

638
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,597
Friend of mine, used to do his engines,

639
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,978
Richard Britten, he was killed 2006.
You could go on.

640
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,524
I just think, you know...

641
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,523
When you're time's up...

642
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,827
I think you've got to be
in this line of work, you know?

643
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,238
And that's why
I sort of don't believe in

644
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,156
having any commitments of any sort.

645
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:57,912
Because if I did have responsibilities
as wife, kids, mortgage

646
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,959
and all that sort of caper,
I couldn't do this job,

647
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,132
as in racing the TT,
I couldn't give it me all.

648
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,042
And I wanna give it me all.

649
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,299
Yeah. Before I can start
thinking about winning races,

650
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,592
we've got a lot of practice
to get through.

651
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,466
You know, we've five nights
of practice to get through.

652
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,348
That's not going to be easy. There's
a lot of work to do on the bikes.

653
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,554
And that's where me dad
was gonna come in.

654
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,481
It's not just gonna go straight on the
bike, a lot of things will need making,

655
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,191
to get that swinging
arm to suit the new bike.

656
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,022
But, if it was easy, every man and his
dog would be at it, wouldn't they?

657
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,319
I'll chill out later on.

658
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,079
I find a different place
every night to kip in me van.

659
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,240
Just get me airbed blown up
in the back of me van.

660
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,244
Bit of a wank, then go to sleep.
You know? Proper!

661
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:43,166
Proper. You know, people get all...
It's not a crime, is it, to have a wank,

662
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,165
you know. Fuck it.

663
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,892
(McGuinness) You never get complacent
with the TT.

664
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,439
There's always something you can learn,

665
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,942
and, you know, if you get that way
and overconfident, itll bite you.

666
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,906
I just went up and had
a little moment on my own,

667
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,200
looking down the road
because the road was shut.

668
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,246
There wasn't a sound apart from
the birds just tweeting away.

669
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,370
And that's just something real special
about the track itself you know,

670
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,040
I was just looking down
thinking next week, in the race,

671
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,880
I'm gonna be going down there
at 200 mile an hour plus.

672
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,260
(Donald) That emotion you feel
when you roll up onto that start line,

673
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,133
when you're getting waved off
10 seconds apart, it's just...

674
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,264
It's just unbelievable.

675
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,183
It's like nothing else
I've ever experienced.

676
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,474
(Amor) It's not about
beating the next guy.

677
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,059
It's about who beats the track.

678
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:50,073
(Cummins) This TT is the most powerful
race you'll ever do in your life.

679
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,618
I love it, and it's legal.

680
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,742
(Donald) People often ask,
Why do you road race?"

681
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,910
Because circuit racing is fast, you
can get a buzz, but it's not the same.

682
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,244
Circuit racing
is rock climbing with a rope.

683
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,413
It's dangerous.
But there is some room for error.

684
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,919
You slip, you fall, you've got a rope.

685
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,209
Road racing is like free climbing.

686
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,629
You know, you're climbing up that same
mountain, you're on a course,

687
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,509
but there's no room for error.

688
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,759
If you make a mistake it's,
it's going to be, you know...

689
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,637
Well, it could be
serious injury or worse.

690
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,432
(Dunlop) You're doing maybe 170,
180 mile an hour;

691
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,230
going through fast bends
with trees, hedges, brick walls..

692
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,727
It's the greatest thing.

693
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,983
(Carl Roberts) And you realise

694
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,606
the dangers before you put
your leg over the bike.

695
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,775
I mean, at the top
of Bray Hill before I go out,

696
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,783
you know, you have lots
of strange thoughts in your mind

697
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,119
and you're nervous and you're worried,
but as soon as you set off;

698
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,124
and you get the tap off
the start marshal

699
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,211
to go down Bray Hill, that's gone.

700
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,589
Then once you're actually
out here the noise, the wind,

701
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,170
the physical strain on your body,

702
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,970
there's nothing like it. It's just,
you put yourself through hell

703
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:58,134
and you frighten yourself so many times,
but that is the draw.

704
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,059
(Mark Miller) Out there
you can't fake it, you know.

705
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,812
There's nothing you can do
that isn't putting you in the moment.

706
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,769
This is it. You know...

707
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,314
Especially if you ride two wheels.
This is about as difficult as it gets.

708
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,910
(Stephen Davison) You know,
people talk about extreme sports.

709
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,114
There's nothing more extreme
than road racing.

710
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,032
One split second.

711
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,786
I mean, somebody like Joey Dunlop,
31 years of career,

712
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,167
26 TT wins. All those other race wins,

713
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,210
all those World Championships...

714
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,174
One split second.

715
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,716
(Eve of Destruction playing)

716
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,633
- (Commentator 1) Oh, dearie me.
- (Commentator 2) Oh, down he goes.

717
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,470
 Can't you feel the fears
I'm feeling today?

718
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,722
(Commentator 3) Oh, that throws...

719
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,595
 There's no running away

720
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,899
 There'll be no one to save
With the world in a grave

721
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:52,195
 Take a look around you, boy
It's bound to scare you, boy 

722
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,107
(Leto) There is no room
for error on the TT course.

723
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,198
Of all road-racing circuits, it is
the toughest and most unforgiving.

724
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,362
With an average five deaths
for every mile,

725
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,533
only a lucky few have crashed
and escaped unharmed.

726
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,874
Milky Quayle is one of the lucky ones.

727
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,046
(Milky Quayle)
Your life revolves around the TT

728
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,344
because its such
an immense, passionate thing

729
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,886
whether you're on the track or off
the track. It is a life and death thing.

730
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,520
I know it sounds crazy and stuff
I mean,

731
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,853
I've... I haven't raced around here
now for eight or nine years

732
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,901
and I still now
struggle with life because

733
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,946
I can't do it, you know,
I can't get me buzz.

734
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,531
It's like you've done the ultimate

735
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,242
and once you can't have that ultimate,

736
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,495
then you're a bit like
a drug addict, sort of thing.

737
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,789
You just can't, you can't
get it out of your system.

738
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,165
You love it.

739
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,167
When I'm sat beside the track,

740
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,497
you just want to do it and you think,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and then...

741
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,128
So, obviously if you keep yourself busy

742
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,009
and whether it's blooming sweeping
the floors or emptying the bins

743
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,547
or taking other riders round,
or meeting dignitaries

744
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,559
and taking press round,
it keeps my mind off it, really.

745
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,971
(Leto) Milky looks after the newcomers

746
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,598
and shows them around the course.

747
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,892
It can take three years
of competing to learn it

748
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,110
and at least that long
to build up the confidence

749
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,312
needed to be able to push themselves
to the limits.

750
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,319
(Jenny Tinmouth)
It's all about confidence.

751
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,113
You need to be confident
where the corners go

752
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,994
and how fast
you can go round that corner

753
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,951
to build up your speed,
so I'm still experimenting

754
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,663
on how fast I can go, a little bit more,
a little bit more, little bit more.

755
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,793
How to build up
and get used to the corners

756
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,704
and the bumps and the rises
and the tipping points

757
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,415
and the grids and everything, and
hopefully I'll keep going a bit fasten

758
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,509
Get over, get over!

759
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,758
In by the hedge,
transfer back over the bike again.

760
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,757
Into here, and guess what,

761
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,137
there's another one here.

762
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,728
That takes you three years to get right.

763
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,389
(Leto) After only two years
of competing,

764
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,651
Jenny Tinmouth is the fastest
woman ever around the course.

765
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,820
(Tinmouth) You definitely feel
like you shouldn't be doing it.

766
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,609
It's quite bizarre. You feel...

767
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,236
You do feel cheeky, and a bit naughty.

768
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,742
To be blasting around the roads,

769
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,865
but again,
I think that's half the fun...

770
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,656
Like when you set off down Bray Hill,
it's just massive big grin.

771
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,786
It's like... (Exclaims)

772
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,492
(Imitating engine revving)

773
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,793
As I'm coming up here,
all I'm thinking about

774
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,591
is the next corner that's coming up,
which is called Ballagarey.

775
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,631
It's affectionately known
as Ballascary because it is.

776
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,676
It's so, so scary. It's so fast.

777
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,930
It's the most important,

778
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,179
but also the most dangerous
corner on the circuit.

779
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,681
The big problem with Ballagarey is
it's unsighted on your entry point

780
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,264
so as I'm coming up to here
now I'm still hard on the gas,

781
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,727
still on the gas, still on the gas,

782
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,058
at the 30 mile an hour sign here now,

783
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,402
this is where I come off the gas.
I come down one gear effectively,

784
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,694
I get my head out of the bubble,

785
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,272
and my head's getting
ripped off my shoulders,

786
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,907
but at that point also I'm trying
to look for my peel in point

787
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,071
but I still can't see it.

788
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,410
I know it goes to the right
but where do I turn in?

789
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,195
As soon as I see the kerb on the inside,

790
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,989
I lay the bike on its side and drive it.

791
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,707
OK, and just fire through,
right by the kerb-

792
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,368
So, so fast.

793
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:57,038
(Leto) Averaging 131. 57 miles per hour;

794
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,425
John McGuinness is still
the fastest man around the course.

795
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,713
A hundred years ago, the first race
was won at just 38 miles per hour.

796
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,845
Throughout its history
even riders with no hope of winning

797
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,801
have come to break personal bests

798
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,262
and challenge
the island's famous course.

799
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,433
Riders are always chasing
faster and faster lap times.

800
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,106
(Commentator) ...in first place.
This is Nick Crowe. He's still second.

801
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,442
(Nick Crowe) I just think it's got
a certain addiction about it.

802
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,364
Once you get here,
you couldn't let it go then.

803
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,369
You're looking for the ultimate
lap times all the time.

804
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,411
I always set out to beat myself
more than anybody else.

805
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,748
Every year, I just thought I'd do it
faster and faster and faster,

806
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,958
which I was actually doing

807
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,498
unfortunately until to
the time of me accident,

808
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:40,256
which was really no fault of me own,
just one of those freak things.

809
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,632
(Leto) In 2009, while leading the race

810
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,474
a hare ran onto the track,
causing Nick to crash his sidecar

811
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,055
at 160 miles per houri

812
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,481
(Crowe) I think it just came up and
damaged the front part of the fairing.

813
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,727
And then it came and hit me
in the face and that was it then,

814
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,980
obviously the bike turned
immediately right then, that was it,

815
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,568
straight into the trees.

816
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,367
Yeah, we were lucky
to get away with that one.

817
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,578
(Mayhew) If we have
an injury or a fatality,

818
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,335
I tend to sort of want to stop

819
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,962
because, yeah, I do, I feel
like a drug dealer sometimes

820
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,873
because I'm preparing
these engines for these people

821
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,583
to go and hurt theirselves with

822
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,344
and even though it's, you know,
touch wood, not my fault, you know,

823
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,427
people who deal in drugs are worse
than the people who take them.

824
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,309
And last year.
we had such a terrible time.

825
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,642
I did say that I wouldn't carry on
with the sidecars.

826
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,727
And then the way Nick bounced back
was just...

827
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,437
I couldnt't say no to him at all,

828
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,400
so we've got three engines all ready
for him, and we're doing two more.

829
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,572
His spirit is unbelievable.

830
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,901
(Leto) Nick himself won't be riding.

831
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,237
Instead, his own race team will attempt

832
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,405
to break the sidecar lap record,

833
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,954
which has stood unbroken
since his accident.

834
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,170
(Chattering)

835
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,507
(Cameraman) Do you have to find Guy?

836
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,384
Yeah. He's...

837
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,760
He's got a little problem
with his license.

838
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,341
Have you got a problem
with your license, Gary?

839
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,764
Yeah, I've just had
to have it re-scanned.

840
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,767
(Leto) Typically, Guy is
nowhere to be found

841
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,150
and he won't be eligible to practise
without his race license.

842
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,190
Until he returns, the bike can't
go through scrutineering.

843
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,026
We don't know where he is, as usual.

844
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,190
He'll be here in a bit, hopefully.

845
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,284
(Man on PA) We've just had
a message from race control.

846
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,739
Would Guy Martin please report
to the race office immediately, please.

847
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,406
Guy Martin...

848
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,741
Where do you start?

849
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,544
(Davison) He is a maverick.

850
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,001
He's an eccentric. He's always
got something good to say,

851
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,425
although a lot of the time
it comes out not broadcastable.

852
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,717
(Mayhew) He's a bit old school.

853
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,675
He's a bit what we grew up with,
what we used to be.

854
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,973
(Mick Grant) Guy is
a fabulous personality.

855
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,513
(Amor) I don't think Guy really knows
exactly what he wants to do.

856
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,303
He's got a lot of
different loves in his life.

857
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,267
(Grant) I'd like to see
him win around here,

858
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,523
but if he's not careful,
he'll run out of time.

859
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,275
(McGuinness) Guy is
a colourful character

860
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,023
But he's an attention seeker isn't he?

861
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,446
He loves a bit of attention, he's had
green shorts on for two years.

862
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,572
I mean, they must be stinking
and growing legs by now,

863
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,028
but that's what racing is all about.

864
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,281
We need characters in there, you know.
Guy is what he is.

865
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,445
I mean, he talks pure rubbish,
but he's funny.

866
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,243
(Roberts) Guy says it as it is,

867
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,199
and I think that's
why he's so popular with people.

868
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:25,213
He's not worried about
upsetting the hierarchy.

869
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,421
Guy Martin is Guy Martin

870
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,754
and nobody would want him any other way.

871
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,220
I mean he is a true grit, he's
a John Wayne of motorcycle racing.

872
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,433
(Leto) At last, Guy returns

873
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,226
after blowing up a friend's classic bike
in the south of the Island.

874
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,520
- There you are, it's sorted now.
- That's all it is.

875
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,231
Spot on! Ta very much. Cheers, boss.

876
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,819
(Man on PA) The roads
will be closing in half an hour

877
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,198
and tonight's practice will start
at 7:30 prompt.

878
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,246
(Leto) Guy's race license approved,

879
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,370
the team can finally make it through
scrutineering with the bikes.

880
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,922
(Indistinct)

881
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,254
Right, cheers.

882
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,296
(Man on PA) And the time is now 7:25,

883
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,176
the roads will be closing
and tonight's practice

884
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,675
will begin in five minutes' time.

885
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,177
Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes.

886
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,020
(Engine revving)

887
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,488
(Commentator) Number eight, Guy Martin,
and number 19, James Hillier

888
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,824
leave the line,
both on superbikes as well.

889
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,340
(Indistinct)

890
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,507
(Blow playing)

891
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,003
 I like the little things you do

892
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,388
 I like the way your body moves

893
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,932
 I like the way you make me go

894
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,596
 Oh, so crazy 

895
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,272
The mechanics said last year
coming into the first pit stop

896
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,439
and me eyes were on stalks,

897
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,517
you couldn't see
the whites of me eyes all the time.

898
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,938
You come to the TT and your body's
unfamiliar with it to start with.

899
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,529
(McGuinness) Stuff's just going past
so fast.

900
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,653
From a standing start lap, 125 mile
an hour; you know, first lap.

901
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,914
And it's like, I must be mad. 

902
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,625
It is spectacular and when
you've just, you know plodding along

903
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,786
on your road bike thinking
you are a legend riding fast.

904
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,922
It's like a totally different thing

905
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,666
when you see
the race bikes come through.

906
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,260
(Donald) You might have driven
to the pits that morning

907
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,339
so your top speed for the day so far
is maybe 40 miles an hour

908
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,800
You let the clutch out
and within a couple of miles

909
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,310
you're pushing 200 miles
an hour between you know,

910
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,807
stone walls and hedges.

911
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,938
So it takes a bit
to get your head up to speed.

912
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,601
(McGuinness) Then you settle down
and start relaxing

913
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,769
and getting more
and more comfortable with the circuit.

914
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,488
You start going faster;

915
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,065
start going smoothly,
start breathing properly.

916
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,571
(Gary Johnson) You do go into, like,
this weird sort of state of mind

917
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,361
where everything start slowing down.

918
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,618
You start moving,
your eyeline starts lifting so much

919
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,784
and your brain starts working
so much ahead of yourself

920
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,874
(Cummins) You're thinking, like,
maybe four or five corners ahead.

921
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,295
It's all about momentum,

922
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,793
and keeping your rhythm up

923
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,130
and not getting into any stupid battles
with people.

924
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,927
You've got to be really using your head.

925
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:24,259
(Dunlop) I'm a real hard rider
to ride with, if you want to race off me

926
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,310
you're going to have to be
willing to wrap around a post.

927
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,722
You know what I mean? And that's
the way I race motorbikes.

928
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,562
And that's the way I push,
and I'll push any man to the bitter end.

929
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,986
If they wanna play ball,
they can play with me, you know.

930
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,373
When you listen to the bikes coming
in sixth gear... (imitates engine)

931
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,793
And they never close the throttle,
this is also for me, I mean...

932
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,844
You know, I've ridden bikes
for many years...

933
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,638
Wow! Wow! Really wow.

934
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,052
(Mayhew) Even after all these years
to talk to somebody about

935
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,058
the Isle of Man TT course,

936
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,316
the hair stands up on the back
of your neck and you remember,

937
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,648
and I'll never ever forget
my first flying lap of the TT

938
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,697
going over St Ninian's crossroads
down Bray Hill.

939
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,774
And I thought I'd come off
the end of the world, really.

940
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,534
I thought I'd ridden
off the end of a cliff

941
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,986
You just feel you can fly really,

942
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,372
and most of the times you do.

943
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,699
(Getaway playing)

944
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,575
 Everybody wants to know

945
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,927
 We are nearly there

946
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:53,306
 Do you get to see the love

947
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,022
 Can you understand my thoughts

948
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,730
 Seeing as no one else here can

949
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,025
 When you see the light

950
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,987
 Does your pain just disappear

951
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,166
 Will I ever feel your love

952
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,211
 Once again, my dear

953
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:18,756
 Your love is Ending a better way

954
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,301
 Everybody wants you to know

955
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:26,173
 Your love is Ending a better way

956
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,597
 Somebody, everybody wants to... 

957
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,019
(Alex Verner) Where's Guy, Johnny?

958
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,473
- Where's Guy?
- Just walking up to you.

959
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,393
(Leto) Guy's bike has been impounded
because on his return,

960
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,733
he has illegally
ridden it through the town.

961
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,731
(Martin) So I've got to go up
and get a bollocking? For what?

962
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,779
For riding through the holding area,
or riding through the town?

963
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,280
(Johnny) Riding through the town, Chief

964
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,278
See, you're supposed to read that bit
before you go out.

965
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,451
But I didn't see you
because you was late for the grid.

966
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,700
That's telling you
not to do what you did.

967
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,255
- (Craig) Don't do it again.
- Really, really Mr Craig,

968
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,588
this is where you come in.
Team boss and all that.

969
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,799
- I'm gonna blame you, Wilson.
- Yeah, blame me.

970
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,096
I'm blaming you, yeah.

971
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,426
Oh, fucking mega! Where's Rob?

972
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,178
- It would be perfect.
- No problem.

973
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:15,767
More badges?

974
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,223
Yeah, every year.

975
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,446
(Leto) Guy will get his bike back
once he apologises.

976
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,989
Who do I go see for a bollocking?

977
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,909
Can I take me bike?

978
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,413
Can I take me bike?

979
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,787
- (Man) You want some chips?
- I wouldn't mind, mate.

980
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,960
I know you're on a diet.

981
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,999
- Help yourself.
- Thanks very much.

982
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,337
Go on, get in there.

983
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,004
You're a good lad, you.

984
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,125
Thanks, lads.

985
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,464
(Man) You're all right, Mr Craig.

986
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,848
All right, boss, job done.

987
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,643
That's fucking mustard, though, boys.

988
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,728
Has that got
the same sprocket carrier in?

989
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,859
(Danny Horne) Yes.

990
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,027
 If there's one thing that I like

991
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,152
 It's riding around on a motorbike

992
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,028
 I'm a speed king

993
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,288
 When I once begin

994
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,995
 I once won first prize two and six

995
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,959
 I know all the dirt track dirty tricks

996
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:27,127
 I'm a marvel
when I'm out to win

997
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,132
 In a 50-mile race
I am the best

998
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,933
 I ride five miles
and skid the rest

999
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:40,056
 So come along and see me
riding in the TT races

1000
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,353
 Down the hill I go
at break-neck speed

1001
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,906
 See me coming down the street

1002
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,909
 With the winning post
on the pillion seat

1003
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:58,495
 Oh! Come along and see me
Riding in the TT race 

1004
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,326
Absolutely, two weeks of my life.

1005
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,957
It's just something that...

1006
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,174
That, to me, is like the World Cup.

1007
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,392
It's just 50 years of my life
is 100 weeks,

1008
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,139
it's just unbelievable.

1009
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,650
The atmosphere. The friends I've made,
from all around the world,

1010
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,604
you see every year.
You lose some, gain some.

1011
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,113
It's just something special.

1012
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,403
One second!

1013
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,825
(Announcer speaking)

1014
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,039
(Audience cheering)

1015
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,210
(Hayley Sayle) People say to me,
oh, you've got children, you know,

1016
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,041
you shouldn't be allowing him to do it.

1017
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,251
But, you took racing away from Dan

1018
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,463
and it would just be
the end of Dan's world,

1019
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,762
and I can't do that to him, you know.

1020
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,466
He's my husband, I love him,

1021
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,887
so I have to support him.

1022
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,635
(Motorcycles whizzing)

1023
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,932
(Becky) You're up on the Grandstand,

1024
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,771
sitting together you know,
the rest of the families

1025
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,065
and the rest of the wives.
You know, we're all nervous,

1026
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,441
but you kind of have to,

1027
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,315
sort of have a little joke and a laugh.

1028
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,654
And it's amazing the strength
that comes from within, really

1029
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,278
with all of... Everybody together,
you know, you sort of club together

1030
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,992
and get yourselves through it really.

1031
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,538
(Davison) The road racers great defence
is always the same thing,

1032
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,581
every single one of them,
it's the same thing,

1033
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,874
But it will never happen to me. "

1034
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,001
But somewhere in there
they know very well

1035
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,205
that it can happen to them.

1036
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,833
And between those two places

1037
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,760
there's a lot of ways
of dealing with it.

1038
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,134
(McGuinness) I've worn the same
crash helmet for the last 11 years.

1039
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,841
And I always wear
a certain pair of socks

1040
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,767
throughout the whole fortnight

1041
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,645
and I always drop a penny
down my leathers, as well,

1042
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,314
before the start of every race, yeah.

1043
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,019
It makes no difference whatsoever,

1044
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,727
but I'll wear pink knickers
if it's gonna make me win. (Laughs)

1045
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,649
Where's your pass?

1046
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,901
I ain't got either one of that.

1047
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,022
You need a pass.

1048
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:55,858
I ain't got om.

1049
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,150
You can't go past without a pass.

1050
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,739
- No?
- No, that's the rules.

1051
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,533
It's the pit area, you see.

1052
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,539
In the pit area, you can't.

1053
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,533
That's what you need.

1054
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,338
I'll stick it back over the fence
for you. Cheers, mate.

1055
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,540
Cheers, mate.

1056
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,344
(Fan) There's no question that the
Isle of Man TT represents

1057
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,634
kind of the last bastion
of the freedom of choice

1058
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,678
and to come to a place like this

1059
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,514
and to have something
so truly, you know,

1060
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,856
potentially dangerous

1061
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,354
be welcomed, really, is refreshing.

1062
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,899
It's charming. It's all of the things
that should be allowed

1063
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,572
to go on other places.
I mean, we're human beings.

1064
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,066
Life isn't a dress rehearsal.

1065
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,277
You only get one lap,
why not make it a good one?

1066
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,199
(Milky) This is where I start
the mountain climb.

1067
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,331
So, this one I have to slow down for;
back down to second gear.

1068
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,993
I get into that wall, into there,

1069
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,170
as I come through here,
the bump just there, bang.

1070
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,086
So we run now up through
this little right hand kink here,

1071
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,249
Still flat, Still flat,

1072
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,552
on the power, on the power on the power,
on the power, on the power,

1073
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,133
underneath the wall,
off the power, down one gear,

1074
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,599
back on the power, now to drive,
on the drive, drive, drive, drive,

1075
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,052
back down to second gear.

1076
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,722
Back on the power now,
pull the bike straight,

1077
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,436
get up, get up, get the driving on,

1078
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,560
up towards
these little left-hand kinks here.

1079
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,069
So this first one here.
Just get back underneath there,

1080
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,566
out towards the tree on the right hand
side of the road, right to here, OK?

1081
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,909
As we run up to that
to go on to Guthrie's, OK?

1082
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,579
Guthrie's is the third most important
corner on the circuit.

1083
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,366
Got three left hand bends here, OK.

1084
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,035
It's very steep. This is the one,
get the first one right,

1085
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,831
get into that one, into there,

1086
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,754
out to the white line,
back into number two,

1087
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,623
out to number three, just there.

1088
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,927
See the corner, on the brakes hard,
down three gears, one, two, three.

1089
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,422
Back into there,
back on the power; drive it through.

1090
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,299
Right out to the white line,
back over towards

1091
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,384
the external white line,

1092
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,477
back in then,
just underneath this one just here,

1093
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,397
feathering the throttle, there we go.
Lovely. Nice wheelie.

1094
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,104
Bang.

1095
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:00,483
(Leto) Over the next seven days, there
will be many scrapes and near misses,

1096
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,864
seven cracked vertebrae,
four broken ribs,

1097
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,700
five life-threatening incidents,
two bruised lungs

1098
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,699
and unfortunately, much worse.

1099
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,664
Where's Camee?

1100
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,036
He's in there?

1101
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,288
What's the plan?

1102
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,208
- What?
- (Man) Tea.

1103
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,960
Tea. Yeah, get his tea.

1104
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,503
And get an early start in the morning.

1105
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,340
- That the plan, Wilson?
- Sorry?

1106
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,467
What's the plan? These boys
are asking what the plan is.

1107
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,516
The plan is you're riding the bike.

1108
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,560
(People laughing)

1109
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,141
Ah, well, there you go.
That's it sorted. Job done.

1110
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,236
(Announcer) Well, obviously a fair bit
of mist up here,

1111
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:41,191
Douglas, at the moment around the area
here. It is clear up on the top...

1112
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,447
(Charlie Lambert) Starting off
with the TT superbike race.

1113
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,040
Six laps of the course,

1114
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,581
226. 38 miles.

1115
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:56,501
A reminder; this is a time trial,
they go at 10 second intervals,

1116
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,337
so they're racing the clock
just as much as each other

1117
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,627
Most important, of course,
they race themselves.

1118
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,089
They race tradition, they race
the history of the mountain course.

1119
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,550
We're one minute away
from the start of racing

1120
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,766
- at this year's TT.
- (Engines revving)

1121
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,516
(Wilson) The laws of averages
tell me he's going to win.

1122
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,641
I would like him to win the first race

1123
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,518
because I believe that will settle him.

1124
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,103
If he wins the first race,
he'll win three or four.

1125
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,195
I really believe in him.

1126
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:26,035
(Lambert) And it is a Suzuki that
sets us going, there goes Bruce Anstey.

1127
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,741
With mist still rolling
along Glencrutcherry Road,

1128
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,037
but we are racing.

1129
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,041
And there is the number
one machine of Bruce Anstey.

1130
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,494
And he's very compact
there through Union Mills.

1131
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,205
And there is John McGuinness,

1132
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,627
the fastest man in the history
of the mountain course.

1133
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,176
And here's Hutchy with two wins
last year; but not on a superbike.

1134
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,796
Next off is number eight,
28 years of age,

1135
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,926
here comes Guy now.

1136
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,549
He's fast down Bray Hill.

1137
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,932
(Dave Christian) Good turn speed.

1138
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,394
And here we go. We're on. Two together

1139
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,478
John McGuinness leads on the road
ahead of Bruce Anstey.

1140
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,902
(Roy Moore) Number six,
Cameron Donald, is closing the gap

1141
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,237
between him and Keith Amor.

1142
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,734
They've got a battle on there,

1143
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,945
the advantage being held
by Cameron Donald

1144
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,444
but here is Guy Martin now
and he's quick!

1145
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,660
(Christian) John McGuinness
has had an amazing start to this race

1146
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,409
but Conor Cummins,
the local lad, is right behind him

1147
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,253
only eight-hundredths of a second down
in second place.

1148
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,752
(Lambert) Back here in the Grandstand,
I can tell you from my screen

1149
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,336
that Conor Cummins has taken the lead
at Ballaugh on corrected time

1150
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,012
a three second
lead over John McGuinness.

1151
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,556
But John clearly has problems because

1152
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,012
at the Sulby speed trap

1153
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:35,267
he's gone through
at only 136.4 miles an hour

1154
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,770
So, clearly problems with
John McGuinness and the big Honda.

1155
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,980
But up to Ramsey and Roy Moore.

1156
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,978
(Moore) Well, they said it was
going to be close and it is,

1157
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,231
cos Guy Martin's here...
Oh, my goodness!

1158
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,491
Guy Martin was nearly taken out there

1159
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,284
by Michael Dunlop, and it was close.

1160
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,528
(Christian) Conor Cummins, number 10,

1161
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,738
leads by six seconds
before Ian Hutchinson.

1162
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,994
It's then in third place Guy Martin,

1163
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,666
just one second down on Hutchinson.

1164
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,586
(Lambert) John McGuinness
is a retirement on Sulby Straight.

1165
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,878
What a disappointment,

1166
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,457
the king of the mountain
is out on the first lap

1167
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,875
but on with the show.

1168
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,878
Number four who is leading on the road.

1169
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,969
(Moore) I can tell you that number 10
has increased his lead to 14 seconds

1170
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,307
over number four; Ian Hutchinson.

1171
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,726
(Christian) We could see a Manxman
on the top of the podium

1172
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,394
for the first time for several years.

1173
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,811
Cummins has got that fantastic
lead now 21 seconds.

1174
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,567
If he can just hang it together
there will certainly be some Guinness

1175
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,485
drunk in the Swan in Ramsey tonight.

1176
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:29,821
(Lambert) And Ian Hutchinson's
lap time, 130.496,

1177
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,868
So here's Conor now,
let's have a look at this.

1178
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,706
Oh, it's 131.511 by Conor Cummins.

1179
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,122
And, wow, what a performance
by the man from Ramsey.

1180
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,040
Well, the light came on at Cronk-ny-Mona

1181
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,463
to signal the arrival
of number six, Cameron Donald,

1182
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,219
but he's failed to appear

1183
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:52,055
Now we reckon that Cameron may have
made a mistake on that lap,

1184
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:53,845
possibly an overshoot at Signpost

1185
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,469
That seems one logical explanation
for that.

1186
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,728
(Chris Kinley) We've just got
another machine coming in now,

1187
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,097
and that'd be Guy Martin is in now,

1188
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,023
Guy's just coming in to
the top of the pit lane now

1189
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,101
and it's Conor's that's on the way
as he's just being told there.

1190
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,686
Bring it home, Conor; bring it home.

1191
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,363
He knows he's got
a 21.1 lead at Glen Helen.

1192
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,490
On this lap, 23. 3.

1193
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,030
Well, there's the klaxon going,
Hutchy leaves now.

1194
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,575
And Cameron, he'll be kicking himself
for that mistake,

1195
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,040
he's now dropped to 13th.
Oh, Conor stalls! Conor stalls!

1196
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,914
Is he gonna get it going here now,
it just won't fire up.

1197
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,587
Quite a bit of time. Come on, come on,

1198
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,876
come on, come on, oh, no, no, no.

1199
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,089
It's fired, it's fired!

1200
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,419
Oh, Conor; a big shake of the head
from the big man from Ramsey there.

1201
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,881
Guy Martin goes as well, and Guy's fast
into the speed limiter there,

1202
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,640
and nails it. Charlie Lambert.

1203
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,259
(Lambert) So, a 21 second lead,

1204
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,557
and all of a sudden
it was down to four seconds.

1205
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,560
Seventeen seconds disappeared
during the course of that problem,

1206
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,850
of getting the big ZX-10 fired up again.

1207
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,069
So, ifs all to play for
then in the final two laps

1208
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:49,897
and there's some work
to be done by Cameron

1209
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,398
to eat into Conor's lead.

1210
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,280
So, Conor Cummins, Ian Hutchinson,

1211
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,784
Guy Martin and Michael Dunlop,
those are the top four

1212
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:02,535
The order is the same, but the gap
has most certainly changed.

1213
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,421
First of the late-numbered runners now
in pit lane.

1214
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,464
And here's number 26, Paul Dobbs,

1215
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,421
racing with the kiwi on his helmet

1216
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,922
and there's Jenny, away now.

1217
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,471
And we've just had
news that Conor's missing.

1218
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,260
(Christian) Conor Cummins
missing here at Glen Helen.

1219
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,134
Waved yellows out here as
a new machine comes into view now.

1220
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,303
No, it's not Conor; either.

1221
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,307
That's number eight, Guy Martin.

1222
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,058
Conor missing at Glen Helen.

1223
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,405
(Lambert) I can tell you
what's happened to Conor

1224
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:39,663
He's a retirement,
mechanical failure at Laurel Bank.

1225
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,494
A retirement at Laurel Bank.
A mechanical failure.

1226
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,334
Huge disappointment there for Conor.

1227
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,626
So it's Ian Hutchinson,
number four who's leading on the road.

1228
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,627
There's number eight, Guy Martin
into second place for now.

1229
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,178
(Moore) And there's one,
two, three into view now.

1230
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,844
Those three are going to have
a real old scrap over the mountain

1231
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,470
and that's going to be
well worth looking at.

1232
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,343
(Lambert) It's not only Conor
that has bad news.

1233
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,892
We've just heard that the
new timing system here in the pits

1234
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,140
has claimed
its first-high profile victim

1235
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:09,602
with Guy Martin picking up
a 30-second time penalty.

1236
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,358
That's moved him down from
what would have been second place

1237
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,698
down to fourth place. So, off the podium

1238
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,410
for Guy and Ian Hutchinson, the
30-year-old from Bingley in Yorkshire

1239
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,403
is the leader of the superbike TT

1240
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,664
with Michael Dunlop now in second place.

1241
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,163
I know it's Hutchy winning, but keep
an eye on number six, Cameron Donald,

1242
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,127
despite that excursion at Signpost

1243
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,043
finishing the race very strongly indeed

1244
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,666
and that final place on the podium
is not nailed just yet.

1245
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,632
You can see the chequered Hag
is now being prepared.

1246
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,383
Here comes
the wheelie of Ian Hutchinson,

1247
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,268
and Ian Hutchinson wins
on the Padgett's Honda.

1248
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,439
The final result sheet,
Hutchy one, Dunlop two, Donald three,

1249
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,438
and Guy Martin
finishing in fourth place.

1250
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,237
And it was a time penalty
that cost Guy so dearly.

1251
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,405
So, when I was in pit lane,
I heard him announce

1252
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,530
that Guy had gone through
the speed lane too fast

1253
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:03,197
and there was a time penalty
against him, now that's all I've heard.

1254
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,123
We just lost second place.

1255
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,869
(Wilson) When Guy was told he just
jumped off the bike, got into his van.

1256
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,211
He didn't even take his helmet off

1257
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,999
But I'm sure he'll
come back again, you know.

1258
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,426
It's a big disappointment to Guy.

1259
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:21,132
You know, he'd just done
224 miles at those speeds

1260
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,933
and then told we are
penalizing you for nothing.

1261
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,770
Such a tiny thing. Point one over 60.

1262
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,353
There shouldn't be a 30-second penalty.

1263
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:31,975
Five, possibly.

1264
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,893
That's harsh.

1265
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,731
(Mark Woodage) They're measuring
the average speed over a distance.

1266
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,110
Now who's to say that their distance
that they're measuring over

1267
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,531
is accurate to within a millimetre?

1268
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,495
We have books full of regulations,
by the way.

1269
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,542
And unfortunately,
I perhaps also ought to say,

1270
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,044
that in the matter of time-keeping

1271
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,998
the timekeeper, his word is law

1272
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:59,132
and he records what are then considered
to be matters of fact

1273
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,296
from which there is
no protest or appeals.

1274
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:05,342
OK.

1275
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,845
Yeah, well, that's it.
Monday's a new day, innit, and you know,

1276
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,304
Guy's got another two races on Monday

1277
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,773
so you know as long as Guy turns up
this evening, open-minded,

1278
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,691
and puts today's race behind him,

1279
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,815
you know, he's got another
superbike race as well on Friday.

1280
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,606
And, you know,
we'll just move on from it.

1281
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,458
(Lambert) Welcome to Monday's
action on the mountain course.

1282
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,713
Two races, 600cc machines
are off first at 10:45.

1283
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,796
(Christian) Guy Martin
has blitzed them from the start.

1284
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,847
(Lambert) At Ballaugh, Guy Martin
is still leading the race by

1285
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:51,726
just over a second from Ian Hutchinson,
with Dan Kneen in third place.

1286
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,316
(Moore) Guy Martin is here at
Ramsey hairpin, lap one,

1287
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,731
and he still leads
and he looks determined today.

1288
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,734
(Lambert) News from the top
of the mountain, from the Bungalow,

1289
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,191
is that Ian Hutchinson has
halved the gap on Guy Martin.

1290
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:05,277
And here's Ian Hutchinson who leads
at the end of the first lap.

1291
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,530
(Christian) Guy Martin obviously
likes that stretch of course

1292
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,158
between the Grandstand and here
because he's consistently quicker.

1293
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,201
But Hutchy seems to get it
on him on him everywhere else.

1294
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,209
(Moore) It's trouser-bulging excitement
here.

1295
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,540
(Lambert) Guy Martin
is leading the race.

1296
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,500
Now Ian Hutchinson
has gone back into the lead.

1297
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,085
(Christian) It's Guy Martin
back into the lead.

1298
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,920
There's Hutchy now, leading on the road.

1299
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,718
(Kinley) Oh, as quick as that.

1300
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,516
Charlie, what's the difference
as Guy comes in?

1301
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,720
(Lambert) 3.3 seconds so Hutchy
has been going away a little bit.

1302
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,184
(Kinley) Guy Martin's being told
there, "You can do this,"

1303
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,687
and I'm sure there's thousands
out there who would like him to do this.

1304
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:37,900
(Cameron Whitworth)
Get out the fucking way.

1305
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,028
(Kinley) Did Guy have problems there
on the way?

1306
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,020
We heard a lot of shouting.

1307
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,232
(Lambert) Guy goes through with
Keith Amor hot on his tail.

1308
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,858
(Christian) Michael Dunlop
slots into third.

1309
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,114
(Lambert) But, here's Ian Hutchinson
who's extended the lead.

1310
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,454
There's now over four seconds,
but stand by your beds

1311
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,703
because the news from Ballaugh is that
Guy Martin has halved the gap.

1312
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,576
Ian Hutchinson is coming
towards the end of the race

1313
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,671
but Guy Martin has now got it down
to less than three seconds at the Cronk

1314
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,376
and Guy Martin
is having the lap of his life!

1315
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,460
But is it going to be enough to give him
his first victory here at the TT.

1316
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,136
And Hutchy crosses the line
right now, but where is Guy?

1317
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,384
He started 40 seconds after Hutchy.

1318
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,677
We've started the stopwatch,

1319
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,592
and we're going to be
counting it all the way down

1320
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,765
from those 40 seconds. 37... 38...

1321
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:15,723
It's 39...
It is victory for Ian Hutchinson.

1322
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,901
By 3.03 seconds.
Guy Martin is in second place.

1323
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:26,109
Michael Dunlop is in third place,
with a final lap of 126. 587.

1324
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,156
The one, two, three is Hutchinson,
Martin and Michael Dunlop.

1325
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,529
And it's down to Chris Kinley.

1326
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,410
(Kinley) I don't know
where Guy got to, actually.

1327
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,620
(Tim Glove) I can tell you he went
straight up the return

1328
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,208
and that is as much as
we know at the moment.

1329
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:43,375
So Guy did not come
into the winners' enclosure.

1330
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,960
He went straight up the return,

1331
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,586
well have to find out
what's going on there.

1332
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,678
Charles, did you see him?

1333
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,257
The people who made the rules,
it's nothing to do with us.

1334
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,180
Paul's trying to do his job,
you know what I mean, it's not Paul,

1335
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,306
Paul doesn't make the rules.

1336
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,770
Now this is me being picky.

1337
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,268
(Woman) Guy, we're all
really proud of you, so just please...

1338
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,141
For Wilson. Please. Please. Please.

1339
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,614
Get yourself together, Guy.

1340
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,492
- Wouldn't you be peeved?
- Yeah, Guy, I'd be upset

1341
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,610
but I wouldn't take it out on the people

1342
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,990
who are supposed to be me mates.

1343
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,454
Point one-one-two...

1344
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:17,375
(Kinley) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guy! Guy!
Brakes, front brakes! Front brakes!

1345
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,456
Gonna hold his bum in a minute.

1346
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:22,046
Now then, boss, where'd you go?

1347
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,374
(Martin) 60.112.

1348
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,293
That's you boys being picky.
This is me being picky.

1349
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,669
I'll do what I want at my speed.

1350
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,804
(Kinley) So this is Saturday's race
you're on about, isn't it?

1351
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:30,964
(Martin) Yeah. Yeah...

1352
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,512
I'll let you get down the bottom there
we'll have a longer chat later on.

1353
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,639
OK, Guy? Thank you very much,
Guy's off there now.

1354
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,229
(Interviewer) So that was a bit of
a Guy Martin protest we saw there,

1355
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,312
you going straight in?

1356
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,653
If I walked
at 112 of a kilometre an hour

1357
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,816
do you know how far I'd go?

1358
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,698
Point .112 of a kilometre,
how far's that, the length of this here.

1359
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,745
Get a grip, man, get a grip.
30 seconds...

1360
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,866
(God Save the Queen playing)

1361
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,336
(Crowd applauding)

1362
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:10,837
(Lambert) There's the applause.

1363
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,932
And richly deserved, as well,
it's been a terrific morning's racing,

1364
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,560
and these guys will remember
this for one reason or another

1365
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,681
for a very long time.

1366
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,730
But Guy Martin is not hanging around
at the top of the podium,

1367
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,652
he's already making his way down.

1368
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,730
He's taking his bottle
of bubbly with him, though.

1369
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,949
Tell me a bit how you feel.

1370
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,029
They're being awkward with me,
I'll be awkward with them.

1371
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,748
They just do things... They want you,
"You can't do this, you can't do that."

1372
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,542
You know, "Press this, press that."
Fuck off.

1373
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,412
They've been awkward with me,
I'll be fucking awkward with them.

1374
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,463
That simple. No problem.

1375
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,129
No problem. Don't worry,
that's only the tip of the iceberg.

1376
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,255
You wait till I win a fucker.

1377
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,055
I didn't even think about it really,
I just agree with them.

1378
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,096
You're better off. Owt I say was just
sour grapes, anything at all that I say.

1379
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,301
I could've said owt.

1380
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,728
So I had to do an interview
yesterday morning...

1381
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,522
I just said,
"I was happy to finish fourth.

1382
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,724
"Happy. It's where I wanted to be."

1383
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,809
Obviously not,
I wanted to win it, didn't I?

1384
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,816
But they're not helping you with
dickheads like that, are they?

1385
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:09,896
Oh, well.

1386
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,157
Worse things happen at sea,
we're still here aren't we?

1387
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,281
I thought it went rather well.

1388
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,281
Obviously not well enough,
cos Hutchy beat me.

1389
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,412
Yeah, I know what needs to be done.

1390
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,454
But there's another three
races left yet, isn't there?

1391
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,831
It'll come.

1392
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,637
(Lambert) There is the race leader
Ryan Farquhar really looking dialled in.

1393
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,677
Something must have gone wrong
at the start for Guy

1394
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,258
he was well outside the top 10.

1395
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:44,139
It's Hutchy's victory by 1.3 seconds.

1396
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,771
Hutchy, Ryan and Conor. in that order.

1397
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,688
It's hat trick Hutchy
winning three TT's in a week.

1398
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,356
And there are still two solo TT's to go.

1399
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,692
(Hutchinson) I just gave it
absolutely everything I could.

1400
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,449
And, It's just unbelievable, man,
unbelievable.

1401
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,828
(Mellow playing)

1402
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:05,419
 I hear the ocean beat upon the shore
outside my room

1403
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:11,963
 Calling me out from sleep
to listen to her graceful tune

1404
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:18,723
 She makes me feel alive
Her power more than words can say

1405
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:25,272
 Send shivers through my person
Clears my head to face the day

1406
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,146
 I pray

1407
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:35,903
 The tides will rise
and fall again 

1408
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:36,983
(Phone ringing)

1409
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,284
Hello?

1410
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,492
All right, driver. Who are you?

1411
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,492
What do you know?

1412
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,161
No.

1413
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,838
Yeah, just sat watching
some onboards playing,

1414
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,257
getting a plan of attack sorted.

1415
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,173
Jeffries's from 2002

1416
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,337
and then bits of Hutchy.

1417
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,386
I'm going through
the tight sections too hot,

1418
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,180
and then I'm losing the run
onto the long straights.

1419
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:09,691
 I see the sun rise up
into a cloudless sky of blue

1420
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,268
 Coaxing the shadows back

1421
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,981
 To let the sun's light
shine on through 

1422
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:17,986
- You want it?
- OK, thank you.

1423
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,196
- Can you sign here?
- All right love, how's it going?

1424
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,035
- Going great.
- Good lass.

1425
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,957
Hope you get the race.

1426
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,789
I know. Let's hope so, eh?

1427
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,372
(Kinley) I've just seen Paul Dobbs,

1428
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,548
lets maybe go
and have a word with Dobbs.

1429
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,087
- Good morning, Paul.
- How you doing?

1430
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,885
(Kinley) What about today's conditions?
I bet you were sat

1431
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,054
when you woke up this morning and
you must have thought, "Oh, no. "

1432
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,551
(Dobbs) No, teammates
with Oatsey this year

1433
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,599
and he assures me
that it's gonna come right, so...

1434
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,385
(Kinley) All right, Paul, I'll let you
get it together and get warm,

1435
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,469
he looks freezing.

1436
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,600
(Glover) You're looking as if
you're not ready for a race, either.

1437
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,936
Nowhere near.
I mean, yeah, it's not safe is it?

1438
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,817
No, so you can't go racing in that.
I ain't racing.

1439
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:58,564
There you go, love.

1440
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,073
Guy! Guy!

1441
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,488
Guy, she fancies you!

1442
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:05,738
(All laughing)

1443
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,432
(Moore) ...as Guy Martin goes
through in fourth place.

1444
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,093
(Lambert) There goes Hutchy,
looking very strong.

1445
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,262
(Moore) Keith Amor on the pace
is in third.

1446
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,472
Michael Dunlop
is here and he still leads.

1447
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,600
But only by 1.82 seconds.

1448
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,111
The difference is only 1.82 seconds.

1449
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,109
(Lambert) No, I think Hutchy
has done it...

1450
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,283
He has, because
Michael Dunlop crosses the line,

1451
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,819
but it is Ian Hutchinson
who has won the race.

1452
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:45,903
And not just that.

1453
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,286
He has made the most amazing
piece of history here today.

1454
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,877
The first man in history
to win the first four TT races.

1455
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,996
And only the second man,

1456
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,590
after Phillip McCallen,
to win four in a week.

1457
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,673
Ian Hutchinson,
the new king of the mountain.

1458
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,052
No question about that.

1459
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,932
(Kinley) James McBride away now.

1460
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,473
Next away will be
New Zealand's finest Paul Dobbs,

1461
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,224
and right behind him
is Welshman Paul Owen.

1462
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,686
Great to see the man
from Llangollen here once again.

1463
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,816
(Paul Owen) Well,
we were on the start line,

1464
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,280
and then you shake hands with your mate

1465
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,699
and always wish him all the best.

1466
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,906
I set off behind my mate, Paul Dobbs.

1467
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,284
Because you're 10 seconds apart,

1468
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,412
you can count them
when they just disappear

1469
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,202
You start counting.

1470
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,207
(Paul Aston) You can hear them coming
down from the campsite down in the dip

1471
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,201
and then back up. You can hear
them speed coming up there.

1472
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,374
And you can tell the men from the boys

1473
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,624
because they gear down,
they drop a cog down

1474
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,718
and then they ease off
slightly, then they open it up

1475
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,632
and rip it around the corner.

1476
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,384
But I have to say, the top boys,
they just don't bother.

1477
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,547
They just keep it going flat.

1478
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,726
He just came round the corner so well,

1479
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,019
clipped it,

1480
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,931
the bike went
the height of the bus stop.

1481
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,691
It just went straight up,

1482
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,235
the height of the bus stop
that's down there.

1483
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,062
Like a battleground.

1484
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,781
(Paul Owen) I was just closing on him

1485
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,950
and then we were
just coming up to Ballagarey

1486
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,445
and I just seen him
go off into the corner

1487
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:54,825
and then the yellow flags came out
so I knew that there'd been an incident.

1488
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,664
Either he'd blown
the engine or crashed so,

1489
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,496
I could like hear the other riders
coming so I just grabbed a flag

1490
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,957
and just ran into the track
to slow the other riders down.

1491
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,506
The medics tried
everything they could for him.

1492
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,758
But he'd have been cheesed off
if he'd have been in a car

1493
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,263
and got squashed by a tractor
or summat like that, like.

1494
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,350
Like, we're here, we race.
We know the dangers.

1495
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,106
It's not tiddlywinks or whatever

1496
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,776
That's why everybody gets on
if you can help each other.

1497
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:23,769
But sadly,

1498
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,109
he lost his life
to the sport that he loves.

1499
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,741
Just one of them, like.

1500
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:44,048
(Bridget) I had one of those moments,
you know, that happen at some point

1501
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,966
once or twice during every TT fortnight,

1502
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,922
when I just stand and look around
and everything you see, the bikes,

1503
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:54,472
the overalls, you know you hear
that siren, pit-entry siren.

1504
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:58,813
Everything going on
and I just thought, I love this.

1505
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:03,977
And I actually thought,
a stupid moment of clarity,

1506
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:08,861
God, I'd miss this if I couldn't have it
cos something happens to Dobbsy.

1507
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:10,816
(Laughs)

1508
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,819
An hour later...

1509
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,327
Anyone could lose
their partner tomorrow.

1510
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:24,422
People step out under a bus.
People are lost every day.

1511
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,841
You talk about that, and you joke
about it all the time, you know.

1512
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:31,296
I might not be here next week,
is what people say.

1513
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,552
But when it is part
of your consciousness,

1514
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,720
even a subconscious part,

1515
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,601
it really does make you love life.

1516
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,689
It makes you appreciate who you've got

1517
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,687
and what's special about them

1518
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,268
and just how lucky you are.

1519
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,566
The reason we make
that choice to go racing

1520
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,198
is just the whole, you know,

1521
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,778
We're here for a good time."

1522
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,330
What can, you know, how can we
get the most fun out of life?

1523
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,292
And, we want the kids
to share that as well.

1524
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,579
They come along, they love it,
they're part of it.

1525
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,874
Because we had that time with him,
it's made us who we are.

1526
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,170
It's made them who they are.

1527
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,884
You know, they're incredible.

1528
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,889
Um, they're strong. They're fun.

1529
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,267
And we have fun.
You know, we have so much fun.

1530
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,261
It doesn't stop.

1531
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,723
And we're going to keep on having fun,
you know.

1532
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,234
Ride the bikes, play the music,
dance in the kitchen.

1533
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,445
We still love the TT,
still love the island,

1534
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,939
you can't change that.

1535
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,408
You can't love the death.
You can't love the loss.

1536
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:37,908
But you can't love
the excitement and the thrill

1537
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,823
without knowing that that's part of it.

1538
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,203
It wouldn't be so exciting
if it didn't have the risk.

1539
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,255
That's why they want to do it.

1540
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,762
(Man on radio) Meanwhile,
the Auto Cycle Union has confirmed

1541
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:07,191
a second rider was killed
in yesterday's Supersport 2 race.

1542
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,525
48-year-old Austrian Martin Loicht died
in a crash at Quarry Bends...

1543
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,990
This is Friday, Senior day.

1544
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:16,738
This is the day
we've all been waiting for

1545
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,121
it's the final,
and it's the race of the year,

1546
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,204
as far as we're concerned.

1547
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,624
The big prize. People Call it
the power and the glory.

1548
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:25,959
It just means so much.

1549
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:30,006
So we will be putting a big effort
into this, a huge effort.

1550
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,462
Everyone's ready. And Guy is up for it.

1551
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:36,591
(Chuckling) He's just arrived.
That's him.

1552
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,136
On the dirty old bicycle, the pushbike.

1553
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,436
(Lambert) Who's going to take
this year's Senior title?

1554
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,688
Will it be an unbelievable
five for Ian Hutchinson?

1555
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,771
Can John McGuinness
make it onto the podium?

1556
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:54,648
(Martin) I've had a second, had a fourth
yesterday, I had a fifth.

1557
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:58,652
And so I've not had the best of weeks,
really. A few little issues

1558
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,490
in the way of just bike setup.

1559
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,159
But it's all food for thought,

1560
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:05,249
and I've got to try and take
it through into today's race

1561
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,326
and go play the part, see what I can do.

1562
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,581
I'm going to go out
there and try my hardest.

1563
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,504
But then sometimes
I've been watching onboards,

1564
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,294
I've been watching
this and watching that.

1565
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,791
And am I trying too hard?

1566
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,964
And I think I look in a couple
of places, and I am.

1567
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,795
And that's what's holding me back, so...

1568
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,427
Yeah, I'll pull me finger out.

1569
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,679
That penalty, I didn't
feel really hard done by.

1570
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,260
Worse things happen at sea.
I just came and sat in here

1571
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,936
with me helmet and me boots
and me gloves and me leathers

1572
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,764
and all that shit on,
and just sat here and...

1573
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,349
At the time, if someone
would have come in here,

1574
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,526
if Mr Speed-gun Man
or whatever had come in here

1575
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,024
I'd have thrashed fuck out of him.

1576
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,905
But, really, Mr Speed-gun Man,
I'd have thrashed fuck out of him.

1577
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,744
I'm not a fighting man, but there's
a time and a place for everything.

1578
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,909
And something like that's going on.

1579
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,374
Point... Whatever, don't
even get me started on it.

1580
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,959
I've won four so far,
and it'd be great to get the fifth.

1581
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,166
You know, it'd be the fairytale story.

1582
01:19:55,916 --> 01:20:00,217
But, obviously, everyone's been
gunning out to get me all week.

1583
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:03,516
And I think in some respects,
the pressure's kind of off them

1584
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,310
with it just being one person
that's done it all week.

1585
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,477
What more can they do?

1586
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,352
It's not as if you know, there's
been four different winners

1587
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,516
and they haven't won one, it's just...

1588
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,895
I think maybe the pressure
is off them a little bit, but...

1589
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:19,364
On the other side of it,
it's the last race this year.

1590
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,073
You know, if they really are determined
to win a TT this year,

1591
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,904
this is the last chance.

1592
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,740
(Christian) I haven't seen one of
those Conor Cummins posters around yet,

1593
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,459
but there'll be a big groundswell
of support for the local boy...

1594
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,286
(Martin) If you go out there
with your head filed,

1595
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:33,913
if I listen to Rage Against The Machine
before I go out,

1596
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,084
you're going out
with the wrong frame of mind.

1597
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,297
So I'm gonna go out there
listening to...

1598
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,501
I think I might have a bit of
Otis Redding on before I go out.

1599
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,045
Yeah, smoke me 10 Bensons.

1600
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,212
(People laughing)

1601
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,598
Do you want 10 Bensons?

1602
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:45,929
That'll do you, will it?

1603
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,395
Yeah, I'm only taking up smoking...
I'm taking up smoking after July.

1604
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,101
But there's been a few moments
in this past couple of weeks

1605
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,815
where I've just thought...

1606
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,772
But I've not smoked, so I think
a bit of Otis Redding on the start line,

1607
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,315
pretend to smoke a fag,

1608
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,200
and take it as it comes.

1609
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,585
(Lambert) Well the parade lap
is coming to its conclusion here.

1610
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,961
We're going to have
the senior TT race going

1611
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,789
in just under an hour's time

1612
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,131
at half past 12,

1613
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,467
and we will, of course,
give you all the build up

1614
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,136
and the interviews
as the riders get out there.

1615
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,202
Can history be made by Ian Hutchinson?

1616
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:53,329
He's proved himself to be
an absolute maestro

1617
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,168
around the mountain course.

1618
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,588
And there is the number one machine
of Bruce Anstey.

1619
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,588
The lap record still standing
at 131.578 miles an hour.

1620
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,671
That was set by John McGuinness
last year Less than 10 seconds to go.

1621
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,844
Well, I can tell the members of
the Guy Martin fan club over there

1622
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,558
on the far side of Glencrutchery Road

1623
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,601
that their man is
still one of the favourites,

1624
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:14,722
along with the big local hope,
number 10, Conor Cummins.

1625
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,352
(Engine revving)

1626
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,858
The last few seconds tick away.

1627
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,027
We watch the Hag, which drops,
and we are now racing.

1628
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,359
Bruce Anstey.
Mountain Maestro John McGuinness.

1629
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,077
Now number three Ian Lochear
That's Hutchy on the number four

1630
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,037
Keith Amor goes. And Cameron Donald.

1631
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,702
So Michael is away on the Honda.

1632
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,783
Guy Martin on the Wilson Craig Honda.

1633
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,119
Guy's off and racing.

1634
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,377
But I can tell you that
when we look to the scoreboard

1635
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,630
to see that Guy Martin,
number eight, leads.

1636
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:51,434
But only by .4 or .5 of a second
from number 10, Conor Cummins.

1637
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,307
There is only .06 of a second then

1638
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,564
between him and
number four, Ian Hutchinson,

1639
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:00,233
with John McGuinness
just .74 of a second down on him.

1640
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,195
So one and a half seconds
cover the top four here.

1641
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:06,156
And a tight line in
from number eight, Guy Martin.

1642
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,400
A hundred and thirty one mile
an hour lap for Guy.

1643
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:13,581
131.108, that's Guy Martin's fastest lap
ever around the mountain course.

1644
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,457
And he's absolutely on song today.

1645
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,454
It's all about those guys
on the eight and 10 plates,

1646
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,962
Guy Martin and Conor Cummins,
but it's so close right behind them,

1647
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:27,253
Hutchy and John McGuinness
are right there in the mix.

1648
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,559
And Conor has gone into the lead.

1649
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,937
Conor has snatched
the lead from Guy Martin

1650
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,689
but there's 0.58 seconds in it.

1651
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,608
(Soft music playing)

1652
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,542
It's down to fractions of seconds,

1653
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,166
because at the Bungalow,
Guy Martin has narrowed the gap

1654
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:51,261
on Conor Cummins to just one-tenth
of a second. That's all there is.

1655
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,422
It's still desperately,
desperately tight.

1656
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,719
(Kinley) IFS Guy right
in front of me here now,

1657
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,718
red torpedo on the back of his leathers.

1658
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,927
Just watch that speed! Go on...

1659
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,355
(Lambert) And Guy Martin,
let me just give you his details.

1660
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:04,020
130. 642,

1661
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,568
and he was the race leader
at Cronk-ny-Mona,

1662
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,029
but we're still waiting for Conor
Conor's here now.

1663
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,277
130.278.

1664
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,318
(Kinley) A brand new tyre in
for Guy as he fires up and he is away.

1665
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:17,071
Right now we saw a great pit stop
by the Wilson Craig team

1666
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,701
and it's the McAdoo boys
who are on it now.

1667
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,781
Tighten her up, Mark, and

1668
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,117
Mark just says go, go, go, go.

1669
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,543
She fires and the big man is away now.

1670
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,337
(Lambert) Here he is.
Here's Guy Martin now!

1671
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,066
(Christian) But there was
an awful long gap there

1672
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:50,529
in between Hutchinson and Michael Dunlop
and Keith Amor appearing here,

1673
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,982
and the road goes quiet here
for a moment or two.

1674
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:55,742
But we're still waiting
on machine number eight.

1675
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,129
And here's Conor at number 10,

1676
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,461
so we don't appear
to have a Guy Martin here.

1677
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,136
Guy Martin is missing.

1678
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,180
(Race official) Red flag.
Attention, attention. Red flag.

1679
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,098
(Lambert) Well, back here at
the grandstand, we're not sure

1680
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,265
if we've got a red-flag situation.
The race has been stopped

1681
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,604
because a fire engine
has to go onto the track.

1682
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,024
It's clearly something very serious
at Ballagarey.

1683
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:30,103
It's only the second Senior race
in 100 years to be red-flagged.

1684
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,613
Incident at Ballagarey.

1685
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,819
Guy Martin hasn't reached Glen Helen.

1686
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,903
Red flag, boys. Red flag.

1687
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:49,334
We believe it's Guy Martin. He's crashed
and the bike has set fire to a field,

1688
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,962
and that's one of the only times
they'll put red flags out.

1689
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,800
(Anderson) it's gut-wrenching
for everyone.

1690
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:54,967
The team are pacing up and down,

1691
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,134
you can see the team boss' head down,
not knowing what's going on.

1692
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,432
I mean, nobody knows
any better than anybody.

1693
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:04,803
(Man) First we knew about it was
when Guy didn't arrive at Glen Helen.

1694
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,356
You'd like to think
that it's a mechanical failure

1695
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:08,648
rather than a crash.

1696
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,904
But then we heard the hedge
was on fire at Glen Vine...

1697
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:18,067
(Announcer) Only riders and officials
are allowed in the parc ferm area.

1698
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,328
Everybody else out, please. Thank you.

1699
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,872
(Mark) You could see the fire
in the distance about a mile away.

1700
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:25,912
There was smoke and one of the hay bales
was on fire

1701
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,164
and they slowed us way down
and I thought, "OK,

1702
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,621
"well, there's a hay bale on fire, "

1703
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,672
and, There's the bike
in somebody's yard. "

1704
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,507
And I'm like, "OK
we're past the incident."

1705
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:39,137
A quarter-mile later, there was Guy.

1706
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,757
And I was like, "Oh, shit."

1707
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:47,013
(Wilson) There was an incident.
Guy was missing so it had to be him.

1708
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,856
He crashed at something
like 170 miles an hour,

1709
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:51,691
cos he was off at that speed

1710
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,565
and, of course, you worry.

1711
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:56,025
You know, you dont jump from a bike

1712
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,697
at 170 miles an hour and get up again.

1713
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,447
So, yes, we are worried.

1714
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:06,491
Paul Dobbs crashed there last night,
and, you know, he didn't make it.

1715
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:08,746
So, fingers crossed for Guy.

1716
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,414
It's hit and miss there, you know.

1717
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:13,498
There's no run-out, as there isn't
anywhere on the circuit here.

1718
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,925
Guy seems to have made a little bit
of a rider error sort of thing

1719
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,464
and he's gone into the wall.

1720
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,170
It's not looking good.

1721
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,180
I came up on the circuit,

1722
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,933
you know, it just looks like
a bomb's exploded when owt goes on here.

1723
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,968
The wall and all the bales were on fire,

1724
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,645
you know, and Guy's
laid there in the track,

1725
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:31,060
his bike's split in pieces, like it's...

1726
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,233
It's horrendous, yeah, we...

1727
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,903
Everyone's fingers are crossed
at the minute, to see how Guy is.

1728
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:42,948
(Announcer) So quarter past two, for
a 3:00 start to a four-lap Senior race.

1729
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:44,448
(Johnson) It's just how it is,
sort of thing.

1730
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,947
We all enter it. There's no gun
to our heads to enter

1731
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,163
We all love it, and at the end
of the day, if it goes wrong

1732
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:53,371
and the worst does happen,
then he died a happy man, like.

1733
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:58,926
You know, the show's going on.
We've got four laps coming here.

1734
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,590
We're a 3:00 start.

1735
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,092
No. It'll be no slower.

1736
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,101
(Announcer) Now let's give you
the track conditions.

1737
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,513
Roads. Lack of adhesion at Ballagarey

1738
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,602
Dry around the rest of the course.

1739
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,766
Visibility good. Four lap race.

1740
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,652
(Dave) Got me fingers crossed
for Conor today.

1741
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,775
He'll be out there giving
it the berries, as usual.

1742
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,648
I'm right behind you,
Conan if you're listening.

1743
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,954
(Lambert) Four laps, 150.92 miles.

1744
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,042
John McGuinness, the race leader
in the race before it was abandoned

1745
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,670
is away on number two.
This is Ian Hutchinson.

1746
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,335
And now number 10, Conor Cummins,

1747
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:44,463
looking so good for
the first couple of laps.

1748
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:48,141
He's got to keep it together
for the full race today.

1749
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,185
And here comes the first
of those machines, it is McGuinness.

1750
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,142
Here's Hutchy now, 0.61,

1751
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,814
that's all there is
between the two of them.

1752
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,605
I'm sad to report Michael
is in retirement at Joey's.

1753
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,360
And Cameron is off the bike.

1754
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,354
Here's Conor now. Head down.

1755
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,567
(Christian) So the big news here
at Glen Helen. Lap two.

1756
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,902
McGuinness appears to be out.

1757
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,703
(Lambert) And there's 3.24 seconds

1758
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:11,156
that Ian Hutchinson leads
number 10, Conor Cummins.

1759
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:34,055
Back here at the Grandstand,
we have got a situation at the Bungalow

1760
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:37,186
where Ian Hutchinson
retains the lead of the race.

1761
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,355
We're waiting for Conor
to appear at the Bungalow

1762
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:41,399
before we can update that.

1763
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,943
News of Conor Cummins,
he came off at the Veranda

1764
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,365
and he's receiving attention.

1765
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,109
So, Conor off at the Veranda.

1766
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:51,242
Ian Hutchinson crosses the line
and rides into the history books.

1767
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:55,242
Forget the famous five,
this is the fabulous, fantastic five

1768
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:57,744
by the Bingley Bullet Ian Hutchinson,

1769
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:01,089
30 years of age.
He has rewritten the history books

1770
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:04,543
of one of the greatest
motorsport events in the world.

1771
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,892
(Paul) Again it was
the sound and the blurt

1772
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,393
But the blur stopped.

1773
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,228
He was coming around the corner
A good race line,

1774
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,775
really good race line
in all fairness to him,

1775
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,276
and he was flying round.

1776
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:30,160
The bike comes down,
he kicks the bike away

1777
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:34,615
and the bike literally
turns into a fireball on impact.

1778
01:31:37,867 --> 01:31:40,666
It's like the start of a TV programme,
an all-action TV programme

1779
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,622
where the screen is filled with flames,

1780
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,420
and this silhouette comes towards us

1781
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,467
at about waist height, and it's Guy.

1782
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,467
And I'm thinking,
"Oh, here we go, I got a job here."

1783
01:31:49,462 --> 01:31:50,930
First thing that springs to mind.

1784
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:55,477
So I reached down, grabbed
my orange box, the med box.

1785
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,596
I turned around there
and Guy's flying past me

1786
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:01,475
followed by a bike which is on fire
and it just screams past me

1787
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,273
and then the bike goes over to one side
and it's still in flames

1788
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,446
and there's black smoke everywhere.

1789
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:08,031
And flames, they make a
hell of a mess, don't they?

1790
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,153
And Guy's in the middle.

1791
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,620
I tell him, "I'm not
gonna cut your leathers,

1792
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,697
cos I need to check you over
first of all. 

1793
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,953
And he says, "No, don't cut my leathers,
don't cut my leathers. "

1794
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,326
Now I understand that
because I'm a biker, like,

1795
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,453
and that's the last thing I'd want is
somebody to cut my leathers.

1796
01:32:21,995 --> 01:32:24,248
But he was good. He was good.

1797
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:27,383
Definitely somebody's up there
watching him.

1798
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,006
No doubt about it.

1799
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:30,962
Lucky guy.

1800
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:39,017
(Martin) I thought,
"Right, job was looking good."

1801
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,144
Job was looking good,
131 and a half from a standing start.

1802
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,693
Uh, slowing to come into the pits,
I think 130.6,

1803
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,691
battling for the lead.

1804
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,530
Went out from the pits,
got about five mile out, at Glen Vine.

1805
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:54,865
Took the front.

1806
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,743
Thought I got it.
Thought I got it! Got it! Got it!

1807
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,870
See, I've had a few moments like this.

1808
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:01,994
You're just riding into
the grip that you've got.

1809
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:06,172
And I was riding up to that point of

1810
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,833
I knew where there was decent grip,

1811
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,506
and you couldn't really push
past that point.

1812
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,008
Cos I just left the pits with
another full tank of petrol,

1813
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,053
and I decided in my head
the grip that I could ride up to

1814
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,349
and, um...

1815
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:20,891
Obviously not.

1816
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:23,140
I think the full tank of petrol
probably made a bit of difference.

1817
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:27,273
Uh, lost the front. Far fronner.

1818
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,944
You know, one of the faster corners
of the track.

1819
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,025
Probably 160-70 mile an hour.

1820
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,906
And took the front, I thought

1821
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:37,529
"I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

1822
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,702
"No... No, I ain't got it."

1823
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,374
So I had to jump ship.

1824
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,915
And I think I ended up with a few...

1825
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,042
I've got a few bits of
singed eyebrows and eyelashes,

1826
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,375
and singed me fringe and what have you.

1827
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,459
But it's... I ended up
in the wall I think.

1828
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,090
I can't remember much.
I was knocked out.

1829
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,429
But I'm still here.

1830
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,764
And I'm not bad, really. It could have
been a lot worse, couldn't it?

1831
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,383
Could have been a lot worse.

1832
01:33:58,383 --> 01:33:59,555
Yeah, I think it is nothing.

1833
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,725
It's only, you know, a bit of bark
off my knees and what have you,

1834
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:04,772
you know, when you're sliding at
160-70 mile an hour

1835
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:05,895
that's a lot of heat, isn't it?

1836
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,230
I've got a lot of
friction burns from sliding.

1837
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,687
A few broken ribs, a punctured lung.

1838
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:16,322
Uh, four chipped vertebrae
and two cracked vertebrae.

1839
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,153
Apart from that, I'm like a new one.

1840
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:23,413
So, yeah, just sat here and... Yeah.

1841
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,335
I think... I think here,

1842
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:29,085
I'm sat here moving my legs
and I think, "Ah, I'm invincible."

1843
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,633
Then I try and get off
and I think, "Oh, fucking hell."

1844
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,718
I'm not as good as I think.

1845
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,505
Cos they say like owt with the spine,
you can't rush it, can you?

1846
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,932
Now, it's a stable fracture
as it is at the moment,

1847
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:41,806
but push any harder,
you know, and it can...

1848
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:45,101
Like Conor's just up the corridor there,
not looking clever.

1849
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:48,942
His back's a bit worse than mine,
and they're having to send him away

1850
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,987
to get his shoulder
and his elbow screwed together.

1851
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,693
But it's part of the game, boy.

1852
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,866
We all know the risks.
No one's making us do owt.

1853
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,118
All part of the game.

1854
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,539
Put me in that position again
and I'll do exactly the same.

1855
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,291
Exactly the same again.

1856
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:08,874
I'll be back.

1857
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,464
He's just making me work for it,
isn't he?

1858
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,834
Sorted.

1859
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:25,012
(McGuinness) I think I've had a podium
every year since 1997.

1860
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:27,810
So, it seems weird, you know,
coming up on the access road

1861
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:31,143
and, you know, not getting
a cheer and a clap

1862
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:34,817
and getting waved past the rostrum
and I was leading the first race

1863
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:37,486
and it all went wrong and then
in the senior, the blue ribbon race,

1864
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,860
I got up to a sort of eleven second lead
and then Guy had the crash.

1865
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:43,162
You know, the red flags come out
and you've got to come back

1866
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,535
and tune yourself back in,

1867
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:45,991
and get dialled in and ready
for the restart

1868
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:47,667
and the restart looking like
it was going good

1869
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:50,541
and then we had a kill switch failure.

1870
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,839
Two pence wire snaps off
and the solder breaks

1871
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,918
and just puts you
out of contention completely.

1872
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,836
You know, that's
the TT for you, I suppose.

1873
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,839
I've had a lot of luck in the past,
I've won a lot of races round here.

1874
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:02,890
And when luck's not on your side,
it's not happening for you.

1875
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,593
For sure Guy Martin's had
a worse day than I had,

1876
01:36:05,677 --> 01:36:08,897
and for sure Conor Cummins has had
a lot worse day than I have.

1877
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:12,852
I'm still in one piece. I'm gonna
head for the ferry and get home

1878
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,524
and get my thoughts together
and see what's going to be available

1879
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,857
for next year, or,
if nothing floats me boat,

1880
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,533
I might hang me leathers up.
You never know.

1881
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,742
(Bridget) Me and the kids, together;
have had our down times

1882
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:32,211
and I haven't tried to
hide anything from them.

1883
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,790
You know, we've done
our crying together

1884
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:38,759
And then, OK, what are we
gonna do now?"

1885
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,212
Get over it, move on.

1886
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,966
I think the point of life
is to enjoy it.

1887
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,722
Have as good a time as we can while
we're here and what we've got given.

1888
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,391
You can't change what you get given

1889
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:51,389
but you can decide
whether or not to enjoy it.

1890
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,989
(Cummins) I've been to look at
where the crash was,

1891
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:05,161
there's still bits of green paint from
either the bike or me leathers

1892
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,988
still on the cat's eye
on the side of the road.

1893
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:10,120
I can actually see
where it's all gone wrong.

1894
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,959
I've disappeared over the side.

1895
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:14,921
And the way I look at it that's where
the injuries started to happen

1896
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:18,166
and it sort of..
It does get to you a little bit.

1897
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,510
The main one was me back.

1898
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,337
I broke that in five places

1899
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,514
and I've got a big scar on my back

1900
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:29,015
as a result of getting tumbled clown
the hill and hitting a few things,

1901
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:31,141
I broke my arm in four places.

1902
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:34,357
Some slight nerve damage to it
but that's coming back nicely.

1903
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:37,857
My knee was dislocated, a few scrapes,

1904
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:42,281
I had a fractured pelvis
and a fractured shoulder blade

1905
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,779
and a bruised lung, as well.

1906
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:48,034
Um, there was a bit
to take in really, you know.

1907
01:37:48,446 --> 01:37:53,122
To get my head around it
was a big challenge, you know, mentally.

1908
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,620
There's no chance I'm giving up.

1909
01:37:55,703 --> 01:38:00,550
I'm 24 year old and I perfectly accept
I've been really really lucky

1910
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:04,220
but me love for bike racing
is still there

1911
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,968
and I've got goals I want to achieve.

1912
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:09,221
So the first opportunity I ever get
I'll be straight on it.

1913
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,177
That's my plan, you know.

1914
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:14,147
Come up to the Verandah at the
next TT or whenever I get back,

1915
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:17,684
and just attack it like normal.

1916
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:22,818
Yeah, it was a big one but
we'll just get on with life. (Chuckles)

1917
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,649
The world ain't gonna stop for me.

1918
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:28,035
(Commentator) Tremendous start,
round the outside.

1919
01:38:28,111 --> 01:38:29,363
(Commentator 2) We think Ian Hutchinson,

1920
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:32,870
the five times in a week
winner of the TT,

1921
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,327
may be the lad who's down there.

1922
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:39,502
(Ian) Unfortunately, yeah, I got into
the second to last race of the year

1923
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:43,718
on a short circuit, not a road race,
and ended up with this injury.

1924
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:48,427
I mean, it's a shame how it happened.
To be ridden off by somebody else.

1925
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:53,178
You know, when it happened and they were
talking about amputating my leg,

1926
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:56,431
there was only one reason
I didnt want to amputate

1927
01:38:56,514 --> 01:38:58,937
and that's so I can race
a motorbike, you know.

1928
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,028
Apart from that,
nothing else really matters, so,

1929
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,361
you know, my argument
was to get my foot back on.

1930
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,529
And not only get it on,

1931
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:11,200
I said, "I don't want a foot
just on the end of my leg.

1932
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,783
"I want a foot that's 100% working
so I can get on with my job."

1933
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,207
Couldn't have been a better time
for it to happen, obviously,

1934
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:21,130
seven months until
the start of the season, so...

1935
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:25,051
I've just got to get on with it
and get back to fitness

1936
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,885
for the start of next year.

1937
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,931
(Fire playing)

1938
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:37,515
 Take me into the night
and I'm an easy lover

1939
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:46,407
 Take me into the fight
and I'm an easy brother

1940
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,901
 And I'm on fire

1941
01:39:55,740 --> 01:40:02,294
 Burn my sweet effigy I'm a roadrunner

1942
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:10,594
 Spill my guts on a wheel
I wanna taste, uh-huh

1943
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:17,980
 And I'm on fire
And I'm on fire

1944
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,230
 And I'm on fire

1945
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:31,197
 And I'm on fire

1946
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:59,893
 Wire me up to machines
I'll be your prisoner

1947
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:08,026
 Find it hard to believe
You are my murderer

1948
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:13,072
 I'm on fire

1949
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:16,371
 I'm behind you

1950
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:22,960
 There's a falling sky

1951
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:29,468
 And I'm on fire

1952
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:37,009
 And I'm on fire

1953
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:16,965
 And I'm on fire

1954
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:23,771
 I'm on fire

1955
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:33,148
 Move on, you got to move on

1956
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:36,985
 You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

1957
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:41,243
 Move on, you got to move on

1958
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:44,997
 You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

1959
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:50,293
 I feel it, I want it, I'm coming
I tell ya

1960
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:54,799
 I caught the bullet from the heavens
To the one you serve

1961
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:58,469
 I'm going
I'm running out to the highest love

1962
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,475
 I'm wanna hit you to the hip

1963
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:03,010
 And I'm on fire

1964
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,938
 Move on, you got to move on

1965
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:09,768
 You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

1966
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,018
 And I'm on fire

1967
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,946
 Move on, you got to move on

1968
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:17,776
 You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
