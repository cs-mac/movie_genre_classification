Hey!

5
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,607
We had a plan, Carter,
and you done goofed it.

6
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,775
The plan's still on.

7
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,527
The plan was for you to get me B's.

00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,614
I just want what's best for you.

You know when the last time
I got an A was?

Okay, I'll act more stupid next time.

11
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,490
Completely moronic and idiotic.
Beyond obtuse.

12
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,576
Yeah. Totally. That's
what I'm talking about.

13
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,793
You making fun of me?
You're dead this time, Carter.

Hey! You go on now, little mutt.

Go on. Go on, dog. I'll turn you
into a hot dog. Now, go on.

Hey.
There you are.

You're late. Again.
Come on. I wanna go to Sam's.

24

I was practicing for my recital.

That's cool, Frankie.

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,373
And I'm gonna dance in New York,
in Swan Lake, and be crazy famous.

28
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,666
But I'll still talk to you.

29
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,251
Why wouldn't you talk to me?

30
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,579
Because famous people
are always stuck up.

31
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,331
I am not.

32
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,268
And I'm gonna wear my boots
to do my pirouettes.

33
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,679
Good luck with that.

34

Hey. You are coming, right?

35
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,560
Yeah, sure.

nobody will be there.

I'll be there, Frankie.

That is if I invite you.

No, we can't!

Wait, Frankie.

What are you talking about?

48
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,387
I saw you have strawberries
in your pocket in the car.

49
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,097
I don't have any strawberries.

50

I saw something red and green.

I don't have any strawberries
in my pocket.

52
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,889
Well, it smeared on the chair
and you didn't wipe it up.

What do you mean
you don't believe me?

Not gonna happen.

He'll bully you your whole life.

I'm not gonna fight back.
I'd lose.

60
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,720
Why are we going here again?
It's just a waste of time.

61
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,306
Because you never know,
it could change sometimes.

Hi, Mr. King.
We're here for the watch.

64
00:12:55,774 --> 00:13:00,653
$4 and 26, 27, 28 cents.

65
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:06,826
That brings the total to $34 and 18...
No, 19 cents.

66
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,237
Not bad, am I right?

67
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,582
Oh, you don't even wanna know.

68
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,833
Mr. King,

69
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,121
we've been coming here
twice a week for a long time.

70
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,423
You can at least take the watch out
of the "For Sale" case.

71
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,800
Please. He meant to say please.

72
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,521
I take it out of the case, people can't see
it. People can't see it, people can't buy it.

73
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,433
But we're gonna buy it. Eventually.

74
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,354
Listen, I told both of you when we
started this whole cockamamieness,

75
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,106
that if somebody wants the watch,
I'll let you know.

76
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,943
Give you a chance to buy it first.
Yeah, but we should have

77
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,611
There's no buts.

78
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,447
When I bought it from your mother,
I paid her good money.

79
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,158
This is a business. Barely, but it is.

80
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,330
Mr. King, I promise you'll get money.
We're at, like, $34 and 19 cents.

81
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,533
Old.

82
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,493
A hundred?

83
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,421
You're not really helping your case.

84
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:05,301
The point is, at this rate, you guys
will be bringing my money to the cemetery.

85
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,171
I don't like the cemetery.

86
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:15,061
Listen, a guy came in, he liked the watch.
I told him it ran slow.

87
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,563
It doesn't run slow.

88
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,149
My father kept it in perfect condition,
and you know that.

89
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,604
The point is, pudding head,
he's not wearing it, is he?

90
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,315
Oh...

91
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,285
Mr. King, of all the people
I don't like in this world,

92
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,036
I like you the best.

93
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,406
You and every other woman in my life.

94
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,958
Now, you two, get out of here.

95
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,545
We're just gonna keep coming back.
Yeah, like a rash.

96
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,372
See ya tomorrow.
Take care.

97
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:01,566
That was a waste of time.
No, it wasn't. We added more money.

98
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,193
Next time, it'll be less money
that we have to add.

99
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,366
You've been giving Mr. King
your lunch money. I know you have.

101
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,995
Maybe I wouldn't have to
if Mom hadn't sold Dad's watch.

102
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,373
Lots of things aren't very good in life.
Get used to it.

103
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,537
You get used to being grounded forever
or longer when Mom finds out.

104
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,796
I was here first.

105
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,799
I'm older, so it doesn't matter.
I'm always first.

106
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,467
Mom doesn't like it when you double dip.

107
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,805
Mom's not here, so if you just shut
your mouth for once, you'll be fine.

108
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,600
Fine. I can keep my mouth shut
so much that I'll never talk to you

109
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,937
for all the time in all the universes
in all the world.

110
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,848
Thank goodness.

112
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,278
Carter can't come to the phone right now.

113
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,949
Please don't leave a message
after the beep. Beep!

114
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,492
Just look!

115
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,870
If you are satisfied with your message,
please press "1" or hang up.

116

Carter, just listen to me!

117
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,325
What?

118
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,745
No way.

119
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,050
I can't believe it.
How did you even get up here?

120
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,176
You know this dog?

121
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,013
I was trying to get him
to follow us home from school.

122
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,266
I knew you were doing something not good.
Come on. Good boy.

123
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,018
Come here. Good boy.

124
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,721
He's a stray.

125
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,641
Where did you come from?

126
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,525
A trash can?

127
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,895
He smells worse
than your side of the room.

128
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,816
You're right. Let's fix it.

My dog will always come through"

131
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,964

Comes shining through his eyes"

132

To make me realize"

133
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:41,134
"That I love my dog
As much as I love you"

134
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:46,556
"But you may fade
My dog will always come through"

135
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,368
Carter, what are we gonna do about Mom?

136
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,654
What about her?

137
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,663
She's gonna freak out.

138
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,875
You asked for a bulldog for Christmas,
and you got a stuffed animal.

139
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,880
Which is why we're not gonna tell her.
He's just gonna stay in our room for now.

140
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,582
Where's he gonna pee and poo?

141
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,293
In your bed? Carter!

142
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,296
Just until I can convince her.

143
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:22,426
It's Mom. We'll never convince her.
Like, ever.

144
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,978
Oh, crap.
Oh, no.

145
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,264
Hey, hey!

146
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,851
Where are my two favorite people
that help Mom out?

147
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,195
Hey, Mom.
Hi, Mommy!

148
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,281
You're the best mommy of all the mommies
in all the world!

149
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,200
Definitely, you're the best.

150
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,368
Aw...

151
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,452
What'd you break?

152
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,738
Nothing.

153
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,368
So there were
four accidents today. Four!

154
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,712
I was driving the ambulance
80 miles per hour.

155
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,922
That's a lot, Mom.

156
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,048
Forks on the left, hon.

00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,551
It will be.

158
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,872
Here you go, Madame. Mushrooms on top. How about you,
Mr. Man. Anything exciting happen at school today?

159
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,392
PigFace happened.

160
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,935
Your death is about to happen.

161
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,898
Again? That's the third time.
Okay, that's it. I'm calling the school.

162
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,609
Don't blow this up
like you blow everything up.

163
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,069
I'm not blowing anything up.

164
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,404
I wanna know who this kid is.

165
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,947
I told you, PigFace.

166
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:23,779
Tell me the truth.

167
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,867
Carter, just
You don't wanna know the truth.

168
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,003
No.
Straight up, Carter.

169
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,838
No.

170
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,548
'Cause if you are,
that's nothing...

171
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,549
Go.
To be ashamed of.

172
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,801
Just let me help you.
No. No.

173
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,262
Here you go. No mushrooms.

174
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,222
Um, actually,
can I have mushrooms, please?

175
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,934
You hate mushrooms.
But taste buds change every seven years.

176
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,430
That's a scientific fact.
He's right. Very, very right.

177
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,974
Mushrooms.

178
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,061
Okay.

179
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,321
I'm just worried about you, Carter.

180
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,650
You're worried about everything.
That is not true.

181
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:06,405
Okay, maybe that is a little bit true.
A little bit.

182
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,826
Anyway, here you go.

183
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,504
What is going on with you guys?

184
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,797
Nothing.
Nothing.

185
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,292
I feel like you're hiding
something from me.

186
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,839
Okay. Mom, let's just calm down
and eat our food.

187
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,676
Okay, I...

188
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,313
I know that things have been hard,

189
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,900
and you guys wake up in the morning
and I'm already at work,

190
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,986
and you've been on your own a lot lately.

191
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:43,157
But I just want you to know
that you can talk to me, you know?

192
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,445
Really, I'm right here.

193
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,583
We do talk to you, Mom.

194
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,710
Don't worry.

195
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,006
We love you, Mom, to the moon and back.

196
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,716
To the moon and back.

197
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:17,608
This is the Aitken Basin,
formed 4.5 billion years ago,

198
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,193
which in dog years is a lot.

199
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,862
My dad showed it to me
on an electron telescope

200
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,489
at the planetarium he ran.

201
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,449
Wanna know something more interesting?

202
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,403
This is my favorite ballerina book.
Isn't she pretty?

203
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,289
Hey, stop chewing on that.

204
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,291
And this is the Nutcracker.

205
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,584
It's about an evil rat king.

206
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,503
Die, Rat King, die.

207
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,671
Shh.

208
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,047
Mom will hear you.

209
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,009
Hey, what if we named him Michael Jordan?

210
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,636
That's the dumbest name
for a dog I've ever heard.

211
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,597
Okay. What about Copernicus?

212
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,551
What is going on in your mind? No.

213
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,814
This is my favorite, Sleeping Beauty.
There's a lot of kissing.

214
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,108
Look,
Benjamin Franklin had a dog.

215
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,193
He thought they were more reliable
than people.

216
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,063
That's not very interesting.

217
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,408
Yeah, but what about Benjamin,
as his name?

218
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,903
Mmm... What about Benji?

219
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,208
He does look kind of like a Benji.
He's old and new at the same time.

220
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,453
Yeah.

221
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,289
Good boy. Good boy.

222
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,264
Dad would let us keep Benji.

223
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,684
Carter...

224
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,980
I don't wanna say goodbye to Benji.

225
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,151
I don't like goodbye.

226
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,321
Promise me we won't have to.

227
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,915
Hey, I promise you, Fritter.

228
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,379
I love you, guys.

229
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,298
I love you too, Frankie.

230
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,267
And now I lay me down to sleep,

231
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,770
I pray the Lord for this dog to keep.

232
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,731
And that I will do incredible
at my recital.

233
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:25,236
And that my spelling teacher will quit
her job forever and never come back.

234
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,899
And that Mommy
will not have to worry so much.

235
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,404
And that I'll never have to eat
any more mushrooms as long as I live.

236
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,947
Amen.

237
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,617
Good night, Benji.

238
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,554
I don't know what to do, you know?

239
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,357
They're getting so big,
and they're so smart,

240
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,560
and they catch on to things and...

241
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,315
And I'm trying
to keep everything together.

242
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,326
It's like I'm nothing but a nag.

243
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:18,823
All of a sudden, I'm so serious.

244
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:27,791
Every day I feel like I'm messing them up
and letting them down.

245
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,254
I don't know how to be
in three places at once.

246
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,893
So, feel free to give me some advice

247
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,889
or one of your lame science jokes, or...

248
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,727
a carton of ice cream and bingeing...

249
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,361
'cause I could really use it.

250
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,753
Just a quick kiss
before I go to work.

251
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,685
Good morning, Mom.

252
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,095
What is that?

253
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,023
A stuffed animal.
An animatronic one.

254
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,735
Okay. All right.
I'm on to you two.

255
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,280
This is why you guys
were being weird last night.

256
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,615
He's cute. Mom, look at him.

257
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,285
You know what?
I expected Carter to lie to me

258
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,328
because he's almost a teenager, but you?

259
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,540
Mom, we're not lying.
We just didn't tell you yet.

260
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,125
Where did he come from?

261
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,960
Uh, he kind of found me.

262
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,170
On the street, we saved him.

263
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,623
On the street?

264
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,009
No. Okay.

265
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,719
All right, I got it.

266
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,514
You're cute, but you are a dog
and you poop everywhere,

267
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,891
and you mess everything up,
you chew on things,

268
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,476
you keep us up at night.

269
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,978
He loves you, Mommy.

270
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,148
No. Okay? I can barely keep
the three of us afloat.

271
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,441
It's not happening.

272
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,229
Mom, you don't have to worry.
We'll take care of him.

273
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,905
I don't have the money or the time.

274
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,867
It's not happening.
I'm taking him to a shelter.

275
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,370
They murderkill dogs there.
You can't take him there.

276
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,788
No, they don't.
Are you kidding me?

277
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,957
A shelter?

278
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,543
They won't even give him three days.

279
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,004
I won't let them hurt him.

280
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,256
Yeah, you will. You don't care.

281
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,009
He's a good boy,
and you won't even give him a chance.

282
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,887
Carter, no, okay?

283
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,513
I'm sorry... I don't...

284
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,891
I can't take care
of one more thing right now.

285
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,469
He's not a thing. He's Benji.

286
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,721
You named him?

287
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,778
I'm so sorry that you can't handle
one more thing right now,

288
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,363
but what about us?

289
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,989
We take care of each other,

290
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,033
so I'm pretty sure
that we can handle a dog.

291
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,870
Maybe he'll make things
fun around here for once.

292
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,790
Oh, I forgot. That's not allowed, either.

293
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,708
Carter, no... That's not fair.

294
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,494
Just leave us alone.

295
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,874
I don't even like that stupid dog.

296
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,104
Carter...

297
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,217
Mom won't let you stay.

298
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,805
You'll wind up in a pound.

299
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,808
Just go.

300
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,811
Go, please.

301
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,866
I love you, Benji.

302
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:53,741
"If your heart believes in dreamin'"

303
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,539
"There's no other place I know"

304
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:08,388
"Well, life here rolls on by
Without a care for tomorrow"

305
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:14,721
"Yeah, that was the life for me
That was the life for me"

306
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:20,393
"How long must I travel
On this journey?"

307
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:26,691
"Guess I'll count a million stars
Along the way"

308
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:33,121
"And every time I start to worry"

309
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,748
"Oh"

310
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,126
"Something whispers in my ear"

311
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:43,332
"Says the words I long to hear"

312
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,627
"Almost home"

313
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,423
"I'm almost home"

314
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,302
"Might be lost and afraid"

315
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,688
"But I'm just a dream away"

316
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,266
"I'm almost home"

317
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:09,366
"Just one more mile
And I'll be home free"

318
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:15,289
"Just one more day
Is all my heart needs"

319
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,083
"I'm gonna get there"

320
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:24,165
"Yeah, I'm gonna get there someday"

321
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,513
"Feel so cold and alone
But I'm..."

322
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:36,928
"I'm almost home"

323
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,851
"Ooh"

324
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,462
Did you not eat lunch again?
I ate lunch.

325
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,214
I don't.

326
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,008
Then how come we're going to Sam's?

327
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,509
To get my money back.

328
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,471
If you get our money back,
how do we get Dad's watch back?

329
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,390
Mom doesn't care.
She wouldn't let us keep Benji.

330
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,101
Why should I care
about getting her the watch back?

331
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,680
Because we're a family.

332
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,314
Whatever.

333
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,150
You're just scared
of somebody else buying it.

334
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,403
I'm not scared. I'm realistic, Frankie.

335
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,530
I told you she wouldn't let us keep him.

336
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,784
You're not real or listic or whatever.
You're just chicken.

337
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,280
You give up at everything
when not very good things happen.

338
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,208
Mr. King, we need to talk.
Hold up.

339
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,169
Hey, you kids, I sold the watch.

340
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,921
You two go on back home now.

341
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,548
Sold the watch.

342
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,884
You sold the watch? That's not right.

343
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,387
Y'all go on now. Go home.

344
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,640
I'm gonna call the police
and tell them you are a lying liar.

345
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,593
You can't sell the watch.

346
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,439
Now, I remember being a kid.

347
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,102
I used to tell my brother there
I was gonna beat him with a baseball bat,

348
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,237
but I didn't really mean it.

349
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,191
When you say
you're gonna go get the police,

350
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,027
that's just you being a kid, right?

351
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,487
Yeah, just talking.

352
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,833
Good, but just in case,
y'all are gonna stick around for a while.

353
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,544
Man, you don't need
to handle kids like that.

354
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,461
Shh.
Let go.

355
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,256
You don't have to do that.
Leave 'em alone!

356
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,133
Open the safe. Fill the bag. Do it.

357
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,635
Not until you let them kids go.
Mr. Pawn Man,

358
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,847
put yourself in the shoes of two fellas
who would come in here wearing

359
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,217
these ridiculous masks.
Do I look like I'm playing?

360
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,810
Open the safe! Hurry up.

361
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,936
Y'all calm down.

362
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,605
Open up the safe, now!
Don't hurt them kids.

363
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,065
Do it, before I hop that counter

364
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,894
and slap the taste out your mouth.
Come on, hurry up!

365
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,279
Speed it up. Come on!

366
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,481
Comin'.

367
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,659
You got what you came for. Now go on.

368
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,785
Tie him up. Let's go.

369
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,287
Move. Come on, back door.

370
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,039
Man, wait.
Tie him up.

371
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,910
Move! The backdoor. Go. Get out.

372
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,878
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

373
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,705
Let us go.

374
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,058
Y'all gonna sit here,
stay quiet for ten minutes,

375
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,939
and then forget any of this ever happened.

376
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,682
If you don't, me and my brother will pay
a little visit to your home. Understand?

377
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,646
Help!
Hurry up.

378
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,482
Over here!
Mr. King!

379
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,568
Frankie, stop!

380
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,248
Get up. Get up.

381
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,868
Help! Help us!
Let us go!

382
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,219
Get in the van.
Carter

383
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,930
Wait. What are you doing?
They saw my face.

384
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,265
Help! Someone, help us!
They kids.

385
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,643
Now they've seen your face, too.
Get in the van.

386
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,769
Please let us go.

387
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,771
We didn't do anything.
Go on. Get in the van.

388
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,015
Please.

389
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,102
Help! Help!

390
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,102
Frankie.

391
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,273
Damn.

392
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,442
Is that your dog?

393
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,703
Easy!

394
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,662
Get out the way!

395
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,116
It's more like saving our butts.

396
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,496
Find the phone, Titus. Hurry up.

397
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,964
Mommy!
Get rid of it.

398
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,085
Get it out the window, idiot.

399
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,310
Please stop.

400
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,721
We in too deep now, brother.
We can't do that.

401
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,849
He's gone.

402
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,862
Stop driving!
We can't stop!

403
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,023
We can stop!
No, we can't!

404
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,836
Syd, where are you taking us?

405
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,915
Don't worry.
I got this covered, I promise.

406
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,384
Why are you so ugly?

407
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,212
Wanna say that again?

408
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,932
Hey! What are you doing back there?

409
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,635
Nothing. It's just my lunch.

410
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,021
What is that?
Do not take your eye off of him.

411
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,850
Don't you never call me ugly. Never!

412
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,024
Whoa!

413
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,747
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

414
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,491
Tie 'em up in that back room.

415
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,338
Hurry up.
Let me go!

416
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,881
Hey.

417
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,636
Double knots. Put the tarp on the van.
They ain't going anywhere.

418
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,481
Give me your hands.

419
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,275
Please.

420
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,250
I'm almost done with my shift,
and I haven't heard from you guys.

421
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,414
I know that you're mad at me,
but you have to tell me where you are.

422
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,085
Look, I'm sorry.

423
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,004
And I love you.

424
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,007
So call me, okay?

425
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,400
What'd you pick this place for?
Gives me the creeps.

426
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,811
So nobody comes sniffing around.

427
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,898
Checking our score.

428
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,868
I mean with them.
I didn't sign up for no kidnapping.

429
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,620
Let me make something real clear to you.

430
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,414
There are people that want money from us,

431
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,935
but we ain't got no money, do we?

432
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,661
So they gonna break
every bone in our body instead.

433
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,663
That what you signed up for?

434
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,126
I don't owe those people nothing.
That's all you.

435
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,964
Who took care of you seven years, huh?

436
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,641
Food, clothes, all that?

437
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,851
I was the one who figured out a way

438
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,180
for us to keep on
even when our own parents wouldn't.

439
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,850
What I owe, you owe.

440
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:56,987
Sell all this, pay off our debt.

441
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,408
Keep them around in case we need
a getoutofjailfree card.

442
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,828
And then what?

443
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,166
And then we no longer need 'em.

444
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,359
She's cold.

445
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,319
So what?

446
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,284
I like this here watch.

447
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,453
A lot.

448
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,921
It actually reminds me
of a watch my daddy had.

449
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,623
Give it back!

450
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,129
Was this the reason
y'all was in the shop today?

451
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,300
"To the man of my dreams.

452
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,012
"I love you more than the moon
and the stars. Love, W." That's nice.

453
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,609
Let me work this here.

454
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,773
Your daddy run off.
Got sick and tired of you, your old mama.

455
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,275
So she sold it. It's good riddance.

456
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,989
But then, y'all want a little
something something to remember him by.

457
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,909
Ain't that right, little man?

458
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,956
Tell me how bad you want it.

459
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,670
Come on. Tell me.

460
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,756
It's yours, ain't it?

461
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,718
You can take it from me.

462
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,018
Take it. Take it.

463
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,021
Yeah.

464
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,398
What you scared of?

465
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,070
You're a little coward, huh?

466
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,158
Just like your old man.

467
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,217
Sic, Rott! Sic him!

468
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,179
We okay?
You, too, dumbo.

469
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,099
Go. Go!

470
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,075
Hey!

471
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,134
Dumb move, dog.

472
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,930
Where are you?

473
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,393
Hey!

474
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,478
Hey!

475
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,356
Help!

476
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,200
Day keeps getting better.

477
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,849
Little doggie.

478
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,152
Where you at, baby boy?

479
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,313
Come out and play.

480
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,532
Little doggie.

481
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,370
Where are you?

482
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,257
I'm gonna skin you alive.

483
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,468
Gonna wipe that stupid grin off your face.

484
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,308
Where you at?

485
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,623
Benji!

486
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,543
Come here, boy. Get this.
Please, get this.

487
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,786
Good boy.

488
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,629
I hate that dog!

489
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,225
Please, Benji, hurry.
It's stuck. He can't get it.

490
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,635
Please, Benji.
Come on!

491
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,188
Oh, I think Rottie smells him.

492
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,203
Get him, Rott.
No!

493
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,663
Run, Benji, run!

494
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,949
Don't hurt him!

495
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,618
Run, Benji!

496
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,792
Help! Get me out of here.

497
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,961
Hey, who is that?

498
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,799
What are you doing in here?

499
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,261
Puppy, bark for me!

500
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,564
Where'd you go, puppy? Come on, puppy.

501
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,142
Where'd you go? I know you're out there.

502
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,397
What are you doing out there?

503
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,317
Come on, puppy. Come on, puppy. Come on.

504
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,530
Hey, puppy, come on back now.

505
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,002
What're you...

506
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,913
Are you trying to get the lock?

507
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:31,801
Come on, puppy, you can do it!
I know you can.

508
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,638
Come on, pup. Don't leave me now.
Don't give up, puppy.

509
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,768
Come on, baby. I know you can do it.
Come on, puppy. You almost got it. Get it.

510
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:44,139
Come on, pup. Come on,
I know you can do it.

511
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,567
Puppy, thank you! You opened the door!

512
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,986
Yes, yes, hey. Good boy.

513
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,481
Wait. Where's Carter and Frankie?

514
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,578
Yes, sir. I'll keep you posted.
Yeah.

515
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,865
Sam King

516
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,916
Detective Lyle Burton. How you doing?

517
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:08,045
Hey. Listen. You got to find the kids.
Trust me, we're gonna find them.

518
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,130
Did you see what the guys look like?

519
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,966
No, they were wearing
I got something.

520
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,211
Okay. Hold on for a second, okay?
What you got

521
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,672
I found it out back.

522
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,689
Lord, Ms. Hughes, I'm so sorry.

523
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,233
Ms. Hughes, I'm Detective Lyle Burton.

524
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:32,403
We're gonna do everything we can

525
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,155
It's the watch.

526
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,573
Your husband's watch.

527
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:39,736
The kids have been coming in
every day almost trying to buy it back.

528
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:47,535
I told them that I sold it. I didn't know
that they'd come in here to...

529
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,154
Hey! What...
Get him. What...

530
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,533
That dog saved me.

531
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,788
He got me out of the dang closet
they locked me in.

532
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,165
We need to follow procedure, okay?

533
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,253
I think he's trying to
tell you something.

534
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,436
Ms. Hughes! Ms. Hughes!

535
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,940
Stay put. Requesting backup.
I got a 212 on foot.

536
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,825
Suspect identification?

537
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:05,329
Uh, brown hair, 35 pounds, four legs.

538
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,956
You wanna repeat that, Burton?

539
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,324
Not especially.

540
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,162
We're parked down there.

541
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,842
Ms. Hughes, let me do my job.

542
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,385
I'm following that dog.

543
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,053
Listen, we'll find them.

544
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,507
We will follow the dog. Just come on.
Fine. Let's go.

545
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,685
Hey, hold up, hold up.
Sam?

546
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,478
About to catch a heart attack.

547
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,431
Get in the car. Let's go!

548
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:01,127
Hey, hey. No, no, no, you wait.
Wait here. I got it.

549
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,342
Must be out of my doggoned mind.

550
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,612
The heck you sniffing around for?

551
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,872
What you got?

552
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,544
What

553
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:49,342
Pudding

554
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,889
Is that why you brought us here?

555
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,602
Okay.

556
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,939
And then you walk off. Great.

00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,720
Stop. Just stop.

559
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,862
No, stop. Just stop!

560
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,991
Do you have any idea
how much time I've wasted?

561
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,195
My kids are...

562
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,366
I don't wanna see you ever again. Go.

563
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,919
Do you hear me? Go!

564
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,282
What the heck were you thinking, Street?
We got procedure, son.

565
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,825
Sir, I know. I got carried away.

566
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:17,573
Ms. Hughes? Here's a cup of jasmine tea.
It manifests good fortune.

567
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,368
Thank you.
You're welcome.

568
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,757
How much money had they saved up?

569
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,676
It doesn't matter.
I should've given them the watch back.

570
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,796
No, I never should have sold it.

571
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,765
I should've done something

572
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:39,721
so they didn't think that buying a watch
would make it all okay.

573
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,598
The honest truth is, Ms. Hughes...

574
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,978
I didn't give the watch back,
'cause I like having 'em come in.

575
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,774
Those two, they got
nothing but love in 'em.

576
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,666
I got something.
It's Carter's.

577
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,243
A traffic cop found it.

578
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,622
No usable prints,
but it's a starting point, locationwise.

579
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,635
Hey, come on. Give me my phone back.

580
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:25,023
Don't eat the rubber ducky.
Give me that back. Good boy. Good boy.

581
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,609
What's his name, anyways?

582
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,355
I don't think he has one.
He's a stray.

583
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,902
Hey, where did you come from, buddy?
Do you need a home?

584
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,322
What are you thinking?
What if Mom finds out?

585
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,533
I'm thinking he's lonely.

586
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,329
What are we gonna name him?

587
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,173
Like there's even a reason
to name him.

588
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:51,000
Mom will never let us keep him.

589
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,713
It's kind of like...

590
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:01,094
when Dad got sick, Mom did, too.

591
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:07,308
I miss Dad,
but I miss Mom even more.

592
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,728

Hear me, boy?

01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,065
We'll get out of here.
I don't wanna go anymore.

615
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,650
Look at my face. See how much I care?

616
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,645
Go on. Come on, Titus. Let's go.

617
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,441
Uh... What are we doing, man?

618
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,742
Listen. I know a guy, all right?

619
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,404
He's gonna buy our score
and take us up river.

620
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,247
I mean, with them.

621
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,491
They're coming with us. Come on.

622
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,493
What are you saying?

623
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,581
Don't worry
your pretty little head about it.

624
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,092
What y'all doing over there?

625
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,301
Nothing.
Nothing.

626
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,712
Nothing.

627
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,967
No, please. No.

628
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,096
No, please, please.
Please. Please.

629
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,266
Let me be real clear...

630
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,688
I don't need but one of y'all to be
my insurance policy. You hear me?

631
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,864
Get goin'. Go on.

01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,087
Ms. Hughes...
I have to go find my kids.

634
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:47,966
Just give me a second.
I can't just sit here any longer.

635
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,385
I have to go.
You have to be rational.

Ms. Hughes! I have a lead.

637
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:56,967
What?

638
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,769
This van. It was stolen two days ago.

639
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,813
Yeah.

640
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,308
It raced out of the quarter
down towards the river.

641
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,902
That's right where the dog was taking us.

642
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,195
It's just a coincidence.

643
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:12,824
Listen, the house was empty.
Maybe you didn't look hard enough.

644
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,785
You're talking as if you think
a dog is smarter than the police.

645
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,287
I'm going back to the house.

646

We need to follow protocol this time!

647
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,866
Detective...

648
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,329
I don't think that dog
was following any kind of protocol.

649
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,082
I think he was following his heart.

650
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:38,600
If anybody ask, I'm following the lead,
all right?

651
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:43,347
Don't you worry. I'm real good
at not telling the police things.
