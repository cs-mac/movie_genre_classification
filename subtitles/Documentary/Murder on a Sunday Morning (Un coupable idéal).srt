1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,671
I don't care whether
you believe it or not

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,800
but this map will lead
you to a hidden treasure

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,135
in the Pacific Ocean.

4
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:08,598
I know, on the
island of Bungo Bungo.

5
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:09,850
On the island of Bungo Bungo.

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,353
It's not even on a map.

7
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:12,605
Neither was Australia once.

8
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,025
If your boat was
read then find it.

9
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,903
It's ready, all
I need is another 2,000

10
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,489
for the last installment.

11
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:18,783
Yeah, the plain ol' horses.

12
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:19,660
Me?

13
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,538
Never.

14
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:23,502
They know
you better than I do.

15
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,297
Look kid, I caught six
tropical diseases guarding

16
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:28,052
that treasure, I'm
telling you it's there.

17
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:29,931
Here's your 2,000 but I want it.

18
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,475
No sweat, Uncle Brady.

19
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:33,731
I'll set sail first
thing tomorrow morning.

20
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,067
Yeah.

21
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,071
At the crack of dawn.

22
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:43,916
There's a treasure
there kid, like .

23
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,213
It's sitting there,
waiting for ya.

24
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,341
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:58,768 --> 00:02:59,603
Hello, Alan.

26
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:00,605
Hi.

27
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,899
You want another drink?

28
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,944
No thanks, I'm broke.

29
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,074
The wheels of luck
aren't getting you, huh?

30
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,995
I'm afraid so.

31
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,208
I mean, I just
dropped 2,000 dollars.

32
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,505
Couldn't care less except
that, it wasn't my money.

33
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,550
You interested in
a little tip from me?

34
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,476
A fixed race, get some money
and put it all on Big Phil.

35
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:22,439
Borrow, do anything, if you
put all your money on Big Phil,

36
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,566
you'll make a fortune.

37
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,028
Big Phil?

38
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,535
Chocolate's the
favorite, he's gonna win.

39
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,247
Alan, they're
hoods from Chicago,

40
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,750
they don't fool around.

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,044
They'll beat up the jockey.

42
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:36,468
They've got their
money on Big Phil.

43
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,762
On Big Phil.

44
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,597
Yeah, thanks Linda.

45
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:40,934
What for?

46
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,896
I didn't tell you anything.

47
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,191
That's right.

48
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,656
Man in Chicago
surely thinks Chocolate

49
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,370
is gonna break a leg, huh?

50
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,290
Yeah, they put a whole
pile of bread on Big Phil.

51
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,591
Instead we got 30,000
simoleons on Chocolate.

52
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,511
Wait, you know what?

53
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,471
What?

54
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,809
Another 15 grand on Chocolate.

55
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,314
But they said he
ain't gonna win, Frisk.

56
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,318
I say the winner's Chocolate.

57
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,867
You can take care of
Big Phil's jockey.

58
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,621
What do those idiot's
know in Chicago?

59
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,207
I'm with you Frisco.

60
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't like taking orders
from guys that don't know.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,006
How are the girls
gonna get to the jockey?

62
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,217
Follow them.

63
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:21,682
Hey, hey.

64
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,937
Hi.

65
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:25,482
What are you
doing here, Grubby?

66
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,821
Still betting your money on
horses that come in last?

67
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,617
No, I'm with a bookie
now, I learned my lesson.

68
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,162
You betting on Chocolate?

69
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:34,749
Naturally, he's a sure thing.

70
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:37,672
15,000 bucks, that
makes 30 grand.

71
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,590
So long.

72
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,467
Hold on.

73
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,934
Chocolate's up for the money

74
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,105
but I know a guy
who's paying double.

75
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,609
So if you place
your bet with him,

76
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:48,987
we can split the difference.

77
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,698
You're boss will never know.

78
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:51,868
Okay, let's go.

79
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,414
Well wait a minute.

80
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,041
I've got to handle this alone.

81
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,961
This bookie wants it on the QT.

82
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,342
You can trust me, right?

83
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,306
Sure, unless you prefer
to die with head bashed in,

84
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,767
huh metal head?

85
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,312
Careful.

86
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,984
Deliver the money to the table.

87
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,911
Nice breakaway.

88
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,123
El Figor takes the lead
followed by Calamity Jane,

89
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:19,422
Ravatin, Chocolate and Big Phil.

90
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,717
Can you imagine
that, giving us double?

91
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:23,094
Two to one on Chocolate.

92
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:25,058
Yeah, okay.

93
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,060
Fantastic.

94
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,230
Okay, here's to our benefactor.

95
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,068
A toast to Chocolate.

96
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,116
As
they come into the last stretch.

97
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,285
Come on boy.

98
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:36,664
Where's Big Phil?

99
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,127
I put a lot of money on him.

100
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,505
Well Big Phil is back there.

101
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:41,800
He's the last one.

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,221
Come on, get with it
Chocolate, come on.

103
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:45,098
Come on!

104
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:57,371
Winner,
fourth race, Chocolate.

105
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:03,175
There he is, go get him.

106
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:04,052
Move it.

107
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:11,023
Uncle Brady, open.

108
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:13,737
Hey Brady.

109
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,244
Uncle Brady, come here.

110
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,457
Come on, wake up.

111
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,417
Good news.

112
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,711
Oh it's you.

113
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,005
I'm ready to move out

114
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,800
but you gotta finance me.

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,346
50,000.

116
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,890
And of course, you're mad
but I'll pay you back,

117
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,809
what's a matter?

118
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,895
Don't you trust me?

119
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:30,813
Trust you?

120
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:31,690
Exactly.

121
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,485
I don't trust anybody.

122
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,030
Least of all, you.

123
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,079
Don't come back
without any money.

124
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,873
Uncle Brady, wake up.

125
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,797
Everything's set, you
can't pull out now, right?

126
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:44,632
Yeah.

127
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,514
Hi.

128
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:51,311
What did you do with
the 15,000 dollars?

129
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,563
The what?

130
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,360
What are you
deaf or something?

131
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,114
The 15,000 dollars.

132
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:56,990
15,000.

133
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,119
What do you want?

134
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,414
Who are you?

135
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:03,585
Don't play games
with us, buddy.

136
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:06,298
Now I get it,
you think I'm Alan.

137
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:08,847
No, I'm Johnny,
his twin brother.

138
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:10,141
Oh really?

139
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,645
Really, this
happens all the time.

140
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,149
It's a cross I have to bear.

141
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,528
Don't worry, we'll
just put your little name

142
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,490
on your brother's tomb.

143
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:32,393
No wait a minute,
no wait, no wait.

144
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,596
Listen boy, this don't
look too good for you.

145
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,766
Take this here and go.

146
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,353
I already had breakfast.

147
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,231
No, the map's inside.

148
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:59,446
Take it and get the
hell out of here.

149
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,202
Gee, there's a lot of water.

150
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:03,287
I need a boat.

151
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,873
You need a boat?

152
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,129
I was only kidding.

153
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,548
I've got a great boat.

154
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:09,550
Don't lose the map.

155
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,220
Don't worry.

156
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,143
There really is a treasure.

157
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,161
Come on, keep
your eyes on him.

158
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,329
You see him, you see him?

159
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,206
No.

160
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,647
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great honor

161
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:02,697
and privilege to present to
you, Mr. Charlie O'Brien.

162
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,331
Get out of the way.

163
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:10,545
Do you think you can
make it around the world?

164
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,507
Well of course I can,
thanks to delicious,

165
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:15,012
homemade marmalade
by Puffin Brothers.

166
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,434
Not to mention the
20,000 dollars prize money

167
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,272
they'll pay you if you make it.

168
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:21,734
There's a lot energy and
vigor in Puffin marmalade

169
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,989
but you mean, they
don't pay you?

170
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,035
Charlie O'Brien,
you're something else.

171
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,373
Seriously though, how do you
feel about sailing around

172
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,210
the earth all by yourself?

173
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,880
What do you think you'll
miss most after days

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,676
and days out at sea
without ever sighting land.

175
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:36,930
With a bottle Puffys
sister, I can circumnavigate

176
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,475
the whole wide world.

177
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:40,313
Well you won't really be
sailing all this time alone.

178
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,402
Ladies and gentlemen, a
beautiful parrot, Paquito,

179
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:45,698
will be going along too.

180
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,621
Does Paquito enjoy
Puffin's Marmalade also?

181
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,166
Why you asking
the little critter?

182
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,715
Paquito do you also
enjoy Puffin's Marmalade?

183
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,096
Marmalade man, marmalade man.

184
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,410
Go Charlie, happy sailing.

185
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:06,399
Marmalade men, marmalade men.

186
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,820
Jam overboard.

187
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,997
Marmalade overboard.

188
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:22,265
Puffin overboard.

189
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,396
Marmalade men.

190
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:29,028
Shut up or I'll jam this
marmalade, you know where.

191
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,014
Another two minutes
and they're done.

192
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:48,692
Don't you stretch your neck
on my beams, you understand?

193
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:20,755
Huh, they're finished?

194
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,472
How is it possible?

195
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:27,395
You parrot or a
winged rhinoceros.

196
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,899
Hey buddy, look me in the
eye when I talk to you.

197
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,318
Marmalade mate.

198
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,450
Your going in this frying pan.

199
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,497
I'll pluck every
feather in your body.

200
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,584
You'll be a bald parrot.

201
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:17,863
Waba, waba.

202
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,411
Waba don't allow
no bean stealer.

203
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:24,292
Paquito's a liar, there
isn't a brick for you.

204
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:36,024
Hey
Charlie, Charlie come on out.

205
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:41,784
How you doing, boy?

206
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,664
How's it going you old buffalo?

207
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:47,505
I saw you knock your
sponsor overboard, huh?

208
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:51,847
Hey Charlie, when you gonna
quite saying solitary?

209
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,516
When I
get a bigger boat.

210
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,145
There's never enough room.

211
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,441
There
never will be with you,

212
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,154
old boy.

213
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,865
Need anything, Charlie?

214
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:04,372
No just come around and
pay me a visit if you can.

215
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:06,166
Okay Charlie.

216
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,878
How's your radio?

217
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,549
Everything's ship shape.

218
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,970
Loud and clear all around.

219
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,310
Okay,
over and out, sea bird.

220
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,187
Roger.

221
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:59,020
Well then Paquito,
the thief ain't you.

222
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:04,825
There's a, some bean
eating thief here.

223
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,828
Alright, where are you?

224
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,254
Parasitical skunk, I'll
make you eat your own liver.

225
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,382
Where the hell are you?

226
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:14,553
Come on out, let's go.

227
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,180
Your punishment is
gonna be commensurate

228
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,603
with the time you
keep yourself hidden.

229
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,676
Go on, hide you sewer rat.

230
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:58,305
I'll find you sooner or later.

231
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:00,434
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,193
Okay, Paquito, this
steak's big enough

233
00:17:04,193 --> 00:17:06,281
to choke a draft horse.

234
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:09,202
Looks more like a shank
of hippopotamus to me.

235
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:12,417
Let's slap down over
here for a little air.

236
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,545
A perfidious thief
might be attracted

237
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:17,302
by a mammoth overgrown
beef steak, right?

238
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,470
Right.

239
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,015
Good bird.

240
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,564
Okay, now I'll fake being
distracted and play the radio.

241
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,441
Up yours.

242
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:25,818
Yeah up yours too.

243
00:17:25,818 --> 00:17:27,572
Here we go.

244
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,326
Hallelujah.

245
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,413
Sailing Puffin to Coast Guard.

246
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:33,834
Puffin to Coast Guard, over.

247
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:36,590
Coast Guard
to Puffin, what's up Charlie,

248
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,925
over.

249
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:39,595
Ain't nothing in
particular, just calling

250
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,477
to say that I'm hooked
and know that is

251
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,941
the bait that's found it's mate.

252
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,194
We
don't dig you Charlie,

253
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,406
you say the bait
has found it's mate?

254
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,327
Yeah more or less.

255
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,621
We're not authorized

256
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,668
to take coded messages
from private sailing.

257
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,755
Sorry, you'll have to .

258
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,511
It's already clear to deck
and the fish is jumping,

259
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,263
roger, over and out.

260
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,357
Okay parasite.

261
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:14,999
Yeah, here we go.

262
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,431
Well, a stowaway, huh?

263
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,433
Hi.

264
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,810
The name's Alan.

265
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,361
No, no, look.

266
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,988
There's a reason for everything.

267
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,953
And I came here to tell
you how it happened.

268
00:18:33,953 --> 00:18:35,247
Get down.

269
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,207
I as running away
from these hoods,

270
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:37,251
they were out for blood.

271
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,545
So am I.

272
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:39,464
They thought I
was somebody else.

273
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,716
Yeah.

274
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:42,053
And your boat
was my last chance.

275
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,722
The only place to hide.

276
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,683
Miserable.

277
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:46,645
Wait, I listen, if you like,

278
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:48,148
I can pay my way.

279
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,320
Pay your way?

280
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,906
A boot in the pants.

281
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,536
No, can't we talk this over.

282
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:02,301
Careful, it's cold.

283
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:04,305
Hey wait, get me out.

284
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:07,102
It's criminal, you
can't leave me here.

285
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh yeah, well I
couldn't care less

286
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,319
and nobody's gonna
bother anyhow.

287
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:13,615
Criminal!

288
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:16,621
You'll be sorry.

289
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:19,752
This guy's death is gonna
be on your conscience.

290
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:20,628
Forever.

291
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,595
Oh no.

292
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,733
Hey, company, three o'clock.

293
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,567
Huh?

294
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,448
That's even
more criminal than me.

295
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:35,325
Holy.

296
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:56,784
You on?

297
00:19:56,784 --> 00:19:57,619
Yeah.

298
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,546
Almost as big as
you are, Captain.

299
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,220
You're
authorized to drop him

300
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,182
off on Rabbit Island, Charlie.

301
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:09,768
Okay, roger out.

302
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:14,361
That's it.

303
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:19,579
I'll put you there with the
other rabbit's and fly away.

304
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,503
I hope you know, you're
gonna have to give me bread

305
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:26,218
and water supply, for
30 days, that's rough.

306
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:28,472
You'll have to do without.

307
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:38,993
Here.

308
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,128
Here.

309
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,340
That's hard.

310
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,332
We're under regulations.

311
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,670
If I wanted to, I could've
dumped you overboard

312
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,257
like rotten fish.

313
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:10,179
No look, I feel,
I didn't get dumped.

314
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,183
Besides, you saved me.

315
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,103
Which attenuates the blame.

316
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,777
Instead of a stowaway, I'm
the one who was shipwrecked.

317
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,279
It's that simple.

318
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:23,873
Okay, stowaway or shipwrecked
makes no difference.

319
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,460
Gotta clean the
galley, the decks,

320
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,297
the dolehouse, the brass
and keep the ship on course

321
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,510
and check the sails.

322
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,971
Navigating is not allowed.

323
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,933
I mean, a stowaway
can't navigate.

324
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,145
Right, but you're shipwrecked,
get your ass over here

325
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,731
and start cleaning.

326
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,068
Snap to it, sailor.

327
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,364
The blanket is mine, I'm
getting some shut eye.

328
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:42,244
Aye, aye, sir.

329
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:43,621
Do we stay on this course?

330
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:44,498
Yeah.

331
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:45,584
And wake me up at five.

332
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:52,179
Only if you should sight
a flying whale.

333
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,056
Yes sir.

334
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,173
O'Brien, I'm sailor Puffin.

335
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,386
Atmosphere condition
don't coincide

336
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:38,890
with latest weather bulletin.

337
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,900
Puffin to California two,
come in please, over.

338
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,950
Come in California
two, over.

339
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,871
California two, califor,

340
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:51,124
what are you.

341
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:52,710
The clouds are
better than the radio.

342
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,007
I mean, it looks like a storm.

343
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,511
I'll decide who's to
look at the clouds or not.

344
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,724
You just do as I tell you.

345
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:06,278
Come in California, California
two to Puffin, come in.

346
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:21,851
Something wrong, Captain?

347
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:25,483
No, it's just that
the radio doesn't work

348
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:28,030
and suddenly we have trees
sprouting in the ocean.

349
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,743
Nah, looks like a wave to me.

350
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:32,747
Get me the binoculars.

351
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,209
The what?

352
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:35,711
The binoculars.

353
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:37,214
Oh like field glasses?

354
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,091
Uh huh.

355
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:43,185
The...

356
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:47,318
Here you go, catch.

357
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,833
You lost your
binoculars, Captain.

358
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,460
I lost 'em, yeah.

359
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,646
A pair of binoculars
ain't required to tell me

360
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,650
that that there is an island.

361
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,320
It just might be a mirage.

362
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,238
What mirage?

363
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:11,198
You see it too.

364
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:14,329
It's an island with trees on it.

365
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,417
Oh yeah, I can see it now.

366
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,920
It's an island.

367
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,010
Hey, you sure can see
without binoculars, Captain.

368
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,681
The only trouble
is, it ain't booked.

369
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:25,602
There's only water.

370
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:29,233
In a radius of over 200
miles, ain't one island.

371
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,948
You know what, maybe
the wind's were favorable

372
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,869
and that is Rabbit Island.

373
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,040
Yeah, alright, shut up.

374
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,586
Course is right.

375
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:40,381
Yet there's land there
when it says here

376
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:43,262
there shouldn't be land.

377
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:47,269
So it's either the compass
or me that's crazy.

378
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:49,398
But if it's what I think it is,

379
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,069
stowaway, you better
start praying.

380
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,530
Can I be fixed?

381
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,126
Oh no.

382
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,220
Huh, that's not
good for the compass.

383
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:07,059
How many prayers do you know?

384
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:09,480
Well there's
the Lord's prayer,

385
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,609
the hail Mary,
act of contrition.

386
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,115
No, don't do something
you may regret.

387
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,117
First I know.

388
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:16,244
I was shipwrecked.

389
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:18,582
We'll see if I regret it.

390
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:22,423
Come back here.

391
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:25,471
Listen Captain,
let's talk this over.

392
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:27,141
I have something
important to tell you.

393
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,228
It could change your life.

394
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,107
Captain change your life.

395
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,657
Now wait, I'm serious.

396
00:26:35,657 --> 00:26:38,037
What's ducking huh?

397
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,333
A shipwrecked person
must be turned over

398
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,586
to the authorities.

399
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,589
I'm turning you
over to the sharks.

400
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:46,387
Shipwreck or stowaway makes
no difference to them.

401
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,475
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

402
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:54,529
My boat.

403
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,329
That's it Captain,
you can make it.

404
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,712
You're almost there, keep going.

405
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:08,722
Forget it Captain, that's life.

406
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:10,268
Thanks a lot.

407
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:14,109
Our only chance is
that island, follow me.

408
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:14,304
Charlie, I mean
Captain, I'm sorry.

409
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:15,181
Captain.

410
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,486
I've gotta tell you
the truth about why

411
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:23,992
I ended up on your boat.

412
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:25,577
Come closer?

413
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,038
Okay.

414
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,252
As I was saying.

415
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:30,462
Closer, yeah?

416
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:31,339
Okay.

417
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:33,259
Hold on.

418
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:37,142
I'm sorry about the compass.

419
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,732
I goosed it, you're right.

420
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:43,362
And it's my fault
if we ended up here.

421
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,868
But I had a real good reason.

422
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,041
See this island?

423
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,335
It's deserted.

424
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,007
And you can't find
it on any map.

425
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:53,884
Understand?

426
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:55,219
I sure do, you weasel.

427
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,305
Hold it.

428
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:57,141
Come here.

429
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,059
Relax.

430
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,102
Relax?

431
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:00,730
I lost a boat in
a contract I had

432
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,567
with the marmalade company,

433
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,738
only to end up on a deserted
island with a sneaky side

434
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:06,324
of a side wind up.

435
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:07,702
Easy, easy.

436
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:10,124
No not the coconut, you
wouldn't use it anyway.

437
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,045
You're too nice a guy.

438
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,672
There ain't nobody around here

439
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:16,637
with loathing and
pure hatred than me.

440
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,182
Miserable parasite.

441
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:19,851
Hey cool it.

442
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,647
You left the steer in gear.

443
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:23,734
That's why you lost your boat.

444
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,155
I should of let shark in.

445
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,284
Now how will we
get back once we find

446
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,830
the treasure, huh?

447
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:34,840
Treasure?

448
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,218
How'd you know?

449
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,514
A hidden treasure.

450
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:41,437
And it's worth
millions of dollars.

451
00:30:41,437 --> 00:30:42,772
On this island.

452
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:44,651
You mean it's true?

453
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,195
Look, I'll prove it.

454
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:48,616
This here is my uncle's map.

455
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,916
He's got meningitis
and the French curse,

456
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,589
otherwise he'd be here himself.

457
00:30:57,258 --> 00:31:01,017
And I'm supposed to believe
in a treasure map drawn

458
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:05,609
by your uncle who's got
the curse and meningitis?

459
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,742
No, calm down,
Charlie, I mean, Captain.

460
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,704
Okay, okay, I'm calm.

461
00:31:13,124 --> 00:31:15,754
Calm down, let's get our wits.

462
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:18,635
We've been cast
on a desert island

463
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:19,970
and if I don't kill
you, it's only because

464
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,519
I might have to do
it later for food.

465
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,607
Now I'll go here
and you go there

466
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,611
and if this island
ain't no fairy tale,

467
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,740
we'll meet up on the other side.

468
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,909
Otherwise, we'll
never meet again

469
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:32,788
which is my fondest hope.

470
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,374
I got it.

471
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:37,421
You miserable
coniving galleywag.

472
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:26,721
Get out of here.

473
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,437
Where'd he find that gun?

474
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,920
He found a gun.

475
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:28,385
Hey Captain, are you crazy?

476
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:53,978
You sneaky, you were out
to kill me, weren't you?

477
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:56,065
You're the one who
started shooting.

478
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,192
Where'd you find that gun?

479
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:59,029
I don't have a gun.

480
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:01,326
Don't have a gun.

481
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:03,246
There's only two of
us on the island.

482
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,623
Alright, where's that gun?

483
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:05,918
Don't you understand.

484
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:07,087
There's somebody
else who's looking

485
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,464
for the treasure.

486
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,773
They're onto you, Charlie.

487
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:19,194
They're not aiming at me.

488
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,740
We better get out of here.

489
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,077
Uh huh, the shots
come from the west

490
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,288
so we go east.

491
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,670
Hey, that's south, not east.

492
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,717
You're looking
at it upside down.

493
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:34,057
Charlie.

494
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:36,102
Hey Charlie.

495
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:41,280
Shouldn't we stick
together from now on?

496
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,624
As much as the
idea is obnoxious,

497
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:49,338
I'm afraid it makes
pretty good sense.

498
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:52,052
Yeah, okay, let's
move out of here.

499
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:54,263
Hey, I'm giving the orders.

500
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:55,642
Give the orders.

501
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:56,769
Let's move out of here.

502
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,021
To the east?

503
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:58,898
Yeah.

504
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:04,409
If somebody's shooting at us,

505
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,372
it means the treasure's
here, Charlie.

506
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,541
Old Brady was right.

507
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,751
Who'd you say old Brady was?

508
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:09,962
My uncle.

509
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,882
Oh great, it
runs in the family.

510
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:13,385
Look, I'm sorry
about the boat.

511
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:14,262
And my parrot.

512
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:15,597
And your parrot.

513
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:17,310
And the marmalade contract.

514
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,521
Yeah.

515
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:20,232
But I've got
Brady's map and that's

516
00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:22,445
the answer to our
troubles, Charlie.

517
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,239
You're getting on my nerves.

518
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,784
Stick with me Charlie boy,

519
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,287
I'll lead you to a
treasure that'll make

520
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,832
you go down in history.

521
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:34,010
Charlie?

522
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,012
Charlie?

523
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:36,931
Hey Charlie, where are you?

524
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,560
Shut up will you?

525
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:44,615
Telling me I'll go
down in history.

526
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:46,826
Well how did you
get down there?

527
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,623
Wasn't an idiot.

528
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:51,418
I'd like to know why
anybody would build

529
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,424
an underground deep hole in
the middle of the jungle.

530
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:56,429
To hide the treasure.

531
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:01,648
Oh yeah, well your uncle
Brady forgot his helmet.

532
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,113
And yet, you know,
according to Brady's map,

533
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:06,825
this might be the place.

534
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,245
Uh huh, this is military.

535
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:10,915
US Army came through here.

536
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,210
Lookie here.

537
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,758
Uniforms, equipment,
miskits, cigarettes.

538
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:21,896
Without filters.

539
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,403
Hey, this outta be good.

540
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:27,157
What outta be good?

541
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:29,494
Well, this says,
only Puffin can give

542
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:31,707
you energy, strength and health.

543
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,542
Want some?

544
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,839
Chuck it out.

545
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:35,841
Why?

546
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:37,802
Move that outta here.

547
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:39,723
Oh, I forgot, sorry.

548
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:45,275
Let's take a look
down there and see where

549
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,945
it leads to.

550
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,240
Are you still going east?

551
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,116
Shut up.

552
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:54,251
Looks like a door.

553
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:55,128
A door.

554
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,221
Me first?

555
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,681
Yeah.

556
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:01,557
Okay.

557
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:11,662
Hey Charlie.

558
00:38:11,662 --> 00:38:12,539
Huh?

559
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,498
We got visitors.

560
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:14,918
They American?

561
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,045
Uh, Aliens.

562
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:19,635
Requires diplomacy.

563
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:45,311
Hi.

564
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:09,317
To me they look like
a bunch of jubonies.

565
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:10,152
Hey.

566
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:13,367
Come on.

567
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,060
What's that he said?

568
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,605
Either he talks or you talk.

569
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,742
Invadoors?

570
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:36,705
I don't understand why
you pick out one word.

571
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:40,922
No speak, you no
speak, I speak, silence.

572
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,301
You two invader, invader.

573
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:44,971
Oh, we're invaders.

574
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:46,056
Oh.

575
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,642
But who is he?

576
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:50,105
Anulu, skit Mama.

577
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:51,734
Oh us two have a mama.

578
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,407
No Anulu's not Mama,
Mama's the queen.

579
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:56,995
Queen of island, Bongo Bongo.

580
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,539
Your prisoner, come out.

581
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:00,627
Come out prisoner.

582
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:03,132
Oh he's saying
we're his prisoners.

583
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,010
Yeah, okay, we're prisoners.

584
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:18,204
They coming, they
coming, they coming.

585
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,973
Oh he's like his poor
father, he's war-like.

586
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,267
He like war.

587
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:13,188
But you look friendly.

588
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:16,319
You're my guest.

589
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,406
And my daughter's guest.

590
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:32,308
Yeah.

591
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:35,315
Your highness, madam,

592
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:36,734
I imagine you're the queen.

593
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:38,028
Oh what do you
know, you imagine.

594
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,282
Yes and my name is Mama.

595
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,288
You're American.

596
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:45,209
How you reach Bongo Bongo?

597
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,921
Oh well that's a long story.

598
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,176
The captain went off
course and perhaps

599
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:52,055
I better not bring
the matter up.

600
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,228
We almost got a bullet
in the head as soon

601
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,482
as we set foot on the island.

602
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,445
We don't shoot.

603
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:00,531
We got no guns.

604
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,201
We peaceful people.

605
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:04,414
Unless.

606
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:05,708
Unless what?

607
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:09,215
Kamasuka, the
Japanese soldier.

608
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:11,260
American and Japanese fight war.

609
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,140
Then one day, all Americans go

610
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,772
but one Japanese
still fight war.

611
00:42:16,772 --> 00:42:18,441
He lives in fort.

612
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,113
And no one ever bothered
to tell him the war was over?

613
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:22,616
He don't believe it.

614
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:26,750
But he don't bother us,
we don't bother him.

615
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,294
Where you going?

616
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,014
What are you doing?

617
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:37,354
May I ask you a
personal question

618
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,985
just out of
scientific curiosity?

619
00:42:39,985 --> 00:42:41,196
Tell me boy.

620
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:44,868
Could you tell me if
there's been any talk

621
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:47,248
about hidden treasure
on this island?

622
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,795
No treasure on Bongo Bongo.

623
00:42:49,795 --> 00:42:51,549
Nothing hidden here.

624
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,346
Satisfied knucklehead?

625
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:55,975
There ain't no hidden treasure.

626
00:42:55,975 --> 00:42:57,894
So let's knock it off.

627
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,192
This is our
treasure, Bongo Bongo.

628
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:03,949
Full of happiness, joy and love.

629
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:24,155
I'm very sorry but
witch doctor war-like too.

630
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:25,992
I nothing can do.

631
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:28,748
Ancient tribal custom.

632
00:43:28,748 --> 00:43:32,963
Tribe only excepts stranger
if they win test of strength.

633
00:43:32,963 --> 00:43:35,427
Well who is we
supposed to beat?

634
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:37,306
Fight chief of tribe.

635
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,644
I would never do that.

636
00:43:39,644 --> 00:43:42,358
Go and test my strength
against you, Queen Mama.

637
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,568
Not me, him.

638
00:44:57,089 --> 00:44:59,511
May I have a word, please?

639
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:07,694
He says that, the fat man
there, that you couldn't beat

640
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:10,199
your way out of a grapefruit.

641
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:14,456
Him.

642
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:24,936
He's saying he'd like
to take you on first.

643
00:45:26,063 --> 00:45:26,898
Uh huh.

644
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:57,744
What's going on?

645
00:46:57,744 --> 00:47:00,708
Bad men, pirates from Barcuda.

646
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,754
They make slave
labor of our people.

647
00:47:02,754 --> 00:47:05,844
They come and steal
boys and girls.

648
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:08,391
They'd steal two
beggars like you two.

649
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:09,936
Go, quick, quick, run.

650
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:11,522
Save yourself.

651
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:13,359
Okay, remember
boys, only beautiful chicks

652
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,029
and macho men.

653
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:16,950
I'll choose the men.

654
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,708
I don't want no
rejects this time, understand?

655
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,671
I'm
choosing the girls.

656
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,760
Who's
choosing the girls?

657
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,390
I'm
choosing the girls.

658
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,439
He's
choosing the girls.

659
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:54,231
Where'd they gone, huh?

660
00:47:55,192 --> 00:47:57,196
They're here.

661
00:47:57,196 --> 00:47:58,699
Where they gone, idiot?

662
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:02,081
How come there ain't
a chick in sight?

663
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,085
You got a point there, huh?

664
00:48:04,085 --> 00:48:06,047
Take a look in the huts.

665
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,592
Okay, get on with it.

666
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:08,886
Onto the women.

667
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,778
Shame on you.

668
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,701
Get the witch
doctor .

669
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,599
Okay, dog, let me
hear you repeat that.

670
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:38,402
Oh yeah?

671
00:48:48,548 --> 00:48:52,305
What's that groove
you got playing there?

672
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:12,220
This is our gig.

673
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,061
I'm gonna have to tell
these sods, zackatom.

674
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,406
Zackatom.

675
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:25,204
Hey, try with both.

676
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:26,081
Zackatom.

677
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:28,293
Zackatom.

678
00:49:39,357 --> 00:49:40,943
Let me help you,
I'll show you.

679
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:43,072
With both feet, zackatom.

680
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:54,005
Zackatom, zackatom,
zackatom, zackatom.

681
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:03,648
I'm gonna tell Mama you
break, sword got no point.

682
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:12,582
Okay jellyfish.

683
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,103
Zackatom, to you.

684
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,879
Hey boss.

685
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:18,756
Don't touch me.

686
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:19,883
It's me, it's me.

687
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:20,760
Let's go.

688
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,557
Let's get out of here.

689
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:33,743
Come on hurry.

690
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,600
We come back next
time, we'll show you.

691
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,087
This could be the spot.

692
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:22,381
So could
the whole island.

693
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:25,179
We've covered it six
times in two days.

694
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,517
Don't you know when to quit?

695
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:30,774
Listen Charlie,
according to Uncle Brady's map,

696
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,779
the treasure should be
somewhere along the line drawn

697
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:36,826
from shore to shore,
indicating a spot

698
00:53:36,826 --> 00:53:40,460
with 11 coconut palms
and two midget palms.

699
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,712
So what do we do?

700
00:53:41,712 --> 00:53:43,340
Draw up a map of
palm tree clusters?

701
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,216
Why not?

702
00:53:44,216 --> 00:53:45,552
There aren't that many.

703
00:53:45,552 --> 00:53:47,263
11 palms,
you gotta be kidding.

704
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:48,683
The only thing we
can do with 11 palms

705
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,231
is make a raft and
clear out of here.

706
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,276
You know what
you're trouble is?

707
00:53:53,276 --> 00:53:54,946
You've got no faith.

708
00:53:54,946 --> 00:53:56,282
Oh sure.

709
00:53:56,282 --> 00:53:57,701
Maybe we'll run into a
sign that says there's

710
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,914
a treasure here.

711
00:53:59,914 --> 00:54:01,041
Why not?

712
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,419
It could happen.

713
00:54:11,103 --> 00:54:13,190
Doesn't seem like the
rain is gonna let up.

714
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,860
Don't you think we
outta take a break?

715
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,238
Take advantage you mean.

716
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:18,952
The rain makes digging easier.

717
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:20,455
You gotta have faith.

718
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:21,875
Right, Anulu?

719
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:24,379
Good job, fast, shove, shove.

720
00:54:24,379 --> 00:54:25,465
Shut up.

721
00:54:25,465 --> 00:54:27,093
Shut up, shut up.

722
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:41,413
Hey, I found it.

723
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:42,665
I found it.

724
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:44,669
Look, look, I found it.

725
00:54:46,757 --> 00:54:47,759
I found it.

726
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:55,984
You found a tombstone
that sank in the mud.

727
00:54:55,984 --> 00:54:57,487
See what it says.

728
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:00,659
Oh it's voodoo, voodoo.

729
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:03,331
Cut that out, Anulu.

730
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:07,172
Here lies Jonathan
Foster who searched

731
00:55:07,172 --> 00:55:10,805
for treasure with Brian
Culpepper and died,

732
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:12,182
March 16th 1950.

733
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,690
You see what happens to you
when you search for treasure

734
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,401
that doesn't exist?

735
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,158
Yeah but, this proves
there are other people

736
00:55:20,158 --> 00:55:22,495
who believe the treasure exits.

737
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:23,831
Just because Foster died,

738
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:25,917
that doesn't mean
Culpepper died too.

739
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:34,268
Hm, Brian Culpepper,
died March 17th, 1950.

740
00:55:36,689 --> 00:55:38,943
He went the very next day.

741
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:42,618
Anulu.

742
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:44,456
Catch.

743
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:48,964
You know what?

744
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:50,508
I prefer the rain.

745
00:55:53,805 --> 00:55:55,935
When it rains,
it's too wet for you.

746
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,399
When the sun shines,
it's too hot for you.

747
00:55:58,399 --> 00:55:59,818
Come on Charlie.

748
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:02,156
It's not that easy to
find a buried treasure.

749
00:56:02,156 --> 00:56:04,285
Yeah, dumb suckers
like you though

750
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:06,373
are pretty easy to find.

751
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:09,587
Keep digging.

752
00:56:09,587 --> 00:56:11,634
We're close, I can feel it.

753
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,429
Have faith.

754
00:56:17,395 --> 00:56:19,273
Get down Anulu.

755
00:56:19,273 --> 00:56:20,943
He ain't
shooting at him.

756
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:24,450
I told you not to go
by the fort, Captain.

757
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,623
Japanese no like, he shoot.

758
00:56:27,623 --> 00:56:29,043
How much ammo does he have?

759
00:56:29,043 --> 00:56:30,588
Oh, very much ammo.

760
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:31,798
Japanese ammo.

761
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:37,184
We're in trouble.

762
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:39,314
Boom, boom.

763
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:42,193
Get down boy, he might
just take a pot shot at you.

764
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,364
Anulu know, Anulu know.

765
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:49,417
According to my
uncle's map here,

766
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:52,465
you know where the treasure is?

767
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:54,636
It's right under the
fort with Kamikaze.

768
00:56:54,636 --> 00:56:56,221
His name is Kamasuka.

769
00:56:56,221 --> 00:56:57,432
Anyway, I'm not interested.

770
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:59,519
It's all yours.

771
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:00,941
You mean you're quitting?

772
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:02,652
Now that we're so close?

773
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,906
I thought you were made
of better stuff, Charlie.

774
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:06,785
Yeah, I ain't
particularly fond

775
00:57:06,785 --> 00:57:09,539
of a bullet in the head.

776
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:12,462
Poor guy still thinks
the war is going on.

777
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,842
I'm not about to disturb
somebody who's been hating us

778
00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:16,470
for 30 years or more.

779
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,017
Couldn't we just say
that the war is over?

780
00:57:19,017 --> 00:57:21,522
He'd probably kill us,

781
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,567
talking to a guy who
peppers you with bullets

782
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:25,238
is plain suicide.

783
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:27,910
I know way to reach Kamasuka.

784
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:33,295
You save us from pirates, we
give you war car with cannon.

785
00:57:57,802 --> 00:57:59,054
It's good banana.

786
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:00,599
Yeah, great.

787
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:01,559
Where is he taking us?

788
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,145
How should I know?

789
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:04,775
He keeps talking
about bananas.

790
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:06,820
Relax, Charlie.

791
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:32,621
Look here, a Japanese tank.

792
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:36,796
There's no way
Kamasuka can stop us now.

793
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:38,298
Oh yeah?

794
00:58:38,298 --> 00:58:40,219
And who's gonna get
this tin can running?

795
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,806
That's not the
problem, Charlie.

796
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:43,309
Who knows how to drive it?

797
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:45,857
That's the easy part.

798
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:48,194
Get inside and do as I tell you.

799
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:49,071
Aye, aye sir.

800
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:50,030
Shut up.

801
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,202
Yeah, that's
called Tango boys.

802
00:58:53,202 --> 00:58:55,041
No Tango, Kamasuka.

803
00:58:57,755 --> 00:58:59,591
Will you shut up?

804
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:01,011
How's it look in there?

805
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:02,263
Huh?

806
00:59:02,263 --> 00:59:03,724
The steering wheel's gone.

807
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:06,855
It's not a
wheel, there's sticks.

808
00:59:06,855 --> 00:59:08,234
Oh yeah, here they are.

809
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:10,029
Let's hope the jets
haven't fizzled out,

810
00:59:10,029 --> 00:59:11,616
otherwise we'll never make it.

811
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,993
How can
a jet be in here?

812
00:59:12,993 --> 00:59:14,370
Is the gyropin in there?

813
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,207
What's a gyropin?

814
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:17,919
It's a crank
to turn the motor over,

815
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:18,962
knucklehead.

816
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:22,678
Couldn't you say crank?

817
00:59:22,678 --> 00:59:25,016
No, it's gotta be
called by it's right name.

818
00:59:25,016 --> 00:59:26,018
Anulu?

819
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:26,853
That's me.

820
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:28,816
Yeah, take this.

821
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:29,818
For Anulu.

822
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,863
Get going.

823
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:34,244
Ready now?

824
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:37,918
You in the drivers seat?

825
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:39,045
I'm sitting in it.

826
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:39,921
Now what.

827
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:42,717
Open up the fuel line.

828
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:45,013
Where is it?

829
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:46,142
Okay, okay.

830
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,983
Everything is
written in Japanese, Charlie.

831
00:59:49,983 --> 00:59:50,860
Yeah.

832
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:54,658
You ready?

833
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:55,702
For what?

834
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:07,099
Take your foot off the brake.

835
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:17,866
Good thing it ran out of gas.

836
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:19,410
It just wouldn't stop.

837
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,955
You could've
tried putting your foot back

838
01:01:20,955 --> 01:01:22,041
on the brake.

839
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:23,334
Ah, you drive.

840
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:24,544
I intend to.

841
01:01:24,544 --> 01:01:26,131
That's enough Anulu.

842
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:27,133
We're at war now.

843
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:28,428
See my war hat.

844
01:01:28,428 --> 01:01:30,432
Patton, General Patton.

845
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:37,195
Hey, get over there.

846
01:01:38,697 --> 01:01:40,953
Okay, Captain,
you give the orders.

847
01:01:40,953 --> 01:01:41,996
You're the boss.

848
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:42,831
Yeah.

849
01:01:44,252 --> 01:01:46,339
This here's a cannon.

850
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:49,218
What do you know, I
thought it was the horn.

851
01:01:49,218 --> 01:01:50,470
These start the engines.

852
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,514
One and two.

853
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:54,271
Okay.

854
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:01,493
Well, okay.

855
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:06,128
War, General Patton, war.

856
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,007
Oh.

857
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:29,340
Anulu, Anulu,
open, open, open.

858
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,102
Hey, Anulu's on
top of the tank.

859
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:36,688
He wants us to open up.

860
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:38,400
We got to right,
we got to right.

861
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,862
He's saying we gotta go
right, we gotta go right.

862
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:42,073
You going right?

863
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:42,951
Yeah.

864
01:03:32,423 --> 01:03:34,427
That's it, that's
probably the so-called fort

865
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:36,389
that Brady charted.

866
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:38,811
But how do we get that
kamikaze out of there?

867
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:39,855
Hey Anulu.

868
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,528
What's in the fort?

869
01:03:55,259 --> 01:03:56,720
What do you see?

870
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,641
Nothing yet.

871
01:03:58,641 --> 01:04:00,437
He's coming out now.

872
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:03,944
I can see the
whites of his eyes.

873
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:08,745
And he can see ours.

874
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:16,720
What's he doing?

875
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,972
He's
going up the tower.

876
01:04:17,972 --> 01:04:20,227
Why doesn't he
shoot at the tank?

877
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,062
Because he thinks
it's Japanese.

878
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:23,566
Oh yeah.

879
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,619
What happened?

880
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:31,081
I don't know.

881
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:40,350
Wait, I come too, I come too.

882
01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:49,533
Why is he shooting?

883
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,870
I don't know.

884
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:19,886
He's throwing grenades.

885
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:37,671
Pull the string,
start using the cannon.

886
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:38,547
What?

887
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:39,925
Go on, go on.

888
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:41,387
The cannon.

889
01:05:41,387 --> 01:05:42,473
Yes, sirie.

890
01:05:46,147 --> 01:05:47,232
Hey Captain?

891
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:48,066
Yeah?

892
01:05:48,066 --> 01:05:49,152
Which one?

893
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:50,906
This one.

894
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,033
Okay, here.

895
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:07,230
- Hey Captain.
- Come on.

896
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,106
Stop yelling.

897
01:06:08,106 --> 01:06:10,194
I'm ready, tell me when.

898
01:06:12,114 --> 01:06:12,950
Now.

899
01:06:46,851 --> 01:06:47,853
All clear.

900
01:06:47,853 --> 01:06:49,063
Okay.

901
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:26,554
Hey, a grenade.

902
01:07:26,554 --> 01:07:27,681
Be careful.

903
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:28,558
Huh?

904
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:46,217
No ammunition,
yankee.

905
01:07:47,888 --> 01:07:48,723
Woah.

906
01:07:54,567 --> 01:07:55,444
Bonzai.

907
01:07:55,444 --> 01:07:57,072
Bonzai.

908
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:58,325
No I say bonzai.

909
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,160
Bonzai.

910
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:02,751
Bonzai.

911
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:06,174
Hey.

912
01:08:06,174 --> 01:08:07,886
Quit playing war now.

913
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:09,430
Where go, where go Kamasuka?

914
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:11,016
Where go Kamasuka?

915
01:08:17,404 --> 01:08:18,949
So I great warrior

916
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,452
but I defeated because
they attacked me

917
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:22,206
with a tank.

918
01:08:22,206 --> 01:08:24,460
How did they get it Anulu?

919
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,297
Who gave it to them?

920
01:08:26,297 --> 01:08:27,634
My Mama tank.

921
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,897
Well Mama told me
to give the tank.

922
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:38,446
What, he's your son?

923
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:40,284
Unfortunately, yes.

924
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:47,005
40 years ago Mama still
beautiful princess.

925
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:48,299
Not like today.

926
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:53,351
When I was left alone on island,

927
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:57,191
I search for company
like all honorable men.

928
01:08:57,191 --> 01:09:01,282
We used to meet every
evening, Mama and I.

929
01:09:01,282 --> 01:09:04,331
Beneath the tall palms
near the river and...

930
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,543
And Anulu's the result.

931
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:08,088
But I disowned him.

932
01:09:11,303 --> 01:09:14,184
And now, I am dishonored too.

933
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:17,273
I ask your pardon to
leave your presence.

934
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:20,154
Yeah, if it'll
make you feel better.

935
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,162
Okay Charlie, let's
start digging.

936
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:26,415
No, you're better at it.

937
01:09:29,673 --> 01:09:33,221
Would Kamasuka try to
commit harry carry?

938
01:09:36,435 --> 01:09:37,647
He just might.

939
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:50,005
No, hold it.

940
01:09:50,005 --> 01:09:51,966
What you do, I must.

941
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:53,845
Cut that out for
crying out loud.

942
01:09:53,845 --> 01:09:55,891
Still playing tin soldier.

943
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,937
The war ended 36 years ago.

944
01:09:57,937 --> 01:10:00,275
Now the US and Japan get
along pretty good together.

945
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:02,696
I have fallen in disgrace.

946
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:06,245
I come from a long
line of warriors.

947
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,834
Your boys are finished,
they got new warriors now.

948
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,880
With up to date weapons.

949
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,802
Like watches, look,
with music inside, look.

950
01:10:13,802 --> 01:10:17,767
Oh my god.

951
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:20,482
I was always crazy
about watches.

952
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,613
Kawasaki.

953
01:10:23,613 --> 01:10:26,117
Oh kawaski yes,
miniature motorcycle king.

954
01:10:26,117 --> 01:10:27,788
Those teeny motors.

955
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:29,708
Captain Fujiama.

956
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:32,213
No kasamjama is a comic strip.

957
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:33,049
Or no...

958
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:36,389
Well, anyway.

959
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:38,893
Japan today, they say, is the
most important industrialized

960
01:10:38,893 --> 01:10:40,730
country in the world.

961
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:41,982
They'll make anything.

962
01:10:41,982 --> 01:10:45,573
Radios, transistors,
cars, you know Toyota?

963
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:47,118
Toyota?

964
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,370
She's my auntie.

965
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:50,499
She's a great lady of the night.

966
01:10:50,499 --> 01:10:53,880
Yeah, well, I
got an Aunt Honda.

967
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:03,693
Come on, don't say that.

968
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:07,199
You probably are
crazy. So is my friend.

969
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:21,603
Well, you hit a spring, I see.

970
01:11:21,603 --> 01:11:22,980
Hey knucklehead.

971
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:31,956
Hey Kamasuka, I've been
digging for a hidden treasure.

972
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:35,003
Would you know
where it is exactly?

973
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:38,595
Hidden treasure?

974
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:39,931
You see?

975
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,266
Never heard of it.

976
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:42,853
There is no hidden treasure.

977
01:11:42,853 --> 01:11:44,397
No, no, come on Kamasuka.

978
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:45,733
Don't hold out on us.

979
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:47,111
I know it's here.

980
01:11:47,111 --> 01:11:49,074
Is that why you come here?

981
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:50,869
You can bet on it.

982
01:11:50,869 --> 01:11:53,792
I think I know what
you're talking about.

983
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:54,627
Follow me.

984
01:12:01,682 --> 01:12:04,062
Many years ago, this
door always kept locked

985
01:12:04,062 --> 01:12:07,986
with two guard on duty
but now, guards not here

986
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:11,451
anymore so I go one, two, open.

987
01:12:11,451 --> 01:12:12,411
You follow.

988
01:12:18,299 --> 01:12:19,176
My god.

989
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:30,030
Here, is this what
you're looking for?

990
01:12:31,574 --> 01:12:32,409
Wow.

991
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:34,288
Hey.

992
01:12:36,626 --> 01:12:40,301
The treasure,
look, the treasure.

993
01:12:40,301 --> 01:12:41,386
The treasure!

994
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:45,394
The treasure.

995
01:12:46,437 --> 01:12:47,607
The treasure.

996
01:12:51,488 --> 01:12:53,785
Oh, now that you
found the treasure,

997
01:12:53,785 --> 01:12:55,830
you're gonna faint on me?

998
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,755
All this loot, hundreds
of, no no, thousands,

999
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:03,136
millions of dollars.

1000
01:13:03,136 --> 01:13:06,728
Millions yes but
of no use to you.

1001
01:13:06,728 --> 01:13:08,064
No use to us?

1002
01:13:10,193 --> 01:13:12,114
We could put it in
a bank and live off

1003
01:13:12,114 --> 01:13:14,910
the interest for the
rest of our lives.

1004
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,163
There are no banks in
Bongo Bongo and no way

1005
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:18,543
to leave island.

1006
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,188
We can build a raft.

1007
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:33,781
Impossible.

1008
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:38,541
Eagle, like a big bird.

1009
01:13:51,983 --> 01:13:53,152
Look down below.

1010
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:54,572
I see it, I see it.

1011
01:13:54,572 --> 01:13:56,368
According to the map,
it's Bungo Bungo.

1012
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:58,538
Yeah, Brady's famous
treasure island.

1013
01:13:58,538 --> 01:14:00,877
It better be or he'll
wish he were dead.

1014
01:14:00,877 --> 01:14:01,879
If he ain't already.

1015
01:14:04,259 --> 01:14:05,636
Well I had to convince him.

1016
01:14:05,636 --> 01:14:07,472
Yeah and cracked his left arm.

1017
01:14:07,472 --> 01:14:09,059
Well if I cracked his right,

1018
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:11,313
he wouldn't have been able
to draw us another map.

1019
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:26,761
Oh no, I can't believe it.

1020
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:28,473
It's Frisco.

1021
01:14:28,473 --> 01:14:29,767
You know those dudes?

1022
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:31,604
Yeah, I know them.

1023
01:14:31,604 --> 01:14:33,859
They're the guys who were
after me when I had to hide

1024
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:34,986
in your boat.

1025
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:39,077
It's like feeding you to the
sharks all over again, huh?

1026
01:14:39,077 --> 01:14:39,953
Yeah.

1027
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,562
Okay you guys,
let's get the bundle

1028
01:14:52,562 --> 01:14:54,316
and get out of here.

1029
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:15,066
Okay move it.

1030
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:28,591
According to the map, the
fort's just beyond those palms.

1031
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:29,844
Let's move.

1032
01:15:29,844 --> 01:15:31,431
These guys will
kill you for nothing.

1033
01:15:31,431 --> 01:15:33,017
How are we going
to defend ourselves

1034
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:36,649
when we have no ammunition left?

1035
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:39,781
Hey, maybe we
can do without it.

1036
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:40,658
Anulu?

1037
01:15:42,244 --> 01:15:43,748
I've got an idea.

1038
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:46,878
Let's stick together.

1039
01:15:46,878 --> 01:15:48,256
It's gotta be through here.

1040
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:49,132
Always north?

1041
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:50,343
Yeah.

1042
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:51,763
Brady was a
lush, don't forget.

1043
01:15:51,763 --> 01:15:52,723
Shut up.

1044
01:15:52,723 --> 01:15:55,227
That's enough, keep it moving.

1045
01:15:57,398 --> 01:15:59,319
Less than 300 yards.

1046
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:00,446
I don't see nobody.

1047
01:16:00,446 --> 01:16:01,740
That much the better.

1048
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,040
Yeah, keep your
eyes open though, huh?

1049
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,503
Hello.

1050
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:09,340
Who is that?

1051
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:10,342
No, don't shoot.

1052
01:16:10,342 --> 01:16:11,719
Anulu, me Anulu.

1053
01:16:14,181 --> 01:16:15,142
No, no, no.

1054
01:16:16,186 --> 01:16:17,856
You look for treasure.

1055
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:19,317
What the hell do you
know about the treasure?

1056
01:16:19,317 --> 01:16:21,279
Oh I know, look, see.

1057
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:25,413
This must be the copy that
Brady gave to his nephew, Alan.

1058
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:27,459
Yeah, Alan get big treasure.

1059
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:29,337
He beat us to it, that's
what he's telling us...

1060
01:16:29,337 --> 01:16:30,924
No, no, hold it.

1061
01:16:32,886 --> 01:16:34,222
You're a good boy, huh?

1062
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,474
Good boy.

1063
01:16:35,474 --> 01:16:37,228
Me good boy like you.

1064
01:16:37,228 --> 01:16:38,522
Good yes.

1065
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:40,651
Yeah, you tell us
where treasure is

1066
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:44,951
and you'll be allowed to
taste American heritage.

1067
01:16:49,627 --> 01:16:51,255
Good for corns.

1068
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:52,132
What?

1069
01:16:52,132 --> 01:16:53,135
Good for his corns.

1070
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:54,053
We go, huh?

1071
01:16:54,053 --> 01:16:55,639
Yeah, lead away.

1072
01:16:58,353 --> 01:16:59,230
Pretty fast pace.

1073
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,900
Just follow him.

1074
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,278
What's the big hurry, boss?

1075
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:03,447
Hey, he's beginning to run.

1076
01:17:03,447 --> 01:17:05,115
Alright, come on, let's go.

1077
01:17:05,115 --> 01:17:06,410
Let's go.

1078
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:07,287
Where is this
treasure, anyhow?

1079
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:08,080
How should I know?

1080
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,124
Keep moving.

1081
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:11,295
Keep going.

1082
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:15,178
Come back here, you pineapple.

1083
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:29,498
Okay Papa Kamasuka.

1084
01:17:29,498 --> 01:17:32,295
Stop where you are.

1085
01:17:33,881 --> 01:17:35,510
Put your hands
up on your head.

1086
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,599
The trigger on his
gun is a little loose.

1087
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:40,979
Sorry boys, the
treasure hunt's over.

1088
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:43,108
We got here first.

1089
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:44,863
We'll see about that.

1090
01:17:44,863 --> 01:17:46,448
I knew it, there is a treasure.

1091
01:17:46,448 --> 01:17:47,409
What do you think?

1092
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,746
We came here for a vacation?

1093
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:55,174
There's a nice cage waiting
for you down at the village.

1094
01:17:55,174 --> 01:17:56,427
Come village.

1095
01:17:56,427 --> 01:17:58,096
Anulu my son.

1096
01:17:58,096 --> 01:17:59,850
You know what to do.

1097
01:18:00,935 --> 01:18:02,856
Son of a no good jack.

1098
01:18:02,856 --> 01:18:04,775
What you say?

1099
01:18:04,775 --> 01:18:06,529
You speak bad my Pa.

1100
01:18:09,203 --> 01:18:10,580
Now wait a minute, hold it.

1101
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,459
What are you doing?

1102
01:18:35,797 --> 01:18:37,132
Thank you.

1103
01:18:37,132 --> 01:18:40,055
Thank you that for
Pa and Mama marry.

1104
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:10,656
What are they gonna do to us?

1105
01:19:10,656 --> 01:19:13,078
Fatten us up for the kill.

1106
01:19:37,919 --> 01:19:40,883
For you, speak
to Kamasuka, you.

1107
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:42,762
No you.

1108
01:19:53,951 --> 01:19:57,709
May I come in Your
Highness, Kamasuka?

1109
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,546
You asked to see me.

1110
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:02,551
I thought newlyweds like to
be alone on their first night.

1111
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:05,515
My beloved husband
wishes to speak with you.

1112
01:20:05,515 --> 01:20:07,227
Ah, what's up?

1113
01:20:07,227 --> 01:20:08,146
Tell him.

1114
01:20:11,944 --> 01:20:16,872
This secret
orders of

1115
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:19,418
to be opened only
when fort evacuated.

1116
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:21,882
And so now, I opened it.

1117
01:20:21,882 --> 01:20:23,259
What's it say?

1118
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:31,359
It say money not worth
paper it printed on.

1119
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,155
What?

1120
01:20:34,155 --> 01:20:35,784
It's counterfeit.

1121
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,132
It's counterfeit.

1122
01:20:44,093 --> 01:20:46,347
Completely worthless.

1123
01:20:46,347 --> 01:20:48,518
Can't even buy a
hamburger with it.

1124
01:20:48,518 --> 01:20:50,605
Oh Mama, it's not possible.

1125
01:20:50,605 --> 01:20:52,734
What do I tell Charlie?

1126
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:54,654
He's gonna kill me.

1127
01:21:08,015 --> 01:21:09,517
Oh god help me, Mama.

1128
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:12,398
Don't despair, my boy.

1129
01:21:12,398 --> 01:21:14,277
You have done much for us.

1130
01:21:14,277 --> 01:21:16,573
We give you this treasure.

1131
01:21:18,452 --> 01:21:19,746
Oh.

1132
01:21:19,746 --> 01:21:21,040
Mama.

1133
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,044
My boy, we feel happy

1134
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,634
if you would accept
gift from the heart.

1135
01:21:26,634 --> 01:21:28,220
That's very kind.

1136
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,350
It is
our only treasure

1137
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,518
but it is yours.

1138
01:21:31,518 --> 01:21:33,482
Thank you Kamasuka,
thank you Mama

1139
01:21:33,482 --> 01:21:38,575
but please don't say anything
to Charlie about the money.

1140
01:21:38,575 --> 01:21:40,913
I'm sure he won't mind
if I keep this treasure

1141
01:21:40,913 --> 01:21:42,040
as a memento.

1142
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:45,005
You're leaving the island?

1143
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:46,382
I'm afraid so.

1144
01:21:46,382 --> 01:21:47,927
Without him, I hope.

1145
01:21:47,927 --> 01:21:49,513
He's here to stay.

1146
01:21:49,513 --> 01:21:51,725
How could anyone
separate the two of you?

1147
01:21:51,725 --> 01:21:53,938
Kamasuka.

1148
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:59,157
Hey Charlie it's
Anulu, avocado.

1149
01:22:02,915 --> 01:22:06,463
No good twinkly
blood-eyed coniving snake.

1150
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,759
Thought you could
fake me out, huh?

1151
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,422
Dear Double Crosser,
I'm taking the treasure

1152
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,968
to make up for the
loss of my boat

1153
01:22:29,968 --> 01:22:32,390
and for all the trouble
you've caused me.

1154
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,773
I'm leaving and I hope
I never see you again.

1155
01:22:35,773 --> 01:22:36,648
Charlie.

1156
01:22:38,234 --> 01:22:39,320
Charlie.

1157
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,197
Huh?

1158
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:46,041
Bongo bongo.

1159
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:48,087
I'm sorry, I didn't
get the last part.

1160
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:49,508
You for to go?

1161
01:22:50,843 --> 01:22:52,889
Yeah, I might as well.

1162
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:54,517
No point in hanging around.

1163
01:22:54,517 --> 01:22:57,147
You first

1164
01:22:57,147 --> 01:22:59,151
You wanna what?

1165
01:22:59,151 --> 01:23:00,905
Ah, a good bye kiss.

1166
01:23:04,703 --> 01:23:06,582
Goodbye kiss you
said, no let's say,

1167
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:10,924
so long for now 'cause
Charlie's coming back, yeah.

1168
01:23:15,475 --> 01:23:16,352
Charlie.

1169
01:23:18,606 --> 01:23:19,483
Charlie.

1170
01:23:23,992 --> 01:23:26,874
Now I'm too sad, Charlie
leave Bongo Bongo.

1171
01:23:26,874 --> 01:23:29,670
Very sad if Charlie leaves.

1172
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:32,592
But it's just temporary.

1173
01:23:32,592 --> 01:23:36,099
Like I told, look
I'll be back before

1174
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,935
you can say goodbye
Charlie dear.

1175
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,609
First Charlie give
me kiss, please.

1176
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:43,405
You don't say please, you say.

1177
01:23:50,544 --> 01:23:51,714
Oh Charlie.

1178
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,745
Don't go, Charlie.

1179
01:24:08,998 --> 01:24:11,753
Hey, what is this,
some sort of conspiracy?

1180
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:13,966
Wait for me, too, wait.

1181
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:18,432
Please, before leave,

1182
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:21,105
give bliss to me
as promise of love.

1183
01:24:21,105 --> 01:24:23,025
You want bliss, huh?

1184
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:51,534
Hello, hello, testing
frequency radio.

1185
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,457
Can anyone hear me?

1186
01:25:54,457 --> 01:25:56,294
Come in please, over.

1187
01:25:57,838 --> 01:26:01,929
Hello, hello, anyone on
this frequency, please?

1188
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:15,164
US Aircraft
Carrier Forstall here.

1189
01:26:15,164 --> 01:26:18,003
Aircraft Carrier Forstall,
we hear you loud and clear.

1190
01:26:18,003 --> 01:26:21,093
Give us your position and
identification please.

1191
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,637
Hello, hello.

1192
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:24,266
I'm afraid I don't recall
the letters of this aircraft

1193
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:26,269
or it's position.

1194
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:27,982
Maybe you can help me out.

1195
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,901
You're
approximately 100 miles away.

1196
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:31,112
You've gotta be kidding.

1197
01:26:31,112 --> 01:26:32,657
Beg your pardon?

1198
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:34,494
No it's only, I was taking
a look at the fuel gauge.

1199
01:26:34,494 --> 01:26:36,330
I don't think I can
cover 100 miles.

1200
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:39,129
Could you possibly
come a little closer.

1201
01:26:39,129 --> 01:26:43,721
Why did you take off
if you were low on fuel?

1202
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:45,391
I made a boo-boo.

1203
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:48,814
What was your
point of departure?

1204
01:26:48,814 --> 01:26:51,027
Oh well that's
easy, I took off

1205
01:26:51,027 --> 01:26:55,619
from the island of Chowkey,
not more than 25 minutes ago.

1206
01:26:55,619 --> 01:26:57,247
The airstrip of
Chowkey was destroyed

1207
01:26:57,247 --> 01:26:58,708
in the last world war.

1208
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,714
You better get your
story straight up there.

1209
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:05,473
My plan is an anphib,
goes on water, bye.

1210
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:11,025
Man oh man.

1211
01:27:12,695 --> 01:27:13,781
Where's my beer?

1212
01:27:13,781 --> 01:27:15,201
It's over here, I've got it.

1213
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:16,203
Relax.

1214
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:18,790
Hey, double-crossing, no.

1215
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:20,460
No Charlie, you
can't ask me to leave,

1216
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,839
I haven't got a parachute.

1217
01:27:22,839 --> 01:27:24,593
How is it possible
you got onboard?

1218
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:26,639
No, no, no, don't
tell me, I know.

1219
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:29,646
You made those three
little fickle chippies

1220
01:27:29,646 --> 01:27:32,902
follow me so I'd waste time
and you'd get on board first.

1221
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:33,987
You were gonna
leave me alone on

1222
01:27:33,987 --> 01:27:36,117
that almost deserted island

1223
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,996
and take off with
all that money.

1224
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:42,546
By the way, it's fake.

1225
01:27:42,546 --> 01:27:43,840
How's that?

1226
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,136
Fake, make believe,
phony, counterfeit.

1227
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:47,639
You mean after all the
trouble you put me through,

1228
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:49,517
the dough is fake?

1229
01:27:49,517 --> 01:27:51,104
It's not my fault.

1230
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:52,942
The US government
got the bright idea

1231
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:55,780
of fighting Japan with
fake money, not me.

1232
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:57,284
I'll bat your
pretty little head in,

1233
01:27:57,284 --> 01:28:00,331
you no good son of a
sidewinder, I'll kill you.

1234
01:28:00,331 --> 01:28:04,715
We're going down,
we're going down, Charlie.

1235
01:28:09,223 --> 01:28:11,519
Blaming the US
government, shame on you.

1236
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,064
Look at it this way,

1237
01:28:13,064 --> 01:28:15,402
when the US Treasury finds
out what we discovered,

1238
01:28:15,402 --> 01:28:18,241
they'll give us
a medal for sure.

1239
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,164
Government'll give us a medal?

1240
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:22,416
Without a doubt.

1241
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:24,170
We'll be handing all
those phony dollars over

1242
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:26,841
to the US Navy instead of
letting those creeps get

1243
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:28,178
to it.

1244
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,931
They're gonna make
heroes out of us.

1245
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:33,814
Come on Charlie,
call the Forestall.

1246
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:36,235
Hello Charlie, hello Alan.

1247
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:42,247
Hello Alan,
Charlie, it's Kamasuka,

1248
01:28:42,247 --> 01:28:44,168
can you hear me?

1249
01:28:44,168 --> 01:28:47,967
Charlie, Alan, Kamasuka
calling Charlie, Alan.

1250
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:50,639
I hope you can hear me in sky.

1251
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,393
Bad pirates come back to island

1252
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,649
also gangsters in cage free.

1253
01:28:55,649 --> 01:28:57,278
They want treasure.

1254
01:28:57,278 --> 01:29:00,700
I say we got no treasure,
they say you got treasure.

1255
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,999
We tell them treasure
is not on island.

1256
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:07,297
They say they will kill
all women and babies.

1257
01:29:07,297 --> 01:29:09,217
Hello, hello, Charlie, Alan.

1258
01:29:09,217 --> 01:29:10,512
You hear me?

1259
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,432
What are you
trying to pull on me?

1260
01:29:12,432 --> 01:29:13,643
It's Frisco.

1261
01:29:14,812 --> 01:29:16,315
They took off
without the treasure.

1262
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:23,163
I'll blow your brains
out, understand?

1263
01:29:23,163 --> 01:29:25,541
Hey Frisco,
we've got the money

1264
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:27,545
so keep your hands
off those people.

1265
01:29:27,545 --> 01:29:28,964
Take it easy, Alan.

1266
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:30,801
We can pick up their
signal but their radio

1267
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:32,638
ain't powerful enough to get us.

1268
01:29:32,638 --> 01:29:34,267
Well what should we do?

1269
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:36,438
We can't leave them
to those creeps.

1270
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:38,692
I don't suppose we can.

1271
01:29:38,692 --> 01:29:40,988
Forstall, Forstall,
I'm sorry to bother you,

1272
01:29:40,988 --> 01:29:44,329
old buddy, afraid I'm gonna
run plum outta gas soon

1273
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:45,998
so I'll fly and land in
the back of the island.

1274
01:29:45,998 --> 01:29:49,588
Anyway, found something
may interest you.

1275
01:29:51,175 --> 01:29:52,302
Over and out.

1276
01:30:05,872 --> 01:30:09,003
Charlie, it's
none of my business,

1277
01:30:10,547 --> 01:30:12,594
but do we have enough gas
to get back to the island?

1278
01:30:12,594 --> 01:30:13,596
Nope.

1279
01:30:13,596 --> 01:30:15,265
No?

1280
01:30:15,265 --> 01:30:17,311
There's about two
gallons left in here.

1281
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:19,314
But I think that'll be
good enough to shoo us in.

1282
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:20,942
What do you mean?

1283
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:22,738
Like birds flapping
their feathers.

1284
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:25,076
Look at the gulls as
they rise high until

1285
01:30:25,076 --> 01:30:29,043
their block, allowing them
to land light on the earth.

1286
01:30:29,043 --> 01:30:31,047
They flick their tails to port,

1287
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:32,716
these wing sailors.

1288
01:30:34,177 --> 01:30:38,520
The wind is a friend,
instinct their only thought.

1289
01:30:39,856 --> 01:30:43,153
The wind, aircurrentss,
instinct, great.

1290
01:30:44,656 --> 01:30:47,620
But if those shouldn't work,
they've got wings to fly.

1291
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,582
Who's gonna give
us wings to flap?

1292
01:30:49,582 --> 01:30:51,712
Oh our guardian angels.

1293
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:54,008
Oh no.

1294
01:31:05,948 --> 01:31:07,910
Shut up and that
goes for you too Q-ball

1295
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:09,831
and your indigenous son.

1296
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,835
The bone

1297
01:31:11,835 --> 01:31:13,045
Beast?

1298
01:31:13,045 --> 01:31:14,841
You take advantage
because Charlie and Alan

1299
01:31:14,841 --> 01:31:16,094
are not here to help us.

1300
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:17,597
You see this gun?

1301
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,603
It's the only left loaded
on the whole island.

1302
01:31:20,603 --> 01:31:22,523
There are six bullets in here.

1303
01:31:22,523 --> 01:31:24,319
The odds are with me.

1304
01:31:28,911 --> 01:31:31,457
Don't, my god, my god.

1305
01:31:31,457 --> 01:31:33,294
Shut up back there.

1306
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,350
And now there are just two left.

1307
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:43,649
One for you and one
for your banana boy.

1308
01:31:43,649 --> 01:31:45,151
Don't worry son.

1309
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:47,490
Alan and Charlie
will come to save us.

1310
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:51,080
No, you gonna die
Papa, boom, boom, dead.

1311
01:31:55,631 --> 01:31:57,217
Oh my god.

1312
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,666
Alan, Charlie, hurry.

1313
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,221
Well, get him,
there's only two of 'em,

1314
01:32:20,221 --> 01:32:21,348
you slobs.

1315
01:32:21,348 --> 01:32:22,976
Get with it, go on.

1316
01:32:30,115 --> 01:32:32,078
Alan, give me a hand.

1317
01:33:10,321 --> 01:33:11,155
Here.

1318
01:33:11,155 --> 01:33:12,032
Thanks.

1319
01:33:16,081 --> 01:33:17,417
Don't worry, it's
just a little shock,

1320
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,003
hold still, hold still.

1321
01:33:19,003 --> 01:33:19,880
It's fine.

1322
01:33:33,825 --> 01:33:35,913
Charlie, there's four.

1323
01:33:52,821 --> 01:33:54,365
Anulu, you okay?

1324
01:33:56,328 --> 01:33:58,332
Sorry about that Anulu.

1325
01:33:58,332 --> 01:33:59,542
Shall I straighten him out?

1326
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,004
Yes, certainly.

1327
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:05,805
Thank you good.

1328
01:34:05,805 --> 01:34:08,351
Drop on the head is
good for him now and then.

1329
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,228
Sorry.

1330
01:34:55,361 --> 01:34:56,405
Drop dead.

1331
01:35:03,293 --> 01:35:04,463
My bad eye.

1332
01:35:04,463 --> 01:35:05,507
He's good.

1333
01:36:07,338 --> 01:36:08,549
Goodbye.

1334
01:36:08,549 --> 01:36:09,592
No, Anulu.

1335
01:36:24,872 --> 01:36:25,874
Oh Mama.

1336
01:36:25,874 --> 01:36:26,960
Anulu, Anulu.

1337
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,254
Why are you here
in woman's cage?

1338
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:29,882
Shame on you.

1339
01:36:40,026 --> 01:36:41,947
Stupid swords.

1340
01:36:41,947 --> 01:36:44,243
No, no the feet, not again.

1341
01:36:44,243 --> 01:36:46,582
Not the feet, your hands.

1342
01:36:48,752 --> 01:36:50,881
Hold it, hold it, you ready?

1343
01:36:50,881 --> 01:36:51,758
Ready.

1344
01:37:03,448 --> 01:37:05,118
Go get him you worms.

1345
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:06,704
I said go get him.

1346
01:37:08,207 --> 01:37:12,675
Kill them, pulverize
them, disintegrate them.

1347
01:37:12,675 --> 01:37:15,055
Make meatballs out of them.

1348
01:37:16,975 --> 01:37:19,146
Yeah, they'll feel sorry.

1349
01:37:36,472 --> 01:37:37,641
What's the mean?

1350
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:39,561
I didn't catch it.

1351
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:40,855
I got the gist.

1352
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:46,283
Bonzai.

1353
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:47,869
Oh bonzai again.

1354
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:58,140
Okay.

1355
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,017
Yeah.

1356
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:09,454
Who us?

1357
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:12,168
Keep me covered.

1358
01:38:12,168 --> 01:38:13,587
I don't have my wig.

1359
01:38:13,587 --> 01:38:15,258
Whatever you say.

1360
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:18,847
My head.

1361
01:38:18,847 --> 01:38:19,682
Sorry.

1362
01:38:21,353 --> 01:38:23,105
Thank you so much.

1363
01:38:51,161 --> 01:38:53,375
Thank you Alan and Charlie.

1364
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,587
Mama wishes to thank
her two friends

1365
01:38:55,587 --> 01:38:58,259
for your goodness and wishes

1366
01:38:58,259 --> 01:39:01,808
to offer to them both
my three daughters.

1367
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:05,274
Three for two?

1368
01:39:05,274 --> 01:39:08,029
The odd number would
create a problem.

1369
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:08,905
Yeah.

1370
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:15,333
The Forstall notified
the Coast Guard like

1371
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,962
I said they would.

1372
01:39:16,962 --> 01:39:18,132
That's what I said.

1373
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:18,967
Yeah.

1374
01:39:20,386 --> 01:39:21,973
Listen, we're gonna
take those creeps

1375
01:39:21,973 --> 01:39:23,977
and the treasure and hand
them over to the military.

1376
01:39:23,977 --> 01:39:26,732
You go find some place where
they can't see your people.

1377
01:39:26,732 --> 01:39:28,277
Really, why?

1378
01:39:28,277 --> 01:39:29,654
They'll see a deserted island

1379
01:39:29,654 --> 01:39:32,620
and you won't be bothered.

1380
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:36,084
Alan is right and
Charlie's a prophet.

1381
01:39:41,803 --> 01:39:43,307
Alan and Charlie.

1382
01:39:44,518 --> 01:39:47,524
Everybody now,
hide, hide, go hide.

1383
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,994
I say thank you great warrior

1384
01:39:53,994 --> 01:39:56,416
but I wish to remain on island

1385
01:39:56,416 --> 01:39:59,756
because your world
make me feel sick.

1386
01:40:09,943 --> 01:40:12,406
Listen, about this loot,

1387
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:13,826
you really sure?

1388
01:40:13,826 --> 01:40:15,412
Sure about what?

1389
01:40:16,873 --> 01:40:20,130
Handing those beautiful
bills to the military?

1390
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,633
Sure, I'm sure.

1391
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,516
They're fake, aren't they?

1392
01:40:25,516 --> 01:40:28,855
Hey, do you want me to think
you're thinking something

1393
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:31,109
you shouldn't be thinking?

1394
01:40:32,111 --> 01:40:33,363
Not me.

1395
01:40:33,363 --> 01:40:34,825
You're the one that's
thinking about it.

1396
01:40:34,825 --> 01:40:35,702
Yeah.

1397
01:40:40,879 --> 01:40:43,676
265 million, 270, 280 million,

1398
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:53,904
285 million.

1399
01:40:55,114 --> 01:40:56,660
Sure is a great
privilege for me

1400
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:59,165
to be the first to
congratulate you.

1401
01:40:59,165 --> 01:41:01,253
You've shown a great
deal of courage.

1402
01:41:01,253 --> 01:41:03,340
And let's go right
ahead and say it,

1403
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:06,806
a lot of wholesome
honesty too, yesire.

1404
01:41:06,806 --> 01:41:08,517
Thanks, Major.

1405
01:41:08,517 --> 01:41:10,771
But any law-abiding
citizen would have done

1406
01:41:10,771 --> 01:41:11,816
the same thing.

1407
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,446
Just a bunch of no good paper.

1408
01:41:14,446 --> 01:41:15,699
Did you hear that Wallace?

1409
01:41:15,699 --> 01:41:17,994
They're calling
this no good paper.

1410
01:41:17,994 --> 01:41:19,539
I wouldn't mind
having some of it,

1411
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:22,879
seeing what my
paycheck brings in.

1412
01:41:22,879 --> 01:41:24,172
Come on.

1413
01:41:24,172 --> 01:41:26,928
You don't really mean
that the money is real.

1414
01:41:26,928 --> 01:41:28,223
Sure.

1415
01:41:28,223 --> 01:41:30,186
Navy's been looking
for it for years.

1416
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:32,022
Yeah, would've been bad
news if it had fallen

1417
01:41:32,022 --> 01:41:34,026
into the wrong hands.

1418
01:41:34,026 --> 01:41:36,071
How much is it?

1419
01:41:36,071 --> 01:41:39,579
300, 470, 923 good
old American dollars.

1420
01:41:44,004 --> 01:41:45,506
Excuse me.

1421
01:41:45,506 --> 01:41:47,344
How much did you say?

1422
01:41:47,344 --> 01:41:48,638
And they're not fake.

1423
01:41:48,638 --> 01:41:49,933
And
they're not fake.

1424
01:41:49,933 --> 01:41:51,603
During the war, the
high command spread

1425
01:41:51,603 --> 01:41:53,690
the word around that
the money was no good.

1426
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:55,778
And fortunately the
Japanese government fell

1427
01:41:55,778 --> 01:41:57,322
for it and left it here.

1428
01:41:57,322 --> 01:41:59,034
It was the pay
money the 11th fleet

1429
01:41:59,034 --> 01:42:01,247
was supposed to get
over 40 years ago.

1430
01:42:01,247 --> 01:42:02,750
There was only one
man who knew about it,

1431
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:03,919
fellow named Brady.

1432
01:42:03,919 --> 01:42:04,921
Oh Brady.

1433
01:42:04,921 --> 01:42:06,424
Yeah, he fought in this area

1434
01:42:06,424 --> 01:42:08,469
but he never
divulged the secret.

1435
01:42:08,469 --> 01:42:11,099
By the way, take a minute, Walt.

1436
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:12,769
We're gonna have to find Brady.

1437
01:42:12,769 --> 01:42:15,107
Certainly deserved
for what he did.

1438
01:42:15,107 --> 01:42:18,991
Yeah, I'd say three
percent at least.

1439
01:42:18,991 --> 01:42:20,618
Thanks again Mr. O'Brien.

1440
01:42:20,618 --> 01:42:22,205
We can't publicize the
fact that you notified

1441
01:42:22,205 --> 01:42:24,250
it so it's top secret.

1442
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:26,212
I'm sure that when the
president hears about it,

1443
01:42:26,212 --> 01:42:29,637
he'll wanna congratulate
you in person.

1444
01:42:31,725 --> 01:42:33,518
Charlie?

1445
01:42:33,518 --> 01:42:37,276
Is there anything
wrong, Mr. O'Brien?

1446
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:38,778
Uh huh.

1447
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:43,121
No, he's just moved by
the whole thing, that's all.

1448
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:47,046
Well can I give
you boys a lift?

1449
01:42:47,046 --> 01:42:48,465
Me, thanks, I.

1450
01:42:50,677 --> 01:42:53,225
I got a few things to do here.

1451
01:42:53,225 --> 01:42:54,978
And him too.

1452
01:42:54,978 --> 01:42:56,190
Right?

1453
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:57,859
Right.

1454
01:42:57,859 --> 01:43:00,781
I meant thanks but no thanks.

1455
01:43:00,781 --> 01:43:03,160
Alright, let's go.

1456
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,581
Okay gentlemen, moving out.

1457
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:06,459
Bye.

1458
01:44:31,419 --> 01:44:35,553
Get down you chicken
livered blue eyed rat.

1459
01:44:35,553 --> 01:44:37,140
You'll strain
yourself, Charlie.

1460
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:38,600
Here give me a hand.

1461
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,644
Forget it.

1462
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:42,983
Come back here, you beggar.

1463
01:44:42,983 --> 01:44:44,068
No.

1464
01:44:44,068 --> 01:44:45,613
You've got hate in your eyes.

1465
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:47,451
Oh I've got it
in my heart too.

1466
01:44:47,451 --> 01:44:49,371
You see, that's
not nice, Charlie.

1467
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:51,625
No, I ain't nice at all.

1468
01:44:54,923 --> 01:44:59,182
Hey, look what else
is in here, Major.

1469
01:44:59,182 --> 01:45:02,607
Huh, well I don't think
it's worth anything.

1470
01:45:02,607 --> 01:45:05,028
Bet it does belong
to those two guys.

1471
01:45:05,028 --> 01:45:06,362
We'll send it on their behalf

1472
01:45:06,362 --> 01:45:09,077
to the anthropological
museum in Washington.

1473
01:45:09,077 --> 01:45:10,579
Their experts there
will appraise it.

1474
01:45:10,579 --> 01:45:11,456
Yes sir.

1475
01:45:11,456 --> 01:45:12,834
Hey guys, look.

1476
01:45:12,834 --> 01:45:14,171
Nice huh?

1477
01:45:14,171 --> 01:45:15,715
Yeah, I got
on in my locker.

1478
01:45:15,715 --> 01:45:17,051
Hell you do.

1479
01:46:03,142 --> 01:46:07,401
As they say, he who loses
a treasure finds a friend.

1480
01:46:07,401 --> 01:46:08,278
