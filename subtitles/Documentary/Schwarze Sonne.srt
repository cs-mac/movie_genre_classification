1
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,479
Hello!
Here speaks Edgar Wallace!

2
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,390
What do you want?
- l don't like the walks you take...

3
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,913
in the park every night.
- Does it really matter so much to you?

4
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,913
Well, your health...
- You're my administrator, not my doctor!

5
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,390
Or, are you afraid l could find things
that might be...

6
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,430
embarrassing to you in my walks?
- You seem irritable.

7
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,350
lt's simply nerves.
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be able to talk.

8
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,350
Anyway, if anyone should ask
for the past 21 hours,

9
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,878
you haven't left the house.

10
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,438
Here. To help you sleep.

11
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,631
Listen now, Harry.
You went to bed very early.

12
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,591
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

13
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,839
Mr. Alford?

14
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,349
Yes?

15
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,197
Chelford Manor is now complete, Sir.
There's been a ghost for months.

16
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,198
And now we havea corpse, too.

17
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,832
There's a body in the abbey.
Dead. Stabbed.

18
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,118
l would say, in the back.

19
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,153
Do you know who it is?
- Mr. Smooth, who had that hunting box.

20
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,153
You're astoundingly well informed.
Have you informed the police?

21
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,516
l thought l should first
speak to you about it.

22
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,630
And why speak with me?
- l saw His Lordship arrive late,

23
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,630
after l had come in.
And His Lordship seemed to be excited.

24
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,995
Are you sure it was Lord Chelford you saw?
- My eyes are very good, Sir.

25
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,872
This, l found right by the corpse.

26
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,152
lsn't it yours, Sir?
lt's not yours?

27
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,675
Yes, it is.

28
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,150
l was with Doctor Loxon, chess playing.
On the way back,

29
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,673
l almost tripped over the corpse.
That's when l must have lost it.

30
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,470
Looks bad for you.
- No worse than for you, Thomas.

31
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,673
You just might have to explain
to the police what you were doing...

32
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,638
in the abbey at midnight.

33
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,672
Mr. Alford.
Good evening, Sergeant.

34
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,752
Something has happened here.

35
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,958
You can take the corpse away.

36
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,150
Mr. Alford, just when did the victim
buy the hunting box?

37
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,150
Three months ago.
- Perhaps he didn't like the country here.

38
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,673
These 3 matches were near the body!
- And what do you conclude?

39
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,672
He was looking around, Sir.
- For his murderer?

40
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,150
You may give them to Mr. Alford.
They're yours, aren't they?

41
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,150
That could be. When l found the corpse...
- That's alright.

42
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,594
Tell me, who is Doctor Loxon?
The man's your chess partner...

43
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,150
and the Doctor who examined the body.
- He's just our doctor.

44
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,150
ln general practice?
- Yes. But he is not entirely retired.

45
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,673
His practice is confined to our family.
- Does he make a living?

46
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,150
And the murder weapon
is the property of the Chelfords?

47
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,672
Yes.
- And Lord Chelford sleeps...

48
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,150
through all the excitement?
- He took a very strong sedative,

49
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,150
lnspector Puddler.
- Are you saying, that Lord Chelford...

50
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,673
had something to do with this?
- No. l don't think he would use...

51
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,832
this weapon here.
- Or leave it near the body.

52
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,673
Mr. Alford. Why did you wait
45 minutes before you called in...

53
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,194
the local police on this?

54
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,353
Miss Wenner, Mr. Alford has forbidden you
to talk to His Lordship.

55
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,830
But, Thomas, l have yet to hear
Harry brushed me off.

56
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,353
This administrator has the gall
to insult a Lady, who almost was the...

57
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,830
Almost the Lady Chelford.
But Lord Alford put a stop...

58
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,392
to that quite thoroughly.
- Spare us your commentary!

59
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,439
l take it. You're still interested in the
story of Fossaway and the gold treasure,

60
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,196
aren't you? Still hoping!
- l'll complain about you to Harry!

61
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,319
You won't be able to see him at all.
Mr Alford gave me strict orders...

62
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,472
that you should be shown
promptly to the door.

63
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,638
Miss Wenner...
- Good. l'll go.

64
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,150
But will you please tell Lord Chelford
that l was here...

65
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,673
with a great favour for him.
And now, whatever else will happen,

66
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,673
whatever will be his future,
he can thank his administrator for it!

67
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,320
l will tell him so.

68
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,678
Also Harry ought to watch his bride-to-be.
lt's no secret at all...

69
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,752
that Dick Alford loves her.
- Very well.

70
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,277
Sarcastic!

71
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,672
Sunbeam special. 115 PS.
- A pretty woman.

72
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,673
That's Miss Wenner. Formerly
private secretary to Lord Chelford.

73
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,150
Formerly? Wasn't she a good one?
- She was too good.

74
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,673
She planned to be the Lady of Fossaway.
- And that bothered you?

75
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,638
Exactly.
- And who is that?

76
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,873
Thomas Fortuna. He works in the house.
- Fortuna, ''the lucky one''.

77
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,677
Thomas! lnspector Puddler and his
assistant want to look over the premises.

78
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,150
Show them every courtesy.
You'll excuse me, lnspector,

79
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,673
but l must take care of some business.
- But of course! Mr. Alford?

80
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,673
Could you put us up here for a while?
- You'll stay for some time?

81
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,673
Yes. l'm sure that Chelford House
is as interested as we are...

82
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,036
in clearing up this case?
- Naturally, lnspector.

83
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,150
Thomas. Arrange the quarters.
- With bath, if you please!

84
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,752
Horatio!
- At state expense, of course!

85
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,036
l'll say goodbye, lnspector.
- This way, please.

86
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,590
The Lord's mother, the Lady Chelford.
She's dead, Sir.

87
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,516
When did she die?
- l think it's about 2 years.

88
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,630
You're new here, it seems,
Mister... What was your name?

89
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,959
Fortuna.
- Ah, Fortuna.

90
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,952
You should do quite well
with that name.

91
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,430
lf l had never been called in here,
who would know...

92
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,918
that Streisser is your name?

93
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,038
And that you spent time
in Dartmoor Prison!

94
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,433
You were planning to see Harry today?
- l don't believe l will.

95
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,275
He's usually too busy reading about
the Chelford treasure or he's sleeping.

96
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,673
lt must be difficult to look
for a treasure in such a great estate.

97
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,551
l quite agree.

98
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,230
Do you think there's a treasure?
- To tell the truth... no.

99
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,912
And if there would be one,
and we found it,

100
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,116
well, we'd lose all the romance
of Chelford Manor.

101
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,230
The gold makes the place romantic.
- Oh, impossibly!

102
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,752
lf l would find that gold,
l'd just bathe in it.

103
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,832
And leave it here for my decedents!

104
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,508
Don't you want to say hello to Harry?
- No. You say hello for me.

105
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,159
And, Dick...

106
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,996
l don't know how to say it,
but l'll try anyway.

107
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,750
My engagement to Harry is not
a real engagement. lt's a...

108
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,552
l merely agreed
because of my brother, Arthur.

109
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,590
Now, why does Lord Chelford
keep that Dick Alford around?

110
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,192
Alford is a very efficient fellow.

111
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,590
And you must admit,
an extremely capable administrator.

112
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,593
Sometimes, l don't understand you.
Are you on his side, or mine?

113
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,713
Don't forget, it's my office you work in.
- l'm sorry, Mr. Gine.

114
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,832
Does that mean, l have to agree...

115
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,872
with every foolish idea you have?

116
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,311
How dare you!

117
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,790
Allow me, please.
l think you've seen these notes before.

118
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,312
No. l think l'd better hold them.

119
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,115
How come you have those things?
- l bought them though they're worthless.

120
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,590
The signature of Lord Chelford
is falsified, of course.

121
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,951
By you, Mr Gine!

122
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,590
You must take all those notes back!
- Can't do that.

123
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,590
But don't you worry.
l don't intend to present them.

124
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,070
You bought the lot,
just so you could blackmail me.

125
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,672
No, l mean simply
to protect your name.

126
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,348
What do you want?

127
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,471
Your sister.
-Leslie?

128
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,590
You are insane. l remind you
she's engaged to Chelford...

129
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,590
l am sure he will willingly
cut off the engagement.

130
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,113
l have in my bank account enough
to give Miss Leslie whatever she wants.

131
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
Now, how on earth
did you get so wealthy?

132
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,233
Don't forget, l know what you earn here
as head clerk in my office.

133
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,596
lf you please.

134
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,070
Treadman? That's my bookmaker.
You picked a few winners.

135
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,758
l am Treadman.
- What?

136
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,953
You are the man who took thousands
and thousands of pounds from me?

137
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,953
lf you want the exact figures:
To Treadman, the total was just 23.000.

138
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,952
And Wrathman...
- You'real so Wrathman?

139
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,430
And Burton, and Smith.
ln the last 3 years, Mr. Gine,

140
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,918
you lost altogether, 160.000.

141
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,438
l wonder what l shall admire:

142
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,950
Your shameful dishonesty,
or your dishonest genius.

143
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,918
l'll leave that up to you. You'll be
entirely willing to be my brother in-law,

144
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,072
or plan on a long career in Dartmoor.

145
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,678
An easy decision to make!

146
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,279
Now then,

147
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,073
l think the best way for us to start,
is to have Leslie at my house

148
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,151
tomorrow for tea.

149
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,551
Yes?
- l'm sorry, Sir.

150
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,388
Miss Mary Wenner wants to speak with you.
- Miss Wenner? Send her in.

151
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,630
Good morning. Excuse me
for interrupting, but it's so important.

152
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,995
ls it bad news?
- Well, no.

153
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,996
l'm curious now.

154
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,233
You want me to prevent
my sister's marriage to Harry Chelford,

155
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,710
so that you can get him? But Mary!
- What l want, l pay for.

156
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,430
Can you give me more than Lord Chelford?
Nobility? Prestige?

157
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,634
Millions?
- Yes.

158
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,430
Your ambition runs away
with your logic. You're sick!

159
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,958
ls 2,5 tons of gold a sickness?

160
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,112
2,5 tons? Mary,
that's over a million pounds!

161
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,916
l know.
- Mary, do you know what you're saying?

162
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,316
Be sure of it. And l'll use it
to get what l want.

163
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,430
Harry means nothing.
l'm after the title of Lady Chelford.

164
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,430
2,5 tons of gold?
ls it the Bank of England you broke in to?

165
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,752
No. l know where
the treasure of Chelford is.

166
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,430
l'm afraid you've been exposed
to Harry's ideas too long.

167
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,953
The plans. l have them.
- Why did you come to me instead of Harry?

168
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,952
He might be willing to...
- He would not!

169
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,953
He always takes Dick Alford's word.
- Well, he'll still be around...

170
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,430
to muddle things up.
- No. l know enough about Dick Alford...

171
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,430
to takecare of him. lf l must,
l'll threaten him...

172
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,430
with a visit to Dartmoor.
l've prepared a contract for us.

173
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,910
You'll be glad to sign it,
if you want to be wealthy, Arthur.

174
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,796
Fascinating. l admire you.
Or should l fear you?

175
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,432
Both.
- But who's to guarantee me...

176
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,910
that you will keep your bargain?
- You're a lawyer!

177
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,433
lsn't that contract, and your share
of the gold enough guarantee?

178
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,316
What is it?
- The contracts from Gines Gill & Son.

179
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,592
Mr. Gine insisted
that they be mailed today.

180
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,750
Give them to me.

181
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,752
You won't regret this.
- l can hope.

182
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,272
Until tomorrow.
- Goodbye, Mary.

183
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,592
Will 5 o'clock in the afternoon be ok?
- 5?

184
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,431
Ah! My tea with Leslie, eh?
There's a lot of excitement in the press

185
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,513
with that murder over at Fossaway.
You know that treasureat Chelford?

186
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,720
They mention it!
Amazing that someone believes in it.

187
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,872
Well, they even talk about
the Black Abbot a bit.

188
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,952
Didn't Miss Wenner
tell you anything?

189
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,430
Why mention Miss Wenner?
- l just thought that as...

190
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,910
secretary to Lord Chelford,
she might have some information.

191
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,953
And anyway, it leaves a man to think.
- And what do you think?

192
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,750
That she, l mean Miss Wenner,
has something to do with it.

193
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,112
With murder?
You're absolutely insane, Gilder!

194
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,749
You'd be surprised at
who could bea murderer.

195
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,634
Mr. Gilder?
- Yes.

196
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,430
And l guess you work for Scotland Yard.
- lnspector Puddler.

197
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,953
And my assistant, Horatio.
- W. Smith! Horatio is my first name.

198
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,430
Please go right in, Gentlemen.
l've been expecting you.

199
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,709
Good.

200
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,430
Oh, you'reserving tea.
A delightful reception, eh, Horatio?

201
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,953
This tea wasn't brewed for us, Sir.
This orchid here is not for the police.

202
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,952
l invited friends.
- Just a few questions.

203
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,953
l know what you will ask.
My name is Fabian Gilder, 45 years old.

204
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,953
The victim, Mr. Smooth, was my employer.
And at my orders, he bought me this house.

205
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,032
Why use him?
- l had private reasons.

206
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,433
A beautiful house. Bookmaking
is very profitable, isn't it?

207
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,430
You have excellent information, lnspector.
- That is our job.

208
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,953
We'd still like the name of the murderer.
l'd better examine Smooth's room, right?

209
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,429
A good idea, Horatio.

210
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,957
lf you don't mind, Mr Gilder...
- Please, please! 2nd to the right.

211
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,912
Where were you yesterday evening?

212
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,072
Took a business friend
to dinner at the club.

213
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,152
And how long did you stay there?
- Until 10, or so.

214
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,997
Then l went to a flat l keep in town.
- But, you didn't stay there.

215
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,073
You suspect that l went out again?
- Yes. Mr. Gine's gardener...

216
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,870
saw you coming back here about 12.
What did you do then?

217
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,392
Might you have met Mr. Smooth,
perhaps?

218
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,552
Smooth wasn't here.
l went to bed right away.

219
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,315
That's a very weak alibi, you know.
By that time, Smooth had been killed.

220
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,873
You'll need a better story than that.
- One that is more convincing.

221
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,076
Good day, Mr. Gilder.
- Good day, Mr. Gilder.

222
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,552
Did you find anything?
- lt's unbelievable!

223
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,873
A soccer pool card, that he had
all filled out. 12 right on it!

224
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,236
He even picked
the Birmingham-Liverpool game 2:1.

225
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,873
That means he'd win 5.000 pounds.
- What a guy! He's a lucky one!

226
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,394
Not very.
- Too bad.

227
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,717
Hello?

228
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,350
Yes, they've been here.
You should have called much earlier.

229
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,756
Ah! lnteresting.
- Mr. Alford was quite shocked,

230
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,399
when he became aware of it,
you can besure.

231
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,872
Anyway, the more bewildered,
the better.

232
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,514
l will. Good.

233
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,472
l'll call you
as soon as l'm able to.

234
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,871
With whom did you just talk there?
- Doctor Loxon wanted Mr. Alford,

235
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,918
but Mr. Alford is out riding.
- Alone?

236
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,072
That l don't know, Sir.
- Oh? You don't know?

237
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,436
Phone and get me Miss Gine.
- Of course, My Lord.

238
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,552
The more l see you,
the more l dislike you.

239
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,552
l regret, My Lord,
that my face annoys you.

240
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,393
The Gines, apparently, are out.
- l have the feeling that Mr. Alford...

241
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,393
gets more out of you than me.
lt seems that your loyalty lies with him.

242
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,393
lf l might mention, Sir...
- Don't bother mentioning anything!

243
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,596
Just bring the tea!

244
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,276
Leslie? He's out of his mind!
What is the total?

245
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,194
Oh, well... 20.000.

246
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,154
What? 20.000?
- Yes.

247
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,190
Forging notes! Your own sister,
a victim of your dirty deals!

248
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,230
You worthless swine!
- l don't want Leslie involved with him.

249
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,753
lt's blackmail. Dick, you're the only one
who can help me. He can't do a thing...

250
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,832
if you acknowledge those notes.

251
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,270
l can't understand how you are
still allowed to practice.

252
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,196
Dick, in a week,
l'll be able to cash those notes.

253
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,838
l know l will. l give my word!

254
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,434
Your word is worthless!

255
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,717
Dick, it's just Leslie. At this moment,
she's having tea with Gilder.

256
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,593
You've been our neighbour now for weeks.
And we've never gotten...

257
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,313
to know each other, Mr. Gilder.
- Are you displeased with your neighbour?

258
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,313
Why, no, of course not!
My brother should have been here by now.

259
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,070
A lawyer as well-known as he?
He must have a lot to do.

260
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,272
And besides, let him come later.
l don't mind.

261
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,072
That's a Gainsborough.
An early painting.

262
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,590
lt's nice. A beautiful house.
l know you love it, of course.

263
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,476
l expected you to ask
how l could afford all this.

264
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,113
My brother told me that you were
very lucky at the race track.

265
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,590
Absolutely true.
And that puts me in the position...

266
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,312
to give the right girl
the best of everything.

267
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,552
The right girl, Mr. Gilder?
Getting married?

268
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,672
Yes, l think so.
The one l want to marry,

269
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,272
the girl of my dreams,
is about to be told,

270
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,192
l want her.
- What is this, Mr. Gilder?

271
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,070
Leslie, listen to me.
- l'm engaged to Lord Chelford!

272
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,593
An engagement that doesn't mean a thing.
Leslie, what will you have...

273
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,070
with that Harry Chelford?
Yes, they'll call you Lady.

274
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,673
But he wouldn't treat you
as l would. A man like him.

275
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,593
You're obviously out of your mind!
l don't want to hear your ranting.

276
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,070
You speak as if you had the right to...
- This is my right!

277
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,070
l love you! You believe
l want all this stuff for myself?

278
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,593
l know what a young wife wants from a man!
- You're a fool! Let me go!

279
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,592
Let me out of here!
- No, Leslie!

280
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,070
You force me to tell you something,
l wanted to spare you:

281
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,070
Harry Chelford wants you
because he thinks you're rich.

282
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,752
l'm in love with you.
- What are you saying?

283
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,952
You ask your brother!
Leslie! l love you so!

284
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,474
Let me go! Let me go!

285
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,077
Help! No!

286
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,518
Help! Are you mad?
No! Let me go!

287
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,353
No! Help!

288
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,158
No! Help!

289
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,392
What do you want here?
- l've got time to kill you,

290
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,393
after Leslie has a chance
to get out of here! You go home, now.

291
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,236
You have your nerve!
She's a guest in my house!

292
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,873
Guest? l think Miss Leslie
has had enough of your hospitality!

293
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,673
l have no intention of letting her
stay in this house, not another second!

294
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,077
Come, Leslie.

295
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,592
l should have punched you
in the jaw!

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,593
Listen, Mr. Alford. This is my house.
l won't be threatened here!

297
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,073
lf you think this is your own home,
there's something you don't remember.

298
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,550
l sold this house to Smooth,
of course, but not to you!

299
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,956
And it was Mr. Smooth,
l bought the house from.

300
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,593
You couldn't have. Because Mr. Smooth
signed a contract, that gives me the right

301
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,631
to approve any buyer! lt's amusing
that l can throw you out at will.

302
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,313
There's other interesting news.
You have notes in your possession...

303
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,393
for 26.500 pounds,
which you thought you could use.

304
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,751
l will cash them.

305
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,439
lnteresting.

306
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,710
And, of course, you know,
the signatures are forged.

307
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,553
lf l acknowledge the signatures,
you might as well let the notes be paid.

308
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,112
l'm astounded that someone like you,

309
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,754
the administrator
and successor to Lord Chelford,

310
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,832
would be in on
a business like this one.

311
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,031
Watch it, Gilder!

312
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,429
You press your luck!

313
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,313
Oh, one more thing. Mr. Gine
won't have any further use for...

314
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,432
your extremely dubious abilities.

315
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,190
Sorry to have been so late.
- l'm in a hurry. What is it?

316
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,237
Our talk will take a moment.
l don't want you to do something stupid.

317
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,232
You waste my time!
- You're going to...

318
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,710
give Mr. Gine information, right?
- How do you know?

319
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,033
l also know, he said he wouldn't let
the wedding of his sister...

320
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,233
and Lord Chelford take place.
So Lord Chelford will turn to you.

321
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,233
For this you will reveal the location
of the treasure of Chelford.

322
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,312
Well, l must say...
- l warn you.

323
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,596
Gine will cheat you.
- You think l'm naive? Here.

324
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,352
l have it all in writing, you see?

325
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,190
l thought he might do that.
This piece of paper is worthless.

326
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,236
What do you mean? lt's a contract.
- Look at that added clause.

327
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,279
He can just claim he made the deal
to get information for a client.

328
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,432
He can always claim
that Lord Chelford...

329
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,913
is his client in this case.

330
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,071
ln this book...

331
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,958
ln this book, 2 pages are missing.
lf l had them, l could solve the problem.

332
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,312
Question, My Lord.
Where did your mother die?

333
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,350
Some sanatorium near Lausanne.
She'd been sick for years.

334
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,838
And there she was buried?

335
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,389
Yes.

336
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,711
Did Doctor Loxon treat your mother?
- Yes. Why do you ask?

337
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,193
l must ask. You told us she was interested
in the same treasure, didn't you?

338
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,351
My mother collected all the books
she could about the Chelford treasure.

339
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,353
My father wasn't very active.
But my mother was obsessed with it!

340
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,353
Not just because of the gold but
of some special drug was hidden with it.

341
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,951
Hello, Harry. Hello, lnspector.

342
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,710
How delightful to see you, Leslie.
l'm glad you came by.

343
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,832
So much for us to talk about.

344
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,799
Yes but l don't want to disturb you
while you talk to these people.

345
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,230
Allow me, My Lord, to say goodbye.
l must go to London.

346
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,753
You're going to London?
Since you are working on this murder case,

347
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,873
l thought that you might be here a while.
- There's nothing to worry about.

348
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,838
My assistant remains here.

349
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,154
He'll be quite busy.

350
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,430
My Lord, l will be quite busy
examining this labyrinth!

351
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,032
l don't mean to criticise
the place...

352
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,473
Horatio, why don't you just get started?
- Of course. lmmediately or sooner.

353
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,632
Yes, Sir. Promptness is the word!
- Come on.

354
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,950
That Puddler doesn't show
much interest in the case.

355
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,632
lt's just his job.
- l know it's his job.

356
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,950
He should work at it.
And your job will be with me.

357
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,951
l'm sorry you don't drop over more often.
- Every morning l ride by on horse back.

358
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,316
lt should be me, not Dick
that you come by to see.

359
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,470
When you ride by, l mean.
- Harry! You're misunderstanding.

360
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,950
l'm near my goal.
l'll do more with Fossaway in time.

361
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,950
My studies. You really mind?
- No. But, l'd like to help you.

362
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,918
Everyone wants to help me.

363
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,632
The treasure is mine, my dear.
You too.

364
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,552
Harry,
why do you want to marry me?

365
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,872
Why?

366
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,358
l am the last Chelford.

367
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,558
And what about love?

368
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,113
Love is for people who lack the ability
needed to face reality.

369
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,637
Chisel.

370
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
Do you understand?
lt means gravel and chisel.

371
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,878
lt makes no sense at all.

372
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,038
Harry? l must ask a question.

373
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,677
Then ask.

374
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,474
lf l were poor...

375
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,070
You are poor.

376
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,152
You are poor
because you belong to me.

377
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,272
You are my treasure,
and l will protect you.

378
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,154
My Lord, the books are here.

379
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,951
You can go.

380
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,879
Harry?

381
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,197
This way!

382
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,073
All afternoon l tried to ask.
But l couldn't get him to speak.

383
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,152
About anything.
Except the treasure!

384
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,550
You got nowhere, huh?
- You laugh, but there's a difference,

385
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,152
if a man marries money,
or just a girl.

386
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,030
Naturally. But is it so important?
- ln marriage, yes.

387
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,352
Leslie? Harry worries you,
doesn't he?

388
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,671
A funny engagement.

389
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,632
Do you think l should
go through with it?

390
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,712
What l want really isn't important.
- lt is!

391
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,876
Leslie, l have no money, either.
And, of course,

392
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,872
the House of Chelford
must have an heir.

393
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,758
l had better see you home.

394
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,992
A fine pair. Harry should see.
- Shh.

395
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,719
Come on!

396
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,750
l don't understand you.
Arthur spent all of your money?

397
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,753
Don't make it difficult for me.
You're Harry's fiance.

398
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,359
That's all.

399
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,270
Shall l tell Harry
that you're really a rich woman?

400
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,631
l'll tell him myself.

401
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,072
Shall l light a match?
- No. No light.

402
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,958
lncredible.
- Come on.

403
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,074
No! That's awful!
- They won't harm you!

404
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,958
Quiet down, will you? Hush!

405
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,559
There!

406
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,519
The chisel!

407
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,918
lt's heavy.
This is the gold!

408
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,237
What's that?
- There!

409
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,312
Help me!
- Are you crazy? Shut up, you fool!

410
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,834
l want to get out! Please!

411
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,038
Take me back!
l want to get out! Please!

412
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,229
Hurry!

413
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,199
You wait here. l'm going back there.
- No! Take me away from him, please!

414
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,670
l'm scared to death, Gilder!
He must be back there!

415
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,630
Believe me, he's hiding somewhere!
- You're just hysterical!

416
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,075
You wanna leave the gold here?
- We can come back tomorrow! Come! Hurry!

417
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,190
l have been waiting.
- The police have been everywhere,

418
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,272
l'm sorry.
- l understand. When will you return?

419
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,471
Monday at midnight.

420
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,552
Sir, l have to know
what you're looking for!

421
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,468
Sir! l'm from Scotland Yard!

422
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,032
lmpudent fool!
Doesn't know who l am!

423
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,632
Hands in theair!
Even if you're a ghost!

424
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,672
The law... l mean, an arm,
you see here.

425
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,519
Horatio W. Smith!

426
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,718
One, and two, and ho!

427
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,831
Do you want more?

428
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,591
With a fist? That's...

429
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,238
Listen here.
l've been working.

430
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,430
When they'reall put together,
they form a plan of the abbey.

431
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,793
lt's connected with the gold.

432
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,677
Well, hello. l thought you were afraid?
- Not so much as you think.

433
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,918
Where are the packages?

434
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,677
Vanished. And it's your fault!
- That vanishing act is your specialty.

435
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,630
You wrote a contract with me,
and it seems the ink...

436
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,516
took just 24 hours to vanish!
- Mary, listen.

437
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,118
lt was a joke.
- A joke?

438
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,198
You won't double-cross me twice!

439
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,670
Tell me where the gold is hidden!
- Mary! For God's sake!

440
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,670
Stand still, Gilder!
You scare me. Where is the gold?

441
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,838
Mary. This is so foolish.

442
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,916
Give it to me. Let me have that.
lt's dangerous!

443
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,031
One scandal after another!
First a murder, about which,

444
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,631
just nobody seems to care! Mr. Puddler
seems to be a visitor around here!

445
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,996
And now this!
As if l haven't been abused enough!

446
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,829
Miss Leslie Gine tells me,
my engagement to her is cancelled!

447
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,553
Things like that will happen sometimes!
- But to Lord Chelford?

448
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,118
Even the best families.

449
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,118
l might begin to think...

450
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,032
the reason for it all is Dick Alford.

451
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,632
But Harry, that's nonsense.
- Oh?

452
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,312
Then prove it.
l expect you, as my advisor,

453
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,630
to talk to the Gines,
and make them come to their senses.

454
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,670
lt can't be done, Harry!
Leslie can't be forced to marry you.

455
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,312
And why not?
Either she marries me,

456
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,352
or Arthur Gine will be
unemployed in my home!

457
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,916
And l'll see to it
that no one else employs him.

458
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,630
Mr. Alford, may l speak to you?
- l'm in a hurry right now.

459
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,152
l think you should here me out.
- Alright, talk to me.

460
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,312
l made an interesting discovery,
last night.

461
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,312
l saw the late Lady Chelford
in the abbey.

462
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,476
You saw Lady Chelford?
l think you suffer from hallucinations.

463
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,714
This kind of rambling is not of interest!
- Maybe the police will be interested.

464
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,152
What are you saying?
- l thought...

465
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,232
you'd prefer keeping it a secret.

466
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,391
lf you really feel
it's a police matter,

467
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,230
just inform the inspctor.
Mr. Streisser!

468
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,153
Are you mad? ln the middle of the day!
lnspector Puddler could see!

469
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,152
Don't worry. He's in London.
- What's going on?

470
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,118
Too much. And not good.

471
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,953
First, Alford made a threat to fire me.
- He noticed something?

472
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,473
Could be. Another thing:
Leslie cancelled her engagement to Harry.

473
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,718
Ah, that's interesting!

474
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,552
And third,
Gine has embezzled a huge amount.

475
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,632
How do you know that?
- Oh...

476
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,394
l keep my ears open.

477
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,551
Now, keep talking!

478
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,075
Gine told Alford he embezzled 50.000
pounds from the Lord Chelford accounts.

479
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,516
And Alford says,
he won't protect Gine any longer.

480
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,708
That's excellent news, Thomas.

481
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,269
Here.

482
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,919
A little extra.

483
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,312
And if Lord Chelford puts me out?

484
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,994
You needn't be worried.
l have...

485
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,831
l have another job,

486
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,032
that must be finished
in the next 24 hours.

487
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,633
l call it blackmail.
- But l just don't believe that Thomas...

488
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,110
would talk to Puddler about it.
- l hope, you're right!

489
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,630
Do you still believe, Doctor,
that the Chelford treasure...

490
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,232
could still exist?
- l guess it could.

491
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,708
Why are you so sceptical?

492
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,073
lf we knew that,
if we only knew for sure!

493
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,789
No doubt we'd be through
with the problem of the Gines.

494
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,919
Come in!

495
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,873
Where have you been? l was looking
for you! You don't look well.

496
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,670
l used to look better.
- l suppose you had a fight...

497
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,434
with the Black Abbot?
- l did!

498
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,871
Don't make jokes. What was it?
- A wrestling match with our phantom.

499
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,236
l was doing fine, believe me,
but he was unfair.

500
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,350
He hit me with his bare fist!
Don't believe me, hey?

501
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,793
Just a moment, Sir. Here it is.
Here's all the proof you need.

502
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,792
From his cowl?
- Yes, Sir. Before his...

503
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,270
sneaky illegal attack,
l had him in the judo hold, Sir.

504
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,270
And then, l passed out, cold.
- And, when you woke up?

505
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,270
He vanished.
- No! You had the Black Abbot and then...

506
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,797
let him get away. Did you see his face?
- The hood didn't come off.

507
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,156
He's human. You fought him, anyway.
All in all,

508
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,351
your encounter was worthwhile.
- You didn't get punched, Sir.

509
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,952
This might cheer you up:
lt seems, in London,

510
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,388
l might just have
the murder of Smooth solved.

511
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,832
So. One more tablet,
and l guarantee you will sleep well.

512
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,039
Huh... that's good.

513
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,150
Nothing but aggravation
and trouble in this house!

514
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,392
Dick. l believe he's
the cause of my trouble.

515
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,673
And l don't seem to be able to make
much progress in my research.

516
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,670
You still have faith in that?
- l haven't lost faith in it!

517
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,671
The same as my mother felt. Although,
she had more interest in the wonder-drug,

518
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,036
than the gold.
l'd give anything to have her back.

519
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,358
The treasure?
- Treasure?

520
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,157
Goodnight.

521
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,832
Who made that noise here?
- l was exercising,

522
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,153
and l kicked 2 chairs. Please excuse it.
- You won't solve the case that way.

523
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,869
l'm sorry, but this little exercise
makes the head clear. A few seconds,

524
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,032
and l'll bea fresh, new man!
- l hope so!

525
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,873
lf everybody had yoga training,
murder might not be committed.

526
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,350
Could be, standing on your head
seems to improve your mind.

527
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,873
lt completely clears the brain, and l...
- We came here to clear up a murder,

528
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,873
not to practice yoga here. We have
to check those who live in this house,

529
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,951
so stay on your feet!

530
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,754
Mr. Alford?

531
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,832
Yes?
- Anything wrong? l heard a noise.

532
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,670
Nothing, lnspector.
Thank you for checking, though.

533
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,989
Sorry l bothered you. Goodnight.
- Goodnight!

534
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,192
Now! What are you trying to do!

535
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,751
l hate you!

536
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,439
But, Harry...

537
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,397
Your nerves are playing tricks.
No one will harm you.

538
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,549
No?

539
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,716
The murderer!

540
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,792
The Black Abbot!
That fiend, Thomas!

541
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,678
Leslie!
All want my gold.

542
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,597
My gold!

543
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,199
You too!

544
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,189
Horatio?

545
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,194
Sir?
- What are you doing?

546
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,193
l'm working hard on the murder.
- More quietly, if you please.

547
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,871
Of course, Sir.

548
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,109
Lady Chelford!

549
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,198
Hello. Don't run away!

550
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,311
Wait, won't you?
Who are you?

551
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,232
That fellow, Thomas. ls he around?
- l've no idea.

552
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,710
Horatio, you see if you can find Thomas!
- Sure, Sir.

553
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,709
There!

554
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,469
Dead.

555
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,395
Remarkable. Only one shot
was fired with this weapon.

556
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,358
Where's Mr. Alford?
- l believe he ran over there.

557
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,959
Get back!

558
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,113
Come no closer!

559
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,312
Don't be foolish, Harry!
- The Black Abbot!

560
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,671
l shot him!

561
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,193
Nonsense, Harry! You have no pistol,
and you shot no one, do you hear?

562
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,670
You shot no one!
- Taking care of your cousin, Alford?

563
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,592
My Lord, what did you see?
- lnspector...

564
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,588
My cousin had a shock.

565
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,030
Thomas took a shot at him.
- No! Not Thomas! The Black Abbot!

566
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,958
And then, l...
- My cousin is completely bewildered!

567
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,390
Just let him talk, Mr. Alford!
My Lord, you can go on.

568
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,908
l was going to the abbey.
- And?

569
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,158
Suddenly, he was in front of me,
wearing a cowl.

570
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,631
The Black Abbot?
- Yes!

571
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,230
But he looked like my Mother.
l ran away, but he came after me!

572
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,479
Harry, you don't know what you're saying!
- Mr. Alford! l'll thank you not to...

573
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,950
interfere with the questioning!
- But believe me, lnspector!

574
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,031
lt was...her face.

575
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,272
lnspector,
you must not continue!

576
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,472
Help Lord Chelford to his room.
- Yes, Sir!

577
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,469
My Lord?

578
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,918
Better give me your revolver.

579
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,394
Haven't any.

580
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,115
Perhaps, you'll have it,
Mr. Alford?

581
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,511
Oh, please, lnspector...

582
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,597
Alright.

583
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,396
Sir! Sir!

584
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,916
Sir, l can't find that fellow.

585
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,432
Oh, my goodness!
l see you've found him, Sir.

586
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,677
And dead, quite dead!

587
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,429
Oh dear!

588
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,832
So, that's the Black Abbot.
- Just a fake.

589
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,716
You mean, there's another?
- Yes. The real one.

590
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,510
Listen, Dr. Loxon! What l was afraid of,
has happened:

591
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,318
Harry has seen her!
What did you say?

592
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,318
l think l got there in time.
No, she's unconscious now.

593
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,190
No, no. No hypo. But give Harry
2 tablets. Yellow ones.

594
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,878
Leslie, put your mind at ease.
lt's not as bad as it seems.

595
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,594
The forged signatures, l will acknowledge.
Those notes are going to be honoured.

596
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,190
Gilder tells the police
that my brother stole 50.000 pounds!

597
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,713
Aside from the forged signatures!
- We simply have to stop him!

598
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,196
How long did he say he'd wait?
- By tomorrow noon.

599
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,837
By tomorrow?

600
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,512
Well, l'll try to think of a way.
- Oh, Dick.

601
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,353
Might as well face it. How could we
ever raise such a fortune?

602
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,272
l marry Gilder,
or Arthur will go to prison.

603
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,711
You must remember, your brother is
already ruined. He's responsible for it.

604
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,190
You can't take your entire life,
and just give it up for him!

605
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,799
As much as you love him, he will have to
pay his own bills sooner or later.

606
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,952
The fellow really
can't entirely be saved.

607
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,033
You'll have to face it. He's letting you
suffer for it, and you shouldn't.

608
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,393
Leslie, with a man like Gilder,
marriage is out!

609
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,472
l'm sorry to disturb you again.
Hello!

610
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,792
lt looks like
you will make it a habit.

611
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,832
Excuse me, please.
l saw your car outside.

612
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,832
How long have you known Streisser?

613
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,637
Streisser?

614
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,032
Not at all!
- Well, that's strange!

615
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,272
lt seems you recommended him.

616
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,308
For a job at Fossaway.

617
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,589
Oh, so...

618
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,875
You mean Mr. Fortuna.
Now, this name, Streisser, l don't...

619
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,430
l'm sure you knew it.
Your straw man, the late Mr. Smooth,

620
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,953
was a great friend of Streisser.
Smooth gave him money regularly.

621
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,033
l have an idea it was your money.
- That's a complete false...

622
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,790
l can prove it. You can besure of that.
Streisser was in your employment.

623
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,872
And you used him at Fossaway
as a spy,

624
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,790
so you knew all along about the gold.
At your command,

625
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,116
Streisser murdered Smooth!
- Don't make such charges, lnspector!

626
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,512
What went on with those two,
l've no idea!

627
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,872
What do you say to this, then?
Your initials.

628
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,470
How did you get it?
- From your own man, Streisser.

629
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,470
He fired at Lord Chelford.
He wasn't able to tell me,

630
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,796
where the weapon came from.
- He simply stole it!

631
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,073
l'm going to show that rascal!
- l'm afraid not. The man's dead.

632
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,079
lnspector, you must not think that
l did it! That pistol, this morning...

633
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,551
was in my desk with some important papers.
They vanished, too.

634
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,110
What important papers?
- They're not... not important.

635
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,916
l wouldn't say that.
You're referring to these?

636
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,878
Yes!
- You know Miss Mary Wenner?

637
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,350
Miss Wenner? No.
- You should learn the names of your...

638
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,958
lady friends. Where is Miss Wenner?

639
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,554
How should l know that?

640
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,554
lt's bad?
- Yes.

641
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:57,553
l've been in touch with a famous
colleague over the telephone.

642
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,712
He says that she musn't be moved.
- Any pains?

643
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,030
No, l gave her an injection.
- A stranger ran away. From me.

644
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,718
A man, a man l never saw.

645
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,716
Why must he run off?
The Black Abbot isn't evil.

646
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,117
No! No!

647
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,832
lt's awful!
- Nothing we can do. Go now, Dick.

648
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,512
Yes, but Doctor, can't l just...
- No, she has to rest.

649
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,672
What can save her now,
is peace and quiet.

650
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,709
Finally!

651
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,635
l had an errand to take care of. Anyway,
l don't like the way you talk to me.

652
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,792
lt's too arrogant.
- You'll get used to it.

653
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,792
You'll have to get used to it.
- Think so?

654
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,590
Haven't you been talking to your sister?
- About what?

655
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,110
Now, you listen, Gine.
You act as if you think l'm joking!

656
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,596
l've kept quiet,
but your time is very nearly up.

657
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,632
l'll turn you in!
Unless,

658
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,158
Leslie will quickly marry me.
- She won't do it.

659
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,590
And you won't go to the police.
- You're annoying me, Gine.

660
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,070
l plan to. l found out you're
a murderer, you know.

661
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,677
Seems l saw you when you came out
of the gravel pit a few nights back.

662
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,954
That's nonsense!

663
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,517
What would l do down there?
- l asked myself that question.

664
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,153
But then l found Mary Wenner.
Quite dead. Lying there in that pit.

665
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,750
But l didn't do it!
- You think the police will believe that,

666
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,789
when they find out you, and Miss Mary were
out searching for the treasure together?

667
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,916
Swine! You killed Mary Wenner!
You're framing me,

668
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,516
so that you can get away
with that embezzlement! Blackmailer!

669
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,956
l don't like your tone.
As l mentioned before.

670
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,708
l can't let you leave my house alive.
Don't move!

671
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,470
l will shoot you like a dog!
And then l'll call the police.

672
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,590
And tell them you threatened me.
You threatened to shoot me.

673
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,752
And the gun you would use on me?

674
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,558
Beside you, on the wall.

675
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,672
And the rifle?
lt's near your hand.

676
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,752
You simply didn't have a chance,
you know.

677
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,314
Spare me a moment?

678
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,550
lnspector. Why do you sit down there?
- l play hide and seek.

679
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,076
Same as you.
- What on earth would l have to hide?

680
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,232
Maybe a revolver
you took from His Lordship.

681
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,593
lnspector, we can talk about it later.
l have to look for Harry.

682
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,752
l just checked upon his room.
- ls he asleep?

683
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,070
No. He's not in his room at all.
- What? You saw him go out?

684
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,597
Do you believe l would have allowed it?
l've checked the entire house.

685
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,071
Horatio is searching outside.
- l'll get the servants to search for him.

686
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,436
Nobody, please.
- l feel responsible for Harry!

687
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,152
Do you?
- lf something happens to him...

688
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,752
What could happen?
You have his revolver.

689
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,672
Yes, that's so, but...
- Mr. Alford?

690
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,878
You started to tell me.

691
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,992
Could it have been
why Thomas was shot?

692
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:58,190
Harry did shoot him, then.
- Well, yes. But in his own defence.

693
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,954
Out of fear?

694
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,393
l think he would kill anyone
he thinks might be the Black Abbot.

695
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,078
Do you think so?
- Yes. l'm convinced.

696
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,232
Meanwhile, Mr. Alford,
l have to ask you this:

697
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,272
How does Harry feel
toward Lady Chelford?

698
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,192
l believe they both, heand his Moth...
his Mother's picture!

699
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,314
The head!
- Cut out!

700
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,632
But, by whom?
- l believe it was Harry.

701
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,431
His mother was also a bit odd, huh?
- Yes. Doctor Loxon has been afraid...

702
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,672
that Harry might have
mental trouble, too.

703
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,874
Hello? Ah, Doctor Loxon!

704
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,479
Any pains?

705
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:01,195
Dr. Loxon, please come over to the house.
Yes, l'm afraid it's about Harry.

706
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,995
Bye.

707
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,714
Lady Chelford?
- Yes.

708
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,632
How'd you know?
- Simply guessed.

709
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,632
l hope you and Doctor Loxon
tell me the whole story.

710
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,469
Yes, lnspector.

711
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,553
My uncle, Harry's father,
and Doctor Loxon, were good friends.

712
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,553
His last wish was that Harry
should never know about his mother.

713
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:31,515
And Doctor Loxon was afraid that
a meeting between Harry and his mother...

714
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,553
would make Harry a mental patient.
- So, he brought Lady Joan to his house,

715
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,030
and issued an announcement
that she had passed away.

716
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:43,553
Yes. And Lady Chelford, in her fancy,
thought that a wonder-drug...

717
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,632
from the Black Abbot
would help her.

718
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:52,919
Dr. Loxon and you, Mr. Alford, had to take
on the role of the Black Abbot for her.

719
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,671
You know that, too.
You're a clairvoyant.

720
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,872
Not at all.
l would know where Harry is.

721
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,192
Here she is!
My mother, you know.

722
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,310
l loved her much more,
but everyone wants me to fear.

723
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,030
Absolutely, Harry. But please,
please let me loose.

724
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,472
l might do it later.
l mustn't let you go now!

725
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,990
l must keep you here!
- But you promised to take me to Dick!

726
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,230
You said that he'd been hurt!
- That was because...

727
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,872
l had to fool you, my dear.
l'm smart.

728
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,272
They all think l'm dumb!
They all do, all!

729
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,592
With my mother, it was a trick!

730
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,192
Just to scare me!
lt was to steal my gold!

731
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,950
Harry, let me free, please,
if you love me. The rope hurts!

732
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,478
Leslie, love often hurts.

733
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,158
l'm the 18th Lord Chelford!

734
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,914
The gold is mine!

735
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,594
No... not mine.

736
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,074
Yours, Leslie.

737
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,278
We're so lucky, my darling.

738
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,313
Believe me. l'll find the gold.
l've been studying for so long.

739
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,078
l know where to look!

740
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,677
l'm sure!

741
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,678
You'll see how clever l am!

742
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,794
Help! Help!

743
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,554
A 4 hour search,

744
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,798
and nothing.
Except, a dead woman.

745
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,793
This complicates things even more.
- Do you believe that Harry...

746
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,270
No, no. The murderer of Mary Wenner
is someone else.

747
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,917
Sir! Sir!

748
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,790
l've been told that Dick Alford
was hurt. Good day. Oh!

749
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,790
You! You seem to be alright.
- What is all this foolishness?

750
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,313
The Gines's porter told me about
a phonecall for Miss Leslie to...

751
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,313
come to the abbey, where Mr. Alford was.
That Mr. Alford was wounded.

752
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,313
On the way here, l stopped at the abbey,
and found nothing. Except a hole...

753
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,312
l had never seen there.
- Where was it?

754
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,313
Near the tower. l was ready to dive
right in to that hole, like a shot!

755
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,790
But then, l stopped,
and l said to myself, l said, listen.

756
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,472
Horatio, you have orders
not to be careless!

757
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:54,315
So l reported it. Sir? Sir!
Wait for Horatio! Sir?

758
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,759
Safe at last!

759
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,470
They cannot find this placeat all.
Never! You hear!

760
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,192
Sir! Everyone's ready.
- Fine. Let's go.

761
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,078
This must be the cave.

762
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,872
There are numbers
written on the map here.

763
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,112
Sir! That plan is like
a chess board layout.

764
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,958
And so is the floor! D...

765
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,711
A, B, C, D!

766
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,394
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!

767
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,792
There, it must be right there!

768
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,918
Mr. Alford, l am a genius!

769
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,398
Gilder!
- Yes, another corpse.

770
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,514
Slugged from behind.

771
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,191
Must have hit him with this.
- l guess the Black Abbot ran into him.

772
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:44,193
You'd better say: Lord Chelford.
- lf only l knew where they had gone to!

773
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,272
Let's figure out where we go from here.

774
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,230
Here, that chess plan won't help you, now.
- No, Sir!

775
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,594
Oh, well. Come on!

776
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,870
Here, the whole map.
lt's difficult to read down here.

777
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,239
Lights here, men!

778
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,673
Horatio! Send two men to the house
to get some shovels, quick!

779
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,118
Very good, Sir! Here.

780
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,239
What happened?

781
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,397
Hello, up there? Please don't
come down here! You'll get wet!

782
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,952
What happened to you, Horatio?
- Nothing.

783
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,114
l'm taking a bath.

784
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,474
Help me! Help me!

785
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,912
Quiet! lf anybody needs help,
l do!

786
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,394
That was Leslie! One moment, l'm coming!
- Wait! There's no room here!

787
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,991
Oh, no! Help!

788
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,757
Leslie!

789
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,754
Wake up. Leslie!

790
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,351
l'll takecare of you,
takecare of you...

791
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,069
Have to...

792
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,351
have to watch for them.

793
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,910
Can you seeanything?
- Someone just ran by with a torch.

794
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,358
lt's dark again, now, Sir.

795
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,999
Don't do that.

796
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,511
Wet down there, Sir.

797
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,869
There, Sir!

798
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,109
Don't shoot!

799
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,558
He went down there!
- Be still! Now what?

800
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,589
Here.

801
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,629
Harry!

802
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,914
Harry, listen to me!

803
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,434
Leslie! We must run!

804
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,072
Don't worry,
you'll go with me. Come!

805
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,599
Halt! Stop right there!

806
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,559
Oh!
- Close call.

807
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,790
lt surely was. But l'm entitled
to a new hat, you see?

808
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,189
Leslie!

809
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,319
Put out the torch.

810
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,710
Horatio, you remain here.
- Of course, Sir.

811
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,112
Harry! Harry, we won't hurt you!

812
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,679
Wounded?
- Slightly.

813
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,437
He can't shoot forever.

814
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,509
Sand.

815
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,759
Just sand.

816
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,393
He'll run out of bullets, l hope.
l'm going to shoot over head.

817
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,035
Harry?

818
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,149
Come here.

819
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,479
l'm not armed.

820
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,269
See, Harry?

821
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,519
Don't be frightened.

822
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,751
lt's alright, Harry.
- My gold!

823
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,239
Leslie, answer!

824
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,312
l won't give them to you!
l won't do it!

825
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,279
Look out!

826
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,315
Harry!

827
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,278
There was a treasure.
- Sir!

828
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,390
l was so cold, l changed my clothes, Sir.
- Why the hood?

829
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,556
That's the natural modesty in me
coming out, Sir!
