1
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:18,398
<i>"Dream..."</i>

2
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:26,436
<i>"...when you're feeling blue"</i>

3
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:31,815
<i>"Dream..."</i>

4
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:38,388
<i>"...that's the thing to do"</i>

5
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:52,502
<i>"Things never are
as bad as they seem"</i>

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,175
<i>"So... Dream"</i>

7
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>"Dream, dream..."</i>

8
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:41,918
<i>On April 8, 2000,
Mark Hogancamp was in a bar.</i>

9
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:46,790
<i>He left the bar
about closing time.</i>

10
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:51,161
<i>And a group of 5 individuals had
been in the bar harassing him,</i>

11
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,733
<i>...then they went outside, followed
him, and beat him senseless.</i>

12
00:01:56,801 --> 00:02:02,906
Stomped on him, and did some
pretty bad damage to his brain.

13
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:09,746
<i>The doctors had to
rebuild his face.</i>

14
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:14,051
The impact on the brain
from the assault...

15
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:17,721
...was such that he was
in a coma for 9 days.

16
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:24,895
<i>To see your 38-year-old son
having to learn how to eat again,</i>

17
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:26,763
...taking his first steps.

18
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:32,402
I mean, seeing your 38-year-old
son starting to walk again.

19
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,640
And seeing it,
it's heart breaking.

20
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,044
<i>He was there for 40 days
in the hospital.</i>

21
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:45,415
And then they dismissed him
because he couldn't pay for it...

22
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,818
...when he was on Medicaid.

23
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,987
<i>I took care of Mark
for 2 years...</i>

24
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,123
...after he got out
of the hospital.

25
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:56,326
I mean, he really literally
had to learn everything over.

26
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,999
<i>He went to therapy
for a very short time.</i>

27
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,169
<i>It was... all these physical
therapies he went through...</i>

28
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,839
<i>...and talking and word
search and all this stuff.</i>

29
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,441
He was just starting to get, you
know, some of this stuff back...

30
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:12,442
...when they just, like,
cut if off.

31
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,144
"That's it.
That's all you get."

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,047
<i>Then you come home
from work...</i>

33
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:21,952
...and he's building this
little miniature building,

34
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,590
<i>...and looks like hell, just
made from old plywood...</i>

35
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:29,860
<i>...and nasty stuff and pieces of
stuff you find around the yard.</i>

36
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:35,165
<i>But it's developed into
a world, his own world.</i>

37
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,372
This is me.

38
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,375
After the attack,
of course.

39
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,644
Always smoking.

40
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:52,649
Um, I used to carry
one revolver.

41
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:59,022
And then general Patton
gave me his other revolver.

42
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,424
So now I have two.

43
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:07,130
<i>Because the general just wants
to hang out, have a drink.</i>

44
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,920
<i>What's this
all about, man?</i>

45
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:20,837
<i>When the teenagers
kicked my head to pieces,</i>

46
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,807
<i>...they wiped, I mean,
everything.</i>

47
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,509
<i>All memory of everything.</i>

48
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:35,085
<i>My memories that I do get,
they come back in stills,</i>

49
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:38,688
<i>...just a single shot,
but no context.</i>

50
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:45,662
<i>Alls I have is a photo to remind
me that, OK, I was married, wow.</i>

51
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,164
<i>To a good-looking girl, too.</i>

52
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:53,904
<i>She was a Russian polish.
Anastasia.</i>

53
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,240
<i>I started to ask questions...</i>

54
00:05:57,308 --> 00:06:01,678
<i>...because I didn't know
who I was.</i>

55
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:04,414
<i>I had to ask other people.
What was I like?</i>

56
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:07,684
Was I bad guy?
Was I mean? Was I?

57
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:10,487
And they would tell me,
"No, you weren't mean."

58
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:13,356
"You were just drunk."

59
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,959
<i>You know, you were
an all right guy.</i>

60
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,294
<i>"Did I hurt anyone?"</i>

61
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,664
"No, you just hurt
yourself."

62
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,368
<i>Then I started finding
my drunk journals...</i>

63
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,970
<i>...and started reading those...</i>

64
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,472
...because I wanted
to find out who I was.

65
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,075
<i>For real.</i>

66
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:35,545
<i>'Cause the only one
that would know...</i>

67
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:38,615
<i>...is the guy who was writing
them, who was me.</i>

68
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,917
<i>Maybe not in the right
frame of mind,</i>

69
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,686
<i>...but it was me.</i>

70
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:46,623
<i>It's all messed up like this
because I was hammered.</i>

71
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:51,795
"I'm gonna die tonight."

72
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:55,365
And, oh, January 19, 1993.

73
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,368
<i>"Last entry."</i>

74
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:03,239
<i>And I was like, my god.</i>

75
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:05,375
It was like reading
something...

76
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,143
...that Stephen King wrote
or something.

77
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:11,014
It was bad.

78
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:17,354
I never want to see
this guy again.

79
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,431
<i>I figured, all right, well, what's
the first thing I got to work on?</i>

80
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,068
<i>That's my imagination.</i>

81
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,377
<i>I came flying over in my
P-40 Warhawk. On fire.</i>

82
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,280
<i>And I saw a field
down below.</i>

83
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,617
<i>And I crash landed it.</i>

84
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:52,489
<i>And when I walked
into town,</i>

85
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,091
<i>...there was nobody there.</i>

86
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:03,566
<i>And then one by one, beautiful
barbie-looking women...</i>

87
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:06,703
<i>...started emerging.</i>

88
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:14,110
<i>I was the only man in town
with 27 barbies.</i>

89
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,816
<i>The S.S., I found out later,</i>

90
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,052
<i>...went through there
and killed men.</i>

91
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:25,488
<i>It was like a desolate town.</i>

92
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,402
<i>And they all hid
when the S.S. were there.</i>

93
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,939
<i>So they came out
and they thanked me.</i>

94
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,243
<i>I was thinking, "Boy, what
a lucky guy I am."</i>

95
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:51,381
<i>So they gave me my
own place, my own building,</i>

96
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,850
<i>...which I turned into a bar.</i>

97
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,729
<i>I used to work there
5 days a week.</i>

98
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,065
<i>You know, 10 hours a day.</i>

99
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,535
<i>But now I just work
once a week,</i>

100
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,437
<i>...and it's 4 or 5 hours
a week,</i>

101
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:20,944
<i>...just so I can get used to
doing things again.</i>

102
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:27,283
<i>Mark's job is... he kind of does
anything I ask him, really.</i>

103
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,551
Doesn't come in too much...

104
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,520
<i>...because it's
too much for him...</i>

105
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:34,824
<i>...if he's around a lot of
people and a lot of stress.</i>

106
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:38,428
<i>He came to me,
he was in recovery.</i>

107
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,730
<i>Didn't last long.</i>

108
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:43,032
<i>And he was awful.</i>

109
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,502
<i>He drank.
Sometimes he came to work,</i>

110
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,504
<i>...sometimes, like he said,
he would have a shot...</i>

111
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,072
<i>...just to steady himself
for the day...</i>

112
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,242
<i>...and just call in
and say, I'm not coming.</i>

113
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,645
<i>After he got out
of the hospital,</i>

114
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:56,813
<i>...it was like somebody
turned a switch.</i>

115
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,084
<i>He had no interest in
alcohol at all. At all.</i>

116
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:05,355
<i>After the attack, when I started
coming around back here,</i>

117
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:09,559
...I looked at the bottles and I
don't get that same feeling.

118
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:11,528
Nothing happens when
I look at the bottle.

119
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,963
It's like liquor, booze,
that's it.

120
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:18,201
I mean, if I don't remember
what it's like to be drunk...

121
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,705
...or what it tastes like,
then I don't miss it.

122
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,058
<i>I just figured I'd be like Sam
Malone, you know, from "Cheers."</i>

123
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:44,394
<i>You know, he's
a recovering alcoholic...</i>

124
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,297
<i>...and he is a bartender.</i>

125
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:52,669
<i>I made my alter ego figure
drink only coffee...</i>

126
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,270
<i>...because that's what
I do in real life,</i>

127
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:57,473
<i>...drink tons of coffee.</i>

128
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,344
<i>Does anybody ever try and
offer your alter ego a beer?</i>

129
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,313
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

130
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
<i>And what happens?</i>

131
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,216
<i>I just tell them
I don't drink.</i>

132
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:10,653
<i>The only entertainment I could
think of was cat fighting.</i>

133
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:15,291
<i>So I paid the girls
to cat fight.</i>

134
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:20,296
<i>Staged cat fights for
entertainment purposes only.</i>

135
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:25,101
<i>I named my club,
besides Hogancamp's,</i>

136
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,970
<i>...I added a little bit more.</i>

137
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:30,373
<i>Hogancamp's
ruined stocking.</i>

138
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:34,544
<i>Cat fight club.
The only one in Belgium.</i>

139
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:43,386
<i>This place. Just looking
at it soothes me.</i>

140
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:56,966
<i>I used to be able to draw
anything that came to my mind,</i>

141
00:11:57,034 --> 00:12:01,337
<i>...but now, since
the attack, I can't</i>

142
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>...because my hand
shakes too much.</i>

143
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,778
<i>This one was evidence.</i>

144
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,047
<i>Still has
the evidence sticker.</i>

145
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>His drawings were there
to show to the jury...</i>

146
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,754
...what this individual
was capable of doing.

147
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,590
Brain damage you can't
see with your own eyes,

148
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,625
...but you can see
the manifestations...

149
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,128
...from what people have
been able to do before...

150
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,829
...to what they can do now.

151
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:44,947
Mom, I'm home.

152
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,951
I need supplies.

153
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,288
<i>When Mark first
came in after the attack,</i>

154
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,424
<i>...he was very upset.</i>

155
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,959
<i>His hand wasn't steady
enough to do anything.</i>

156
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,097
<i>And he was afraid that he wasn't
gonna be able to continue,</i>

157
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,767
<i>...and that just frustrated
the heck out of him.</i>

158
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,972
<i>So we encouraged him.</i>

159
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,209
<i>And Janet, when he
didn't have any money,</i>

160
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,112
<i>...she'd give him a kit or
something to work with.</i>

161
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,914
<i>He kept bringing things
in to show us.</i>

162
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,416
And you could see
the excitement in him,

163
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:24,320
...like, "Yeah, yeah, it's there.
I hope to get better at it."

164
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,026
I'm in
the Hobby Shop.

165
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:31,461
I just love
the Hobby Shop.

166
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,063
You get too...
You get too excited.

167
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,904
<i>Everything's real.</i>

168
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:44,440
<i>The slide on the .45.</i>

169
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:47,443
<i>The hammer.</i>

170
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:50,546
<i>The clip even comes out.</i>

171
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:56,419
<i>So that adds to my,
you know, verbosity...</i>

172
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,155
<i>...of getting into it,
into the story,</i>

173
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,656
<i>...because I know
everything works.</i>

174
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:04,093
<i>I almost know what everything...
What every Satchel's carrying.</i>

175
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:06,462
<i>You know, that's grenades.</i>

176
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,500
This is the briefcase
I carry around.

177
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,369
<i>In here we have money,</i>

178
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,304
<i>...the detonator,</i>

179
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:17,907
<i>...and then certificate
of ownership...</i>

180
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:22,979
<i>...that I made up myself for my
doll figure to carry around...</i>

181
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:26,215
<i>...because this proves
I own the bar, then.</i>

182
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,923
<i>This is my mom,
my mother.</i>

183
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:39,996
<i>This is from the movie
"Goldfinger," 007.</i>

184
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,932
<i>Pussy Galore
was her name.</i>

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,603
<i>Anyway, yeah, it looks
just like my mom.</i>

186
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,539
<i>When my mother
came to visit,</i>

187
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:55,144
...I said, "mom, mom, look, there's you.
You're tending bar."

188
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:57,814
Then she... "Yeah, OK."

189
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:02,585
Didn't even look.
Just walked right past it.

190
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:06,088
So it's like... but it's
my mom, you know.

191
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,792
So I gotta have
my mom in here...

192
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,694
...in my town.

193
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:24,607
<i>This is how I work
on patience.</i>

194
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,277
<i>This is how I work
on dexterity.</i>

195
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,551
<i>Training my right hand
to be a little bit calmer,</i>

196
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,920
<i>...not shake so much.</i>

197
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:44,160
<i>I'm amazed how I can talk
about this...</i>

198
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:47,697
<i>...and actually do it
at the same time.</i>

199
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:50,132
<i>That's a first.</i>

200
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:58,841
<i>I started needing vehicles
for my town.</i>

201
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,044
<i>And the tires,
they looked so brand new.</i>

202
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:04,647
<i>They got the little factory
seam around every one.</i>

203
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,649
<i>It looks like it just
rolled out a show room.</i>

204
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:07,984
<i>I don't want that.</i>

205
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,587
<i>So I start dragging stuff.</i>

206
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:20,396
<i>The jeep has
180 miles on it.</i>

207
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:25,835
Which is 1,080 miles
in 1/6 scale.

208
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,472
<i>When I'm even walking,</i>

209
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,774
<i>...I have to constantly
look at my feet.</i>

210
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>I can't look around like other
people do and just walk...</i>

211
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,714
<i>...because otherwise I'll wind
up in the middle of the road...</i>

212
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:39,782
<i>...or something like that.</i>

213
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:43,719
<i>So I've always got to look
at what's ahead.</i>

214
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,992
<i>I'm walking along.
I'm walking on that white line.</i>

215
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,496
<i>I always have to keep on
looking down,</i>

216
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:56,566
<i>...make sure I'm
walking on that.</i>

217
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:02,271
<i>And I still lose my balance and
stuff when I'm doing that,</i>

218
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,575
<i>...but I'm getting better
at it.</i>

219
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,430
<i>Americans and Germans
were wandering into the town...</i>

220
00:17:27,497 --> 00:17:29,332
<i>...either because
they were lost...</i>

221
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,969
<i>...or they just came
across the town.</i>

222
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:35,137
There was one rule
in my town.

223
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:38,441
That... friends.
Be friendly with each other.

224
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,444
Behave.
So they did. They were.

225
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:47,984
<i>The Americans, the British,
the Germans,</i>

226
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,253
<i>...they all drink together, they
all smoke cigarettes together.</i>

227
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,991
<i>Everybody be friends
with each other.</i>

228
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:57,460
<i>The Germans,
when they were there,</i>

229
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:00,096
<i>...I told them they have to get
along with the Americans.</i>

230
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,299
<i>And as long as I gave them booze
and a couple of cat fights,</i>

231
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:07,303
<i>...staged cat fights, between
the girls, they were happy.</i>

232
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:11,540
<i>So the Americans and Germans sat
together, drinking together.</i>

233
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:14,043
<i>Everybody got along.</i>

234
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:17,546
<i>Nobody was against
anybody else.</i>

235
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:20,616
<i>It didn't matter
what clothing they wore.</i>

236
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:28,224
<i>When I get that new character
and I open up that box,</i>

237
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,695
<i>...the first thing I look at
is their face.</i>

238
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:37,566
<i>And then I think, who does
that remind me of that I know,</i>

239
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:41,203
<i>...that I want to portray with
an alter ego in my town.</i>

240
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:45,074
<i>And then that's
their alter ego.</i>

241
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,615
She looks like Pam.

242
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,051
A girl I know, Pam.

243
00:18:55,118 --> 00:19:00,122
That's married.
Down at the anchorage.

244
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,193
So I think I'm gonna
make her Pam.

245
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:06,762
Pam.

246
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,133
<i>Then sometimes I just do
a quick thing like this.</i>

247
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,035
<i>Like, oh-ho ho.</i>

248
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:15,805
<i>Like they're hugging me.
Like they bought me and stuff.</i>

249
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,643
<i>I know what it's like
to build things in miniature...</i>

250
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:26,615
<i>...and want to have, like,
a society outside of society,</i>

251
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:29,351
<i>...a smaller society.</i>

252
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,088
When Mark creates
a character for you,

253
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:34,523
...that's really a way
Mark honors you.

254
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,891
And I felt
very honored...

255
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,694
...when Mark made me
part of his town.

256
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,398
My doll, I believe
he's a British commando.

257
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:45,301
I think it's
a handsome doll, myself.

258
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:48,037
<i>There's always something
going on at Marwencol.</i>

259
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:52,174
<i>There's always danger. There's
always the S.S. trying to attack.</i>

260
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:54,276
I've taken place
in many battles,

261
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:58,414
...and we usually
come out on top.

262
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,489
<i>Everybody
at one time or another...</i>

263
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:09,291
<i>...wishes they had a double
that could do things...</i>

264
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,461
<i>...that they could never do.</i>

265
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:15,197
<i>So what I do is
with alter egos,</i>

266
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:18,734
<i>...I tell my friends,
you can be anybody you want,</i>

267
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,905
<i>...you can do anything
you want in my town.</i>

268
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,641
<i>Have as many girls
as you want.</i>

269
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,077
<i>I only... I have 27 barbies,</i>

270
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,080
...so we have to keep enough
for the other dudes.

271
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,385
<i>Mediterranean Lisa said,</i>

272
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:41,757
<i>...I want to have a tall, dark,
and handsome boyfriend.</i>

273
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,926
<i>I said, OK.</i>

274
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:47,663
<i>So I put her with Yazi
the Navajo Indian.</i>

275
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:51,033
And she said, he's gorgeous.
He's perfect.

276
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:54,503
<i>But she didn't know
I had a Steve McQueen doll.</i>

277
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:59,008
<i>When she found that out, she wanted
to drop the Navajo like a hot cake.</i>

278
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:02,978
<i>And now Steve McQueen’s
her boyfriend.</i>

279
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:14,557
I am Mediterranean Lisa,
and this is my doll.

280
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,358
I am now dating
Steve McQueen.

281
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm very happy about that.

282
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,116
<i>A couple buddies of mine...</i>

283
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:46,789
<i>...were looking at
my town one day...</i>

284
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:51,527
<i>...and it was all, you know, the
soldiers out there and stuff.</i>

285
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:54,029
<i>And I had a barbie.</i>

286
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:58,367
And one of them said, "hey,
look, man, it's a barbie."

287
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:02,371
And I says, "Yeah, what do
you want it to be, gay town,"

288
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,806
"...with all dudes in it?"

289
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:06,742
He's like, "No."

290
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,012
I said, "Man, all the dudes
got to have some women."

291
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,117
You know what I mean. I...
I love the thought of women.

292
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:18,187
You know, so I want women
in my town.

293
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:42,278
<i>This is the last
girlfriend that I had.</i>

294
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:45,447
<i>9 years ago.</i>

295
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:51,854
It's the last time I ever
felt a woman, hugged a woman.

296
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,522
Kissed a woman.

297
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,926
<i>The first 4 years
of that 9 years...</i>

298
00:22:56,993 --> 00:23:01,163
<i>...was because I was a drunk and I
didn't care to look for women.</i>

299
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,365
<i>I'd just rather drink.</i>

300
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>And the last 5 years,
I've been me being busy,</i>

301
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:17,046
<i>...trying to get back
my senses,</i>

302
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:21,283
<i>...fine motor skills.</i>

303
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:26,922
<i>I have to learn that
all over again, sex.</i>

304
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,424
Because I don't know...

305
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,226
...I don't remember
what it was like.

306
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:35,664
<i>That's what I used to do
to my wife...</i>

307
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,666
<i>...when I would come off
the ship.</i>

308
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:40,569
<i>Come home
and attack her.</i>

309
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,906
<i>She'd be waiting.</i>

310
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:50,145
<i>I wish I had somebody to come
over, a girl preferably,</i>

311
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:53,916
...to manipulate
the female dolls.

312
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:55,417
That'd be neat...

313
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:59,922
Playing dolls
with a girlfriend.

314
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:34,823
<i>My bedroom window was right across
the street from a big house...</i>

315
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,460
<i>...with a white picket fence...</i>

316
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:43,032
<i>...and a big tall blonde
lived over there.</i>

317
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:47,669
We would... you know, if I was
outside and she was outside,

318
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,939
...we'd, you know, meet
at the picket fence.

319
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:54,076
And the other neighbor,
Betty, would come over.

320
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:55,344
And then the three of us...

321
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,812
...would be at
the white picket fence.

322
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,882
So I dubbed it
the gossip fence.

323
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,552
It was great.

324
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,088
She was just so beautiful.

325
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:07,956
Hi, I'm Colleen,

326
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:10,159
...and this is my home.

327
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,762
And this is where Mark
and I used to talk...

328
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,500
...and gossip by my fence.

329
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:21,170
I like blondes
to begin with, so.

330
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:24,039
'Cause of my ex-wife.

331
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,809
She's blonde.

332
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:30,145
<i>You know, so I experienced
the feeling of a crush.</i>

333
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:34,216
<i>What it is to want
someone.</i>

334
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:36,618
I have 3 children.
I'm married.

335
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:39,555
I didn't know about
that. Can't have her.

336
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,423
You know, I just...

337
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:44,593
Oh, innocent me.

338
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:46,695
<i>I didn't understand it.</i>

339
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:50,165
<i>I mean, I didn't want
to steal her away.</i>

340
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,668
<i>I just wanted
to let her know...</i>

341
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:57,339
<i>...that she was on
some scrumptious.</i>

342
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:01,243
<i>Mark had shared with me,
like, certain pictures...</i>

343
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,246
<i>...that he had been taking,
photographs,</i>

344
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,549
<i>...and telling me certain
story lines that he had had.</i>

345
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,953
<i>And I just kept telling him
to go with it.</i>

346
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,958
<i>My husband was just like,
you know, you got to be aware.</i>

347
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,294
<i>Just be aware.</i>

348
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:20,696
She matches.

349
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:22,865
I mean, her shirt matches
her little sparkles.

350
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:25,200
And that's what Mark was
probably thinking, too.

351
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:28,570
I was like, yep, that's me.
A barbie doll.

352
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,806
<i>This is the Colleen doll.</i>

353
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:33,442
<i>I did her hair last night.</i>

354
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:39,214
<i>Um, when I wash it
and all that crap.</i>

355
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:41,016
<i>Get all the chemicals out.</i>

356
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:45,420
<i>I put more chemicals in
by spraying it...</i>

357
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:47,189
<i>...and combing it and stuff.</i>

358
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:52,294
But this is how it dries...

359
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,163
<i>Close to her head,</i>

360
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,200
<i>...not sticking out way out here
like it was yesterday.</i>

361
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:04,139
<i>And Colleen has this nice
little one piece of hair...</i>

362
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,841
<i>...that always, you know...</i>

363
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:08,944
<i>A strand that always
hangs down and stuff.</i>

364
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:13,282
Hey. She looks hot.

365
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:20,255
<i>Anyway, I'm putting Manolo
Blahnik slingbacks on Colleen...</i>

366
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:23,192
<i>...'cause she deserves that.</i>

367
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,628
<i>So we were just talking...</i>

368
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>...and he goes, "what would
you name a store?"</i>

369
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,800
There would used to be a store,
and I used to love this store,

370
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,635
...but it actually went
out of business.

371
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:36,438
And it was pocket
full of posies.

372
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:37,973
So I built it.

373
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,175
So I preserved Colleen,

374
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,811
...and I can have her
in my town.

375
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:56,692
<i>"I'm making believe"</i>

376
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>"That you're in my arms"</i>

377
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:05,167
<i>"Though I know
you're so far away"</i>

378
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:11,106
<i>"Making believe
I'm talking to you"</i>

379
00:28:11,174 --> 00:28:16,078
<i>"Wish you could hear
what I say"</i>

380
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:22,084
<i>"And here in the gloom
of my lonely room"</i>

381
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:27,856
<i>"We're dancing
like we used to do"</i>

382
00:28:27,924 --> 00:28:34,630
<i>"Making believe is just
another way of dreaming"</i>

383
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:38,600
<i>"So till my dreams
come true"</i>

384
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:42,738
<i>"I'll whisper good night"</i>

385
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,807
<i>"Turn out the light
and kiss my pillow"</i>

386
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:51,213
<i>"Making believe it's you"</i>

387
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,884
OK.

388
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:01,823
<i>Mark had gotten
into a conversation with me...</i>

389
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,459
<i>...and he was showing me
some certain pictures.</i>

390
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:06,595
<i>I says, look, look,</i>

391
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,196
<i>...I even put your name
on the car door,</i>

392
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:10,232
<i>...my name on that
car door.</i>

393
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,001
<i>You're here, I'm here.</i>

394
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:17,839
And he was like, well, they're getting
married on such and such day.

395
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:23,111
<i>I said, what, you know,
we're engaged.</i>

396
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,579
As he was telling me,

397
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:29,017
...it was like he was telling me about
it like it was somebody else,

398
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:30,585
...like it was two other people.

399
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,722
And then when he told me
it was us,

400
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,625
...and I was just like...
What?

401
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:41,296
<i>Hello. You're talking to a real
person, and there's dolls.</i>

402
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:44,933
<i>You have to know
when you have to stop.</i>

403
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:53,275
<i>So I go outside
sulking and stuff.</i>

404
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:58,814
<i>And there's Deja Thorus, the
Belgian witch of Marwencol.</i>

405
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:02,451
<i>And I explained to her
what went on with Colleen.</i>

406
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:06,688
<i>And just then,
here comes Colleen...</i>

407
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:16,365
<i>...waving, "How you doing,
Mark?" And everything.</i>

408
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:19,234
<i>And poof her
out of her shoes,</i>

409
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:21,136
<i>...get rid of her forever
out of Marwencol.</i>

410
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:24,106
<i>Just get rid of her
for me.</i>

411
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:28,944
<i>So I didn't complain.</i>

412
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:31,413
<i>So who's that?</i>

413
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:36,151
<i>Anna. That's Anna,
my favorite female doll.</i>

414
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,887
<i>I wish that she would
come alive.</i>

415
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:42,691
<i>I won a photo contest...</i>

416
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,727
<i>...and with that money,
I bought Anna.</i>

417
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:47,028
<i>Sorry.</i>

418
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,866
<i>When I first got the doll, I
fell in love with her face.</i>

419
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,435
<i>So much that I had to
paint makeup on her.</i>

420
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:59,040
<i>And being that
I'm alone in life,</i>

421
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:03,445
<i>...I figure at least
my alter ego...</i>

422
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:06,181
<i>...can have a girlfriend.</i>

423
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,424
<i>Every night she's next to
my bed, I stare at her...</i>

424
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:18,760
<i>...and I wish and I wish
and I wish...</i>

425
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:23,398
<i>...that I could find a girl
that looks just like her.</i>

426
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:38,847
<i>When I first saw Mark,</i>

427
00:31:38,915 --> 00:31:41,950
<i>...probably a year before I
actually talked to him,</i>

428
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:44,286
<i>...he's in this full
World War II regalia...</i>

429
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:47,155
<i>...and it looked like he had a remote
controlled truck or something,</i>

430
00:31:47,223 --> 00:31:49,991
...like one of these
RC aficionados.

431
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,693
My window actually
looks out the curve,

432
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:53,795
...like right past us
going toward his house.

433
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,798
And so, I noticed every
day around 2:00 or 3:00...

434
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:58,433
...he would start
coming home.

435
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,001
<i>So I set my long lens...</i>

436
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:02,671
<i>...and tried to zoom in to
figure out what was going on,</i>

437
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,039
<i>...if this was
a remote control...</i>

438
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,041
<i>...or is this grown man
actually pulling a car...</i>

439
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:07,843
<i>...or a truck or something.</i>

440
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,350
And then I decided that I was
going to try to figure out a way...

441
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,613
...to stop and talk to him.

442
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,783
<i>I saw him again when he was
walking down the street.</i>

443
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:19,955
I drive way up ahead, I park
maybe 75, 80 yards up ahead,

444
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,523
...and get out.

445
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,059
<i>I'm sitting there
and can sense him...</i>

446
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,528
<i>...getting a little
closer and closer.</i>

447
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:28,597
I go, "Hey!" You know,
"How's it going?"

448
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,765
He's like, "Pretty good.
Pretty good."

449
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,335
And he stops and proceeded
to introduce me...

450
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:34,669
<i>...to the people
in the jeep.</i>

451
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:36,471
<i>There were 2 figures
in the jeep.</i>

452
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,373
<i>He says, this is
actually so and so,</i>

453
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,141
...who is someone
I work with.

454
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,578
And this other woman, she's
actually an old neighbor of mine.

455
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,547
<i>I was like, has anybody
else seen this stuff...</i>

456
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,815
<i>...or talked to you,
you know?</i>

457
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,850
<i>He goes, you're the first
person to ever really stop...</i>

458
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,253
...and say, that's interesting.
What are you doing?

459
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,155
Or where are you going?
Or what's that all about?

460
00:32:56,592 --> 00:33:00,896
<i>The next day, this envelope
stuffed with photos.</i>

461
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:04,833
<i>And I opened them up, and
I was just astonished...</i>

462
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,470
<i>...by the realism
and the feeling.</i>

463
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,574
<i>When I went to his house
after I saw the photos,</i>

464
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,109
...I said, now, do you have
anymore of these?

465
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,811
He goes, oh, I've got
thousands of them.

466
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,113
Yeah, sure.

467
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,950
<i>'Cause I'm
a photographer, I was,</i>

468
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:24,920
<i>...how do you manage all your
assets and your negatives?</i>

469
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:27,489
<i>He said, I don't even
keep the negatives.</i>

470
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:30,358
<i>The negatives,
I throw them away.</i>

471
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,595
I asked him about metering,
things like that.

472
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:36,498
He said, you know, well, the
light meter's actually broken.

473
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,234
<i>So basically what I do,
is I set up these shots...</i>

474
00:33:39,302 --> 00:33:43,638
...and shoot them, then send
them off to a mail order lab,

475
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:45,407
...which is where he got
all his processing done.

476
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:48,209
And wait a couple weeks,
he'd come back,

477
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,112
...they'd be overexposed
2 or 3 stops or under,

478
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,715
...and he's just shoot the
entire thing over again.

479
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,818
<i>It's funny. I don't think he
ever even thought of himself...</i>

480
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,186
<i>...as being a photographer.</i>

481
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:01,890
<i>He was just using a camera
as a tool to communicate.</i>

482
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,159
Definitely didn't identify
himself as an artist.

483
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:06,461
<i>It was all such
a genuine thing.</i>

484
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:11,132
And I just... I felt like
it was too amazing...

485
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,568
...to not share
with other people.

486
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,711
<i>The story, meanwhile,
was just going on in my head,</i>

487
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:29,718
<i>...like, OK, the S.S. heard
about my town, my bar.</i>

488
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:36,291
<i>They're just driving around
aimlessly looking for Marwencol.</i>

489
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,393
<i>Looking for the town
they heard of,</i>

490
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:40,428
...the bar they heard of,
the women they heard of.

491
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,964
That the Marwencol women
were beautiful.

492
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:45,433
They're the most beautiful
girls in Belgium.

493
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:51,740
<i>So, eventually,
the S.S. find Marwencol.</i>

494
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:55,310
<i>And there's nobody around.</i>

495
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:59,147
<i>We all decided to go
to the bar,</i>

496
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:03,485
<i>...Hogancamp's cat fight club,
2 miles away...</i>

497
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,487
<i>...and hide in there.</i>

498
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:10,025
<i>And the only one left
in town was Ruth.</i>

499
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,494
<i>She had decided
to stay behind,</i>

500
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,863
<i>...watch over the church.</i>

501
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,732
<i>And the S.S. came in.</i>

502
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:22,137
<i>And they interrogated
Ruthie.</i>

503
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,439
<i>And these guys wanted
to know where the bar was.</i>

504
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,976
<i>"Where's the bar?
I want a drink."</i>

505
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:34,082
'Cause I remember that's the way
I was when I was an alcoholic.

506
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,051
"Gah! I want a drink!"

507
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:41,623
You know. I remember that.

508
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:44,826
And so, she still
wouldn't tell...

509
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,896
<i>...the S.S. where my bar was,
where I'd moved the bar.</i>

510
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:51,633
<i>So they killed her.</i>

511
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:54,335
<i>I heard that
I'm killed off.</i>

512
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,303
<i>Yes.</i>

513
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:56,438
I don't remember you
ever telling me.

514
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:59,074
<i>You were in the church...</i>

515
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:03,111
<i>...when the S.S. came
and found Marwencol.</i>

516
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,382
<i>They wanted to drink.
They wanted to party. You know.</i>

517
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,117
<i>There was nobody there
but you.</i>

518
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,987
<i>You wouldn't tell them
where the bar was,</i>

519
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:16,291
<i>...so they killed you.</i>

520
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:20,161
<i>The bad guy killed you.</i>

521
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:25,800
<i>And then they started
walking out of the church.</i>

522
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:31,873
<i>And the professor, who stayed
behind to watch over Ruthie,</i>

523
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:36,578
<i>...he was picking off the S.S..
He got three of them.</i>

524
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:40,582
<i>So the S.S. scared back
into the church.</i>

525
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,985
They were gonna stay there
until they found my bar.

526
00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:47,489
And the professor was just... every time
one of them would poke their head out,

527
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,558
...he was picking them off.

528
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,694
And that was good.

529
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:59,167
If Mark is angry, he definitely
takes it out on his town,

530
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:01,169
...which I guess is a
good outlet, you know.

531
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:02,604
Instead of taking
out in real life,

532
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,372
...he takes it out
on his town.

533
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,474
And he gets a lot
of anger out that way.

534
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:09,477
And the S.S. takes the
brunt of a lot of it.

535
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:19,988
<i>I think a lot of it stems
from his attack, too.</i>

536
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:22,991
<i>He's got a lot of
anger to let go,</i>

537
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:25,393
<i>...especially for groups,
people who hate.</i>

538
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:28,630
<i>And it definitely
shows in his town.</i>

539
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:36,371
<i>Anything pisses him
off in life,</i>

540
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:39,541
...that's an outlet for
Mark to take it out...

541
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:42,143
...and someone in that
town's gonna get it.

542
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:53,188
<i>I created my own therapies.</i>

543
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,523
<i>And this was one of them.</i>

544
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:58,893
<i>Wow.</i>

545
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:02,664
<i>I could act out my revenge
and anger and rage...</i>

546
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,199
<i>...in photographs.</i>

547
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:07,101
It's nice to be
able to...

548
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,838
You know,
somebody hurts you,

549
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:13,007
...you can, without
any violence,

550
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:14,943
...you know, get back at them.
You know.

551
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,144
<i>Correct. Right.</i>

552
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,580
<i>Whether it be on paper
or in film.</i>

553
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:20,515
Yep. Yep.

554
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:24,552
<i>I still really miss
somebody to talk to...</i>

555
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,988
<i>...about still
the way I feel.</i>

556
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,190
So you're not
in therapy now?

557
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:31,392
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

558
00:38:49,678 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>This guy is Tod, the editor
for "esopus" magazine.</i>

559
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,720
<i>Good friend of mine
named David Naugle,</i>

560
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:01,656
<i>...he was at a party and
said... had his Mac with him,</i>

561
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:04,425
<i>...and he said, I've got to
show you something.</i>

562
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,761
And I thought
it was fantastic.

563
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,297
Just like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

564
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:12,300
And the story, although I didn't
know much of it at that point,

565
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,269
...was fascinating
to me, too.

566
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,838
<i>The magazine is...
The whole purpose of it is...</i>

567
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:20,942
<i>...to present a space that's
completely uncommercial,</i>

568
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,177
<i>...completely unmediated,
and completely unfiltered...</i>

569
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:26,514
<i>...for artists to present
their work to,</i>

570
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:29,817
<i>...hopefully, a fairly broad
general public.</i>

571
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:33,688
<i>To find somebody like Mark
who's doing this amazing work...</i>

572
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:35,990
<i>...that no one has seen ever,</i>

573
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,893
...except maybe a few people he worked
with at the anchorage and David,

574
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:42,997
<i>...was just like a gift
from the gods, you know.</i>

575
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:45,366
<i>Does it feel like
therapy at all to you,</i>

576
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:47,201
<i>...or is it all
just art?</i>

577
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,937
<i>It constantly keeps
my mind...</i>

578
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:52,407
<i>It keeps my mind
constantly working.</i>

579
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,075
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

580
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,410
<i>I mean, the minute I met him,</i>

581
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,711
<i>...I was like,
oh, he's like a nice guy.</i>

582
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:58,713
<i>He's just a wonderful
nice guy.</i>

583
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:02,884
<i>He's so much further along than most
of us would be in that situation.</i>

584
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:08,556
And really because of what he'd
decided to do with his life.

585
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,229
<i>This idea of someone using art to
sort of access something they lost...</i>

586
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:18,933
<i>...or to sort of regain
something they lost...</i>

587
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,637
<i>...was just so beautiful
and so moving to me.</i>

588
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:24,238
<i>And then the work
was so great.</i>

589
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:27,742
<i>It would be a great story if
his work were, you know, nice,</i>

590
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,277
<i>...but his work is strong.</i>

591
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:30,411
<i>It's strong stuff.</i>

592
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:33,047
<i>So that just made it
such a no-brainer.</i>

593
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:37,251
<i>Of course we're
gonna do this.</i>

594
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,022
<i>Meanwhile, back
in Marwencol...</i>

595
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:48,363
<i>The town Germans and I
came up with a plan...</i>

596
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,067
<i>...that I would pretend to be
the town Germans' prisoner.</i>

597
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:55,970
<i>They would bring me
to the church.</i>

598
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,307
<i>And that way we could
infiltrate the S.S.,</i>

599
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,211
<i>...and then just get
our town back.</i>

600
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:04,579
Yeah, but that
didn't happen...

601
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:06,180
...because the S.S. took me,

602
00:41:06,248 --> 00:41:09,751
...sent the town Germans
out of the church.

603
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:13,087
<i>They tied me up,
the S.S. tied me up.</i>

604
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,724
<i>Then started interrogating me.
Where's my bar?</i>

605
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,260
<i>Where did I move the bar?
We want to drink!</i>

606
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:21,195
<i>That's what they kept on,</i>

607
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:23,698
<i>...with anger
and stuff like that.</i>

608
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:26,934
<i>Then started cutting me.</i>

609
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:30,138
And on my alter ego,

610
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:36,210
...I put a scar down
the right side of my face,

611
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:39,947
...because this is the side...

612
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:43,751
...that was damaged
in real life on me.

613
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,613
<i>There's one major difference
I found immediately...</i>

614
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:15,950
<i>...between Mark's work and a lot
of other contemporary art...</i>

615
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:18,286
<i>...that I look at and see
and life, for that matter.</i>

616
00:42:18,353 --> 00:42:20,855
<i>That is, particularly
when you're using dolls...</i>

617
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:24,425
<i>...or some kind of... you're
re-photographing something,</i>

618
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:27,428
...there's generally a very strong
sense of irony in the work.

619
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:29,030
There's a distance.

620
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:30,932
And it's kind of
a little wink-winky.

621
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:33,801
Like, I'm photographing dolls.
Isn't that, you know,

622
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:37,271
...funny or subversive
or clever or whatever.

623
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:41,342
<i>And I just... the thing that struck
me immediately about Mark's work...</i>

624
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,345
<i>...is that there's no irony in
it as far as I can tell.</i>

625
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,647
<i>I mean, he's a very
clever guy, very smart,</i>

626
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:48,149
<i>...but he's in the work.</i>

627
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:52,954
<i>He's not using the work
as a tool to do something else.</i>

628
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:55,723
<i>The work is him.</i>

629
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,692
<i>It's a very authentic
feeling to me,</i>

630
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:59,327
<i>...which is a wonderful thing.</i>

631
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:01,462
<i>You don't see it that often.</i>

632
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,842
<i>So then,
back at my bar,</i>

633
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,779
<i>...all the dolls
in my bar heard...</i>

634
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:23,417
<i>...that the S.S. had me tied up and
they were cutting me to ribbons...</i>

635
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,786
<i>...and beating me up.</i>

636
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:31,692
<i>So Anna didn't want to wait
around for another brilliant plan...</i>

637
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,362
<i>...that the townspeople
had come up with.</i>

638
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:37,398
<i>So she took Chris
and Jacqueline...</i>

639
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:41,736
<i>...and traded their uniforms
for barbie clothes.</i>

640
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:48,242
<i>They went into town with their
hands behind their back.</i>

641
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,779
<i>Each hand
was carrying a pistol.</i>

642
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:55,683
<i>And they waltzed into town.</i>

643
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:05,092
<i>Anna grabbed my revolver
from the town German,</i>

644
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,930
<i>...and the 3 of the girls
went into the church.</i>

645
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:13,534
<i>Just like
precision surgeons,</i>

646
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:19,473
<i>...they eliminated the S.S.</i>

647
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:33,754
<i>They only wounded
the worst S.S. guy,</i>

648
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,890
<i>...because they had plans
for him.</i>

649
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,292
<i>They wanted to save him
for later.</i>

650
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:43,331
<i>And Anna came over
and she cut me down...</i>

651
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:45,266
<i>...and held me until
the jeep came...</i>

652
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:48,736
<i>...to pick us up and bring us
back to my bar.</i>

653
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:58,779
<i>Her coming and saving me
from the S.S.</i>

654
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:03,417
...proved to me that
she loved me.

655
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:08,055
It proved to me that she felt
the same way I felt about her.

656
00:45:11,994 --> 00:45:15,997
<i>So the call went out to
all the town's barbies.</i>

657
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:19,967
<i>"We did it before
and we can do it again"</i>

658
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:22,003
<i>"And we will do it again"</i>

659
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:24,705
<i>"We've got a heck
of a job to do"</i>

660
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:26,941
<i>"But who better
to see it through?"</i>

661
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:30,678
<i>"We did it before
and we can do it again"</i>

662
00:45:30,746 --> 00:45:32,980
<i>"And we will do it again"</i>

663
00:45:33,048 --> 00:45:34,849
<i>"We're one for all
and we're all for one"</i>

664
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,652
<i>"We'll get to lickin'
before we're done"</i>

665
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:48,362
<i>...then Svetlana takes a pistol
while the S.S. guy's still alive,</i>

666
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:54,135
<i>...good old-fashioned eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth sort of thing.</i>

667
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:04,412
<i>And still smiling,
the women of Marwencol...</i>

668
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:06,814
<i>...had gotten
their revenge.</i>

669
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:22,196
<i>This is no town that you can
push over and take over.</i>

670
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:27,468
<i>This is what happens
to people who mess with us.</i>

671
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,215
<i>So this is my wife, Anna.</i>

672
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:46,354
<i>When'd you guys
get married?</i>

673
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,757
<i>March 26.</i>

674
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:52,693
<i>I still remember that, too.</i>

675
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:57,865
<i>I don't remember when
I got married in real life.</i>

676
00:46:57,933 --> 00:47:03,871
<i>I mean, I remember that
it was 8-4, '84.</i>

677
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:08,175
<i>But I don't recollect
that wedding...</i>

678
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:15,483
<i>...as much as I recollect the one that
my alter ego got married to here.</i>

679
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:23,958
<i>And it's weird when I say
"My wife," you know.</i>

680
00:47:24,025 --> 00:47:27,995
<i>It's like I remember saying
that back when I was married,</i>

681
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:35,102
<i>...but it just... it doesn't hold
any, you know... I don't know.</i>

682
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:54,855
<i>Anna's competition
is Deja Thorus,</i>

683
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:57,892
<i>...the Belgian witch
of Marwencol.</i>

684
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:01,262
<i>She's competing
for my love.</i>

685
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:04,432
<i>Deja Thorus was in love
with me.</i>

686
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,033
<i>She's still in love
with me.</i>

687
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:09,737
<i>She can't get me, even though
she brought me back in time...</i>

688
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:12,773
<i>...so I wouldn't meet Anna
and all that stuff.</i>

689
00:48:12,841 --> 00:48:15,176
<i>But I did meet Anna.
Anna and I kissed.</i>

690
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:18,179
<i>And while we were connected
on our kiss,</i>

691
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:21,015
<i>...we remembered all the love
we once had for each other,</i>

692
00:48:21,082 --> 00:48:25,920
<i>...so Deja Thorus' spell
was broken.</i>

693
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,556
This is Deja Thorus'
time machine.

694
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:31,258
And I'm proud of it.

695
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:36,864
It was an old VCR that ate
one of my best porno tapes.

696
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:39,834
So I had to extract
the tape somehow.

697
00:48:39,901 --> 00:48:45,139
<i>So I took an MP3 player stand
and made that the seat.</i>

698
00:48:45,207 --> 00:48:50,177
<i>And found an old cell phone
keypad on the roadway...</i>

699
00:48:50,245 --> 00:48:51,612
<i>...when I was walking.</i>

700
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,281
<i>So I glued that on this thing
that I put there.</i>

701
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:59,053
<i>And before I knew it, there
it was, the time machine.</i>

702
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,738
<i>Tod showed my stuff
in the city.</i>

703
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:24,011
<i>And he tells me that there's
a curator of an art gallery...</i>

704
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,449
<i>...that wants to display
my photos.</i>

705
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:33,654
<i>I did feel a very strong
responsibility...</i>

706
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:36,323
<i>...and a concern about,
you know,</i>

707
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:39,393
<i>...will the show be too much?</i>

708
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,529
<i>What if this leads to,
you know, attention...</i>

709
00:49:41,596 --> 00:49:44,532
<i>...and it's bad for him
in some way?</i>

710
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,401
Will the photographs look OK?
Will the space be OK?

711
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:49,904
Will he like the space?
Will he be comfortable here?

712
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:51,305
Will he make to the city?

713
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:54,074
<i>He hasn't been here
for a long, long time.</i>

714
00:49:54,142 --> 00:49:56,877
<i>He hasn't been out of Kingston
for a long, long time.</i>

715
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,881
<i>I'm happy about
the whole thing...</i>

716
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:06,086
<i>...except the talk of me taking
something so sentimental to me...</i>

717
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:10,391
<i>...and having it on display
100 miles away.</i>

718
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:14,562
<i>It's a very big decision
for me to make.</i>

719
00:50:48,163 --> 00:50:50,731
<i>Women want to meet
the artist.</i>

720
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:54,401
<i>They don't want to hear that
the artist couldn't make it.</i>

721
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:59,039
<i>They want to meet
the artist.</i>

722
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:02,810
<i>And, of course, if some
big spendy guy comes in...</i>

723
00:51:02,877 --> 00:51:05,179
<i>...and he's looking
for something,</i>

724
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:08,882
<i>...he has tons of money,
mad money,</i>

725
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,886
<i>...and he wants to meet
the artist,</i>

726
00:51:12,954 --> 00:51:15,194
<i>...he doesn't want to hear, oh,
the artist couldn't make it,</i>

727
00:51:15,256 --> 00:51:20,594
<i>...he's too afraid
to come to the city.</i>

728
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:24,531
<i>Yeah. So, I'm still afraid
to go to the city,</i>

729
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,068
<i>...but that's where
courage comes in.</i>

730
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:35,242
<i>Courage. I was taught that
courage is to face the thing,</i>

731
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,611
<i>...to do the thing,</i>

732
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:44,284
<i>...even though I have
such great fear of doing it.</i>

733
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:20,054
<i>Anna comes back to town
and she's all pissy...</i>

734
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:21,555
...'cause I didn't want to go.

735
00:52:21,623 --> 00:52:25,592
'Cause I have
mental problems.

736
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:30,964
I'm still disturbed
by the S.S. tying me up.

737
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:46,513
And to get a close-up
of her looking at me...

738
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,184
<i>...and then scooting on over,
and now we're kissing.</i>

739
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:59,560
<i>So that's the whole
outcome of that.</i>

740
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:11,171
It gets stranger
by the moment, doesn't it?

741
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:17,077
218 pair...

742
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:20,748
Of women's essence.

743
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:22,349
I mean, they wore these.

744
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:26,920
They scuffed them up, I can tell
if they were a smoker or not.

745
00:53:26,988 --> 00:53:31,658
I should be a shoe
detective or something.

746
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:35,295
Yep. Some of these...

747
00:53:35,363 --> 00:53:39,500
Oh, none of these
are ones I've stole.

748
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:43,103
They were all given
to me by women.

749
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:46,406
They were.
I'm not kidding.

750
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:49,643
Like Colleen gave me
a bag full of shoes.

751
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:51,845
Colleen.

752
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:05,492
The first night we went
home to his apartment...

753
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,194
<i>...when he got out
of the hospital,</i>

754
00:54:07,262 --> 00:54:12,866
<i>...he sees this whole
shelf of high heels.</i>

755
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:16,403
<i>And he says to me,</i>

756
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:18,539
<i>..."Do I have a girlfriend
that lives here?"</i>

757
00:54:18,606 --> 00:54:21,441
<i>And I said, "No."</i>

758
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:25,145
<i>And he says, "Well, what's
with all the shoes?</i>

759
00:54:25,213 --> 00:54:28,182
<i>And I said, "Well, Mark,
those are your shoes.</i>

760
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,950
<i>"You buy them,
you collect them.</i>

761
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:33,053
<i>I think
you wear them."</i>

762
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:50,037
<i>If I tell people who I am
and what I'm about,</i>

763
00:54:50,104 --> 00:54:52,039
<i>...I'm true to myself.</i>

764
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:54,675
<i>That means I'm not
lying to myself.</i>

765
00:54:56,544 --> 00:55:01,381
<i>What they do with that
is on them.</i>

766
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:04,518
<i>I'm not accountable
for their feelings...</i>

767
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:09,857
<i>...or how they perceive it,
make faces and stuff.</i>

768
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:14,294
<i>That's when I close in
and discover who I am.</i>

769
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:16,797
<i>And that's all part of
the finding out who I am...</i>

770
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:20,334
<i>...part of this new life,</i>

771
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,337
<i>...second life I was given.</i>

772
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,960
<i>This is a B.A.R.
It's a browning automatic rifle.</i>

773
00:55:47,028 --> 00:55:50,831
<i>It's .30 caliber.
It has a mean punch.</i>

774
00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:52,900
<i>She's got 2 .45s.</i>

775
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:58,238
<i>I've got 2 six shooters
and one .45 shoulder holster.</i>

776
00:56:02,377 --> 00:56:08,015
<i>When I walk the 2 miles
to the store...</i>

777
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:11,818
<i>When I feel apprehensive...</i>

778
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:18,525
<i>...and I look down at the jeep and
I know that they'll protect me.</i>

779
00:56:18,593 --> 00:56:19,593
<i>It's dolls.</i>

780
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,328
<i>There's a lot
of firepower in there.</i>

781
00:56:21,396 --> 00:56:23,330
<i>And I make sure I put
the correct weapons...</i>

782
00:56:23,398 --> 00:56:27,034
<i>...with the most firepower
in there before I take my walks.</i>

783
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:30,304
<i>It's just in case.</i>

784
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,715
<i>People don't know
I'm disabled.</i>

785
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:44,718
<i>They don't know that
I don't think correctly.</i>

786
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:47,721
<i>They don't know that I have
psychological problems...</i>

787
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:51,858
<i>...like I'm always on guard,
always looking over my shoulder,</i>

788
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:54,661
<i>...always worried about
being attacked again.</i>

789
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:01,635
<i>They just see me
on the outside.</i>

790
00:57:01,703 --> 00:57:05,672
<i>Outside, yeah, I'm trying
to act like a normal human...</i>

791
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:08,008
<i>...so I don't
get attacked again</i>

792
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:11,545
<i>...by the stronger ones.</i>

793
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:21,688
<i>I figured I'd go out and see
what was going on in town.</i>

794
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:27,995
<i>While I'm focused in on
what's going on in my town,</i>

795
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:35,369
<i>...this S.S.
Snuck up behind me.</i>

796
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:37,671
<i>And I don't hear him.</i>

797
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:46,613
<i>Brings me back to town...</i>

798
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:48,815
<i>...where all
of his buddies are,</i>

799
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:53,453
<i>...and five of them figured they'd
have a little fun with me.</i>

800
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:03,730
<i>And then it all
comes back again...</i>

801
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:09,369
<i>The attack, those 5 scumbags,
how bad I want to kill them.</i>

802
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:15,542
<i>I hope Mark is not always
haunted by this experience,</i>

803
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,812
<i>...but unfortunately,
this kind of thing...</i>

804
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,250
...doesn't leave you just
because the case is over.

805
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:29,022
<i>I don't know if I'll
start ripping them apart.</i>

806
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:32,526
I don't know if
I'm gonna want to kill them.

807
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:37,597
And I don't know if it's gonna
take like 8 police officers...

808
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:39,132
...to shoot me.

809
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,071
<i>There's no fair fighting person
that's been jumped on from behind...</i>

810
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:47,808
<i>...and every memory
kicked out of his head.</i>

811
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:51,378
<i>There's no etiquette
to fighting after that.</i>

812
00:58:55,249 --> 00:58:57,717
<i>Sorry, I get a little
angry and stuff...</i>

813
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,886
<i>...thinking about it.</i>

814
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:08,795
<i>After they get done
kicking and punching me,</i>

815
00:59:08,863 --> 00:59:11,131
<i>...they drag me in the church.</i>

816
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,735
<i>Figured they'd have
further fun.</i>

817
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:20,140
<i>There's that.
Happy what he did.</i>

818
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:24,911
<i>He's like, "Good.
Kill that Hogancamp."</i>

819
00:59:29,283 --> 00:59:33,787
<i>So Deja Thorus sensed
that I was in danger.</i>

820
00:59:33,855 --> 00:59:36,523
<i>So she hopped in
her time machine...</i>

821
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:39,993
<i>...and used it just
to transport herself...</i>

822
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:44,030
<i>...as fast as a plasma jet
of a blazar,</i>

823
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:49,503
<i>...which travels at 99.9%
the speed of light.</i>

824
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:58,612
<i>Like I imaged that
it happened in real life.</i>

825
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,617
<i>There she is.</i>

826
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,652
<i>My savior.</i>

827
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:20,600
<i>And then, in like a Belgian
accent girl voice,</i>

828
01:00:20,668 --> 01:00:24,804
<i>..."Oh, my love. Why would anybody
do such a thing to you?"</i>

829
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:30,644
<i>Since I can't remember...</i>

830
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:35,815
...what happened in the bar,
what led them to beat me up,

831
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:42,022
...I was told that I told them
that I was a cross-dresser.

832
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:48,395
So that's what
I have been told happened.

833
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:51,631
So I think they...

834
01:00:51,699 --> 01:00:58,405
...I believe they attacked me because I
mentioned that I was a cross-dresser.

835
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:04,044
<i>We were in the bar.
The guy said...</i>

836
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:07,180
<i>...he was a cross-dresser
and everything.</i>

837
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:10,083
<i>And I started figuring
out he was gonna get it.</i>

838
01:01:11,686 --> 01:01:14,621
<i>I think Freddy wanted
to beat his ass.</i>

839
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:16,957
<i>He was saying, "I have no
problems with anybody."</i>

840
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:20,026
<i>"I have no problems
with anybody."</i>

841
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,995
<i>That guy didn't
do nothing to anybody.</i>

842
01:01:22,063 --> 01:01:25,165
<i>I could tell he was
being set-up.</i>

843
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:43,717
<i>Man.</i>

844
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,620
<i>When in doubt,
bring them all.</i>

845
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:51,124
<i>Got to bring this.</i>

846
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:58,198
<i>I don't know if
I'll use all these,</i>

847
01:01:58,266 --> 01:01:59,666
<i>...but I bring them anyway,</i>

848
01:01:59,734 --> 01:02:01,401
<i>...just in case.</i>

849
01:02:36,937 --> 01:02:40,607
<i>I'm really, really attempting
to have a positive look...</i>

850
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:43,943
<i>Outlook on everything.</i>

851
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:50,517
<i>But it's that subconscious
fear that I still have,</i>

852
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:53,086
<i>...you know, about being
hurt again.</i>

853
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:54,621
<i>That's the biggest fear.</i>

854
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:55,989
<i>I don't want to get hurt...</i>

855
01:02:56,057 --> 01:03:00,093
<i>...mentally or emotionally
or physically ever again.</i>

856
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:13,973
<i>So that's why thank god there's
that other voice in my head...</i>

857
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:18,278
<i>...that still didn't get broke
in that attack...</i>

858
01:03:18,346 --> 01:03:21,147
<i>...that tells that side
that's so worried,</i>

859
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:26,152
<i>..."Hey, come on, don't think
about all that stuff."</i>

860
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,356
<i>"Come on, give it a go, man."</i>

861
01:03:29,423 --> 01:03:36,563
<i>Do the show like you do
Marwencol the story."</i>

862
01:04:01,956 --> 01:04:06,926
And since I was given
a second chance at life,

863
01:04:06,994 --> 01:04:12,332
...I want to live this rest
of my life to the fullest.

864
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,001
I'm gonna do things I've
always wanted to do...

865
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:16,803
...but was always afraid to do.

866
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:19,172
I'm gonna do them now.

867
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:24,444
You know, like wear
pantyhose, wear a skirt,

868
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:26,413
...you know, wear heels
and stuff.

869
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,248
It's just...
It's good feeling.

870
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:33,319
I mean, I haven't got up the
gumption to walk in public.

871
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:51,304
I don't know
how to be smooth.

872
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:54,174
That's my... I mean, I don't know
if I want to look like James Bond...

873
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:57,777
...or if I just want to look
like a hip artist.

874
01:04:57,845 --> 01:05:00,346
I don't know.

875
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:09,088
But I'm representing myself
down there.

876
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,491
And I don't want to
wear anything stupid.

877
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:16,029
'Cause the first impression
is a lasting impression.

878
01:05:16,096 --> 01:05:19,799
You know, that's what leads me
all the way back to the suit.

879
01:05:21,936 --> 01:05:25,939
But really... what I'd
really like to wear...

880
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:30,210
...is that long chiffon
slit skirt.

881
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,951
But that's what
I'd like to wear...

882
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,954
...in my fantasy world.

883
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:58,438
<i>These are meant for women's
dolls legs, but they fit mine.</i>

884
01:06:01,942 --> 01:06:09,182
<i>My figure, 2 or 3 times I
put tights under his pants...</i>

885
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,617
...just to see
how that felt.

886
01:06:10,684 --> 01:06:12,752
And I was like, no,
I'm still...

887
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:16,289
I don't want to come out of
the closet in my town yet.

888
01:06:16,357 --> 01:06:22,595
But my girls, they know
me better than I know me.

889
01:07:04,038 --> 01:07:08,775
<i>You're gonna let me loose in a
land of people that are like me...</i>

890
01:07:08,842 --> 01:07:10,910
<i>...Greenwich village,</i>

891
01:07:10,978 --> 01:07:13,746
<i>...the weirdest place
on the planet,</i>

892
01:07:13,814 --> 01:07:17,784
<i>...where I could walk in high
heels and nobody would care.</i>

893
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:20,620
<i>Some dude would say, "Hey, nice shoes."
"Thanks, man."</i>

894
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,455
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

895
01:07:22,523 --> 01:07:23,957
<i>"I like your shoes, too."</i>

896
01:07:24,024 --> 01:07:27,060
<i>You know what I mean?
It's, like, people like me.</i>

897
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:30,530
<i>Nobody cares. They're all
artists and stuff down there.</i>

898
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:41,874
<i>So for me, it's gonna be that's what
I envisioned, that's what I project.</i>

899
01:07:54,254 --> 01:07:56,389
I put them like this.

900
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:58,891
You know, pull
the blanket over.

901
01:07:58,959 --> 01:08:01,294
Then make sure that
nobody's hanging off...

902
01:08:01,362 --> 01:08:03,196
...and they're
all tucked in.

903
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:04,831
Because
if they're happy,

904
01:08:04,898 --> 01:08:07,367
...it means
I'll sleep better.

905
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:11,537
<i>I always see them.</i>

906
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:15,174
<i>They're the last things
I see before I close my eyes...</i>

907
01:08:15,242 --> 01:08:16,843
<i>...and go to bed.</i>

908
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:33,292
That's just
how I say it.

909
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:38,131
<i>Out loud
so I can hear it.</i>

910
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:43,302
That's how often
I get out from here...

911
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,007
...to see real women
that wear make-up.

912
01:08:48,075 --> 01:08:50,276
And something
other than sneakers...

913
01:08:50,344 --> 01:08:52,712
...and jeans or boots.

914
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:05,525
I'm nervous.

915
01:09:05,592 --> 01:09:07,493
I'm super freakin' tired.

916
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:11,564
My energy level...
The batteries are low.

917
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:23,910
<i>I couldn't sleep last night.</i>

918
01:09:23,977 --> 01:09:27,947
<i>I'm thinking about this
and making lists and stuff.</i>

919
01:09:28,015 --> 01:09:30,349
<i>You know, and I'm making
another list now this morning.</i>

920
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:31,851
<i>Copying makes sure,</i>

921
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:33,453
<i>...so writing it the second time,</i>

922
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,256
<i>...you know, it's like, all right,
make sure I have everything.</i>

923
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:08,387
<i>I built Marwencol for me,</i>

924
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:09,989
<i>...for my therapy,</i>

925
01:10:10,057 --> 01:10:12,492
<i>...and now it's like everybody's.</i>

926
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:15,328
<i>Like, everybody wants to...
Everybody wants to...</i>

927
01:10:15,395 --> 01:10:17,430
<i>...play in it or be part
of it and everything,</i>

928
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:19,899
<i>...and I don't want all that.</i>

929
01:10:24,338 --> 01:10:26,906
<i>It's like this is
the one last thing...</i>

930
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:30,409
<i>...that I don't ever want
taken from me.</i>

931
01:10:32,246 --> 01:10:35,114
<i>And it seems like it is,</i>

932
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:37,416
<i>...but theoretically it's not.</i>

933
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:40,419
<i>It's still mine.</i>

934
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,755
<i>It's still mine.</i>

935
01:11:04,444 --> 01:11:10,817
I expected 98% of people
in Greenwich village...

936
01:11:10,884 --> 01:11:14,320
...to be walking on the street
in big feathers,

937
01:11:14,388 --> 01:11:16,722
...and outfits, and...

938
01:11:23,497 --> 01:11:26,833
<i>I'm glad I have the ability...</i>

939
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:30,102
<i>...to escape into
a fantasy world.</i>

940
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:33,673
<i>I'm real glad that
I have that ability...</i>

941
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,510
<i>...because those guys,
I thought, took it away.</i>

942
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:39,846
<i>I thought they took away
my imagination...</i>

943
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:42,081
<i>...along with everything else.</i>

944
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:45,184
<i>And like I've been
fighting to get balance...</i>

945
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:47,353
<i>...and everything else back,
you know,</i>

946
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:50,790
<i>...I fought for my imagination,
to get that back.</i>

947
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:54,760
<i>And that's when
Marwencol started.</i>

948
01:11:57,097 --> 01:12:00,533
<i>The more I built and
the more I played around,</i>

949
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:02,368
<i>...you know, and bought
figures and stuff,</i>

950
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:06,105
<i>...the more the story just
came alive in my head.</i>

951
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,311
So...
It's gonna go there.

952
01:12:12,379 --> 01:12:14,046
OK? The big one?

953
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:23,155
<i>Every time I see
Marwencol the town,</i>

954
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:27,326
<i>...it brings me right back
to when I started the town,</i>

955
01:12:27,394 --> 01:12:30,663
<i>...and how close and dear
it was to me,</i>

956
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:35,167
<i>...and how much I wanted people
to know about my town...</i>

957
01:12:35,235 --> 01:12:36,736
<i>...and to be part of my town.</i>

958
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:40,006
<i>That's why I started putting
people that I know in it,</i>

959
01:12:40,073 --> 01:12:43,509
<i>...is because I feel
so alone here.</i>

960
01:12:43,577 --> 01:12:46,512
<i>And if I have an alter ego...</i>

961
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,915
<i>...from people that I know
in my town,</i>

962
01:12:48,982 --> 01:12:51,784
<i>I can manipulate them,
make them do whatever I...</i>

963
01:12:51,852 --> 01:12:53,753
<i>You know, I want.</i>

964
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:59,091
<i>And, you know, I'll be
surrounded by my friends.</i>

965
01:13:01,595 --> 01:13:04,430
<i>Now look right dead
in the camera.</i>

966
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:09,201
<i>What do you think
about this?</i>

967
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:13,472
That's a nice camera.

968
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,475
<i>No, the artwork
we have to look at today.</i>

969
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,411
Oh.

970
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,546
There's no words.

971
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:24,550
I can't
think of anything.

972
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,500
It's a suit-and-tie
thing?

973
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:42,768
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

974
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,276
You can wear what
you're wearing now.

975
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:45,604
See what everybody's...

976
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,673
Yeah, this is what
I'll be wearing.

977
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:50,276
I want you
to be yourself.

978
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:52,278
You don't have to feel
like you have to dress up.

979
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:54,747
That's all.
You can wear whatever you want.

980
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,188
Man's shoes.

981
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:04,523
They look all right.

982
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:06,359
Is my hair all right and?

983
01:14:06,426 --> 01:14:08,361
Yeah, you look
great, man.

984
01:14:08,428 --> 01:14:11,364
I look like
a beatnik artist?

985
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:33,719
<i>There's definitely been a strong
response to his work.</i>

986
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:39,158
<i>What I really love is for
somebody to come along...</i>

987
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:44,830
<i>And a gallerist,
or a dealer, or a curator...</i>

988
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:47,266
And say, "This is really
interesting work."

989
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:51,504
"I'd like to help him
show it on a regular basis."

990
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,839
<i>I think that
the really ideal thing...</i>

991
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:57,343
<i>...would be for him to know that when
he makes work from now on out,</i>

992
01:14:57,411 --> 01:15:01,347
<i>...there are gonna be people
ready and waiting to see it.</i>

993
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:09,455
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

994
01:15:09,523 --> 01:15:11,791
<i>I don't know how
to speak to people.</i>

995
01:15:11,858 --> 01:15:14,960
They're big collectors,
they're big, important people,

996
01:15:15,028 --> 01:15:18,297
...but I have no idea
how to talk with them.

997
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:19,965
Should I
be writing Down?

998
01:15:20,033 --> 01:15:22,301
Should I
photograph them? What?

999
01:15:22,369 --> 01:15:25,638
You know, so the most I could do
to that big collector...

1000
01:15:25,705 --> 01:15:28,407
...was say, "You have nice shoes.
I like your shoes."

1001
01:15:28,475 --> 01:15:32,311
And she looked at me like,
"You're strange," you know?

1002
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:35,147
Sorry, ladies before gents.
Yeah, go ahead.

1003
01:15:35,215 --> 01:15:38,417
In Europe they always
offer a cigarette.

1004
01:15:38,485 --> 01:15:39,652
That's the one.

1005
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:42,154
I have 218 pair at home.

1006
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:43,656
Really?
Yeah.

1007
01:15:43,723 --> 01:15:45,157
Pictures or
pairs of shoes?

1008
01:15:45,225 --> 01:15:46,258
Really? Shoes?

1009
01:15:46,326 --> 01:15:48,928
Oh, women's, man.

1010
01:15:48,995 --> 01:15:51,263
It's like, when I'm stuck
where the movie's going...

1011
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:56,001
The movie...
Where the story's going...

1012
01:15:56,069 --> 01:15:58,671
I slip on
a pair of heels,

1013
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:02,108
...and the characters
tell me...

1014
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,677
...where the story's
going next.

1015
01:16:04,744 --> 01:16:06,912
Hmm.

1016
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,615
That's Anna and I just
taking a ride yesterday.

1017
01:16:09,683 --> 01:16:10,816
Who's Anna?

1018
01:16:10,884 --> 01:16:12,284
My wife.

1019
01:16:12,352 --> 01:16:17,289
See, the S.S. Sent
somebody there to kill me,

1020
01:16:17,357 --> 01:16:19,792
<i>...and all the women
of Marwencol...</i>

1021
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,294
<i>...stabbed the crap
out of him.</i>

1022
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:26,298
And I make sure that I turn
that damn flash off...

1023
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:27,533
Oh, yeah.

1024
01:16:27,601 --> 01:16:29,969
'Cause the flash takes
50% away from the photo.

1025
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:31,537
Oh, yeah.

1026
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:41,380
<i>Not one picture did I take
of my show,</i>

1027
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:43,816
<i>...or of people hanging out
at my show,</i>

1028
01:16:43,884 --> 01:16:47,653
<i>...or... Just shoe shots.</i>

1029
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:56,328
<i>I was like an elephant...</i>

1030
01:16:56,396 --> 01:16:59,064
<i>...left in charge of the peanuts.</i>

1031
01:17:27,127 --> 01:17:30,462
That's good.
That's what he... that's it.

1032
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:33,465
All right, so long, ladies.

1033
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:43,809
<i>I went to his show,</i>

1034
01:17:43,877 --> 01:17:46,579
<i>...and I sat there,
and I was looking,</i>

1035
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:50,149
<i>...and I was listening to people's
opinions about his stuff.</i>

1036
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:52,818
And I felt myself, like,
getting mad or defensive...

1037
01:17:52,886 --> 01:17:54,420
...about people who had
negative stuff.

1038
01:17:54,487 --> 01:17:58,390
"Oh, let's go
look at pictures of real war."

1039
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:01,627
You know, like,
this is Mark's real war.

1040
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,127
<i>My mind can't decide...</i>

1041
01:18:35,195 --> 01:18:39,298
<i>...what world to go for.</i>

1042
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:41,900
<i>Realistic world?</i>

1043
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:45,704
<i>But there's dangers out there.</i>

1044
01:18:45,772 --> 01:18:49,975
<i>People out there are so...</i>

1045
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:51,410
<i>Real.</i>

1046
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:54,713
<i>And I don't understand
all that.</i>

1047
01:18:59,386 --> 01:19:04,323
<i>I feel safe
when I get in my town,</i>

1048
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:09,061
<i>...and it just takes
everything away.</i>

1049
01:19:12,565 --> 01:19:15,501
<i>I prefer...</i>

1050
01:19:15,568 --> 01:19:18,904
<i>To live in my world.</i>

1051
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:25,077
<i>I want to live here
in Marwencol.</i>

1052
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:47,032
<i>My character in the story...</i>

1053
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,036
<i>...had to create something
for himself...</i>

1054
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:54,206
<i>...to deal with the trauma
that he still had...</i>

1055
01:19:54,274 --> 01:19:58,377
<i>...from being attacked
by 5 S.S.,</i>

1056

almost to death.</i>

1057

<i>...on his mind and stuff,
so...</i>

1059
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:13,659
<i>You know, he found comfort...</i>

1060
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:17,930
<i>...in building his own little
world, his own little town,</i>

1061
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:19,665
<i>...that's, you know,</i>

1062

1/6 scale dolls and figures...</i>
