1
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:56,061
Leon put 'em on the same squad.
Don't get me wrong. l love the 49ers.

2
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:59,428
Montana and Rice?
They're Hall of Fame locks, baby.

3
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,933
But do they cover the spread?

4
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,630
Hell, no. Not like the Giants.

5
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,338
Let me tell you something.
You can give me Simms and Bavaro,

6
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,774
Meggett and LT, any damn day.

7
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,813
Those guys are your meat and potatoes.
They cover, baby.

8
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:17,850
And don't even bring up Miami.
Don't bring 'em up. There's nothin' in Miami.

9
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,580
Miami only has Marino with the
golden arm and some fat cheerleaders.

10
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:26,592
They have no running game. lt's like
two virgins. Can't find the damn hole.

11
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,559
That's why they get blitzed
all the damn time. Understand?

12
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,223
l can't believe you guys.

13
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:37,998
l mean, yeah, they put up a ton of points,
but they only cover every other week.

14
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,370
Take the over, then bet
the fuckin' farm, you understand?

15
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:47,539
The pigs, the barn, the little chickens and
that raggedy-ass tractor. Bet all of that.

16
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:51,447
- Dallas, America's team? My sweet black ass.
- Come on.

17
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,748
Tried the bookie-fuckin' routine, right?

18
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:58,279
Everybody and their wrinkled
grandmother wanna bet the Cowboys.

19
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:03,488
Therefore, they gotta win by two touchdowns
just to cover. What are the odds on that?

20
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:07,021
So do me a favor. Take the points and run.

21
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,029
Come on, guys.

22
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:13,130
Unless you are a moron, retarded Saints fan,

23
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,533
therefore you deserve
to get cornholed on the 50-yard line.

24
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,341
- America's sport, baby. Football.
- l hate football.

25
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,506
You're talkin' about my sport.

26
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:27,044
One minute, fellas.

27
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,712
lt's showtime.

28
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,128
OK. Let's do it.

29
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,203
lt's a nasty habit.

30
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,184
Go.

31
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:21,501
Everybody down on the ground.

32
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,105
- Hands above your heads.
- Move.

33
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:30,980
You want me to use this thing?
What are you lookin' at?

34
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,777
- How long?
- Two minutes.

35
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,556
l see you, baby.
Get your ass out here.

36
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,398
Bingo.

37
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,338
- 1798.
- That was a bad year.

38
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,077
lt's 90 seconds.

39
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,218
Got it.

40
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,390
Upstairs.

41
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:30,170
- What is that?
- Nothing. lt's estate junk.

42
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,969
One minute.

43
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:40,143
- lt's not here.
- lt's there.

44
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,555
All right, 45.

45
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,158
My God.

46
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,867
30 seconds.

47
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,805
OK. Come on.

48
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,828
Break out the diamond.
Let's see that $10 million red beauty.

49
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,128
Fuckin' right.

50
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,004
The Surgeon General was right.
Cigarettes can kill.

51
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,347
No. Go back.

52
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,116
- ls there a problem?
- Fucking go back!

53
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:20,912
<i>The psychodynamics of compulsive stealing</i>
<i>are well established.</i>

54
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,939
An act committed to relieve
a preexisting state of guilt,

55
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,413
an attempt to harm an imagined enemy,

56
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:33,356
or a form of revenge against those who have
deprived the person of something significant,

57
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:37,522
or somehow inflicted a narcissistic injury.

58
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,428
But stealing panties
from the girls' locker room...

59
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,137
There's nothing in there.

60
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:54,973
l've never really been
a big fan of Freud's anyway.

61
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,250
l don't know if l should say this.
l'm a professional.

62
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:03,447
l won't say anything.

63
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,981
You promise to keep your word?

64
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:12,998
OK. Well, you know, that thing
that you were doing with the panties?

65
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:17,125
Everybody does it.
Your best friends do it.

66
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:21,537
The mailman does it.
Even the headmaster. They all whack off.

67
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:25,374
lf anybody tells you they don't, they're lying.

68
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:30,715
My mom says l'm oversexed.

69
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,768
- Hi, Daddy.
- Excuse me. Who am l speaking to?

70
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,372
- This is me.
- No, my Jessie is eight years old.

71
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:02,005
The girl l am talking to is at least 11.

72
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,611
<i>Can l speak to your mother, please?</i>

73
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:09,613
- Don't forget the turkey.
- <i>Why not have 'em deliver it?</i>

74
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:13,249
lt's Thanksgiving eve, Nathan.
Might as well get it to fly here.

75
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,817
OK. Fairway, right?
What's the cross street? 74th?

76
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,865
The man's a steel trap.

77
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:23,026
- <i>l will be there in ten minutes.</i>
- All right. Bye.

78
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,436
Go away.

79
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,779
Come on.

80
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,414
Shit.

81
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,933
Louis, this better be a real emergency.

82
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,069
My hero. Look.

83
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:44,343
She's not one of your Dalton Trust Fund
waifs, but l think she needs your help.

84
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:50,219
l don't know, Louis. l don't talk to you for
days, and the night before Thanksgiving...

85
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,952
- Jesus Christ.
- Lucky guy. He's still alive.

86
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,291
She took a razor to an orderly in Rockland.

87
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,194
- 111 stitches to close him up.
- What was the trigger?

88
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:01,961
Good question.
Been in institutions for ten years.

89
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:06,629
Yeah, l see that. Selective mutism,
obsessive-compulsive behavior...

90
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:11,176
- Post-traumatic symptoms...
- 20 different hospitals and 20 diagnoses.

91
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:15,840
An lQ off the charts. Saw her father
killed by a subway when she was eight.

92
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:18,007
- Dr Sachs?
- What?

93
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:21,985
The girl who was biting the heads
off pigeons has a med student in a headlock.

94
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:25,149
Call security. Make sure
the student documents the attack.

95
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:28,057
Louis, l don't know
what the hell you want from me.

96
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:32,598
- Look, l got a family at home, waiting.
- Nathan, spend 15 minutes with her.

97
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:36,123
She's an 18-year-old girl
who never hurt a fly until last week.

98
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:39,729
You and l are between her
and a lifetime on Thorazine. Or worse.

99
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,572
What do you mean, ''you and l''?
She's your patient. Your case.

100
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:47,545
You're a big asshole for making me say this.

101
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:52,410
You're better at this stuff than l am.

102
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,477
Everybody knows
Nathan Conrad's touch with the teens.

103
00:12:55,588 --> 00:13:00,582
Elisabeth Burrows is the kind of case you and
l lived for before you went uptown on me.

104
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,322
Just kidding. l didn't mean it that way.

105
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,565
- She needs you.
- All right.

106
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:10,625
But why the emergency? Why tonight?

107
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,796
lf we don't make progress by Monday,

108
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:17,501
they're gonna ship her to Creedmore
and chain her to a bed for the rest of her life.

109
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:22,378
That's why she needs you now. Five minutes.

110
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:28,818
- Arnie, Frankie, good evening.
- Dr Conrad. Slumming tonight?

111
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,947
- Afraid so.
- You guys up for a cavity search?

112
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:35,357
l'll pass, but you know Dr Sachs.
He's always ready for one.

113
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:38,021
Mind the gate.

114
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,126
What's the new cocktail?

115
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,259
Haldol, Droperidol and Ativan.

116
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:47,037
- And she's awake?
- Yes, my friend.

117
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,632
- He told me to stay. You're making a mistake.
- Come on.

118
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:54,873
- She eating?
- Not eating, drinking, sleeping, bathing,

119
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:58,747
letting anybody touch her, or saying a word.

120
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,387
- You're making a mistake.
- No, sweetheart.

121
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,480
Dr Sachs, he told me to stay.

122
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:07,492
l will have a word with him, Louise.
l promise.

123
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,093
What's with the heavy artillery?

124
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:19,800
lt took about five guys
to get her off the poor fella up in Rockland.

125
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,437
Louis, is there
anything else you wanna tell me?

126
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,280
No.

127
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,712
Could you open the door, please?

128
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,448
- You OK?
- Am l OK?

129
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,822
- Yeah.
- l'm OK.

130
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,786
Hello.

131
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,163
Elisabeth, my name is Dr Conrad.

132
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,092
l'm a psychiatrist.

133
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,166
The word has it
that you haven't eaten for days.

134
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,333
l can understand that.

135
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:33,208
l used to work in this hospital.
l know what the food's like.

136
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,947
Elisabeth, would you mind
if l took your pulse?

137
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:50,118
That means l'm gonna have to touch you.

138
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,178
Now, that's not supposed to happen.

139
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:46,511
True catatonics have what's called
a ''waxy flexibility'' of their limbs.

140
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,713
lt means they stay
exactly where they're posed.

141
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,817
There's more to you
than meets the eye, Elisabeth.

142
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,555
You're very good at what you do.

143
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,735
So, is there anything you wanna talk about?

144
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,971
That's OK. We hardly know each other.

145
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:26,088
l know you must have been very frightened
to do what you did to that guy.

146
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,725
l know that you were angry,
because l saw those photos.

147
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:35,758
But l also know that you were in a lot of pain,

148
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:39,737
because nobody is
in this place without a reason.

149
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,832
So maybe we'll talk next week.

150
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,183
You want what they want.

151
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,187
Don't you?

152
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,592
What who wants?

153
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:12,801
Elisabeth. What who wants?

154
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,403
l'll never tell.

155
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,741
Any of you.

156
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,009
Hello?

157
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,412
Who are you?

158
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:48,123
Five to three this old bag doesn't have cable.
l need my sports.

159
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,907
Dinner's over.

160
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:11,946
- How you doin', Tony?
- Good. Nice to see you, Doctor.

161
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,031
Hello?

162
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:33,672
This certainly looks like
the Conrad residence.

163
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:39,180
lt smells like the Conrad residence.

164
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:46,623
And it's definitely overheated,
like the Conrad residence.

165
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:53,089
But it doesn't sound
like the Conrad residence.

166
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:58,903
Hi, honey. l'm looking for a little girl.

167
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:03,202
About four feet two, light brown hair.

168
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,181
Where did she go?

169
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,454
lf l don't find that little girl,

170
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:21,720
l'm gonna have to go downstairs
and find myself another little girl.

171
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,593
l'll be back in ten minutes.

172
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,937
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you?

173
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:37,567
- Look what l did in art class today.
- That's beautiful. Look at the colors.

174
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:41,545
- You've got such a unique vision.
- lt's my vision, l swear.

175
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,873
- Aren't you supposed to be in bed?
- l can't sleep. l have mental problems.

176
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:49,546
- l see. What kind of mental problems?
- l'm highly neurotic.

177
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:53,647
- l think you've been in my study again.
- l needed the stapler.

178
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,785
- Go say good night to Mom.
- You're late.

179
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:59,887
- Good night, Mommy.
- Night, baby. You brush your teeth?

180
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,365
- Yeah.
- Can l smell?

181
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:03,924
Delicious.

182
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:07,200
l'll put Monkey right over here
by you on that side.

183
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:10,434
And l'll put Sally over here
to keep you company.

184
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,440
You had a bad day.

185
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:19,949
- Why do you say that?
- Frown-face.

186
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:24,956
l have a ''frown-face'' because it's
after ten o'clock and you're still awake.

187
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:29,059
Where were you tonight?

188
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,391
l was working.

189
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,624
Why?

190
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:37,133
Because l was helping a young girl.

191
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:41,767
All right. But that's gonna cost ya.

192
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:45,938
All right. What's it gonna be?

193
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:49,777
One hug, two kisses.

194
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,844
You cut a tough deal.
OK, here's one hug.

195
00:22:56,889 --> 00:22:59,016
And one kiss.

196
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,184
And two kisses.

197
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:05,626
Will they put Bart Simpson in the parade?

198
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:10,293
They will put Bart Simpson
in the parade if you go to sleep right now.

199
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:14,330
OK. But l don't think they'll care
if l go to sleep or not.

200
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:21,212
- Good night, sweetheart. l love you.
- Love you too.

201
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,419
- Let me give you a hand, Detective.
- Thanks.

202
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,579
That's beautiful.

203
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:08,720
What exactly is beautiful?

204
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:12,560
- Your leatherjacket. lt's beautiful.
- Right.

205
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,293
- Did you read about the Manhattan Bridge?
- No.

206
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:21,032
lt was built wrong. lt moves ten feet.

207
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,734
- Syd Simon.
- l'll see you later.

208
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,609
- Detective Cassidy, what can l do for you?
- What do we got?

209
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:30,307
Floater. Female, no lD.

210
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:32,850
She's maybe in her twenties.

211
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,981
Sloughing of her skin tells me
she's been in the water two, three days.

212
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:42,458
This time of year,
with the water cold, could be longer.

213
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,529
A couple to three days tops.

214
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,196
Her hands have been tied.
They recover any rope or anything?

215
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,366
They're still lookin'.

216
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:02,009
Another body was found
a couple of days ago.

217
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,105
- Battery Park area?
- Yeah.

218
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:07,710
The victim was male, middle-aged.
Day before yesterday.

219
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:13,622
- l need preliminary findings by tonight.
- Dream on, Detective. l got cases piled up.

220
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:19,027
C'mon, Syd. l got plans for
Thanksgiving. Do me right, all right?

221
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,759
- Tomorrow's the best l can do.
- Thank you.

222
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,334
First thing, though.

223
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:36,609
<i>Cars have now been towed,</i>
<i>the roads plowed to the pavements,</i>

224
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:40,617
<i>so the annual Turkey Trot,</i>
<i>the 8,000-meter race...</i>

225
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:43,017
<i>8,000-meter race? That doesn't sound right.</i>

226
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,055
You can't be distracted.

227
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:50,586
Here you are, immobile,

228
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:58,461
totally exposed,

229
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,334
and quite vulnerable.

230
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:06,271
l think you need a bath.

231
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:09,746
Guess what, sweetie.
l already had a bath today.

232
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:11,749
You did?

233
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,555
You didn't have Nathan Conrad's
fantastic special bath, did you?

234
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,421
- No.
- No, you didn't do that.

235
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:22,687
l didn't get that one yet.

236
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,387
Pretty hot. Not too hot, is it?

237
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,557
- No. lt's nice.
- Good.

238
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:45,005
- We should keep it down.
- You're the one that makes the noise.

239
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:39,570
Prepare to die of delight.

240
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:43,732
Jessie, c'mon. Let's join the downhill racer.

241
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,011
l heard that about the downhill racer.

242
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:53,744
Honey, you were dreaming.
l didn't say anything.

243
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,549
- lt was icy, you know?
- l know it was, baby.

244
00:27:56,622 --> 00:27:59,352
- And very windy, too.
- lt was a hell-ride.

245
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,119
- Good morning.
- Morning. You think she's still sleeping?

246
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:05,356
l don't know.

247
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:09,127
Jessie? Come on.
The parade's gonna start soon.

248
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:16,270
All right. l'm gonna go there all by myself.

249
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:19,569
See all those floats alone.

250
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:27,550
Jessie, come on. Breakfast is getting cold.

251
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,814
Does she have a new hiding place
l don't know?

252
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:35,621
Probably. She's been running round
the house like a wildcat all week.

253
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:39,219
Jessie. Get in here right now.

254
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,390
Eat it up before it gets cold.

255
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:46,365
Nathan? She wouldn't
go out on the balcony, right?

256
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:18,101
She's not there. She knows better than
to go outside without asking, doesn't she?

257
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:20,535
Jessie. Get in here right now.

258
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,231
- She lost one of her socks.
- What?

259
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,938
- She's gone.
- What do you mean?

260
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,540
- Wait. Where is she?
- Somebody came in.

261
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:07,608
- No. She's in the hallway...
- Somebody took her.

262
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:12,053
- Nobody took her, Nathan.
- Aggie, they cut the chain on the door.

263
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:14,785
What? Nathan, call the police.

264
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,190
l can't get a dial tone. Hello?

265
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:24,361
Get off the line. This is an emergency.
Something's wrong with the phone.

266
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:27,803
- <i>There is nothing wrong with it, Nathan.</i>
- This is an emergency.

267
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:30,068
<i>Yeah, l know.</i>

268
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:35,612
- Who is this?
- <i>We have your daughter.</i>

269
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,810
- What?
- Who is it?

270
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:44,879
<i>What's your worst fear, Nathan?</i>

271
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:49,851
- My what?
- <i>The first shock can buckle the knees. True?</i>

272
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,192
- Where is she?
- <i>She's unharmed. l don't want to hurt her.</i>

273
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:56,701
- Give it to me.
- <i>l want something from you.</i>

274
00:30:57,803 --> 00:30:59,100
- No.
- <i>What?</i>

275
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:04,335
Not until l talk to my daughter
and l know that she's OK.

276
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:08,345
<i>Rule number one. You do not make demands.</i>
<i>You listen to what l tell you.</i>

277
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,940
You call me back
when l can talk to my daughter.

278
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:16,653
- What the hell were you doing?
- Aggie.

279
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:20,748
- Listen to me, Aggie.
- No. Are you crazy?

280
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:24,996
Aggie. l have to make sure she's all right.

281
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:27,456
What if they don't call back?

282
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,468
- Hello?
- Daddy?

283
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:41,569
- Jessie, are you OK, sweetie?
- Honey, have they hurt you?

284
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,615
No. Daddy, can l come home now? Daddy?

285
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:49,612
That was very brave, Nathan.

286
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:53,590
- Tell me how much money you want.
- l don't want your money.

287
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:56,456
Pick up your wife
before she breaks the other leg.

288
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:00,858
l'm fine.

289
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:06,829
What?

290
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:08,997
Nathan, what is it?

291
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,347
Don't close the curtains. l like the view.

292
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:21,945
<i>Good. Now, on the bureau</i>
<i>by the door is a cell phone.</i>

293
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,545
<i>l know what you're thinking. Don't.</i>

294
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:28,324
<i>By the time you hit</i>
<i>the one in ''911'' Jessie will be dead.</i>

295
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:33,922
Rule number two. Do not try to call or signal
anyone. lf you do, l will kill your daughter.

296
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:38,402
Not because l want to, but because
those are the rules. Do you understand?

297
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,563
- Yes.
- What?

298
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,137
<i>l can see you. l can hear you.</i>

299
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:49,236
<i>Wherever you go, you will be watched.</i>

300
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,838
- What are they saying?
- <i>If you want to see her alive,</i>

301
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,975
don't say a word.

302
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:57,748
- <i>Now, tell me you understand.</i>
- l understand.

303
00:32:57,822 --> 00:33:02,623
<i>Good. You have a pro bono patient.</i>
<i>Her name is Elisabeth Burrows.</i>

304
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:06,026
<i>A very disturbed girl.</i>

305
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,929
She has a six-digit number in her head.

306
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,993
Locked away in her troubled mind.
She guards it with her life.

307
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,638
- What kind of number?
- That needn't concern you.

308
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:21,178
<i>l need that number. You need your daughter</i>
<i>back. That is why this is happening.</i>

309
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:23,441
<i>You're a professional, Nathan. So am l.</i>

310
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:26,016
lf we do ourjobs
to the best of our abilities,

311
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:30,349
<i>by this time tomorrow it'll be like</i>
<i>we never even knew each other.</i>

312
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:37,252
<i>Now, go back to Bridgeview. Take the Rover.</i>

313
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:42,590
No police, no detours.
And Nathan? Aggie will be fine.

314
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:49,864
<i>Rule number three.</i>
<i>You have until 5pm today.</i>

315
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,383
Let's do exactly what he says.

316
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:07,383
- Nathan, why don't we call the police?
- Because we can't.

317
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,983
Because l believe him.

318
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,212
Happy Thanksgiving.

319
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:11,887
Asshole.

320
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:16,359
- Aren't you and Jessie hittin' the parade?
- She's got a cold, Danny.

321
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,425
No signs of sexual assault.

322
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,399
l see evidence of injury in her neck.

323
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:42,870
Signs of bleeding in the
strap muscles overlying her larynx.

324
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:46,534
l don't know, Syd. This girl
does not match any of my missing persons.

325
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:51,306
Also evidence of a fracture
on the left tip of her hyoid bone.

326
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:53,473
Syd. How'd she die?

327
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,074
No blunt instrument here.

328
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:59,053
- Her neck was snapped in two.
- By what?

329
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:03,489
By two hands.

330
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:09,897
Syd. Same technique used
on this Battery Park floater?

331
00:36:17,306 --> 00:36:19,399
Same dislocation of the skull.

332
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,069
And the splotches on the body?

333
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:25,614
Cigarette burns. He was tortured.

334
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:28,115
And he had prison tats? OK.

335
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:32,916
l'm also gonna need fingerprints
and dental x-rays on our Jane Doe, pronto.

336
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:35,081
You know this is Thanksgiving?

337
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:39,684
You're right.

338
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:45,025
Hope her family isn't waiting on her
to carve the turkey.

339
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:50,431
Cassidy, l'm not susceptible
to your guilty-me bullshit.

340
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:55,706
She probably helped
her mom with the dishes.

341
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:04,746
Fingerprints and dentals. Then l'm outta here.

342
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,879
Thank you, Syd.

343
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:04,139
Slow it down.

344
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,183
Come on.

345
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,669
Roll down your window, sir.

346
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:42,110
- Officer, l'm a doctor.
- Congratulations.

347
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:46,985
- See that tuba player rolling off your hood?
- l need to get through this parade.

348
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:50,248
l need an escort to
the Bridgeview Psychiatric Hospital.

349
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:54,626
Do l look like a freakin' helicopter?
Use 57th Street like everyone else.

350
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:06,805
- He's talking to the cops. What do we do?
- <i>Be patient.</i>

351
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:09,406
There's a young girl who could die.

352
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:13,938
So, Officer, you can either
help me save this girl...

353
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,945
Or not.

354
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:24,084
Get outta here. Move on.
Can l have two of you?

355
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:27,162
Let's go. Right over there.

356
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:31,694
Hold the band right there.

357
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,492
Open those gates for me, guys.

358
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,966
The son of a bitch. He just picked up
a police escort and cut through the parade.

359
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:12,106
<i>l like that.</i>

360
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,803
- What?
- <i>The police escort. l like it a lot.</i>

361
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:20,542
- You didn't tell me the context of the number.
- She knows.

362
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:24,416
This girl has a decade
of pathology to unravel.

363
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:28,890
Even if she knows,
your five o'clock deadline is absurd.

364
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:33,088
ln my experience, people are at their best
facing unreasonable deadlines.

365
00:40:33,162 --> 00:40:35,653
<i>You can't just flick a switch in her head.</i>

366
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:38,723
Trust me. lt does not
work that way in these cases.

367
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:43,567
The money's bad, l know.
But you have family obligations right now.

368
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,234
And Nathan? Don't lose the phone.

369
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:39,825
- The doctor has landed.
- <i>Did he double-alarm the car?</i>

370
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:42,227
- Nope.
- <i>Good. We got him focused.</i>

371
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:45,632
- Do you have the key to Dr Sachs's office?
- Yeah.

372
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:47,896
- Open it, please.
- But Dr Sachs isn't here.

373
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,063
Open it.

374
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:59,632
<i>l thought Nathan explained the rules</i>
<i>very clearly. Put the cellphone back.</i>

375
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:05,638
<i>There's no percentage</i>
<i>in breaking those rules.</i>

376
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,208
You sick son of a bitch.

377
00:43:08,617 --> 00:43:12,519
- You hurt my little girl and l'll...
- <i>You'll do what?</i>

378
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,454
You were about to say something personal.

379
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:17,617
<i>l think.</i>

380
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:19,490
- No.
- <i>That's good.</i>

381
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:23,258
lf your husband is on his game today,
you've nothing to worry about.

382
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:29,271
There's a good side, Aggie. This will bring
you much closer than the occasional ski trip.

383
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:32,265
<i>Or sponge bath.</i>

384
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,209
The remote is to your left. Pick it up.

385
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:39,406
<i>Pick it up.</i>

386
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:44,882
Good. Now turn it on.

387
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,750
Try HBO.

388
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:59,023
No. l've seen this. A bit too violent.

389
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:02,069
Try a nice family drama.

390
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:54,453
- Nathan. What are you doin' here?
- You're not supposed to be here.

391
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:58,619
- How'd you get in? Who let you in?
- You're supposed to be in Greenwich.

392
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,854
Why are you here on Thanksgiving?

393
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:05,093
Why am l here? l gotta testify
in a double homicide on Monday.

394
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,795
l thought l'd come to my office
to do a little research.

395
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:13,204
You broke into my files.
Those are my pers...

396
00:45:13,308 --> 00:45:17,369
- l woulda given you the key, man.
- Have you gone through all of this?

397
00:45:17,446 --> 00:45:22,850
No, itjust got here. But l've been through the
master file. lt's a swamp of misdiagnosis...

398
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:26,081
- l think she's overlaying.
- Overlaying?

399
00:45:26,388 --> 00:45:30,415
She is a brilliant mimic.
That's why Rockland couldn't figure her out.

400
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:34,519
She's highly adaptive. She takes on
the symptoms of other patients.

401
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,463
She's like a counterfeit schizophrenic, maybe.

402
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,058
l can't believe it's all smoke and mirrors.

403
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:42,899
That would place her
in the malingerers' hall of fame.

404
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:46,065
l gotta believe there's
some genuine pathology beneath it.

405
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:50,544
She has classic post-traumatic
stress symptoms. Her PTSD is real.

406
00:45:50,646 --> 00:45:54,742
Seeing her father die, that was ground zero.

407
00:45:55,951 --> 00:46:01,412
And she also believes that
something or somebody is after her.

408
00:46:01,757 --> 00:46:07,821
That is why she stayed institutionalized these
past ten years. She wants to stay inside.

409
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,625
So, 20 different hospitalizations,

410
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,202
20 different diagnoses.

411
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:23,704
All overlaying. Nathan, that would make her
a very talented young lady, wouldn't it?

412
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,172
Or desperate.

413
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,425
- Louis?
- Yeah?

414
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:52,865
Does anybody know l'm treating
Elisabeth Burrows besides you?

415
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:56,136
Everybody. l put it up last night after you left.

416
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:59,408
Figured you might be back.
Wanted you to have clearance.

417
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:02,541
l also reinstated your password. Gate, please.

418
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:23,404
Elisabeth, good morning.

419
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,000
Are you feeling better?

420
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:32,508
l brought you something.

421
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,175
A chocolate turkey.

422
00:47:37,252 --> 00:47:42,451
The sugar'll help you metabolize
all those meds they've been giving you.

423
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:51,297
Do you like Thanksgiving?
lt's my favorite holiday.

424
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:04,609
Wanna touch?

425
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,808
- Sorry?
- l saw you looking.

426
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:13,087
l know what you're trying to do.
You want to embarrass me. lt won't work.

427
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:22,091
The other doctor?

428
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:25,189
- Dr Sachs.
- Yeah.

429
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,198
- l don't like him.
- l can understand that.

430
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:34,841
Very fucking funny.

431
00:48:36,078 --> 00:48:40,481
Elisabeth, there's something
important that l have to ask you.

432
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:46,483
But first l wanna show you something.

433
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,113
l have a daughter. She's eight.

434
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:52,385
Going on 18.

435
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,654
Her name's Jessie.

436
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:01,630
l have some of her favorite things here.

437
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:05,072
This is <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>

438
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:09,270
l've read it to her so many times,
it's pretty worn by now.

439
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:19,582
And this...
She loves to draw weird pictures of me.

440
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:39,267
And this.

441
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:42,602
This is Sally.

442
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:46,179
Would you like one of those?

443
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:50,514
l'll make sure the hospital lets you keep it.

444
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:52,643
<i>But you can only choose one.</i>

445
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:56,179
- What the hell is this? Toys ''R'' Us?
- <i>Want me to choose for you?</i>

446
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:13,238
- Dr Conrad?
- Yes?

447
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:16,502
Get out.

448
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:19,681
No.

449
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:21,841
<i>l want you to leave.</i>

450
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,680
No. We're not finished talking, Elisabeth.

451
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,814
l know what you're trying to do.

452
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,291
You wanna embarrass me. lt won't work.

453
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:40,935
What's your name?

454
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:45,838
Your hair's really long.

455
00:50:48,944 --> 00:50:52,107
My hair used to be that long
but my mom made me cut it.

456
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:57,881
What's that thing on your neck?

457
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:03,681
lt's kind of impolite
not to answer someone's question.

458
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:10,260
lt's a symbol.

459
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,500
- What's it mean?
- Don't talk.

460
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:20,267
Elisabeth, there's something l need to know.

461
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,469
Jessie.

462
00:51:22,544 --> 00:51:25,012
Jessie? That's my little girl's name.

463
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:29,080
Wanna see a picture that Jessie drew?

464
00:51:30,218 --> 00:51:34,951
l'll make you a deal. l'll show you
the picture if you answer my question.

465
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:39,452
ls it worth just one answer?
l don't mean a yes or no answer.

466
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,527
Maybe.

467
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:47,367
l'm gonna ask my question now, Elisabeth.

468
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,733
ls the man that you hurt in Rockland...

469
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:55,639
Did that have anything to do with the terrible
thing that happened to you in the subway?

470
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:58,177
<i>Come on, run.</i>

471
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,578
<i>Come on, honey, run.</i>

472
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,221
- l didn't know what you were talking about.
- <i>Run.</i>

473
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,316
l didn't know who ''they'' were
or what ''they'' wanted.

474
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:14,452
- Now l do. l know how bad they wanted it.
- Leave.

475
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:17,896
l know how important it was
for you to hold onto it.

476
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:20,297
l'm just asking...

477
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:24,263
Elizabeth, you have to...

478
00:52:35,317 --> 00:52:38,252
l'm sorry.

479
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:45,251
You lost her.

480
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,852
She's still got the doll, doesn't she?

481
00:53:16,224 --> 00:53:18,283
- Yeah?
- <i>That went well.</i>

482
00:53:19,661 --> 00:53:24,621
l can gain her trust. But without
more information, l'm shooting in the dark.

483
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:28,795
- The answer's right in front of you.
- l have gone through her files.

484
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:31,832
- Then look closer.
- You tell...

485
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:35,104
Nathan. lt's 12:22.

486
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:45,217
<i>l'm sure of one thing. They would have</i>
<i>encountered quite a few venomous species.</i>

487
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:49,321
<i>Like this. Check this out.</i>

488
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:53,621
<i>See how he's got his tail up, poised?</i>
<i>He is grumpy.</i>

489
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:59,094
<i>He gets his stinger back over the top</i>
<i>of his head, ready to grab and sting.</i>

490
00:54:00,502 --> 00:54:02,436
<i>Trying to recuperate.</i>

491
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:10,174
Sofia.

492
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:20,648
Sofia, why are you here?

493
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:27,092
l broke it. Mr Conrad will fix it.

494
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:36,065
What?

495
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:40,537
Turkey? No. No <i>tacchino.</i>

496
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:45,411
No telephone. Just give it to me.

497
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:54,253
Hello.

498
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:58,017
<i>Get rid of her.</i>

499
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,819
Sofia, no <i>tacchino.</i>

500
00:55:14,576 --> 00:55:17,568
- <i>Any more visitors?</i>
- No.

501
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:34,419
Come on. Yeah, baby, take it off.

502
00:55:40,068 --> 00:55:42,263
All right. Suit yourself.

503
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,362
l have to go. You have to call me back.

504
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,560
Have you seen this?

505
00:56:14,636 --> 00:56:18,265
What's this?
''Girl found wandering on Hart lsland''?

506
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:21,603
- Where'd you find this?
- ln her file in your office.

507
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:25,112
''A young girl was found
among the coffins on Hart lsland.''

508
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:29,182
This is around the time her father died.
l should run this by Child Services.

509
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,378
Could she have been lost or unattended?
That's bizarre.

510
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:35,321
On an island in the East River?

511
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:42,329
l saw Sarah. Two days ago. She was
meeting her boyfriend in the Village.

512
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,628
- Maybe she's still with him.
- She could be. Just wait one second.

513
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:51,231
Jake. Tray 57, and just her face.

514
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:57,636
- lt stinks in here.
- l know. Just breathe through your mouth.

515
00:56:57,712 --> 00:57:01,978
- l've never seen anyone dead before.
- You'll do fine.

516
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:06,350
- l'm gonna get sick.
- No one in here's gonna mind.

517
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:08,480
Come on.

518
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:19,689
l've gotta take this.
But l'm gonna be right here.

519
00:57:22,203 --> 00:57:25,468
Cassidy. Hey, baby.

520
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:32,706
Yeah. You should take the one o'clock,
because l'll be at Penn Station by two.

521
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:35,408
- Make it seven.
- l promise.

522
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:37,917
Don't promise.

523
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,820
What? Yeah, l'm almost done here.

524
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:45,423
Yeah. l'm at the city morgue. Bye.

525
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:51,324
- Your NClC on the guy with the busted neck.
- l got a hit.

526
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:54,995
Leon Edwards Croft.

527
00:57:57,472 --> 00:58:02,341
- Jesus, what does he have, 15, 20 arrests?
- A busy little bad guy that won't be missed.

528
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:07,541
- You run him for known associates?
- Of course. Am l not a paid professional?

529
00:58:16,257 --> 00:58:18,350
lt's OK.

530
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:21,618
Why would someone do this to Sarah?

531
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:27,101
The guy with the cigarette burns, Croft?
He was the driver for this crew.

532
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:30,898
Robbery said they hit banks.
Here, Jersey, Delaware, Virginia.

533
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:33,565
No convictions till '91.

534
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:37,600
And three of his friends just
capped off a ten-yearjolt in Attica.

535
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:43,912
Patrick Barry Koster.
He's the last one that got out. November 4th.

536
00:58:44,018 --> 00:58:46,111
November 4th.

537
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:48,519
Did Croft rat these guys out?

538
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:51,421
l don't know. Could be payback.

539
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:55,622
He has no priors. There is nothing on him.
He just came out of nowhere.

540
00:58:55,697 --> 00:59:00,691
l know. lt's the only thing
he ever got popped for. The guy's a ghost.

541
00:59:02,237 --> 00:59:04,933
l guess that's who l need to talk to.
Thank you.

542
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:06,769
- Watch your back.
- Yeah.

543
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:18,012
You picked Jessie's
absolutely favorite thing.

544
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:22,147
She and Sally were
inseparable since they were two.

545
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,857
Where is she?

546
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:30,462
Where's Jessie?

547
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,067
They took her.

548
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:40,698
Now she's really scared. As scared as you
were when you went for that guy at Rockland,

549
00:59:40,808 --> 00:59:43,777
but she's only eight years old, Elisabeth.

550
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:48,441
She's not as strong as you are. She can't
protect herself as well as you can.

551
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:52,848
l am notjust here to help you.

552
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:58,988
- Me help you.
- l need you to help me.

553
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:06,696
Otherwise, l'm not getting my little girl back.

554
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:13,835
Today's Thanksgiving.

555
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,669
Do you remember Thanksgiving?

556
01:00:17,712 --> 01:00:20,738
Yes, l remember.

557
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,741
Who were you with?

558
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:29,089
My dad.

559
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:31,250
Just me and my dad.

560
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,859
<i>Being strong isn't only</i>
<i>about protecting yourseIf.</i>

561
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,955
lt's also having the strength to let go,

562
01:00:38,066 --> 01:00:41,263
especially if you're holding
onto something so tightly

563
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:45,067
that you don't even know
that you could have a better life.

564
01:00:47,175 --> 01:00:53,307
The only way that you can
help yourself is if you go back.

565
01:01:00,088 --> 01:01:03,888
You have to go back
to that day on the subway.

566
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:07,720
l can't. Can't do it. No.

567
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:10,891
Here we go. The main event.

568
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:13,694
You can't help my little girl
unless you go back.

569
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:16,269
No, please.

570
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:22,466
Listen to me. The men that have Jessie

571
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:28,677
are the same men you're frightened of,
the men that sent the orderly after you.

572
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,208
- l don't wanna hear this.
- All they want is a number.

573
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:35,016
- You want what they want.
- They know you know it.

574
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:38,684
- They'll kill my little girl if you don't tell me.
- Stop it.

575
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,454
<i>Daddy.</i>

576
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:42,361
- ls it a telephone number?
- No.

577
01:01:42,463 --> 01:01:45,330
- An address? An account?
- l don't know.

578
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:48,300
- A bank account? A code? A place?
- No.

579
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:50,428
What is it?

580
01:01:53,074 --> 01:01:55,668
What's wrong? We lost the feed?

581
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,310
No, we're good.

582
01:01:58,546 --> 01:02:01,572
You leave him alone.

583
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:06,112
Your father is gone.

584
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:11,320
And no one is gonna hurt him anymore.

585
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:16,595
My little girl is still alive.

586
01:02:17,498 --> 01:02:20,126
Jessie is alive.

587
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:33,137
Dr Conrad...

588
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,643
l'm scared.

589
01:02:51,165 --> 01:02:53,531
l know. l'm sorry.

590
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:56,728
- Shit.
- <i>lt's OK.</i>

591
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:02,041
- Elisabeth...
- l'll try.

592
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,036
You're OK.

593
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:20,286
Long time since breakfast.

594
01:03:20,995 --> 01:03:24,726
- Yeah.
- l wish we had some cheeseburgers.

595
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:39,871
<i>The best turkey you ever had.</i>

596
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:43,246
<i>Careful, or l'll put you in the oven with it.</i>

597
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,721
<i>l love you, Daddy.</i>

598
01:04:11,846 --> 01:04:16,180
- What's that?
- This is a 5cc syringe,

599
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,980
with a 10-gauge needle
and 500mg of sodium amytal.

600
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:24,821
500mg? Why not give her a quart of Jack
Daniel's and stick a shotgun in her mouth?

601
01:04:24,892 --> 01:04:28,623
The event is obviously
right beneath the surface.

602
01:04:28,696 --> 01:04:32,598
She should respond beautifully to Amytal.

603
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:44,438
Answer it.

604
01:04:53,421 --> 01:04:55,480
You answer the phone.

605
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:04,087
Tell them everything's OK,

606
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:06,462
and that you're going to plan B.

607
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:13,664
Everything's OK, and we're going to plan B.

608
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:16,875
lt's a drug.

609
01:05:17,845 --> 01:05:21,804
You knew all about the numbers,
and you set me up, Louis.

610
01:05:21,882 --> 01:05:25,079
- l swear to God...
- You tell me why or l'm gonna shove this...

611
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:28,313
They got my fucking girlfriend.
He's keeping Sarah hostage.

612
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:32,449
- He'll kill her if l don't get him this number.
- Your girlfriend, Louis?

613
01:05:32,526 --> 01:05:34,687
He's got my daughter.

614
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:41,129
- He's got my little girl.
- Nathan, l didn't know that.

615
01:05:41,235 --> 01:05:43,931
l'm sorry. l didn't know.

616
01:05:44,538 --> 01:05:48,133
You gotta get the number for this guy.
He'll go away. lt's that simple.

617
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:50,233
Dr Sachs?

618
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:54,445
- Yes?
- There's a cop here to see you.

619
01:05:56,217 --> 01:06:00,017
- A cop? What kind of cop?
- l don't know.

620
01:06:00,721 --> 01:06:04,680
- What does he want?
- She. She didn't say. She's in your office.

621
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:07,090
OK.

622
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:10,659
- Tell her l'll be right there.
- OK.

623
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:19,071
- He said no cops under any circumstances.
- You have got to go down to your office.

624
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:23,041
You have to be cool,
and you make her go away.

625
01:06:41,028 --> 01:06:44,122
lf we don't have it by 4:30, we go to plan...

626
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:29,401
Peanut butter and jelly.
What kind ofjelly is it?

627
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:36,446
Hello there.

628
01:07:36,517 --> 01:07:40,783
- l'm Louis Sachs.
- Hi. Detective Cassidy.

629
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:48,020
- Pretty girl. ls that your daughter?
- This?

630
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:52,327
No. This is not my daughter.
How can l help you today, Detective?

631
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:55,334
- l'm here about this woman.
- What about her?

632
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:58,997
- You don't know her?
- Nope.

633
01:08:11,986 --> 01:08:15,285
She worked in the hospital for five months.
She was a resident.

634
01:08:15,389 --> 01:08:19,257
Really? We have dozens and dozens
of residents, l will tell you that.

635
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,693
She worked in the department you oversee.

636
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:27,029
That's strange. l should know who she is.

637
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:30,593
And l don't. So there's gotta be a mistake.

638
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,401
- When did you last see Sarah?
- Detective.

639
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:39,608
l just told you, and l'll tell you again,
l do not know who that is.

640
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:51,519
Where are we going?

641
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:55,254
- Do you have a lawyer, sir?
- What?

642
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:58,389
- Do you have a lawyer?
- What are you talking about?

643
01:08:58,465 --> 01:09:01,832
- You don't know Sarah?
- No. Why are we talking about lawyers?

644
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:06,463
A week ago, in Central Park, with you.
She told her roommate Vanessa about it.

645
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:10,032
- You know Vanessa? She knows you.
- l don't know Vanessa either.

646
01:09:10,144 --> 01:09:12,237
l'm about to read you your rights.

647
01:09:12,346 --> 01:09:14,541
- My rights?
- Yeah, but first...

648
01:09:14,648 --> 01:09:18,015
- What did l do?
- l want you to do me a favor.

649
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:23,455
This is last weekend, with you,
by the fountain in Central Park.

650
01:09:23,557 --> 01:09:27,391
You took this picture. And this is her now.

651
01:09:27,461 --> 01:09:31,454
This one you did, this one l took.
Who do you think did better, me or you?

652
01:09:31,565 --> 01:09:34,557
- That's not Sarah.
- That's Sarah, laid out in the morgue.

653
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:40,096
- No, it's not Sarah in the fucking morgue.
- l work Homicide, Dr Sachs. That's Sarah.

654
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:42,235
The morgue?

655
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:53,679
- lt can't be Sarah. That's not the deal.
- That's not the deal?

656
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:58,425
Why don't you tell me
what the fuck the deal is?

657
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:02,656
Who is part of the deal?
ls he part of it? How about him?

658
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:06,823
Tell me who is part of the deal.

659
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:10,462
He said we had until five today.
That's a mistake.

660
01:10:10,537 --> 01:10:12,528
lt's no mistake. Who's ''we''?

661
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,200
We are so fuckin' close.
All we need is a half-hour.

662
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:18,335
- Dr Sachs, who is ''we''?
- That's not Sarah.

663
01:10:18,445 --> 01:10:23,314
Why don't you quit wasting
my fucking time and tell me, who's ''we''?

664
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:27,410
You like country music?

665
01:11:10,631 --> 01:11:13,395
What did l say about noise?

666
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,830
Daddy's smart little girl, aren't you?

667
01:11:20,307 --> 01:11:23,333
Better hope your mother didn't hear that.

668
01:11:23,444 --> 01:11:25,503
Go full screen on her.

669
01:11:30,284 --> 01:11:32,684
Tighter.

670
01:11:52,306 --> 01:11:55,935
- She heard.
- How do you know?

671
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:59,475
She's stopped breathing.

672
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:28,265
So what can l do for you, Doc?

673
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,276
Arnie, l need to ask you a favor.

674
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,649
Were you takin' Burrows for a stroll?

675
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,650
- We're out of here. Bring her.
- Mommy, Daddy, l'm up here!

676
01:12:58,138 --> 01:12:59,833
Take care of her.

677
01:13:01,075 --> 01:13:03,270
l need you to open the gates.

678
01:13:03,377 --> 01:13:06,574
- On whose authorization?
- This is between you and me.

679
01:13:08,682 --> 01:13:12,209
That's why they call this place
the nuthouse, Doc.

680
01:13:12,486 --> 01:13:16,388
Cos l'd have to be, basically,
fuckin' nuts to let you do that.

681
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:21,784
OK. Well, l just had to ask you...

682
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:30,693
lt's OK, Arnie. lt's just a sedative.

683
01:13:30,804 --> 01:13:34,331
lt's all right. You'll be fine in about an hour.

684
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:20,277
Dr Conrad?

685
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:25,624
Fuck.

686
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:51,643
Excuse me.

687
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:05,429
<i>Security breach. Start emergency procedures.</i>

688
01:15:05,499 --> 01:15:11,995
<i>Security personnel, officer down. We have a</i>
<i>security breach. Start emergency procedures.</i>

689
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:08,755
A gold Land Roverjust left Bridgeview,
heading east.

690
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:11,423
- They're leaving.
- The driver is a Dr Conrad.

691
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:15,264
Wanted for questioning
in connection with a homicide.

692
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:22,572
Have an RMP respond
to his residence immediately.

693
01:17:17,431 --> 01:17:20,298
Oh, my God.

694
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:41,114
- <i>What's on your mind, Nathan?</i>
- Field trip.

695
01:17:47,594 --> 01:17:51,189
Wait a second. Where are you taking Jessie?

696
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:53,796
- <i>Why are you moving her?</i>
- You have 44 minutes.

697
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:59,636
Why are you moving her?

698
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:07,468
<i>All right, l will get you the number.</i>

699
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:10,945
- Just don't hurt her.
- 43 minutes.

700
01:18:24,464 --> 01:18:28,491
<i>You have reached New York City's</i>
<i>emergency services. Please stay on the line.</i>

701
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:33,301
<i>Your call will be answered in</i>
<i>the order in which it was received.</i>

702
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:38,469
You crippled bitch.

703
01:19:40,674 --> 01:19:42,767
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

704
01:19:59,726 --> 01:20:00,784
<i>Move.</i>

705
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,032
- This is where it happened, isn't it?
- No.

706
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:17,003
When we left home, my dad and me...

707
01:20:22,749 --> 01:20:24,546
Big car, dark.

708
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:30,088
l'd never seen my dad so scared.

709
01:20:30,357 --> 01:20:34,088
He grabbed my arm. He kept running.

710
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,253
And l tried to keep up.

711
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:48,233
- You can do it.
- OK.

712
01:20:49,175 --> 01:20:51,541
You can do it. Let's go.

713
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,240
lt's OK.

714
01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:03,913
Elisabeth?

715
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:08,019
There were lots of people.

716
01:21:09,029 --> 01:21:11,623
But my dad just pulled me through them.

717
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,233
l looked back.

718
01:21:16,703 --> 01:21:19,103
They were so fast.

719
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:22,705
They're still behind us.

720
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:27,241
There were only two men. We lost one.

721
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:31,842
My dad took me around the corner.

722
01:21:45,932 --> 01:21:48,025
He made me hide over here.

723
01:21:50,537 --> 01:21:55,372
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>
<i>You and Mishka, you gotta wait here.</i>

724
01:21:55,508 --> 01:21:58,477
<i>lt's gonna be fine.</i>

725
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,650
<i>Russel, where've you been?</i>

726
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:11,657
<i>What's in the fuckin'bag?</i>

727
01:22:11,725 --> 01:22:15,058
They could see my dad's face
and he tried to talk to them.

728
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,667
<i>There's nothing in the fuckin'bag.</i>

729
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:25,304
<i>Where is it, Russel?</i>

730
01:22:28,241 --> 01:22:32,701
What's happening now? Elisabeth?

731
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:35,406
<i>l don't believe a fuckin' word.</i>

732
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:41,719
Elisabeth, what do you see?

733
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:43,550
<i>Where is it?</i>

734
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:47,559
The one in the red coat kept on kicking him

735
01:22:47,661 --> 01:22:51,358
and asking him
''Where is it? Tell me where it is.''

736
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:54,962
- <i>Let me up and l'll tell you where it is.</i>
- Elisabeth.

737
01:22:57,737 --> 01:23:00,331
- <i>Where is it?</i>
<i>- Come on, help me up.</i>

738
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:05,878
And everybody was watching
and no one would help.

739
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,528
Elisabeth, what did the man want?

740
01:23:25,398 --> 01:23:27,662
- l can almost reach him.
- Elisabeth.

741
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:31,533
- Daddy!
- <i>No!</i>

742
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:39,303
<i>Turn around. Hands up.</i>

743
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:47,416
- <i>Down on your knees.</i>
- What did the man want, Elisabeth?

744
01:23:49,055 --> 01:23:51,114
Did he want a number?

745
01:23:53,259 --> 01:23:56,251
Elisabeth,
l need to know what the man wanted.

746
01:23:57,063 --> 01:23:59,759
He wants Mishka. My doll.

747
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:04,059
- And where is Mishka? Where is your doll?
- <i>Hang onto that, baby.</i>

748
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:42,998
- Yeah.
- <i>You're cutting it rather close.</i>

749
01:24:43,076 --> 01:24:45,306
All right. l have what you want.

750
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:48,071
Good. l'm listening.

751
01:24:48,481 --> 01:24:52,611
l've decided l'm gonna deliver
the number to you in person.

752
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:55,085
No time.

753
01:24:55,221 --> 01:24:57,746
- No choice.
- Being brave again, Nathan.

754
01:24:58,124 --> 01:25:01,093
<i>That's the best way</i>
<i>to get your daughter killed.</i>

755
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:05,427
Other than missing the deadline,
which is less than three minutes away.

756
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:07,796
Rule number one. No more clock.

757
01:25:08,234 --> 01:25:10,202
- What?
- You heard me.

758
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:14,196
- Now, l'll meet you there.
- Where?

759
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:19,906
l think you know where. And rule number
two, l want to speak to my daughter now.

760
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:24,283
Do you hear me?
l want to speak to my daughter now.

761
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:30,122
- Daddy?
- Pumpkin, are you all right?

762
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:32,788
Yeah. Daddy, please come get me now.

763
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,855
l'm on my way, sweetheart.

764
01:25:38,298 --> 01:25:42,496
- Anything else?
- Rule number three. No more phone.

765
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:55,142
l got a medical emergency.
l'll get this phone back to you.

766
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:32,450
- <i>Aggie?</i>
- ls she alive?

767
01:26:32,886 --> 01:26:35,218
- She's fine.
- Where is she?

768
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:37,914
Aggie, listen to me.

769
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:42,019
What is that? Did you call the police?

770
01:26:42,428 --> 01:26:44,658
<i>Aggie?</i>

771
01:26:44,731 --> 01:26:48,030
No. But somebody did.

772
01:26:48,601 --> 01:26:50,899
Do they know what's going on?

773
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:55,304
- Not yet. Listen.
- l'm here.

774
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,801
Just get her back.

775
01:28:32,171 --> 01:28:34,264
What you doin' down there?

776
01:28:34,374 --> 01:28:38,208
That's my boat. Where you goin', asshole?

777
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:42,406
What you doin'? Bring that back.

778
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:38,922
Dr Conrad.

779
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:43,026
You're a committed man.

780
01:30:46,672 --> 01:30:48,970
l wanna see her.

781
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,876
l wanna see her now.

782
01:30:54,147 --> 01:30:56,513
Grim place for a holiday, isn't it?

783
01:31:01,787 --> 01:31:04,017
Hello, Elisabeth.

784
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:09,022
l've thought about you
every day for the last ten years.

785
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:11,722
l bet you've thought about me, too.

786
01:31:13,733 --> 01:31:17,294
l know you've been through a lot.
But so have l.

787
01:31:20,273 --> 01:31:23,208
Your father let us both down.

788
01:31:26,846 --> 01:31:29,713
- Where's my daughter?
- She hasn't given it to you.

789
01:31:29,815 --> 01:31:31,908
- Where is she?
- She won't give it to you.

790
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:34,248
- l wanna see Jessie.
- Where's my number?

791
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,880
You're not getting anything until l see...

792
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:42,116
We talked about bravery today.

793
01:31:46,966 --> 01:31:50,026
lt's not good.

794
01:31:52,972 --> 01:31:55,099
You need to know how to use these.

795
01:32:02,048 --> 01:32:04,107
l wanna see my daughter.

796
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:08,015
Yeah, l think you've earned it.

797
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,853
- Max.
- Daddy?

798
01:32:11,657 --> 01:32:14,217
- Jessie?
- Daddy.

799
01:32:15,394 --> 01:32:18,921
lt's all right, honey. You're gonna be fine.

800
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,928
You guessed the number
is a grave. Very good.

801
01:32:24,036 --> 01:32:26,095
Now what?

802
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:29,840
l finish my job.

803
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:39,480
Come on, Nathan. Up the stairs.

804
01:32:56,335 --> 01:32:58,303
Over there, by the table.

805
01:32:59,272 --> 01:33:02,070
And Elisabeth. Not her.

806
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:04,636
Take her back outside.

807
01:33:05,378 --> 01:33:10,111
- Daddy?
- Jessie, you're gonna be all right, honey.

808
01:33:12,618 --> 01:33:15,314
Now, let's see what 200 an hour can do.

809
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:36,500
Officer Peterson. Nice work.
You found my car. Where is it?

810
01:33:36,809 --> 01:33:40,142
- lt's over there.
- OK. Now, where's my guy?

811
01:33:40,246 --> 01:33:43,807
He smashed through a steel fence
on the Corrections pier.

812
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:47,011
Then he jacked a boat from that individual.

813
01:33:47,086 --> 01:33:50,419
He and some girl. Sounds a little hinky.

814
01:33:50,489 --> 01:33:53,947
- A boat to where?
- That's the Coast Guard's problem.

815
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:59,327
lt is not. lt is my problem.
lt is your problem. What is over there?

816
01:34:07,606 --> 01:34:12,373
- Where's the music coming from, Elisabeth?
- The radio.

817
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,672
- Where?
- lt's playing on the boat.

818
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,489
On the boat that brought
you here the first time?

819
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:26,649
Yeah.

820
01:34:28,227 --> 01:34:30,457
lt was cold. lt was wet.

821
01:34:32,298 --> 01:34:35,859
My eyes were burning,
but l was with my dad.

822
01:34:37,136 --> 01:34:40,196
How did you know which one was your dad?

823
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,607
They gave him a number.

824
01:34:45,444 --> 01:34:48,106
Where was this number?

825
01:34:51,484 --> 01:34:57,218
lt's on his box.
They carved the number on top of his box.

826
01:35:00,893 --> 01:35:03,953
l tried to get it open,
but my fingers were numb.

827
01:35:04,964 --> 01:35:08,058
l couldn't lift it, it was too heavy.

828
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:12,267
l couldn't put Mishka inside.

829
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:15,704
Better pray she's lying, Nathan.

830
01:35:15,808 --> 01:35:19,505
Where did Mishka go?
What happened to Mishka?

831
01:35:19,845 --> 01:35:24,214
- They saw me.
- Who saw you?

832
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:28,011
The men with the music.

833
01:35:28,521 --> 01:35:33,288
They were working. They said my lips
were blue. They gave me a blanket.

834
01:35:36,061 --> 01:35:38,586
l told them ''My dad's inside.''

835
01:35:39,732 --> 01:35:42,223
''And l need to put her inside with him.''

836
01:35:43,903 --> 01:35:48,203
''l need to put Mishka in the box,'' l told them.

837
01:35:53,412 --> 01:35:55,505
What did they do?

838
01:36:01,086 --> 01:36:03,247
They helped me.

839
01:36:10,262 --> 01:36:15,996
They helped me put Mishka
inside the box with him.

840
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:20,268
They let me stay with him.

841
01:36:21,707 --> 01:36:23,231
Until...

842
01:37:09,889 --> 01:37:12,619
So what's gonna happen
if you dig this thing up?

843
01:37:12,691 --> 01:37:16,218
He's gonna have you
kill me and my little girl.

844
01:37:16,595 --> 01:37:18,654
You like her. l can tell that.

845
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:23,660
And when you're done with us,
he'll be done with you.

846
01:37:25,304 --> 01:37:26,896
Just keep walkin'.

847
01:38:17,756 --> 01:38:21,692
This boat's for charter, not runnin'
around the Sound on Thanksgiving.

848
01:38:21,794 --> 01:38:27,960
Like l said, sir, it's police business. Do me a
favor, Captain Bligh. Drive the friggin' boat.

849
01:38:48,187 --> 01:38:50,417
Go on, Max. Open it up.

850
01:39:16,548 --> 01:39:18,607
Get her out.

851
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:20,676
The girl. Out.

852
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:25,187
- Sit down.
- Daddy.

853
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,753
Let me go.

854
01:39:29,828 --> 01:39:34,288
l am going to put a bullet through your knee.
Then you'll give me the right number.

855
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,300
No.

856
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:46,877
No. Get off.

857
01:39:49,815 --> 01:39:51,043
Get her off.

858
01:39:52,484 --> 01:39:54,213
Sit down.

859
01:39:54,286 --> 01:39:58,052
Forget the fuckin' number.
Just say hi to your dad from me.

860
01:39:58,123 --> 01:40:01,251
- She gave it to you - in reverse.
- She gave me nothing.

861
01:40:01,393 --> 01:40:05,090
- lt's reversed in her mind.
- Shut up. l've got nothing, you lying bitch.

862
01:40:05,197 --> 01:40:07,529
Cognitive distortion.

863
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,698
She wrote it right to left.

864
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:13,534
Look.

865
01:40:15,741 --> 01:40:18,301
She sees it in a mirror.

866
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:32,721
Can you imagine
what'll happen if this is bullshit?

867
01:40:43,969 --> 01:40:47,166
Central, this is
Detective Cassidy from Homicide.

868
01:40:47,306 --> 01:40:50,469
Shots fired
on the northeast shore of Hart lsland.

869
01:40:50,542 --> 01:40:52,976
l'm en route. l need Harbor and Aviation.

870
01:41:49,935 --> 01:41:51,766
Ten years of my life.

871
01:41:52,771 --> 01:41:54,932
Bought and fuckin' paid for.

872
01:42:04,316 --> 01:42:06,807
Take care of that.

873
01:43:51,523 --> 01:43:53,616
You're not like me, Nathan.

874
01:43:53,959 --> 01:43:57,417
l would have killed
a man who took my little girl.

875
01:43:58,563 --> 01:44:01,054
Police. Don't move.

876
01:44:04,303 --> 01:44:06,863
Drop your weapon.

877
01:44:10,008 --> 01:44:12,306
Go on.

878
01:44:43,408 --> 01:44:45,205
l never got your name.

879
01:44:47,879 --> 01:44:50,245
Patrick.

880
01:44:53,618 --> 01:44:57,816
Are you sure l'm not like you?

881
01:45:01,426 --> 01:45:03,826
Are you sure?

882
01:45:14,172 --> 01:45:17,300
Was this really worth it?

883
01:45:18,076 --> 01:45:19,703
What?

884
01:45:21,279 --> 01:45:23,873
Your life.

885
01:45:23,982 --> 01:45:26,450
Absolutely.

886
01:45:27,986 --> 01:45:30,045
lt's mine.

887
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:34,518
Then you go get it.

888
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,525
l'll be right back, sweetie.

889
01:48:02,807 --> 01:48:05,537
- How are you holdin' up?
- l've been better.

890
01:48:09,047 --> 01:48:11,140
Thank you.

891
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,048
Let's go. Come on.
