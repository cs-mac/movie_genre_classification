1
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:59,951
I am here because..

2
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,850
I recognize..

3
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:06,726
in my life there has been
a major imbalance,

4
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,086
mainly caused by..

5
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:13,530
what I have done in a criminal way.

6
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,130
I want to promise myself

7
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,933
that this is going to be
the most honest..

8
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,600
confession of my life,

9
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,672
and in doing that,

10
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:30,273
I need to make
the long journey backwards

11
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,215
to understand what I did,

12
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,913
to acknowledge that,

13
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:39,118
in some way to make
reparation for it,

14
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:43,128
and to let those
whom I have offended

15
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:46,290
know that, if possible.

16
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,231
Basically what I want
to say to them is, you know,

17
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,825
it should not have happened.

18
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:52,929
It should not have happened.

19
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:18,195
When I saw him the first time,

20
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,256
oh, I think it was love at first sight.

21
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:23,529
- I agree.
- I really do.

22
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,969
It was easy to talk to her.

23
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,974
It must be.
We've been together 41 years now.

24
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:34,644
But he wasn't really practicing Buddhism.

25
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:36,944
He used to go with me to church.

26
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,711
Yeah. Before I even met you,

27
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:41,310
I think I used to go to the chapel,

28
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:44,049
just for peace and quiet,
you know, so..

29
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,216
But then I still had to go to Ireland

30
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:49,125
and talk to Maria's dad
and ask for her hand.

31
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:50,856
- By then you were baptized.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,300
I think that was a big
concern for my family.

33
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:53,694
Yeah.

34
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:58,396
We got married
December 26, 1964.

35
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,235
I told Maria, I said,
"Would you like to go to the States?"

36
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,433
It was a big step,

37
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:06,171
but, you know, I was willing
to go anywhere Bob was going.

38
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,178
Yeah.

39
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:10,876
Ann was born May 9, 1966.

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,077
Yeah, a bundle of joy, really.

41
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,414
- She really was.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,352
'Cause Bob was working
12 hours a day.

43
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,549
We'd get dressed up,
and we'd go outside

44
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,718
and wait for Bob
when he was coming home.

45
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:22,192
Oh, she'd say, "Hi, Daddy,"

46
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,457
and give me a hug
and kiss, you know.

47
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,091
She was a perfect
little lady, you know.

48
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,691
You could take her anyplace.

49
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,203
In her own little way,
she was taking care of me.

50
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,205
So then I went to work
one day a week,

51
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:36,174
and then we decided
we'd buy a house.. this one.

52
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:38,107
This one here.

53
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,804
The one and only house we got.

54
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,712
I was raised a really
strict Catholic in Ireland.

55
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,147
I mean, that was our life.

56
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:45,149
Yeah, and..

57
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:47,186
There is no other religion.

58
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:51,383
I thought she was a shining example
of a good Catholic

59
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,924
who had faith in her religion

60
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:57,395
whether I accepted all the beliefs
of the Catholic Church or not.

61
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,930
But I believed something..

62
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,558
And, you know, you raise
your kids that way, you know.

63
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:02,999
That was part of our life.

64
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,003
- It was our life, actually.
- It was.

65
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,767
I found peace there,

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,274
and, you know, comfort, I guess.

67
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,753
Some people are born
to be leaders,

68
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,265
some people are born to follow,
et cetera, you know.

69
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,768
I like helping people,

70
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:39,624
and, as one of my priest
friends said to me once,

71
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,264
he said, "You're a people person."

72
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,741
And I think that helped a lot to say,

73
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,143
"Hey, I finally reached what..
or I'd like to do.

74
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,306
"I think this is what I want to do.

75
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,907
I think this is
what I'm called to do."

76
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:53,680
I like to be with people.

77
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:57,587
I felt I was good with people.

78
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:59,249
I felt I was good with children.

79
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,587
I've often asked myself,

80
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,322
Why did I..

81
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,761
Why do I like children so much?

82
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:08,528
What do I want to do for them?

83
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:12,128
I feel compassionate to children
that I see sort of cornered and..

84
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:16,335
who image what I was
when I was their age

85
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,967
and did not have

86
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,077
somebody to turn to.

87
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:24,708
I tend to want to reach out
to people like that.

88
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,412
First time we met him was in 1971.

89
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:30,183
I was so excited to meet
somebody from home.

90
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,518
And I'd only been here,

91
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,218
like, five years at that time.

92
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:38,127
He would come and spend
his days off here.

93
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,665
He had a really strong Irish accent
at that time,

94
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,428
so we used to help him
with his sermons,

95
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:45,630
and Ann would go places with him.

96
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:47,832
Ann Jyono.

97
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,876
Little Ann.. Ann was one
of the first people I met there,

98
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,467
or at least her parents.

99
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:56,709
Her mother was Irish,
father was Japanese..

100
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:59,149
of Japanese extraction, I think..

101
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:01,982
and was very welcome
at their home

102
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:06,048
for many, many years
of my time in Lodi.

103
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:11,085
I could, and was often
invited, to sleep over there.

104
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:14,031
Perhaps that's where
some of the problems began

105
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,625
in that.. in Ann's situation.

106
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,037
There are two types
of people in the Church:

107
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:29,377
the hierarchy in the sacred
pastures, as they call them,

108
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,781
who are picked out by God to lead,

109
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,944
and the vast throng
who are the lay people,

110
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,512
and their duty is to be docile,
obedient followers.

111
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,524
It says that.

112
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,116
The system, it's a monarchy.

113
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,822
All power rests in individuals,

114
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:46,763
and so the system
protects those individuals

115
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,698
because it believes
that that is the will

116
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,793
of the higher power,
of the Almighty:

117
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,532
that He wants those individuals

118
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:56,700
to be powerful in order to control

119
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:59,643
this portion of reality called Earth.

120
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,805
And that's, I think, is..

121
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,146
It may sound simplistic
and like science fiction,

122
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,651
but that, in fact, is what it is.

123
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,351
I was..

124
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,325
a student for eight years at Holy Spirit,

125
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,828
which is in the Sacramento Diocese,

126
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,798
and they had some kind
of advertisement to Camp Pendola,

127
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,631
and it was my first time ever
going away to camp.

128
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,297
None of my friends
went to school there.

129
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,670
I didn't know
anybody else there,

130
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,403
and I actually wrote
a letter to my mom

131
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,910
that she had..

132
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,378
On the back of the envelope,

133
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,883
I said I met a new friend,
and his name was Father O'Grady.

134
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,909
I remember him coming
on a sleep-over with the other girls,

135
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:43,819
and a couple of days later,

136
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,586
the other girls breaking out
with poison oak,

137
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,579
and them telling me
that I didn't have poison oak

138
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:50,391
'cause I slept with Father.

139
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,963
And I think the thing
that I'm going to regret most

140
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,731
is that I allowed myself to..

141
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:02,137
just to cuddling alongside her
in bed one night

142
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,766
when she was visiting with me.

143
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,435
I would..

144
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:08,036
label it love and concern..

145
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,810
hugging, embracing.

146
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:13,044
That tended to..

147
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,285
satisfy me and..

148
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:21,416
in a way that took care of my need

149
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:24,463
to reach out to somebody, you know.

150
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:28,158
From there, I don't know
how the relationship started,

151
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,566
that he got my address,

152
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:34,072
that he got in contact with my parents.

153
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,539
He..

154
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,077
came over to the house
a couple of times.

155
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,108
My mother's from Argentina,

156
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:46,880
so she has more
of a trusting attitude.

157
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,648
She had told him, I think,

158
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:51,781
that I was pulling away
from the family a little bit.

159
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,853
She thought it was a good idea
for me to spend time with him.

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,461
If somebody asked me,
"Where was," you know,

161
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:04,628
"What.."

162
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,698
"What kicks the bucket for you?"

163
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,868
Whatever the thing is.

164
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,070
"What triggers things off for you?"

165
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,670
You know, "What areas would be?"

166
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:20,344
And, if given a variety
of areas to consider,

167
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:24,651
you know, I'd have to say
certainly on the younger level.

168
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:29,024
That's where a lot of that surfaced.

169
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:30,918
And if they said to me,

170
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:33,488
"Well, do you feel aroused
when you see women?"

171
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,033
I'd probably say no.

172
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:36,693
"Do you feel aroused
when you see men?" No.

173
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,794
"Do you feel aroused
if you've seen children?"

174
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,168
I'd say, "Well, maybe."

175
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,038
"How about children who are..

176
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:44,098
in swimsuits?"

177
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:46,041
I'd say, "Yeah."

178
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:47,943
"How about children in underwear?"

179
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:51,006
I'd say, "Yeah," you know?

180
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,381
How about..
"If you thought you saw children naked?"

181
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:54,783
And I'd say, "Mmm, yeah."

182
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,988
My last memory..

183
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,921
of Oliver..

184
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,893
is severe..

185
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:07,563
pain..

186
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,599
before I black out.

187
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:21,603
Years ago, Case was Pastor of St. Anne's,

188
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:26,243
and the parents called Case,

189
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,310
and said to him,

190
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,123
"You know, when we
picked up our daughter,

191
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:37,458
"she was not herself at all.

192
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,330
"She was very nervous
and looked very jumpy

193
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,360
and looked extremely anxious."

194
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,999
I mean, he took me out of the house.

195
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,771
I said, you know,
"Sometimes I get carsick on the road."

196
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,368
He said, "Put your head on my lap,"

197
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,004
and, boom, the abuse started.

198
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,673
I mean, I was on Highway 12,

199
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,775
you know, two minutes
away from my house, and it started.

200
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,321
And for 96 hours, that abuse
was happening until my parents came

201
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,221
and said, "Did you have fun with Father?"

202
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,157
And I'm, like, "He tickled me too much."

203
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:10,923
How do you tell your parents
what you just went through?

204
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:14,727
They finally got it out of her that,

205
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,529
during the night,

206
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:21,505
Ollie had come into her room
and had molested her.

207
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:26,336
I think I tried
to be affectionate with her

208
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,904
by kissing her on the mouth.

209
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,974
And I know that
my hand went down,

210
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,646
and I think I brought up
her night dress

211
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,019
and tried to..

212
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,959
not tried to, I did touch her
in the genital area,

213
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:45,292
perhaps outside her clothing at first

214
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:48,197
and maybe, although I can't be specific,

215
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:53,000
I think I probably tried
to put my hand inside her underwear,

216
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:56,599
and I think that's about
the time I realized that..

217
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,910
it was not correct to continue,

218
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,210
and, although I'm not..

219
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,153
paraphrasing exactly
what I remember I did,

220
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,316
but I think I want to say
that I stopped shortly afterwards

221
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,517
and..

222
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,222
left the bed,

223
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,820
left the room,
and went back to my own bed.

224
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,291
Case said, "Have you
ever done this before?"

225
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,359
And, "No."

226
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:25,768
And.. So he told him.

227
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:30,207
He said, "Ollie, this is outrageous."

228
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:33,006
"This is the very type of thing

229
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,241
"that people can go to prison for.

230
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:41,378
I want you to sit down
and write a letter of apology."

231
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:44,218
I took, you know, the occasion

232
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,157
to write my letter to the victim,

233
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:51,128
and to say,
"Hey, I'm sorry."

234
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,789
"May I say first of all"

235
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:56,164
"that this is a difficult letter
for me to write."

236
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,396
"I have come
to like Nancy very much"

237
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:01,736
"and wanted to express my friendship
and love for her"

238
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,367
"by having her come stay with me."

239
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,644
"I also must admit"

240
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:10,181
"that I feel very
affectionate towards Nancy,"

241
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,581
"as I am sure I have
displayed many times,"

242
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:15,245
"even in your presence."

243
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:17,653
"Now comes the difficult part."

244
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:24,755
"Did I touch Nancy in areas
which I shouldn't have?"

245
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,893
"I have to admit that I did
on a few occasions."

246
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,961
"I guess I became overly affectionate,"

247
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,302
"and took advantage of the situation"

248
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:38,070
"and went a little too far."

249
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:42,637
"I have already written
for an appointment with my bishop."

250
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:47,118
"I realize the big responsibility
I have as a priest,"

251
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:51,418
"and the high ideals
which I must uphold."

252
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,859
"But I am also painfully aware
of my own weakness,"

253
00:13:55,928 --> 00:14:00,160
"and how hard it is at times"

254
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:03,429
"to keep the ideals of priesthood"

255
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:05,333
"in front of me.."

256
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:17,673
"when temptations
to satisfy one's own ego

257
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,014
present themselves."

258
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,557
He said, "You need to know"

259
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,459
I've already called Bishop Guilfoyle,"

260
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,760
who was the bishop at the time,

261
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,130
and..

262
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,328
"As soon as our talk is finished here,

263
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:39,769
you're getting right in the car."

264
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,965
I mean, my mother says

265
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,566
that when she was having
the meeting with Guilfoyle,

266
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,440
he was completely saying,

267
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,174
"Oh, I'm sure Nancy just
misunderstood his actions.

268
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:50,476
"I'm sure she..

269
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,744
what she says happened
really didn't happen."

270
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:56,185
Even though Oliver had
already made an appointment,

271
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,157
Guilfoyle had already talked
to Case DeGroot about it.

272
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,193
My mom's having this meeting,

273
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,695
and he's saying, "Oh, I'm sure
nothing really happened,"

274
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:05,787
blah, blah, blah.

275
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,890
My mom pulls out this letter,
and she said his face went beet-red.

276
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:10,731
He was furious because of the letter.

277
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:13,363
Why was he angry about that?

278
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,033
For legal reasons, I'm sure.

279
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:18,702
Of the, you know..
I think he was anxious

280
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:22,736
that the letter be destroyed

281
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,409
or in some way..

282
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,813
disappear.

283
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:32,147
Case wanted to make sure

284
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:37,753
that Ollie was going to be
getting counseling for this,

285
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,357
but when he inquired,

286
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,891
the bishop felt that..

287
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,461
he had done his part,
he had brought him down,

288
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:52,238
and, in essence,
his part was over,

289
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:55,769
and he should not continue
to be a part of this.

290
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:35,911
I remember saying
one time to Case..

291
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:37,512
we were driving somewhere,

292
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,083
and Ollie's name came up
for one or another reason:

293
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,595
what he does on his day off, you know,

294
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:46,961
and..

295
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,000
when I said, "Well, you know",

296
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:53,402
he sleeps over at Maria's house,"

297
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:58,808
and I could see
he got so, like, nervous,

298
00:16:58,877 --> 00:17:01,710
but he didn't say anything to me.

299
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:07,079
The reasons we asked him
to stay overnight sometimes

300
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,916
is because the church can be hectic,

301
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,082
and, like, a priest
can be on 24-hour duty

302
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,356
because parishioners
may need help,

303
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,626
and it was kind of like a relief
to get away from work.

304
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,658
The duties that a priest
has to perform

305
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:27,001
shouldn't take up all his time.

306
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:29,700
And I do remember
one time, I think..

307
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:32,676
And that was his answer
to non-married priests.

308
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:34,736
- In other religions they're married.
- Yeah.

309
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:37,782
It would be so much
easier to help people

310
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,112
in the Catholic religion..

311
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,776
'Cause you know
what a family's like.

312
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,718
If they had a family of their own,

313
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,881
and he used to say
he couldn't do that.

314
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,117
He couldn't do both.

315
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,887
Yeah, 'cause of the work
with the church

316
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,258
that, you know,

317
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,821
what he says is dedication
to the Church, you know.

318
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,493
You have to have celibacy
because you can't give..

319
00:17:56,568 --> 00:18:00,334
But I says, "How do you know
how a family functions?"

320
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:04,774
And he would say,
"Well, by education, school."

321
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:07,175
You know, looking back
at it now in reflection,

322
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:11,649
it's more like a power trip
that he would have us robe him,

323
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,844
like he was a deity, you know?

324
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,547
Like he was the king
or something, you know?

325
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:20,786
He would call us
out of class, you know.

326
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,260
He had total control of us

327
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,693
'cause he was at our school,

328
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:28,392
he was at our home,
he was at church.

329
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:32,767
In a Catholic lifestyle,
what else is left after that?

330
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:35,500
What part of my life wasn't he at?

331
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,836
I.. Absolutely, you know.

332
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,638
I mean, there's an awful lot of my areas

333
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,907
that I was ill-equipped
to handle, you know.

334
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,345
Counseling would be one of them.

335
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,713
If I were back in,
I'd never counsel people,

336
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,843
unless I took training
in it, you know.

337
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,016
Because apparently I wasn't
able to spot the differences,

338
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,888
spot the elements that..

339
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,652
There were danger signals

340
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:01,062
That a therapist, you know,
would know to say,

341
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,601
"Oh, there's transference here,"
you know.

342
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:06,229
This person is not alone,
coming to me once a week.

343
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:09,274
This person is calling me
on the phone twice a day.

344
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,775
This person is calling me on the phone

345
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:14,745
about things that are
insignificant right now.

346
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,678
"My God, what do I have
for dinner?"

347
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,943
Whatever you like.
Why are you calling me?

348
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:22,714
You've had dinner before.
You'll have dinner again.

349
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,983
But, you know,
what was there about me

350
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,288
that kind of said
"You can call me,"

351
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,489
you know?

352
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:33,588
This was somebody
that we knew for 23 years,

353
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:35,895
totally trusted.

354
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,060
We trusted him because..

355
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,000
And now, you know,
I hear, you know,

356
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,039
things he did with other families,

357
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:44,507
and..

358
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:46,567
I just feel..

359
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,580
I never saw that side of him.

360
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,172
You know, we were supporting him

361
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,445
up to the very, very end,

362
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:57,579
'cause he was..
he was the perfect..

363
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,591
example of what you would think
a priest would be

364
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,786
when he was here in our house.

365
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,625
I mean, he was always respectful.

366
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:08,962
He was.. Anything that I saw
with him with the kids,

367
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,296
he was fine.

368
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:11,597
He would stay here.

369
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,001
I mean, you'd see him
in here in the morning

370
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,369
reading his Bible.

371
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,702
He was everything that I..

372
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,037
I'd go to work and..

373
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,442
He was the closest
thing to God that we knew.

374
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:28,481
Being Catholic is..

375
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:32,114
not like being a Lutheran
or a Presbyterian.

376
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,455
The thing that,
for a lot of non-Catholics

377
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,154
is hard to understand is,

378
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:39,754
the Church teaches
that the only way to salvation,

379
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,765
if you're Catholic,
is through the Church,

380
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,926
and if you're not
in communion with the Church,

381
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,333
you're damned to hell.

382
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,736
And it's not just kind of
like without-God hell.

383
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:50,775
It's fire and brimstone hell for eternity.

384
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:54,243
Well, the Eucharist,
as we call it in Catholic theology,

385
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:57,043
the Holy Communion is the sharing
of the bread and wine

386
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,481
that for some is the body
and blood of Christ,

387
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,644
for others represents
the body and blood of Christ.

388
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,813
No matter what you call..
what words you use,

389
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,356
it's essential to Catholicism.

390
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:08,359
The power of the Eucharist

391
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,895
is what the Church
has held over people,

392
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:13,898
that "I, as an ordained person
with an indelible mark",

393
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:15,627
"can make Holy Communion

394
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,465
"is what separates you from me,

395
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:19,731
"what separates me

396
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,466
from the average person
going down the street."

397
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,633
And if you think of, you know,

398
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,507
the earliest church communities,

399
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,045
it wasn't controlled by the clergy.

400
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:29,307
It was breaking of bread

401
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,246
and passed around to believing people

402
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,614
as a symbol of Christ's presence..

403
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,312
spiritual presence among us.

404
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,486
But then it has become
controlled in many ways,

405
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:39,888
and politicized.

406
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,552
So, for instance,
if you're married and divorced

407
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,595
and remarried but not by a priest,

408
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:45,789
you can't go to Communion.

409
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:49,391
If you're gay and you're not
absolutely chaste and celibate,

410
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,696
you can't go to Communion.

411
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,967
If you vote for somebody
who approves of abortion,

412
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,905
you can't go to Communion,
according to some.

413
00:21:56,975 --> 00:22:01,139
So it's become a kind
of a politicized reward

414
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:02,578
for thinking the right way,

415
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,512
when, in effect,
it's none of the above.

416
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,849
I can't think of anything more evil
than a priest using his office,

417
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,388
what the Catholics
would call alter Christus,

418
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,050
when the priest raises
that host at Mass

419
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:16,094
and consecrates that host,

420
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,561
the priest becomes one with Christ.

421
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,154
The Catholics believe,

422
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,789
and we're all taught as little kids,

423
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,663
that it's truly Jesus Christ.

424
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:24,326
To take that hand,

425
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:27,099
within moments before or after that,

426
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:30,505
and place them on a child's genitals
and abuse him..

427
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:35,274
And I think that was part
of the terrible destruction to the child

428
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:38,145
that in addition to all the other..

429
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,241
consequences..
long-term consequences

430
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,343
of being sexually abused,

431
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,981
the spiritual abuse..

432
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:49,118
of being abused by embodiment

433
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:51,355
of the divine, if you will,

434
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,864
was just devastating.

435
00:22:56,234 --> 00:23:01,297
I asked for a meeting
with Oliver O'Grady in '86,

436
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:05,104
and they told me, you know,
"Vengeance is wrong.

437
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,940
"He's a virtue of priesthood now.

438
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,209
"He's in counseling.
Check your motives.

439
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:12,876
"God will delve out punishments.

440
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,213
You don't need to."

441
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:18,017
When Nancy Sloan came
to you in the '80s,

442
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,921
she was distressed, correct?

443
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,754
1986, was it?

444
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:24,387
Was she distressed?

445
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,795
No, she wasn't.

446
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,861
Was she just doing just fine?

447
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:33,598
She.. The first time I saw her

448
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,469
was that day.

449
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,101
I hadn't known anything about her.

450
00:23:40,745 --> 00:23:43,612
She seemed very composed.

451
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,047
He just went on and on,

452
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:47,347
lashing out all this guilt on me,

453
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:48,784
when I told him, you know,

454
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:51,118
I just want him
to understand the depth

455
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,589
of the pain that I suffer
on a regular basis,

456
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:57,822
that how, when I see a Dodge Duster,

457
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,592
which was the car
that he drove at the time,

458
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,963
how I still pull over and dry heave.

459
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:04,296
What did she want?

460
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:06,701
She wanted to know

461
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:09,331
whether Father O'Grady

462
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:13,241
was continuing in therapy.

463
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:15,474
What did you tell her?

464
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:18,607
I told that I would..
I thought he was,

465
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,913
but I would check
on it for sure.

466
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,783
- Was he?
- Yes.

467
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:26,551
I told him, "You knew
that I was being abused."

468
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,093
"You knew that the abuse
was happening.

469
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,856
How could you not
have done something?"

470
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,365
So Bishop Montrose knew
O'Grady was an abuser?

471
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,900
He knew that O'Grady
had been accused

472
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:41,234
of inappropriate touching in '76.

473
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:45,970
Just like every other bishop after '76.

474
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,613
- Right?
- Yes.

475
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:56,950
And he said..

476
00:24:57,022 --> 00:24:59,513
"We knew that you were being abused,"

477
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:01,115
"but you were a girl,"

478
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,160
"so we thought it was normal curiosity.

479
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,822
"Had you been a boy,

480
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,991
"we would have thought
something was wrong with it.

481
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,830
"That would have been obscene

482
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:16,397
for him to have abused a boy,
like homosexual."

483
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,076
The situation is, I'm alone with the boy.

484
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:26,083
There wasn't anybody else
in the rectory at the time.

485
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,709
I brought him in.

486
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:29,845
I had been affectionate
with him before,

487
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:31,411
so being affectionate again with him

488
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:35,949
wasn't that difficult
a thing to do, which I was.

489
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,086
And I remember..

490
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,256
just holding him and hugging him

491
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,766
and probably saying
some nice things to him,

492
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:46,133
and he was responding
as well, you know.

493
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:49,799
And the thought that had gone
through my mind, actually,

494
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:52,468
was to..

495
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:54,637
take off all his clothes

496
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:58,274
and to molest him that way.

497
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,810
And I think I may have
taken off his T-shirt,

498
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:07,586
and then I was going
to unbuckle his pants,

499
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:08,887
and there was a feeling..

500
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,019
I didn't know if I wanted to go..

501
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,961
There was a conflict
in my mind about,

502
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,931
"Do I really want to do this?

503
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,730
"Here's somebody that I like.

504
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:21,636
"Here's somebody that I respect,

505
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,469
"a family I respect.

506
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,637
What would he feel like
at the end of this?"

507
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,236
Yet, at the other side,

508
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:34,342
there was urges within me
to be sexual with him,

509
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,979
and this is an opportunity
to be sexual with him,

510
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,047
because I wouldn't have
this opportunity again

511
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,719
God knows when.

512
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:48,130
And so I decided not to be
affectionate with him,

513
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,568
and yet later, I brought him
back into my bedroom again,

514
00:26:52,637 --> 00:26:57,700
and I did unbutton his pants,

515
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:59,038
take out his penis,

516
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,874
and I began to masturbate him
at that time.

517
00:27:01,946 --> 00:27:03,174
And..

518
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,484
I think what I.. In doing that,

519
00:27:08,553 --> 00:27:10,111
I'm not too sure what
he was feeling with all..

520
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:12,315
I think, looking at his face

521
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,257
kind of told me that he was..

522
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:18,228
a little uneasy about this.

523
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:22,323
I thought at one point
he was going to cry, you know.

524
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,561
One of the few times
it had ever happened to me,

525
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:26,831
I had an orgasm myself..

526
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,674
without him touching me,

527
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,438
and I think that ended it
right there and then.

528
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,273
So I just tidied him up, and..

529
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,751
perhaps I took care of myself, too,
in the bathroom alone,

530
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,812
but I tidied him up
and put on his T-shirt,

531
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:47,756
and then I made a decision
right there and then.

532
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:50,454
I was not going to do
that again to this boy.

533
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:03,638
There's Ireland.

534
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:05,841
Yeah.

535
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,002
He went with us.

536
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,170
Yeah.

537
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,838
There he is
with Grandma and Grandpa.

538
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,848
- That's right. That's you.
- Yep.

539
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,885
- You're standing there.
- Behind the car.

540
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:16,011
Yeah.

541
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,747
- That's your Communion picture.
- Yep.

542
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,315
With Mahony.

543
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:33,137
I'm angry at Mahony

544
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:39,109
for claiming that he had absolutely
no knowledge of this pedophile

545
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:42,169
who had a file, a sub-secret file,

546
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:46,843
that had pieces of evidence,
that had, you know,

547
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:50,354
a father who had..

548
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,322
the Howard father
who had come forward

549
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,415
with his concerns
about the amount of time

550
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:58,292
that his children were alone
on Oliver O'Grady's days off.

551
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:43,935
'76 to '84,

552
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:48,945
that's, I think, when a lot of the
Howards' situation took place,

553
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:52,380
and, you know,
if I was involved with them,

554
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,418
I was a danger to them,

555
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:55,976
but I would have been a danger
to others as well.

556
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:59,751
Were you concerned
about Father O'Grady's conduct

557
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:03,453
with regard to the Howard
family in 1980?

558
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:06,959
I called him in and told him

559
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,226
that he was to cease and desist

560
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,962
any more conduct.. contact

561
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,527
with Mrs. Howard or the Howard family.

562
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,540
He promised to do so,

563
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,906
and I never had another report

564
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,842
about him and the Howards.

565
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:25,849
I visited with the bishop,
and we had a conference,

566
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,784
and I had mentioned that perhaps
I should need some counseling

567
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,720
to get an understanding of this,

568
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,725
and the bishop kind of at that time
said, "Okay, go ahead and do that."

569
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:40,025
You know, I'd say, "Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned. I.."

570
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:42,191
Sometimes it's good
to give them a time limit

571
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,859
as to when your last
confession was,

572
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,335
and say, "Well, I'd been with
some friends of mine yesterday",

573
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,929
"and some of them
are young children,

574
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:51,442
"and I had the opportunity
to be alone with one of them,

575
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:56,708
"and I did some things
such as to touch his private parts,

576
00:30:56,781 --> 00:31:00,444
"and took occasion
to do that a few times

577
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,509
"when he was alone with me,

578
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:03,781
"and..

579
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,687
"I want to confess that right now,

580
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:08,988
ask forgiveness and absolution."

581
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,824
If it had come to your attention

582
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:17,994
that Father O'Grady told
your vicar-general

583
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,300
that he had sexual urges
towards a 9-year-old

584
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:23,704
or 10-year-old or an 11-year old,

585
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:26,972
is that cause to remove
him from ministry?

586
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,980
No.

587
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,879
And the Church just moved him

588
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,181
to another place where they have kids.

589
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:37,517
Why didn't they just take him out?

590
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:40,717
Why didn't they admit it?

591
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:44,421
There was no action taken

592
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:48,226
that would remove him from children,

593
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,100
and so when you transfer him
from one place to another,

594
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:54,365
it's..

595
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,207
just a tragedy waiting to happen.

596
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,949
Like again, the '84 situation,
what brought it up

597
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:41,485
was, you know, I'm not
feeling right inside.

598
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:42,673
There's something not right.

599
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,585
I need to take care of this.

600
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,783
When I had mentioned it
to my counselor,

601
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:48,689
this time a professional counselor..

602
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,728
he was a layman..

603
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,389
He was very helpful, you know?

604
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:57,833
And he about pulled
the whole tablecloth

605
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:59,631
out from under me, you know?

606
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:02,172
And all of a sudden,

607
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
I saw this massive..

608
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:05,801
problem, you know,

609
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:08,675
that I had,

610
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:12,546
these tendencies that I had,

611
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,608
and this vale of destruction

612
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:17,348
that I had created
as a result of that.

613
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:19,822
And that was very frightening,

614
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:23,383
very difficult to comprehend,

615
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,486
and even to want to comprehend

616
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:27,292
at that particular time

617
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:29,925
that that was going on.

618
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:33,402
But that's what he did
when he confronted me,

619
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:38,135
and said, "I need to report this,"

620
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,076
and he meant report it
to the authorities..

621
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,942
police department..

622
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,606
and that really scared me, you know?

623
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:45,876
That really woke me up.

624
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,863
My counselor suggested

625
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:05,960
that I now talk
to the bishop's office.

626
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,561
Well, I'm aware right now

627
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:10,801
that a personnel file
is kept on each person,

628
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,638
so I would tend to think that,

629
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,678
knowing Mahony as he is,

630
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,611
that he would have
gone through all those

631
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,581
and would have seen any references

632
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:20,549
that would have been in the file

633
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:24,349
regarding the 1973
and 1976 issues,

634
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:26,014
and that, I think,
should have told him

635
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,389
that there was, you know,
not just a one-shot deal,

636
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,623
but there was at least
two prior situations

637
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,324
that needed to be dealt with.

638
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:36,593
I should have been removed..

639
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:40,497
and attended to,

640
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:43,267
and he should also,
then, have followed up

641
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:46,777
by attending to the people
that I harmed.

642
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:49,072
I'd like if he had done that.

643
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:51,809
I'd like if all of the
bishops had done that.

644
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:55,278
Now, I didn't talk
to Mahony right away.

645
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:59,756
I think I talked to the other monsignor
that was there, Monsignor Cain.

646
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:03,953
Did you think it was important in 1984

647
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:07,590
that the Stockton Police Department

648
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:13,433
be advised not only of the information

649
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:14,971
concerning young Mr. Howard,

650
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,563
but also that there had been

651
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:21,101
a prior allegation
by Nancy Sloan's family

652
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,342
of inappropriate touching?

653
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:25,404
No.

654
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:27,474
Well, how would they uncover

655
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,452
what happened to Nancy Sloan,

656
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,250
unless someone from
the diocese told them?

657
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:33,517
They wouldn't,

658
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,082
and at the time,

659
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,151
the two just were not related.

660
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:40,959
They just didn't coordinate.

661
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:43,398
What do you mean when you say
they weren't related,

662
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:44,729
they didn't coordinate?

663
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:46,929
Well, at the time of..

664
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,900
that he came in in '84

665
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:52,534
to talk about this incident,

666
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,601
certainly..

667
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,913
I knew the one in '76 took place,

668
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:01,144
but I didn't put the two together.

669
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:02,982
One was a girl.

670
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:05,147
It was inappropriate touching.

671
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:07,919
The other was a boy, he said,

672
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:11,689
so I just didn't hook them up
in my own mind.

673
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:13,525
Monsignor Cain then suggested

674
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:15,395
I talk to the diocesan attorney.

675
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,127
Oh, it was very difficult, yeah,

676
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,897
because I was, you know, kind of..

677
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,132
you know that kind
of unknowing thing?

678
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,908
I could be arrested.

679
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,568
Where could I end up, you know?

680
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,874
This could be..

681
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,174
What will my family think?

682
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:32,113
What will anybody think

683
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:33,878
when this happens, you know?

684
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,749
Mahony did call me.
He was out of town with some meeting.

685
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,118
I can't remember where.

686
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:40,749
But when he did get back,
he did talk to me.

687
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:41,951
I remember saying to him,

688
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:43,152
I said, "You know, Bishop",

689
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:45,821
this whole thing
has been going on for the past"..

690
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:48,991
and I'd been keeping
a record of the days..

691
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,533
"40 days."

692
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,831
It was, like, actually 40 days.

693
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:54,269
I said, "It's"..

694
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,535
I said, "It's been a real
desert experience for me,"

695
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,940
using an analogy from the Scripture

696
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,913
and, you know, the whole
"40 years in the desert" type of thing.

697
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,013
I said, "It's been a real Lenten
experience for me, I guess,"

698
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:09,882
I said, "even outside of Lent."

699
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:12,514
And he was very supportive, you know.

700
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,989
He was very compassionate.

701
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:15,286
I felt at the time..

702
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,519
I think he was merely calling

703
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,360
to check how I was doing,

704
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,795
because he obviously knew

705
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,958
I had been very stressed out
over the situation,

706
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,626
and I told him that, you know.

707
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:29,571
And he got back to me.
He said, "This is where we are:"

708
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,007
"No charge is being filed,
but we are moving you on,

709
00:37:33,077 --> 00:37:36,740
and here's a couple of other parts
to the package deal."

710
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,612
The bishop, the attorneys,
and the police department

711
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:41,549
decided that maybe it was best

712
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:45,385
to move me on to another situation
out of the particular county

713
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:47,788
in which these charges will be filed,

714
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:50,258
and then to..

715
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:52,853
they'll let me take care
of the business there.

716
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:58,197
And Mahony's people
promised the police

717
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:01,033
that he would never
have another parish,

718
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:03,130
that he wouldn't be around kids,

719
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:04,640
and they'd take care of it.

720
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:10,079
In the Vatican Ecclesiastical system,

721
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:12,206
there's this term that's used.

722
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:13,648
<i>It's called bella figura.</i>

723
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:14,878
It's an Italian word

724
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:18,388
which means good impression,
good image.

725
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:22,790
One of the aspects,
one of the factors

726
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,260
in a man being successful
in the Church

727
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:27,263
is that he create a good image,

728
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:29,993
and that's what Roger was
very much concerned about,

729
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,830
that there be this image

730
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:35,360
of a very upright, loyal,
orthodox bishop,

731
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,839
soon to become archbishop hopefully,

732
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:40,240
because he would be the only
choice for the pope

733
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:41,903
to be the archbishop of Los Angeles.

734
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,573
And the thing he had to do, then,

735
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:48,982
was to take O'Grady, to avoid scandal,

736
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:53,456
and any scrutiny on him in particular,

737
00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:57,221
was to move him
to an outlying parish

738
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:01,560
far away from where the police
would have jurisdiction,

739
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,964
which was in Stockton at the time,

740
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:06,026
and move him out to San Andreas..

741
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:07,866
St. Andrew's in San Andreas..

742
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:10,065
way out there in the hinterland,

743
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,267
and put him out there

744
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:13,867
in a very quiet little bucolic setting,

745
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:17,209
where there was no other supervisor,
just O'Grady,

746
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:18,805
and nobody would know,

747
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:20,851
and the police wouldn't know,

748
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,510
the public wouldn't know,

749
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:25,453
the parishioners and the victims
over there wouldn't know,

750
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:26,922
and Rome wouldn't know.

751
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,425
I'd taken the depositions

752
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:32,929
of cardinals, archbishops,
and bishops across this country

753
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,965
for 23 years,

754
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:38,900
and what I've encountered is deception,

755
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:41,563
perjury, denial, and deceit

756
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:44,107
at the highest levels
of the Catholic Church.

757
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:47,144
Somebody has represented
to the police,

758
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:49,975
in the middle
of their active investigation,

759
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:53,210
that they are going to transfer O'Grady
out of the parish..

760
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:57,421
That he will be working
only with adults

761
00:39:57,488 --> 00:39:58,785
and away from children,

762
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,154
and Monsignor Cain has denied

763
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:03,693
that he was possessed
of that knowledge.

764
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:04,921
Under oath.

765
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:09,022
You were the captain of the ship,

766
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,226
the bishop of the diocese,

767
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,928
the ordinary in charge.

768
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:15,938
Who else, if you weren't
possessed of this knowledge

769
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:19,772
and Monsignor Cain wasn't
possessed of this knowledge,

770
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:21,778
do you think could have been,

771
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:24,076
knowing the way the diocese works

772
00:40:24,148 --> 00:40:27,948
or at least worked in 1984?

773
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,486
I just have no idea of knowing.

774
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,680
I don't know.

775
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:37,751
I know that Monsignor Cain
knew that last sentence existed,

776
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:39,955
he certainly would have said something.

777
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,555
He would not have just let us go ahead

778
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:44,464
and move him to San Andreas.

779
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:45,797
I know that.

780
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,360
So I don't know who..

781
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:50,202
When they say
"This unit was advised,"

782
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:53,868
I don't know who they're referring to.

783
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:55,343
I have no idea.

784
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:19,966
To quote the cardinal's
appointment letter, he put him in

785
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:23,404
"full care of the souls
of that parish in California."

786
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:25,374
This.. it would have been the first time

787
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,842
that I had the total responsibility
for a parish.

788
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:30,073
Up to that time,
I was an associate.

789
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:34,311
It was again working out
in a nice, nice way for him

790
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:39,015
that another situation
had been smoothly handled.

791
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:44,049
Do you remember receiving this letter
from Father O'Grady?

792
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,358
I don't remember it, but I recall..

793
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,297
You know, you showed it to me.
I presume I received it.

794
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:50,958
Okay. Next sentence states,

795
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:54,903
"I would like to write to you
as one of the first persons

796
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,873
to whom I owe a great deal of gratitude."

797
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,199
Period.

798
00:42:00,277 --> 00:42:02,370
"I sincerely thank you

799
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:04,346
"for all that you have done for me

800
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,883
in the past few months."

801
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,087
What did you think
he was referring to there

802
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,885
when he made that statement?

803
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:19,326
Nothing in particular. I thought
this was a overly effusive letter.

804
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:21,387
I didn't really have
that much relations..

805
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:22,898
personal relationship with him.

806
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:25,902
He was not a priest
that I would golf with

807
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,665
or have dinner with
or anything else,

808
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:30,104
so he was, I think,

809
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,938
quite flowery and effusive, basically.

810
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,443
I honestly don't know.

811
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:35,876
As I say, when I first..

812
00:42:35,946 --> 00:42:37,174
when I saw this again,

813
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,216
and I suspect the time when I got it,

814
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:42,980
it's just an overly effusive letter

815
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,145
that..

816
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:47,623
Next paragraph states, quote,

817
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,182
"I am particularly grateful to you

818
00:42:50,261 --> 00:42:54,129
for your sensitivity to me
and my needs at this time."

819
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:56,962
What did you think
he referred to there?

820
00:42:58,068 --> 00:42:59,763
I don't remember.

821
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:01,429
Really, as I say,

822
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:05,532
I just found the whole letter
terribly overstated,

823
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:07,406
and I imagine at the time

824
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:11,209
I read it cursorily
and filed it after..

825
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:12,442
It probably would have then..

826
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:14,075
I didn't answer it for some time.

827
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:16,517
I didn't feel it was..

828
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:18,987
it was important or..

829
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:20,751
I have no idea.

830
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:23,987
At this point, looking back
at this 12 years ago,

831
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,655
I can't remember what I thought
when I read this letter.

832
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,823
When I read this,
I was just very puzzled.

833
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,163
I couldn't imagine
what he was referring to.

834
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,532
I just didn't..

835
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:35,071
I personally didn't pay
that much attention to it.

836
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:38,370
You'll notice I didn't answer it
till almost three weeks later.

837
00:43:59,697 --> 00:44:02,860
What Cardinal Mahony did is,
he picked his own career,

838
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:08,735
and he picked power and glory
over the children.

839
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:10,398
It's like the scene in the Gospel

840
00:44:10,474 --> 00:44:12,874
where it says that Satan took Christ

841
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,207
to the top of a mountain,

842
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,372
and showed Him
all the cities of the world

843
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:19,040
and all the glory over the world,

844
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:20,140
and said, "This all can be yours"

845
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:22,651
if you'll just sit and bow down
and worship me."

846
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,483
I think that's what Cardinal Mahony did.

847
00:44:24,555 --> 00:44:28,514
It was the only thing he could do
to keep his status,

848
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:32,688
and ultimately be exalted
to cardinal as he was,

849
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:36,092
not two years later.

850
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,240
To be married in the Church,
the Catholic Church,

851
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,047
you go through a series of classes

852
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,816
with the priest that you're dealing with.

853
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:02,017
In our case, it was Oliver O'Grady.

854
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:04,017
Those classes,

855
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:05,493
from what I've heard now,

856
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:08,827
run between six and seven weeks,

857
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:11,732
or six or seven sessions.

858
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:14,828
My wife and I went in for our classes.

859
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:18,170
We met with the..
with O'Grady one time.

860
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:20,904
He found out that I was
in law enforcement,

861
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:23,469
and determined
that we did not need

862
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:26,414
any more further marital training,

863
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:28,474
and signed us off,

864
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:30,918
and we were able to get married
in the Catholic Church

865
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:35,015
with Oliver O'Grady presiding
at our wedding.

866
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,720
And he was the priest

867
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:41,424
for one of the churches
that encompassed half the county,

868
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:46,868
so he played a major role
in a lot of people's lives,

869
00:45:46,937 --> 00:45:49,462
a lot of families
in Calaveras County.

870
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,601
He's admitted that he spent
as much time grooming victims

871
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:55,338
as he did being a priest,

872
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:57,937
and he was a priest for over 30 years,

873
00:45:58,015 --> 00:46:03,647
spending every waking hour
planning abuse, executing abuse,

874
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,347
thinking about abuse.

875
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:09,483
So 365 days a year times 30.

876
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,084
He has so many victims,

877
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,924
I don't think he can keep track,

878
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:15,123
and I think it's in the hundreds.

879
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:21,331
How young are the molested kids?

880
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:23,532
One's what, three months, nine months?

881
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:25,575
That was his youngest victim.

882
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:26,574
Right.

883
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:27,575
You know, nine months.

884
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:29,077
Nine months.

885
00:46:29,146 --> 00:46:30,909
To abuse an infant,

886
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:32,107
I mean, you really..

887
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:34,047
Part of what people have to do

888
00:46:34,117 --> 00:46:35,277
when they're talking about this..

889
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:36,444
and it's so hard,

890
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,112
and no one wants to do it..

891
00:46:38,188 --> 00:46:40,748
is to really try to walk through

892
00:46:40,824 --> 00:46:45,591
and picture a grown man

893
00:46:45,662 --> 00:46:51,658
inserting.. forcing his penis
into the vagina of a baby.

894
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,396
Oliver, have you ever been diagnosed

895
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,132
with a disassociative disorder?

896
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:58,504
I'm sure I fit the category

897
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:00,008
of a lot of disorders.

898
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:02,011
Whatever they are,

899
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,569
you name that, I'll jump.

900
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,239
I'm not trying to be flippant here.

901
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:07,112
And I am. I'm sorry.

902
00:47:07,184 --> 00:47:09,277
That's okay, but what
I'm trying to say is,

903
00:47:09,353 --> 00:47:11,184
has anybody ever told you

904
00:47:11,255 --> 00:47:14,452
you may disassociate from events?

905
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:16,083
I'm sure they have.

906
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,251
Okay.

907
00:47:17,327 --> 00:47:18,624
Is it..

908
00:47:18,695 --> 00:47:21,687
I mean, to me, as a lay person,

909
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:23,756
when you molest somebody,

910
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:25,199
it's sort of black and white:

911
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:26,634
either you do or you don't.

912
00:47:26,703 --> 00:47:28,694
What I get from you, Oliver, is,

913
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,205
in some instances,

914
00:47:30,274 --> 00:47:31,866
you're not sure
if you molested people.

915
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:33,136
Correct.

916
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,610
Do you think that's
because it didn't happen,

917
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,510
or do you think that's because,

918
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:40,049
either to deal with the trauma yourself,

919
00:47:40,117 --> 00:47:42,642
or to justify it or deal with guilt,

920
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,051
whatever the malady you had was,

921
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:46,953
do you maybe be disassociating

922
00:47:47,024 --> 00:47:49,151
from the reality
of what actually occurred?

923
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:52,093
- I think that would be accurate, yes.
- Okay.

924
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,221
He's a very dangerous man,

925
00:47:54,298 --> 00:48:00,066
and an aggressive, assaultive person,

926
00:48:00,137 --> 00:48:02,901
who apparently would do anything

927
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:04,304
to get to his victims,

928
00:48:04,374 --> 00:48:07,138
including having sex
with their parents.

929
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:28,355
When I was little,
I was always talking to everybody.

930
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,000
And I feel like I had a lot of..

931
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,301
more hope in me than doubt.

932
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,435
I'm sure you could ask
all my teachers, and they'd go,

933
00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:45,345
"Yeah. Smart guy.
I don't know what happened to him."

934
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:55,048
O'Grady saw an easy mark in us

935
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,490
because we're brought up..

936
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,425
I was brought up Catholic,

937
00:48:58,495 --> 00:49:03,023
so automatically you see
a guy with a collar on,

938
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,227
you automatically trust him.

939
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:07,395
So he moved right in,

940
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:12,135
and Becky fell
hook, line and sinker.

941
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,643
You know, he was the wolf,

942
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,235
and I was the gatekeeper,

943
00:49:16,313 --> 00:49:18,508
and I let the wolf through the gate.

944
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:21,915
That's what it's always
felt like to me, you know?

945
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:23,919
And to know that you could be..

946
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:26,751
that I could be so wrong.

947
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:31,287
I mean, how wrong
could I have been?

948
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:34,057
I mean, to be so horribly wrong..

949
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:38,400
was absolutely devastating.

950
00:49:40,003 --> 00:49:42,164
His whole thing,
he would get into the family

951
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,231
more than just
with the children, you know,

952
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:49,301
so my mom had been involved with him,

953
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,506
and I think that was the..

954
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:54,379
that was the killer one there, you know?

955
00:49:56,353 --> 00:49:57,786
And early on I..

956
00:49:57,854 --> 00:50:00,618
I realized early on
that there was something wrong,

957
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:05,856
but my upbringing told me,
nah, that can't happen.

958
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:10,025
I talk with a lot of, like,
female survivors,

959
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,830
and they talk about,
like, little games

960
00:50:12,903 --> 00:50:16,669
to sort of.. segue toward it,

961
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,537
but with.. it wasn't like that with me.

962
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:21,042
He just started in.

963
00:50:21,111 --> 00:50:22,373
He started right in:

964
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:26,610
grabbing me, touching me,
making me touch him..

965
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:30,210
telling me that.. why would
my folks have brought me here

966
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:32,346
if they didn't think it was okay?

967
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:35,357
Why would they
even have thought that?

968
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:37,450
Those are the things that he said.

969
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:49,268
I failed them once, and it was huge,

970
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:52,103
and I'll never do it again.

971
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:55,110
That will never happen again.

972
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,408
I will not ever..

973
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,745
I will never fail them again.

974
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:04,612
I was trimming those bushes,
right there,

975
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,952
those little bushes,

976
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,854
the first time it happened.

977
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:10,620
I went into the house to eat lunch,

978
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:16,462
and then he just came in
and closed the door,

979
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:20,629
and he just held me down,
held my head down,

980
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,969
and he fucking sodomized me
right in there.

981
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,302
Right there.

982
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,971
That's not easy to say, you know.

983
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:34,483
Fuck, for years I never even spoke of it,

984
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:38,317
and every time I'd get close to a girl,

985
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,221
or every time I'd..

986
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:43,486
feel like something
was done wrong to me,

987
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,994
I'd go right there.

988
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,496
It would just go in
the bin with it, you know?

989
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:51,500
That's the kind of..
That's what this shit does.

990
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:55,334
It doesn't just hurt you.

991
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:57,963
In July of 1993, we had a family

992
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,669
that contacted the Calaveras County
Sheriff's Department

993
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:06,182
to report that a priest
in San Andreas in Calaveras County

994
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,513
was molesting members of the family,

995
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:11,850
specifically two young boys
in the family.

996
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:15,358
So the next day he called me,

997
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,518
and he said he was having a problem

998
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,186
and he was away from the parish.

999
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:23,858
And I knew, just talking to him,
that there was something wrong.

1000
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,697
Then we told him
we would help him.

1001
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,602
I said, "If you didn't do
any of these things to children",

1002
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:30,367
"you have no problem.

1003
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,375
There's no way anybody
can accuse you of.."

1004
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:36,708
Even the word molestation
never even entered my mind.

1005
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,372
It was just touching.

1006
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:39,881
I said, "If you didn't touch these kids"

1007
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,545
"in an inappropriate way
or touched them sexually,

1008
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,053
"you don't have anything
to worry about.

1009
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:46,554
You don't have a record."

1010
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:50,184
Then he said,
Well, I had a problem nine years ago."

1011
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,727
When we started our investigation,

1012
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:56,391
we found out that this had not
been the first incident

1013
00:52:56,466 --> 00:52:58,900
that he had been involved in.

1014
00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:02,405
Going back as far as the mid-'70s

1015
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:07,307
he had been involved
with molesting children.

1016
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,346
It appeared that..

1017
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:17,580
to us that there was a lot
of knowledge about that

1018
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:19,417
outside of our community

1019
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:22,356
but none of that information
had reached us.

1020
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:25,258
At that point
we were supporting him.

1021
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:27,262
Yeah.

1022
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,426
Then he was concerned
about his family and stuff.

1023
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,264
So I talked to his family in Ireland,

1024
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:36,100
and told them
that we would support him

1025
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,868
and make sure he got represented
and everything like that.

1026
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:42,434
At that point we obtained
arrest warrants for Oliver O'Grady

1027
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:46,778
for multiple counts of lewd
and lascivious acts with minors.

1028
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:51,116
We served search warrants
at the parish here in San Andreas,

1029
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:55,123
the rectory here in San Andreas,

1030
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,455
the diocese in Stockton,

1031
00:53:57,527 --> 00:54:00,792
and in law offices..
Not law offices,

1032
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:04,459
but the offices of Cardinal Mahony
in Los Angeles.

1033
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:07,765
Then when he asked for the bail money,
Bob went and got it.

1034
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,805
I went to work Monday morning..

1035
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,306
And I did.

1036
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:15,970
And everybody at work
knew who he was.

1037
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:18,640
They knew he was my friend.

1038
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:19,647
The newspapers had..

1039
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:21,308
It was kind of quiet.

1040
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,147
I remember saying,
"What's the matter with you guys?

1041
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:26,655
How come you're all acting
this way this morning?"

1042
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:28,418
They said,
"Did you read the paper?"

1043
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:30,482
I said, "No, I haven't had time
to read the paper yet."

1044
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,050
Yeah.

1045
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:34,995
It was exploded all over the front page
of the newspaper.

1046
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:39,491
I said, "There's no way Ollie
would touch our kids."

1047
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,833
We didn't suspect.
We didn't see anything.

1048
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:43,167
Just no way.

1049
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,672
Then I called Bob at work

1050
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:48,177
and told him what I saw
in the paper and everything.

1051
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:51,338
I said.. And he said
the same thing to me.

1052
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,540
He said, "No way."

1053
00:54:52,615 --> 00:54:55,675
There's no way
he would touch our kids."

1054
00:54:55,752 --> 00:55:01,691
Then it was almost like
the fear of God got in me.

1055
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,692
I told.. He said,
"Well, we have to ask them."

1056
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,193
But then we went..

1057
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,525
I called her and I said,

1058
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:09,189
"Ann, did you see the paper?

1059
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:12,701
Did you read about
Father Ollie in the paper?"

1060
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:17,365
She said she didn't
watch the news or something.

1061
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,036
I said, "There's all these
allegations against him."

1062
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:26,048
The boys from..
It was the Howard kids at that time.

1063
00:55:26,116 --> 00:55:28,710
And..

1064
00:55:28,785 --> 00:55:30,719
I was.. When I said it to her

1065
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:34,223
I was expecting a response
like "Who's doing this?"

1066
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,056
And it was nothing.
It was just absolute silence.

1067
00:55:38,128 --> 00:55:39,720
Then I said to her.. I said,

1068
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:41,195
"Ann, I have to ask you."

1069
00:55:41,264 --> 00:55:43,892
I said, "Did he ever touch you
when you were a little girl?"

1070
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,060
And she.. "I got to go, Mom."

1071
00:55:46,136 --> 00:55:47,831
I got to take care of the dog."

1072
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:50,730
I just knew right then.

1073
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:53,742
I just felt it.

1074
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:54,850
She still wouldn't answer.

1075
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:56,812
I said, "Bob, you have to call her."

1076
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,407
I knew she wouldn't lie to Bob.

1077
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,575
So I asked her.

1078
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,084
She called him.

1079
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,917
You called her.

1080
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:10,585
I asked her if he had molested you.

1081
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,981
You said,
"Did he ever touch you?"

1082
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:14,589
Yeah.
"Did he ever touch.."

1083
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:17,599
And she said yes.

1084
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:21,763
And the whole world collapsed.

1085
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:22,964
I could hear him crying.

1086
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,132
I could hear Ann crying
on the other side..

1087
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:28,769
I gave her back the phone, and..

1088
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:33,339
She came over,
and Case DeGroot came over.

1089
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:37,944
At that point, it destroyed our lives.

1090
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:39,454
From that day on it just..

1091
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:40,955
Destroyed our family.

1092
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:42,048
Everything.

1093
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,958
Then it's like you have flashbacks.

1094
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,120
Why didn't I see this?

1095
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,458
Why didn't I see that?

1096
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,462
Right.

1097
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,465
It was like..

1098
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:51,625
It was terrible.

1099
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:54,169
I kind of handed Ann over to this bastard

1100
00:56:54,237 --> 00:56:56,671
on a silver platter, just about.

1101
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,632
How did he do it?

1102
00:56:58,708 --> 00:56:59,732
He just destroyed..

1103
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:01,970
How did we get fooled
by him so much?

1104
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,070
I used to go to work
and he'd be here

1105
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:07,981
saying his morning prayers.

1106
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,484
Had the Bible in his hand,

1107
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,985
and he's saying morning prayers.

1108
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:13,488
I said, "Good morning, Ollie."

1109
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,491
Then he'd be in there
at nighttime molesting Ann.

1110
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,154
And during the night
he's molesting my daughter.

1111
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,162
Raping her!

1112
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:24,166
Not molesting her!
Raping her!

1113
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:26,498
At five years old!

1114
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,333
God's sakes!

1115
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,464
How could that happen?

1116
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:35,237
But that's what he did.

1117
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,514
It's futile to ask the question,
"How can this be?

1118
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,181
Why does this happen?"

1119
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:50,351
The system, the monarchical,

1120
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:53,361
hierarchical governmental system

1121
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,193
that the people in charge
of the Roman Catholic Church

1122
00:57:56,266 --> 00:58:02,034
from the Pope on down firmly believe
was willed by almighty God

1123
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:06,872
is the reason why Roger Mahony
is believed to be

1124
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:10,037
substantially more important and better

1125
00:58:10,113 --> 00:58:14,516
than the children who were ravished
by Oliver O'Grady.

1126
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:18,213
My father won't walk me down the aisle

1127
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,882
because he can't step in the church.

1128
00:58:20,957 --> 00:58:23,221
He's taken my wedding
away from me,

1129
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:24,885
everything in the future.

1130
00:58:24,961 --> 00:58:30,228
I constantly am battling
to regain my life back.

1131
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,892
Constantly.

1132
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:34,903
I have never conceived a child.

1133
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,905
I'm not married.

1134
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:40,238
I'm 40 years old, almost.

1135
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,572
I'm 39.

1136
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:43,771
I'm approaching 40 and..

1137
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:47,280
it's still not over.

1138
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,250
When did it stop?
When she was 13?

1139
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:51,253
- 12.
- 12, okay.

1140
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:56,816
And I asked her,
"Why didn't you tell us earlier? Why?"

1141
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:02,590
And her answer was to me

1142
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:08,103
that I used to say that anybody
who tried to hurt you,

1143
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:10,935
I would kill him!

1144
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,338
And..

1145
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:16,034
I shouldn't have made that statement.

1146
00:59:16,112 --> 00:59:17,101
She told me that..

1147
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,944
She wouldn't say anything!

1148
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:21,950
She asked a little girl
what would happen

1149
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:24,452
if your Dad killed somebody,

1150
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,681
and they said that he would go
to jail forever and ever

1151
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,623
and never come out.

1152
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:32,457
She said that day I decided
I could never tell anybody

1153
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:35,588
because she said,
"I knew Dad would kill him."

1154
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:40,466
It guess her love for me
kept her from telling me.

1155
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:44,472
And my love for her..

1156
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,306
I feel guilty about that,

1157
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:52,314
but I feel betrayed by the Church.

1158
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:57,479
The Church had betrayed me
and my family!

1159
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:00,147
They destroyed it.

1160
01:00:00,223 --> 01:00:03,556
By golly, I'm not going
to let it destroy me now.

1161
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,654
My name is Tom Doyle.

1162
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:11,826
I've been a Catholic priest
for 35 years.

1163
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:14,495
I've been fired
from two major positions

1164
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:20,338
and sidetracked from two careers
as a priest in the Church

1165
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:25,177
because I've openly advocated
for the victims

1166
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:28,513
of clergy sexual abuse,

1167
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:29,642
and according to some,

1168
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:33,177
been much too critical
and much too vocal

1169
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:36,350
about the source of the cover-up:

1170
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:40,522
the manipulation, the dishonesty

1171
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,790
that comes from the top.

1172
01:00:41,864 --> 01:00:44,526
When we were serving
the search warrants,

1173
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,364
the members of the Church
that were responsible

1174
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:52,704
for keeping those records
threw up a lot of roadblocks

1175
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,369
in having to contact their attorneys

1176
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:58,243
to find out what
they had to give to us.

1177
01:00:58,314 --> 01:01:03,547
Your duties as chancellor
encompass the entire diocese, correct?

1178
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:04,551
Yes.

1179
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,383
If a child had been sexually abused

1180
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:07,821
during those years,

1181
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,721
is it fair to say that
that would have come to your attention

1182
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:13,558
as chancellor and/or vicar-general
and/or auxiliary bishop?

1183
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,893
Calls for speculation.

1184
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:17,557
During which years?

1185
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,397
When you were an officer
of the Diocese of Fresno

1186
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:21,732
in any of those three offices.

1187
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:26,571
Object to the term
"officer of the diocese."

1188
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,631
Go ahead.

1189
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,416
I imagine I would have become
aware of that during that time.

1190
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:39,421
Your testimony is that
no such event occurred?

1191
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:42,253
No, my testimony is
I cannot recall

1192
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:44,259
something like that
occurring during that time.

1193
01:01:44,327 --> 01:01:48,093
Do you think if a child were raped
during your tenure at Fresno

1194
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:50,598
that that would be something
that you would forget?

1195
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,500
Object. Argumentative. Harassing.

1196
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,265
Instruct the witness not to answer.

1197
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:01,777
Do you think if a child molestation
allegation had been levied, Your Eminence,

1198
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,938
while you were there acting
as an official of the diocese

1199
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:06,106
and it came to your attention,

1200
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,776
that would be something
you would forget?

1201
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:10,443
I'm going to object.

1202
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,957
Harassing. Argumentative.

1203
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:16,616
Asked and answered.

1204
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,626
Instruct the witness not to answer.

1205
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:20,127
He hasn't answered that question.

1206
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:22,528
Yes, he has.

1207
01:02:22,598 --> 01:02:24,964
When the diocese was relating
to the police,

1208
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:26,626
and they didn't disclose the fact

1209
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:29,296
that O'Grady had been
previously accused,

1210
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:33,308
do you think they were telling
the whole truth?

1211
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,900
Repeat that please.

1212
01:02:34,977 --> 01:02:39,243
In '84, when the diocese
was talking to the police, okay?

1213
01:02:39,315 --> 01:02:42,307
The diocese did not talk
to the police in '84.

1214
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:44,649
The diocese attorney did.

1215
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,153
I didn't know that at the time.

1216
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,985
Okay.

1217
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:50,651
Do you think that somebody
should have told the cops, Father..

1218
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,489
Or Monsignor, forgive me..

1219
01:02:52,562 --> 01:02:55,554
that O'Grady had been
previously accused?

1220
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:02,000
It was in the hands of our attorney.

1221
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:04,335
Now, what should be done
or what should not be done

1222
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:06,568
would be his decision.

1223
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:13,678
So basically you left it
to your lawyer to decide

1224
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,013
whether or not to tell the truth.

1225
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:21,022
We left it to our lawyer
to work in the investigation.

1226
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,686
At that time, besides
the police investigation that we had,

1227
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,355
there was one guy
that could speak the truth

1228
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:31,195
and blow the whistle
on Roger Mahony

1229
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,360
having known about
Olive O'Grady for years,

1230
01:03:33,436 --> 01:03:35,529
and that was Oliver O'Grady.

1231
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:39,871
The night before he was scheduled
to testify in that trial,

1232
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:45,209
the attorneys for Roger Mahony
went to his jail cell,

1233
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:48,375
cut a deal with him,

1234
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:50,214
a very dark deal that said,

1235
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:53,380
"Oliver, you take
the contempt citation

1236
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:57,222
"and refuse to testify,
even though you've been ordered to,

1237
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,157
and we'll take care of you."

1238
01:03:58,227 --> 01:03:59,216
And they did.

1239
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:01,559
Does the diocese of Stockton

1240
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:03,895
or any of its representatives

1241
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,629
provide for any economic support
for you right now?

1242
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:12,240
Not at the moment.

1243
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:13,798
Have they in the past?

1244
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:19,247
Not since I left the priesthood.

1245
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:22,079
They didn't buy you an annuity?

1246
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,743
I believe they did.

1247
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,582
Do you get a check
from that annuity?

1248
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:31,423
No, that will not come into effect
until I'm 65.

1249
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:33,587
Who holds that annuity?

1250
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:36,928
I believe the diocese holds it.

1251
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,320
Are you at all concerned, Oliver,

1252
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:40,768
that if you give testimony
that hurts the diocese

1253
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:45,273
that they might revoke that?

1254
01:04:45,341 --> 01:04:47,434
I have a lot of concerns
about a lot of things,

1255
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,570
and I guess that would
be one of them.

1256
01:04:50,646 --> 01:04:53,274
My parents don't get
a pension from the Church.

1257
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:56,546
They lost their whole
financial stability from this.

1258
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:57,608
Yeah.

1259
01:04:57,687 --> 01:05:00,622
They will never ever be the same.

1260
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,624
My mother is forced into retirement.

1261
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:06,128
My dad has to quit his job
to take care of her.

1262
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:08,288
Because of what?

1263
01:05:09,498 --> 01:05:13,298
Because of some jackass
that was running around

1264
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:15,132
juggling 50 kids at a time,

1265
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:17,798
and some raping mothers.

1266
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:21,809
He abused my parents, too.

1267
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:24,311
The Church abused my parents, too.

1268
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,816
They took our tithes,
they took our tuition money,

1269
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:31,148
and they haven't returned
any of that back to my family.

1270
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,313
They deserve all of that back.

1271
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:37,325
There is no excuse that you'd paid
to send your kid to school

1272
01:05:37,393 --> 01:05:39,827
to get raped, you know,

1273
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:41,829
and to be molested in the basement

1274
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:44,661
where you're supposed
to be getting an education

1275
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,668
or being called in his office

1276
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:49,102
where he has full reign to do

1277
01:05:49,171 --> 01:05:51,901
whatever he wants to you
and send you back to class.

1278
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:57,443
This case, from the start to finish,
was less than two months.

1279
01:05:57,513 --> 01:06:02,007
It was strange at the speed
in which that operated.

1280
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,678
We just felt that there was
a lot of things

1281
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:08,349
that were left hanging
in this investigation,

1282
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:13,020
but because of the speed
with which it went,

1283
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:16,690
we just weren't able to do our jobs
as effectively as we could have.

1284
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:21,203
But they were afraid that,
through the powers of civil discovery,

1285
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,363
the civil attorneys
were going to find out

1286
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:27,876
that the Church knew
prior to Oliver's ordination

1287
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:30,138
that he probably offended.

1288
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,905
He got to serve seven years,

1289
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:03,410
and I testified in the case
that convicted him,

1290
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:07,916
and he's over there
living the life of Reilly.

1291
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:11,578
He's having tea and living
like a normal person.

1292
01:07:11,654 --> 01:07:15,181
He doesn't even have to report
like people here do.

1293
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:29,764
Seeing Oliver walk around loose
with kids is one thing,

1294
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,603
but knowing that
he was set up to do that,

1295
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:33,937
and he's allowed to do that,

1296
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,773
and he's going to be paid
to do that by the Church

1297
01:07:36,846 --> 01:07:37,938
makes me furious.

1298
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:40,447
I have to agree with Frank Keating.

1299
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:42,279
He was the former governor of Oklahoma.

1300
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:46,117
He compared this diocese
and the cardinal

1301
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:47,621
to La Cosa Nostra.

1302
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,454
In 2002, the U.S. Conference
of Catholic Bishops

1303
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:53,290
asked former Oklahoma governor
Frank Keating

1304
01:07:53,362 --> 01:07:55,125
to head a national review board

1305
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:56,960
to scrutinize the Catholic Church,

1306
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,465
hold bishops accountable,

1307
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:00,968
and guide the Church
in how to prevent, report,

1308
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:03,300
and disclose sexual abuse.

1309
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:05,966
Keating resigned
after making critical comments

1310
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:10,307
about how some diocese,
including Los Angeles,

1311
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:13,974
were and continue to be
less than open with the public

1312
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:16,540
and less than honest
with themselves.

1313
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:18,621
If you take the position
that you won't get

1314
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:20,646
anything out of me
without a subpoena,

1315
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:22,987
the suggestion is
you have something to hide.

1316
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:26,152
For a faith institution,
that's a terrible suggestion.

1317
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:30,824
In Los Angeles, when ordered
to produce the documentation,

1318
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,958
the records..

1319
01:08:32,034 --> 01:08:34,161
Where you find the truth,
or most of the truth..

1320
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:38,002
by the District Attorney
of Los Angeles County,

1321
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:40,837
Cardinal Mahony's lawyers
cooked up this myth

1322
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,502
called "formation privilege"

1323
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:47,675
which has no basis in canon law,
civil law, history, or theology,

1324
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,345
that every communication between a bishop
and one of his priests

1325
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:56,756
is equal to confessional
as far as confidentiality is concerned.

1326
01:08:56,826 --> 01:08:59,522
There are a lot of
privileged communications

1327
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:02,359
in the state of California.

1328
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:07,198
One of them is reporters
in news media of sources.

1329
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:12,536
That's a very highly protected
protection that you have.

1330
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:17,545
There are between a husband and wife
testifying against each other.

1331
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:19,376
There are a whole list of them.

1332
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,212
Those are protected communications,

1333
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,878
and so a priest
talking to his bishop

1334
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:26,615
is a protected communication.

1335
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:31,559
As Christian adults,

1336
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:33,390
Catholic, non-Catholic,

1337
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:36,898
Jewish, whatever,

1338
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:40,800
we should always be in the business
of protecting children.

1339
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:47,909
The one thing
that always stuck with me

1340
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:53,313
that Mahony didn't..

1341
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:01,914
The children..

1342
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:05,586
- He didn't protect them.
- Yeah.

1343
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:07,652
He didn't come clean.

1344
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,858
He has presided over..

1345
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:14,266
the wholesale sexual abuse..

1346
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:17,430
of dozens and dozens and dozens
of children in his dioceses.

1347
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:18,768
Let me put it this way.

1348
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:20,103
Cardinal Mahony's argument
about the documents

1349
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:23,440
is an argument
David Koresh would love.

1350
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:27,949
Basically, if doctrine
lets you rape kids,

1351
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:32,784
I guess that makes
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles

1352
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,049
an official cult.

1353
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,952
The last place we found O'Grady

1354
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,794
was living with a family in Thurles

1355
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:46,630
in the shadow of the seminary
he'd attended

1356
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:48,182
with the full knowledge
of the bishop,

1357
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:50,637
with the full knowledge
of the rector of the seminary,

1358
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:53,470
and the family he was living with
didn't know.

1359
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,636
And the Garda,
the police in Ireland, didn't know.

1360
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,641
I could say that my life
has been a failure.

1361
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:06,154
I'd like to think that I can still make
some good decisions

1362
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:11,659
and even bright future
for myself as a result.

1363
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:14,662
So, don't always do the right things.

1364
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,163
Obviously not, but..

1365
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:21,832
I think what I'm doing
right now is not alone

1366
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:24,168
the best thing,
but I think the only thing.

1367
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,503
I'm thinking of writing a letter

1368
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:32,343
to each person that I have
offended sexually in the past.

1369
01:11:32,414 --> 01:11:34,507
I do want to apologize to them.

1370
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:39,850
I am.. But I don't want that
to be a simple statement.

1371
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:43,016
I think they..

1372
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:44,572
Basically what I want to say to them:

1373
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,026
It should not have happened.

1374
01:11:46,095 --> 01:11:49,826
It should not have happened.

1375
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:51,195
If I could invite these people

1376
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:54,531
to come and meet
with me one-on-one

1377
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:59,540
and give them the opportunity
to, again, talk to me,

1378
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,872
tell me what I did to them.

1379
01:12:01,944 --> 01:12:05,380
I need to hear that,
and I think they need to say that.

1380
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,210
I can't say it's hard to do this.

1381
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:08,874
I'm kind of happy that I am doing it,

1382
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:13,388
but it's going to be
a very interesting reunion.

1383
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:15,082
And I really, really,

1384
01:12:15,157 --> 01:12:18,558
really, really hope they come.

1385
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,061
"I'm writing this letter to you

1386
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:23,155
"to invite you to meet with me.

1387
01:12:23,232 --> 01:12:26,724
"I would like to apologize
to you again

1388
01:12:26,802 --> 01:12:30,397
"for the wrong I did to you.

1389
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:34,568
"It is my hope that this opportunity
will allow you

1390
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:38,079
"the freedom to continue
with your life

1391
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:42,743
"knowing that I have acknowledged
my actions of the past,

1392
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:46,151
"and hopefully enabling you

1393
01:12:46,221 --> 01:12:50,749
to continue your life
in a better way from now on."

1394
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:53,488
"I need to acknowledge
to you face-to-face

1395
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:58,363
that I have molested you sexually
for many years many years ago."

1396
01:12:58,434 --> 01:13:01,426
"In this way I will be able
to respond and apologize

1397
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:04,097
to all those I have offended
in a sexual way."

1398
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:22,616
He's a piece of crap, man.

1399
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:25,455
He remembered all of our names.

1400
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:29,861
I get so angry to even think
that that guy's alive.

1401
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,100
I would kill his mother.

1402
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,467
I won't be quoting Scripture.

1403
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:38,472
It won't open with a prayer,

1404
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,634
except if anybody wants to,
be they need a..

1405
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:45,146
It might not even close
with a prayer.

1406
01:13:45,214 --> 01:13:47,648
I don't expect people
to hug me when they leave.

1407
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:49,149
I don't expect people..

1408
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:51,812
I hope they might
shake hands with me,

1409
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,321
and say, "Hey, yeah,
it's over right now."

1410
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:57,153
And I let them
get on with their lives,

1411
01:13:57,226 --> 01:14:00,457
and I'm sure they'll be happy
to let me get on with mine.

1412
01:14:00,529 --> 01:14:01,996
Come on down, you know?

1413
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:04,999
We'll have a barbe.. It's stupid.

1414
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,729
What the fuck is he thinking
writing these letters?

1415
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,003
Yeah, that's what we all need.

1416
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:15,873
To see him?
Are you kidding me?

1417
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:18,003
We don't need anything from him.

1418
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,672
I want to know
what his motivation is.

1419
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:23,013
I do not want to go over there
so he can get his jollies off

1420
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:26,179
collecting his little family
of abuse victims.

1421
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:29,520
Yeah, his little whatever.

1422
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,354
My motivation of going over there..

1423
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:34,520
If I thought that he had
a heart at all to touch,

1424
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,585
it would be different.

1425
01:14:35,664 --> 01:14:37,689
But I think he's so far gone..

1426
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:41,202
But it would be to disclose
as much as you can

1427
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,704
about what you did
while you were here

1428
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:46,366
and putting the nail
in Mahony's coffin

1429
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:50,070
to get the truth about what he knew.

1430
01:14:50,145 --> 01:14:53,046
Those are the people.

1431
01:14:53,115 --> 01:14:54,707
Those are the letters,

1432
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:59,948
and all I can say is Godspeed.

1433
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,417
I hope to see
all of you real soon.

1434
01:15:03,492 --> 01:15:08,395
I think the little girl
that's five years old

1435
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:14,231
that's scared and afraid of him
is still afraid to go.

1436
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:18,797
And then I think,
I'm a big girl now..

1437
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:25,469
and what I didn't have the courage
as a child to tell him..

1438
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:30,516
it might be nice
to tell him something.

1439
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,585
Healing myself wasn't going to..

1440
01:15:35,657 --> 01:15:39,252
It was never pending
on what happened to him.

1441
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:42,092
That's.. It's within me to get better,

1442
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:46,100
not based on anything that..

1443
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:50,127
I felt like if I was relying on..

1444
01:15:51,707 --> 01:15:53,937
his punishment to heal myself,

1445
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:57,740
it seems like that would be
giving too much clout

1446
01:15:57,813 --> 01:16:00,611
to the pain that
I'd gone through, you know?

1447
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:04,448
To say that's what I am
and that's who I am..

1448
01:16:04,519 --> 01:16:07,977
That's not who I am, so..

1449
01:16:08,056 --> 01:16:12,789
When you were a little boy,

1450
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:14,852
were you ever touched
sexually by a priest?

1451
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:19,959
Yes.

1452
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:23,801
And what was that priest's name?

1453
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:26,466
I can't remember.

1454
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,305
Do you know where it happened?

1455
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,471
When I was an altar boy
at St. Michael's Church,

1456
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:34,640
the event happened there.

1457
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:36,547
How many times
did it happen, Oliver?

1458
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:45,318
Not many.
I'd say two or three times.

1459
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:50,491
I think we all go through
an exploratory stage of that,

1460
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:54,001
but my older brother
did abuse me.

1461
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:57,163
Again, I find it hard
to say the word "abuse"

1462
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:01,608
because I did not consider
that to be abuse at the time.

1463
01:17:02,477 --> 01:17:05,674
I think my older brother
initiated it with me.

1464
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,847
I remember in the early stages

1465
01:17:10,919 --> 01:17:14,184
being uncomfortable with that.

1466
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:16,019
But later when I found out

1467
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:19,686
that he was also..

1468
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,093
being sexual with my sister,

1469
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:28,099
I became curious
and probably got involved that way.

1470
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,874
So the incidents with your brother
at a younger age,

1471
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:36,706
the incidents with your brother
at an older age when you were 15?

1472
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:37,710
Yes.

1473
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,542
Multiple incidents with your sister

1474
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:41,047
when she was approximately nine.

1475
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:42,048
Correct.

1476
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:44,711
Then you had
at least the two incidents

1477
01:17:44,786 --> 01:17:46,549
with the visiting priests

1478
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,384
when you were 10 or 11.

1479
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:49,617
Yes.

1480
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:55,221
Have you ever thought, Oliver,

1481
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:58,733
that some of your problems
that you encountered as a priest

1482
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,893
that led to your incarceration

1483
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:02,459
may be related to that?

1484
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,066
I have thought about it,

1485
01:18:07,142 --> 01:18:09,440
but I can't seem to make a link.

1486
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:16,747
I'm never going to get
what I want out of this.

1487
01:18:16,818 --> 01:18:17,807
Not from Mahony.

1488
01:18:17,886 --> 01:18:21,583
I'm never going to see them all in jail.

1489
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,248
So who gives a shit
what they think?

1490
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:26,590
You just do what you want to do
to take care of yourself.

1491
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:29,425
To hell with them.

1492
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:31,432
That's what you got to do.

1493
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,264
We're trying to uncover the truth.

1494
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:35,769
We're here to support you

1495
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:38,772
and we're here to support
all of the other kids,

1496
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,277
because this is big business
to the Church.

1497
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:45,939
This is money to the Church.

1498
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:48,278
It's like a big corporation.

1499
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,942
We have to ask ourselves

1500
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:55,115
who's paying for this nightmare,
for this crisis?

1501
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,623
Who is obliged to get involved?

1502
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:57,783
I think we all are.

1503
01:18:57,859 --> 01:18:59,793
One of the things that I've seen

1504
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:03,297
in my time with people like yourselves

1505
01:19:03,365 --> 01:19:06,129
has been a change in the understanding
of what church is.

1506
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:07,793
Many of us, when I ask you,

1507
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,302
"When you hear the word 'church, '

1508
01:19:09,371 --> 01:19:10,633
what comes to your mind?"

1509
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:14,300
Most of us will think
of bishops, the Vatican,

1510
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:17,641
the hierarchy, church buildings.

1511
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:19,475
That will be changing,
it is changing,

1512
01:19:19,548 --> 01:19:20,810
because church is us.

1513
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,941
It's right here in this room.

1514
01:19:23,018 --> 01:19:24,485
25 years ago,

1515
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:28,990
Tom Doyle called
the bishops to action

1516
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:32,652
and put a plan before the U.S. Catholic
Conference of Bishops,

1517
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,991
a comprehensive plan
to address the crisis

1518
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:36,655
of pedophilia in the priesthood.

1519
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,164
Basically, they wrote a report

1520
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:41,498
and said this is going to
be a massive crisis

1521
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:45,006
that's going to cost the Church
a billion dollars unless you do something.

1522
01:19:45,073 --> 01:19:50,010
They found that there was
a national crisis

1523
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:53,673
of children being
sexually abused by priests

1524
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:56,182
on a massive scale.

1525
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:57,513
I didn't know what they were doing.

1526
01:19:57,586 --> 01:19:59,349
I thought that they would
take it and do something

1527
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:00,547
because they were..

1528
01:20:00,622 --> 01:20:02,351
the Catholic Bishops
Conference in the United States

1529
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:04,858
were forever giving
pronouncements on everything

1530
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:10,023
from nuclear war to the Boy Scouts
to animal husbandry to chewing gum.

1531
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:11,861
You name it,
they were giving pronouncements

1532
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:13,534
on the morality
of just about everything.

1533
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,729
But on this, they stonewalled.

1534
01:20:15,804 --> 01:20:18,705
Cardinal Ratzinger,
now Pope Benedict,

1535
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:22,368
was head of what's called
the Office of the Congregation

1536
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,038
for the Doctrine of the Faith.

1537
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:29,379
The head of my church,
the successor to Peter,

1538
01:20:29,451 --> 01:20:31,715
the Holy Father,

1539
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:34,550
was the person in charge
of making sure

1540
01:20:34,623 --> 01:20:36,716
that priests didn't hurt children.

1541
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:41,558
He was in charge of that office
from 1978 until 2005.

1542
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,723
He did a very poor job,

1543
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:47,063
and basically was the one person
besides the Pope

1544
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:50,400
who could have stopped it,
and he didn't.

1545
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:54,966
What the bishops did
is they squelched the report..

1546
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:58,912
they went back to their dioceses,

1547
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,074
and they carried on as normal.

1548
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,414
They knew children
were being victimized,

1549
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:07,080
and they did absolutely nothing

1550
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:10,090
except insure that law enforcement
and the public

1551
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:12,592
and the faithful would not find out.

1552
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,097
The bishops have known that bishops,
priests, and deacons

1553
01:21:16,164 --> 01:21:20,100
have been sexually abusing children
since the fourth century,

1554
01:21:20,168 --> 01:21:23,626
and it's been a severe
major, major problem,

1555
01:21:23,705 --> 01:21:25,764
and they've never really
been able to curb it.

1556
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,105
Basically, you have a
sexualized priesthood.

1557
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:30,769
It's been sexualized for years,

1558
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,109
that looks at child sexual abuse

1559
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:36,446
no different than it does
if you're having sex with a woman

1560
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:41,285
because it's all a violation
of clerical celibacy.

1561
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:45,622
If all sex by definition was bad sex

1562
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:47,628
because you weren't supposed
to be having it,

1563
01:21:47,696 --> 01:21:51,462
then pedophilia is just
another kind of bad sex.

1564
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:55,799
There is no basis in the scriptures
for mandatory celibacy.

1565
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:58,134
It's not mandated by Christ.

1566
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:01,141
It's not justified
anywhere in the gospels

1567
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:04,645
or in the life and times
and sayings of Christ.

1568
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:06,806
All 12 apostles were married,

1569
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:09,816
with probably the exception of John.

1570
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:12,785
The first several dozen popes

1571
01:22:12,854 --> 01:22:16,255
were married and had children.

1572
01:22:16,324 --> 01:22:19,657
It's something that the institutional
Church leaders

1573
01:22:19,728 --> 01:22:22,322
began to think about
and tried to impose

1574
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:25,161
at least from the fourth century.

1575
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:27,326
Married priests, when they died,

1576
01:22:27,402 --> 01:22:30,838
their inheritance
went to their oldest son.

1577
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:33,499
So the institutionalized
Church leaders,

1578
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:37,170
desiring to stop this practice,
began to mandate celibacy

1579
01:22:37,245 --> 01:22:41,511
so that when a priest's property
had to pass after he died

1580
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:44,017
it would go to the bishop
or to the Church.

1581
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:46,280
What we have to remember
is a lot of the priests

1582
01:22:46,354 --> 01:22:48,015
who have been reported
as offenders

1583
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:51,354
went into the seminary
at a minor seminary

1584
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:54,020
at ages 14, 15, 16.

1585
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:57,690
They may have been thinking
about a vocation even earlier.

1586
01:22:57,766 --> 01:22:59,996
They got stopped.

1587
01:23:00,068 --> 01:23:03,367
They got literally arrested
in their psychosexual development.

1588
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:07,204
They're nurtured in an
attitude of negativity

1589
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:10,210
toward relationships, toward women,

1590
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:12,542
toward marriage,
and toward sexuality,

1591
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:14,707
and they never really
fully understand

1592
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:16,307
what any of these are all about.

1593
01:23:16,384 --> 01:23:21,879
So when these men
became unable to be celibate

1594
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:25,221
or when their sexual urges
overpowered them,

1595
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:29,389
they sought out victims
who they experienced at some level

1596
01:23:29,464 --> 01:23:31,625
as psychosexual peers.

1597
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,395
<i>The L.A. Times recently reported</i>

1598
01:23:36,471 --> 01:23:41,408
that 10% of the seminary graduates
from St. John's Seminary,

1599
01:23:41,476 --> 01:23:43,910
where the vast majority
of priests in the western U.S.

1600
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:45,240
went to the seminary,

1601
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:49,750
a full 10%, since 1960,
of their graduates are pedophiles.

1602
01:23:49,818 --> 01:23:51,410
Perpetrators of children.

1603
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:52,748
10%.

1604
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:55,085
If Yale was producing
10% of its students

1605
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:57,249
that became to be perpetrators,

1606
01:23:57,325 --> 01:23:58,417
somebody would take action.

1607
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:01,929
In Boston, after the final
settlements were made

1608
01:24:01,996 --> 01:24:06,763
for about $85 million
a couple of years ago,

1609
01:24:06,835 --> 01:24:09,429
one of the priests said publicly
at an interview,

1610
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:11,938
"Thank God this clergy crisis is over.

1611
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:14,065
Now we can get back to normal."

1612
01:24:14,142 --> 01:24:16,110
The situation was far worse

1613
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:21,444
than even what the most hardened cynic
thought was going on.

1614
01:24:21,516 --> 01:24:25,213
Cardinal Law, who was
the archbishop of Boston,

1615
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:28,517
presided over some
of the worst sexual abusers

1616
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,990
in the history of the Church.

1617
01:24:31,059 --> 01:24:36,759
It was something that ultimately
caused Cardinal Law to step down.

1618
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:38,731
You would think, if you presided

1619
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,997
over the abuse of dozens of children,

1620
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:45,164
that that would mean
you would be sent to a punishment.

1621
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,572
You know, the Vatican
didn't even make it a secret.

1622
01:24:47,642 --> 01:24:49,735
They thought he was
unfairly accused in the media.

1623
01:24:49,811 --> 01:24:52,109
They made him
the cardinal archbishop

1624
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:54,171
of this church in Rome,

1625
01:24:54,249 --> 01:24:58,276
and he actually presided
at Pope John Paul II's funeral Mass.

1626
01:24:58,353 --> 01:25:00,150
What's happening in Los Angeles

1627
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:03,679
does in many ways dwarf
what happened in Boston.

1628
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:06,124
As of June 2002,

1629
01:25:06,194 --> 01:25:10,460
we had over 100 criminal
investigations ongoing,

1630
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:15,492
and that encompassed
over 100 individual priests.

1631
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:20,803
What that tells you is how large
the scope of this problem is.

1632
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,538
I think the Vatican is looking for a way

1633
01:25:24,612 --> 01:25:27,046
to say "We've solved this,"

1634
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:29,640
and they are scapegoating..

1635
01:25:29,717 --> 01:25:32,948
because so many of the victims
were male victims,

1636
01:25:33,021 --> 01:25:35,182
they're scapegoating
the homosexual priests

1637
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:37,588
and saying "If we get rid
of the homosexual priests",

1638
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:39,059
then we'll be rid of this problem."

1639
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:43,860
Most men who abuse children
are heterosexual.

1640
01:25:43,932 --> 01:25:45,729
The Bishops' Conference, I think,

1641
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,530
would like to project that this problem
is now over with.

1642
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:50,798
It's taken care of.
They have solved it,

1643
01:25:50,872 --> 01:25:52,339
and it's now under control,

1644
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:56,673
which is a normal corporate approach

1645
01:25:56,744 --> 01:25:59,474
to something of this nature.

1646
01:25:59,547 --> 01:26:01,879
I'm sure that the guys
in Enron thought that, too,

1647
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,542
when they were discovered.

1648
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:05,381
Every day, every week,

1649
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:10,049
I learn of another child, young adult,

1650
01:26:11,459 --> 01:26:12,824
offended by a cleric

1651
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:15,829
who hasn't been disclosed
before this day,

1652
01:26:15,897 --> 01:26:19,799
and my fear is, my belief is,
that there are not hundreds,

1653
01:26:19,868 --> 01:26:22,336
but there are thousands
of offenders

1654
01:26:22,403 --> 01:26:25,236
yet to be exposed and disclosed

1655
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:29,572
still roaming the churches
in the landscapes in this U.S.,

1656
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:31,339
and tens of thousands..

1657
01:26:31,412 --> 01:26:33,312
tens of thousands worldwide.

1658
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:35,008
What is a good Catholic?

1659
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,244
A good Catholic traditionally

1660
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:39,218
is someone who kept
their mouth shut,

1661
01:26:39,287 --> 01:26:41,187
their pocketbook open,
you know..

1662
01:26:42,357 --> 01:26:43,654
Paid, prayed, and obeyed,

1663
01:26:43,725 --> 01:26:46,489
was docile, went to Mass,
obeyed all the Commandments,

1664
01:26:46,561 --> 01:26:48,153
went to confession
on a regular basis.

1665
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:52,165
For the most part, was ritualized,
obedient, and quiet.

1666
01:26:52,233 --> 01:26:54,326
But a good Catholic
is not that at all.

1667
01:26:54,402 --> 01:26:57,496
A good Catholic is a Catholic
in the model of Jesus Christ:

1668
01:26:57,572 --> 01:26:59,472
a revolutionary,

1669
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,905
someone who's not afraid..

1670
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:08,505
Someone who's not afraid
to get up and speak the truth.

1671
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:12,485
Remember, the only time
Christ ever got angry

1672
01:27:12,553 --> 01:27:14,248
was when He went to church.

1673
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:18,019
And as we speak,
Tom Doyle goes to Rome,

1674
01:27:18,092 --> 01:27:19,889
not because the Pope's
gonna hear him,

1675
01:27:19,961 --> 01:27:22,987
but because he has to do
what they should be doing,

1676
01:27:23,064 --> 01:27:24,929
and making those known offenders,

1677
01:27:24,999 --> 01:27:28,730
such as Oliver O'Grady,
who now resides in Ireland,

1678
01:27:28,803 --> 01:27:32,569
known to the community
as an offender.

1679
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,235
I think a lot of the people in Rome
are in deep denial

1680
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:38,609
about just how serious this issue is.

1681
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,444
Never attempted this before, honestly.

1682
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:43,710
<i>Pronto.</i>

1683
01:27:43,785 --> 01:27:46,345
<i>Mi chiamo* Patrizio Wall.</i>

1684
01:27:46,421 --> 01:27:49,754
I'm calling Father Tom Doyle,

1685
01:27:49,824 --> 01:27:51,815
who is in America.

1686
01:27:51,893 --> 01:27:54,794
Yes, you know Father Thomas?

1687
01:27:54,862 --> 01:27:58,263
Yeah. He will be coming to Rome.

1688
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:02,599
As far as I know, he's in Rome,
trying to help two victims,

1689
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,638
one of whom's our client, Ann Jyono.

1690
01:28:06,574 --> 01:28:08,542
They have an appointment
with somebody at the Holy See

1691
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:11,009
to hear their complaint.

1692
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,941
I'm doing this for my daughter,

1693
01:28:18,019 --> 01:28:19,452
but I said to her,

1694
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,287
"if you do it for the other victims
and the children..

1695
01:28:24,359 --> 01:28:27,192
"or..

1696
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,853
the kids.."

1697
01:28:30,698 --> 01:28:33,531
"I'll help."

1698
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:35,501
By golly.

1699
01:28:36,838 --> 01:28:39,705
People got to know!

1700
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:41,435
It's not right.

1701
01:28:41,509 --> 01:28:43,136
They haven't a clue, you know,

1702
01:28:43,211 --> 01:28:45,611
if it hasn't happened to them.

1703
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:46,977
Nobody has a clue.

1704
01:28:47,048 --> 01:28:49,516
They have no idea
what it does to people.

1705
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,051
And we're not victims..

1706
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,381
Destroys you everywhere.

1707
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:54,546
In that sense,
but Ann was a victim.

1708
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:57,955
She was raped by this priest!

1709
01:28:58,026 --> 01:29:02,190
People understand,
he's isn't a pedophile, he's a rapist!

1710
01:29:03,364 --> 01:29:06,231
My anger's so hard.

1711
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,525
Right now, I'm in Rome,

1712
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:39,566
and I'm waiting to meet
with the Jyonos,

1713
01:29:39,634 --> 01:29:40,862
a family whose children

1714
01:29:40,935 --> 01:29:44,029
have been sexually abused
by Oliver O'Grady.

1715
01:29:44,105 --> 01:29:47,336
I've not met them.
I'm going to meet them,

1716
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:50,707
and my purpose
is to hopefully help them

1717
01:29:50,778 --> 01:29:53,611
begin a healing process.

1718
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:54,670
Good morning.
How are you, dear?

1719
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:57,684
Good morning.
I'm glad to see you.

1720
01:29:58,286 --> 01:30:00,220
How do you feel?

1721
01:30:07,295 --> 01:30:08,592
This is Ann.

1722
01:30:17,004 --> 01:30:18,596
And what I'm gonna do is,

1723
01:30:18,673 --> 01:30:21,369
if we preface this one
with a short sentence

1724
01:30:21,442 --> 01:30:23,467
and say..

1725
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:26,604
"Bishops, archbishops, and cardinals"

1726
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:29,309
have consistently lied
to us and to the public

1727
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,442
and to law enforcement agencies

1728
01:30:31,519 --> 01:30:33,510
about the cover-up

1729
01:30:33,588 --> 01:30:36,421
"of sexual abuse
by the clergy, period."

1730
01:30:36,491 --> 01:30:39,358
We'll address it to the Pope,

1731
01:30:39,427 --> 01:30:41,827
and it'll be from you specifically,

1732
01:30:41,896 --> 01:30:44,558
but speaking in the name
of all those

1733
01:30:44,632 --> 01:30:46,623
who have been
victimized and molested,

1734
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:49,261
and I'm gonna put it
in language that they will..

1735
01:30:49,337 --> 01:30:50,827
direct language they'll understand.

1736
01:32:48,656 --> 01:32:51,625
A lot has changed
in the Catholic Church this year,

1737
01:32:51,692 --> 01:32:53,159
but it's still having trouble

1738
01:32:53,227 --> 01:32:56,287
responding to the victims
of sexual abuse by priests.

1739
01:32:56,364 --> 01:32:59,561
Today, two American women
came to the Vatican

1740
01:32:59,634 --> 01:33:03,035
hoping to deliver a letter
to the new Pope.

1741
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,629
The guards wouldn't let them in.

1742
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:10,143
Since we are survivors
of clergy abuse,

1743
01:33:10,211 --> 01:33:12,611
it has been a very difficult journey,

1744
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,205
and we have come
thousands of miles

1745
01:33:15,283 --> 01:33:20,880
to try to plead for some sort
of mercy and assistance

1746
01:33:20,955 --> 01:33:24,254
with our journey
of pain and healing.

1747
01:33:24,325 --> 01:33:27,658
We seek to regain our faith.

1748
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,571
And instead of..

1749
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:42,973
embracing them,
reaching out to them,

1750
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:45,604
the institutional church
not only rejected them,

1751
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,443
but they revictimized them.

1752
01:33:47,515 --> 01:33:49,983
They abused them
by pointing them out to be..

1753
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:52,383
making them out to be
an enemy of the Church.

1754
01:33:52,453 --> 01:33:57,686
I got them alone at one point
and expressed a sincere apology,

1755
01:33:57,758 --> 01:34:00,090
my profound regrets
as to what had happened to them,

1756
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:01,287
and I apologized to them

1757
01:34:01,362 --> 01:34:02,727
in the name of the institution,

1758
01:34:02,797 --> 01:34:04,059
the clergy, and the priests,

1759
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:06,429
which I am still legally a part of.

1760
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,468
And both of them said,

1761
01:34:08,536 --> 01:34:11,471
"No one has ever said
this to us before."

1762
01:34:51,078 --> 01:34:52,340
I made up my mind.

1763
01:34:52,413 --> 01:34:53,971
There is no God.

1764
01:34:54,048 --> 01:34:57,711
I do not believe in a God, all right?

1765
01:34:57,785 --> 01:35:01,915
All of these rules, everything..

1766
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:05,390
they're made up
by man, you know?

1767
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:09,156
I've tried to find..

1768
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:12,597
what it is that..

1769
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:14,896
brought religion
to where it is today,

1770
01:35:14,969 --> 01:35:17,164
why, you know,

1771
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:20,207
what differences in them..

1772
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:24,075
the similarities in all of them,

1773
01:35:24,145 --> 01:35:26,477
and I think that that's
a big thing for me

1774
01:35:26,547 --> 01:35:29,607
is that they all..

1775
01:35:29,683 --> 01:35:34,586
share some common theme
or philosophy at some level,

1776
01:35:34,655 --> 01:35:39,888
and you can't say
"This one, not that one"

1777
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,952
without alienating someone, so..

1778
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:45,794
And that's not..
That wasn't the message

1779
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:49,632
of Jesus or Buddha
or Mohammad or anybody,

1780
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:52,536
so what's..

1781
01:35:52,606 --> 01:35:55,268
They're already off-base
at that point,

1782
01:35:55,342 --> 01:35:57,207
and that happened
a long time ago,

1783
01:35:57,278 --> 01:36:02,807
so.. I think it's just all..

1784
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,578
all where..

1785
01:36:04,652 --> 01:36:08,418
the only place it could have gone
is the wrong direction.

1786
01:36:08,489 --> 01:36:10,354
What we need to do as a Church

1787
01:36:10,424 --> 01:36:13,587
is to acknowledge our good days
and our bad days,

1788
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:15,686
our good times and our bad times.

1789
01:36:15,763 --> 01:36:17,958
Somehow we always seem
to look back

1790
01:36:18,032 --> 01:36:21,900
and say, "Well, there were
dark moments and times"

1791
01:36:21,969 --> 01:36:23,231
"in our history.

1792
01:36:23,304 --> 01:36:25,397
We would rather
not dwell on them."

1793
01:36:25,473 --> 01:36:27,566
In a very poetic way, you see?

1794
01:36:27,641 --> 01:36:29,233
And that's very nice.

1795
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,141
But it's not reality.

1796
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:33,077
What I'd like to hear,
to say, "Hey",

1797
01:36:33,147 --> 01:36:35,581
"you know, we had one
heck of an awful time"

1798
01:36:35,649 --> 01:36:37,048
there in the Middle Ages.

1799
01:36:37,117 --> 01:36:41,110
"But you know what?
We're still here."

1800
01:36:41,188 --> 01:36:43,349
And that's the point,

1801
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,255
if the Church could see it.

1802
01:38:19,486 --> 01:38:23,217
And I'm here speaking
on behalf of Brandon..

1803
01:38:24,725 --> 01:38:28,456
with his parents today

1804
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:32,465
because this offender..

1805
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:34,592
is still in ministry.

1806
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:15,500
