1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,284
"The mime Baptiste Deburau
passionately loves

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:10,349
an actress named Garance.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:16,195
Out of timidity,
he misses his chance with her.

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,258
Instead, she becomes the mistress

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,397
of the actor Frédérick Lemaître.

6
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:30,004
At the Funambules Theater,

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,246
a rich dandy, the Count de Montray,

8
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,881
offers her his protection.

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,422
She refuses.

10
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,053
But when wrongly accused

11
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:52,499
of taking part in a robbery attempt
by her friend Lacenaire,

12
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:56,198
Garance holds out the count's card

13
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:59,070
to the astonished police."

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,549
PART TWO
"THE MAN I N WHITE"

15
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:15,415
"Several years have passed..."

16
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:35,676
The worst play ever seen
on the Boulevard.

17
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:37,303
The absolute worst!

18
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,541
- Why do it then?
- I have a contract.

19
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,743
- Why did you sign?
- I need the money.

20
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,649
You earn a fortune.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,053
I end up with nothing,
since I spend more than I earn.

22
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:59,158
Hurry, Mr Frédérick!
The authors are impatient.

23
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,998
Alas!

24
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,405
"The Inn of the Adrets
In rehearsal"

25
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:19,445
If punctuality
is the courtesy of kings...

26
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,387
It's not that
of Frédérick Lemaître!

27
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,327
And they call them authors.

28
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,953
My God!

29
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,397
Why do honest folk persist
in writing tales of brigands?

30
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,904
Even convicts could write better
than that.

31
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,438
At least they have experience.

32
00:02:37,507 --> 00:02:40,670
A drink, my little kittens!
For pity's sake!

33
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,847
Thank you, child.

34
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,653
Not at all convincing.

35
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,150
Poor Robert Macaire.

36
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,759
What's going on, my kittens?

37
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,731
I can't hear you.

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,700
We're sad.

39
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,602
We both love you,
but we're friends, you see.

40
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,664
- So?
- We don't want to fight.

41
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:16,337
Then do as I do.

42
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:18,141
Act.

43
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,239
It's your chosen profession.

44
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:24,180
When I act, I'm madly in love.

45
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,620
You hear? Madly.

46
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:32,425
At the final curtain,
the audience leaves with my love.

47
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:37,163
Understand?
I make them a gift of my love.

48
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:40,128
The audience is gratified,
and so am I.

49
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,306
Then I become
sensible and free again,

50
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,574
silent as Baptiste.

51
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,167
Not that again!

52
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:51,111
That's all I hear!
"Have you seen Baptiste?"

53
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,976
Even Théophile Gautier:

54
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,213
"Don't miss Baptiste in The Ragman!
A masterpiece!"

55
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:01,484
"Masterpiece," a pantomime!
Théophile's gone too far.

56
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,385
Don't touch.
It's a souvenir.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,289
It pricks.

58
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:11,163
"Viper of memory, stab of regret,

59
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,499
red light of oblivion."

60
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:17,228
It's all nonsense, fantasy, air!

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,172
What I like is reality.

62
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,974
Only two acts, but well made.
Compliments to the authors.

63
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,016
What vulgarity, really!

64
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:30,044
You think it's funny.

65
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,984
Well, I don't, you hear?

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,389
That's it. We've quarreled.

67
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,559
Are you angry with me?

68
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,371
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,376
Nothing. Just some people
waiting for you.

70
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,639
Poor authors!

71
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,704
Not them.

72
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,249
They started rehearsals
without us ages ago.

73
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,409
Admirers, no doubt?

74
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:06,751
- That's it..."admirers."
- I'm coming.

75
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,848
Back in a moment, my sweet.

76
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:12,122
Tidy up after you finish
snooping about.

77
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:18,359
Poor costume.
As bad as mine.

78
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,368
The manager wants you!

79
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:21,926
I'm coming!

80
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,300
So, where are our knaves?

81
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,341
Debts are made to be paid.

82
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,275
- The cad!
- Box his ears!

83
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:31,939
- Jealous husbands, angry creditors!
- As usual.

84
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,813
Grumblers and malcontents!
A fog of men!

85
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,651
You go first!
We'll plunge into the fog once more!

86
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,920
Gentlemen?

87
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,791
- Inveigler!
- My money!

88
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,626
- My bills!
- You ham!

89
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,825
Help! They're striking
Robert Macaire!

90
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,035
Help, cossacks!

91
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,403
They're killing Frédérick the Great!

92
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,007
So I run out of the inn
when I hear the shot.

93
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:09,449
You rush over to the body.

94
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,182
Where the body should be,
as Mr Lemaître isn't here!

95
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,746
Fine.

96
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,621
Shall we?

97
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,796
The hour of justice strikes.

98
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,563
You won't escape punishment.

99
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,265
Bang!

100
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,605
Alas, you have killed him!

101
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,606
O woe!

102
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,741
He was a wicked man,
but he was my husband.

103
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,253
Excuse me!
I got carried away.

104
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:49,323
However, I would like
just a bit more...

105
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,954
- A touch more...
- A touch more feeling!

106
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,724
Yes, that's right!
Feeling!

107
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,427
Feeling, feeling, and more feeling!

108
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,100
Dare I hope, gentlemen,
you like my costume?

109
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,541
Not bad. It has something.

110
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,041
- This must be some kind...
- Of a joke!

111
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:16,916
Robert Macaire and his evil sidekick
haven't come from the tailor's,

112
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,749
but from prison.

113
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,812
They're bandits, not dandies.

114
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,791
- But that eye patch!
- It's hideous!

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,590
My eye behind it
is even more hideous!

116
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:30,065
Gentlemen, let's not argue again!

117
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,363
He's here,
so let's rehearse Act II,

118
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,434
Scene 9.

119
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,696
On with it!

120
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:41,133
I'd rather do the scene
with the gendarmes. It's funnier.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,373
We are not here
to amuse the gallery!

122
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,108
Too bad!

123
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,412
Oh, well, if you insist.

124
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,216
Come on, Latour, old girl.
Scene 9.

125
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,892
My son!

126
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,451
You alone give me
the courage to face

127
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,363
the wretch who is the cause
of our misfortune!

128
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,597
Egad, my wife!

129
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,808
Yes, your wife and victim!

130
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,679
Woeful Marie!

131
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,708
She does look glum.

132
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,342
Spare us your asides!

133
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,750
On with it.

134
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,753
I am found out!

135
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:31,184
You betrayed me, Marie!

136
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,989
To save my son.

137
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,030
To save your son,
you betray his father!

138
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,827
Alas!

139
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,134
I shall feign tenderness.

140
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,366
Marie!

141
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,435
My poor Marie!

142
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:52,102
Robert! My poor Robert!

143
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:56,349
Did you really commit
all those crimes?

144
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,319
What can I say, Marie?

145
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,283
No one's perfect.

146
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,654
- Stop!
- That's not in the play!

147
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,190
So?

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,421
Your play's empty.
It needs some padding.

149
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,053
Outrageous!

150
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,327
That's right!
Your poor "inn" is empty.

151
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,801
Think the audience
will bring their supper?

152
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,701
They'll bring tomatoes!

153
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,771
You call this a drama?

154
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:22,436
Some drama... and in three acts.

155
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,809
One each. To be fair.

156
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,845
Three acts!
I call them actionable!

157
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,714
Don't play with words.

158
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,380
What can I play with?
Your ideas? You have none!

159
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,923
Come now!

160
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,553
We can't be insulted by someone
who got his start in pantomimes...

161
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,598
- On his hands!
- Why not?

162
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,257
You wrote a play with your feet.

163
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,925
Monsieur!

164
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,936
You force us to take
drastic measures.

165
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,438
Monsieur, you signed
a contract and have received...

166
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,137
And spent.

167
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,112
...a generous advance.

168
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,343
Are you prepared to honor
your obligations?

169
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,311
Are you prepared
to perform our play?

170
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:07,117
Why, certainly, gentlemen.

171
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,851
Provided it plays along
with me.

172
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:25,234
Enough! We have a description
of the criminals.

173
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,234
Don't try to escape!
You're surrounded!

174
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,675
One of them calls himself Rémond,
but we know his real name.

175
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,481
It's Robert Macaire!

176
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,279
And Robert Macaire...

177
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,879
Is you!

178
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:43,585
Prove you're not, if you can.

179
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,290
He's in a fix.
It's not in the play.

180
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,268
By the time he thinks of a line,

181
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,070
I'll have escaped again!

182
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,930
Come on, Rover, let's be off.

183
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:02,671
The play isn't over yet.

184
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,086
Frédérick, please, come back!

185
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:24,660
Stop them!
They'll get away!

186
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,403
Don't move, you're surrounded!

187
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,911
Just when I get a chance
to see the play!

188
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:40,111
Enough speeches!
You are mine!

189
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,810
Yours? You naughty boy!

190
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,746
Come now!

191
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,856
You've been unmasked.
We know you're Robert Macaire!

192
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:56,198
If you're not Macaire,
the escaped convict,

193
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:59,325
answer me this:

194
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:00,800
Who are you?

195
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,838
I am Frédérick Lemaître.

196
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:07,333
Liar! You're under arrest!

197
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,505
Not again!

198
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,170
Shall we kill him?

199
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,772
Killing gendarmes
never hurt anybody.

200
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,982
Collapse, you fool!
You're dead!

201
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,589
Alas, you've killed him!

202
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,959
O woe!

203
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,067
He was a wicked man,
but he was my husband.

204
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:41,938
Don't worry, little widow,
it was a false alarm!

205
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,644
Dry your tears.
Your little hubby lives.

206
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,579
Not for long.

207
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,787
It had to end like this.

208
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,788
I'm dying.

209
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,824
Farewell, Marie.

210
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,089
Forgive me.

211
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,221
I wasn't a bad man.

212
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,698
It was the company I kept.

213
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,770
I was but the arm that executes,

214
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,567
the hand that strikes,

215
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,302
the foot that leaves its mark
in the dust of crime.

216
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,842
But the true criminals,

217
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,473
those who plotted
in the shadows...

218
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,252
I shall point out to DivineJustice.

219
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,988
The true authors of this crime
are there!

220
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,121
A triumph!

221
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,058
- A disgrace!
- An unprecedented shame!

222
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,631
So, gentlemen,
I trust you're satisfied.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,525
Monsieur, you've insulted us.

224
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,473
Only your ignorance prevents you
from seeing what we see.

225
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,806
That you have deeply
insulted the Dramatic Arts!

226
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,870
You have sacked and trampled
our oeuvre,

227
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,944
debased our prose.

228
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:05,418
- It's good luck!
- Vulgarian!

229
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,617
- We demand satisfaction.
- As you like. Tomorrow morning?

230
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,990
Not a duel!

231
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,155
The Holy Trinity feels offended,

232
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,357
so we have to cross swords.

233
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,263
Arrange it.

234
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,566
Let them draw straws.
I'll fight the winner.

235
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,162
You may have the choice of arms.

236
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:29,904
I'll be at the dueling ground
at dawn with my seconds.

237
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,187
A wise precaution.

238
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,023
What are you doing here?

239
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,032
How did you get in?

240
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,610
Hands off. It's a souvenir.

241
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:06,114
It's perhaps one for me, as well.
Who knows?

242
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:08,012
And who are you?

243
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,816
You're famous enough for two,
so let's skip the introductions

244
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,947
and get to the purpose of my call.

245
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:17,592
I'll be brief.
I need money.

246
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,355
Everyone does.

247
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,054
More or less.

248
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:26,533
Maybe, but I'd like to know
why you come to me.

249
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,369
- I don't even know you.
- No matter.

250
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,269
I know you.

251
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,999
All Paris knows you.

252
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,339
You're too kind.

253
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,710
But let's not get carried away.

254
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,675
Yes, you are already famous,

255
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,809
and no doubt rich enough

256
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:47,322
for a man at bay
to appeal to you, quite simply.

257
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,257
- At bay?
- It's a matter of life and death.

258
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,594
- Seriously?
- Do I look like I'm joking?

259
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,359
I'm not rich,

260
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,171
but perhaps Fate sent you.

261
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,838
I won at the lottery last week.

262
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,275
I haven't spent it all.
You're in luck.

263
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:12,412
I'd give it all
to a friend or brother.

264
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:15,939
But as I haven't the honor
of knowing you...

265
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,253
all I can say is:

266
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,912
Let's share it.

267
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,684
If this tiny amount is of any help,

268
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,783
I offer it to you.

269
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,687
"Quite simply."

270
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:32,160
You amaze me.
Actors are said to be misers.

271
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:34,365
Great ones, especially.

272
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:36,199
Fine, then.

273
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,873
There's still progress to be made.

274
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:42,004
You practice a peculiar craft.

275
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:45,171
- The best.
- No doubt.

276
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:50,246
But you make hearts beat
every night at the same hour.

277
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,786
You don't understand.
That's the beauty of it!

278
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,390
The wonder!

279
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,359
To feel and hear your heart

280
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,730
and the heart of the audience
beat at the same time.

281
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,934
How promiscuous!

282
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:10,001
If my heart starts
to beat loudly,

283
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:15,469
I take an unusual delight
in being the only one to hear it.

284
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:21,942
May I ask what the owner
of such a heart does in life?

285
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,009
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

286
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,255
I write plays in my spare time.

287
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,424
You're an author.

288
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,093
An unrecognized author, no doubt.

289
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,793
Yes, unrecognized.
But I have no regrets.

290
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,831
I write light pieces,
but nowadays people prefer tragedies.

291
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,741
I'm fond of one of my plays, though.

292
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,871
A short piece
full of joy and sadness.

293
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,914
Two lovers are parted, reunited,

294
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,611
then parted again.

295
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:02,680
The setting, all in soft green:
A garden, a fountain.

296
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,786
Interesting!

297
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,328
But tell me...

298
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,488
now that we're acquainted...

299
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:14,297
was this money business
really a matter of life and death?

300
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,769
Yes. For you.

301
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,696
For me?

302
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,500
Had you been so foolhardy
as to refuse...

303
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:27,747
I can assure you the blade
doesn't retract into the handle.

304
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,014
You think Frédérick
wouldn't resist?

305
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,316
I didn't come here alone.

306
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,065
Incredible!
Like a scene from the play!

307
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,295
- Happy now?
- I sure am.

308
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,574
This imbecile is
a great admirer of yours.

309
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:58,340
- The thought of...
- I felt sick.

310
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,075
No, really?
How nice.

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,583
So there are decent folks
in every trade.

312
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,579
So, did you enjoy the play?

313
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,721
Don't ask.
The boy is shy about his feelings.

314
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:14,058
But you were there tonight?

315
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,323
- Well?
- Interesting.

316
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,955
I wouldn't criticize...

317
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,590
Please do.

318
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:23,865
It's not every day
you come across a specialist.

319
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:25,463
A connoisseur.

320
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,907
This is marvelous!

321
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,672
Do me the honor
of supping with me.

322
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:34,405
I had it prepared for the authors.
But I doubt...

323
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:36,878
Oh, Mr Frédérick!

324
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,580
It's most kind of you,
but we don't wish to intrude.

325
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,349
And you must be tired.

326
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,050
Not at all.

327
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,889
Just famished.
No formalities! Let's eat.

328
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,758
If you insist.

329
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:52,358
I have to regain my strength.
I have a duel at dawn.

330
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:58,036
It must be unpleasant
to die on an empty stomach.

331
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,709
A duel?
With whom?

332
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:03,935
With some fool.

333
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,741
You'll kill him, I hope?

334
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,748
If we had to kill every fool...

335
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,044
Indeed.

336
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:12,018
Yet it would make life
so much easier.

337
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,365
And with success at our doorstep!

338
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,068
You're killing the goose
that lays the golden egg.

339
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:39,477
- The goose might...
- Kill us.

340
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,416
Gentlemen, please!
I'm the only one dueling.

341
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:47,114
- Because you're the only one...
...who can use a pistol.

342
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,282
A pistol!

343
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,496
Here he comes!

344
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:58,623
And on time, for once.

345
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,854
He's drunk!

346
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,925
Gentlemen, my apologies.

347
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,091
No time to change into black.

348
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:32,155
We talked all night.
The time flew by.

349
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,635
True, we're not here
to exchange pleasantries,

350
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,103
but bullets.

351
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:38,365
Let me introduce my seconds,

352
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,173
who, for political reasons,
shall remain nameless.

353
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:48,380
You can't be serious.
You're not in a normal state.

354
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,575
A normal state.
What's that?

355
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:53,280
You can't even walk straight.

356
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,482
No matter.
I'm not going far.

357
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:57,787
Besides, in such ceremonies,

358
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:01,955
the line of sight is the shortest
distance between two points.

359
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:11,497
NO PERFORMANCE

360
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,927
It's sold out, I tell you.

361
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:36,759
- And tomorrow?
- Not a seat left.

362
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,993
Unheard of!
A ticket seller without tickets!

363
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,101
Oh, Mr Frédérick.

364
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,902
You're hurt?

365
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:53,641
From a pigeon shoot.
A peck in the arm.

366
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,775
I bet the pigeon's worse off.
Is that why you're closed?

367
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,118
I heard your play
was a hit last night.

368
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,222
The talk of the Boulevard.

369
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,224
It's like with Baptiste.

370
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:05,953
Things were slow,

371
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,587
and then all of a sudden...
It's incredible!

372
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,632
The whole town's
fighting for seats!

373
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,998
But you'll find me one.

374
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,293
That won't be easy!

375
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:20,497
I've got an idea. Come on.

376
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:29,042
Ayoung society woman
comes every night,

377
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:32,143
all alone, incognito,
to see Baptiste.

378
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:35,454
- Lucky Baptiste. Is she pretty?
- I don't know.

379
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:39,324
She wears a veil
and leaves without saying a word.

380
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:47,196
Excuse me, Madame,
just this one time.

381
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:51,638
A seat for an injured gentlemen.

382
00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:56,769
It's all right.

383
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,452
Garance!

384
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,431
Frédérick!
What brings you here, sir?

385
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,100
"Paris is small for those who share
so great a passion as ours."

386
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,039
Why the "sir," Garance?

387
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,203
Don't be angry.

388
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,471
I'm like that with everyone now.

389
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:37,507
O Desdemona! Perfidious creature!

390
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,986
To walk off like that, saying,

391
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:43,388
"See you later,"
and then vanish for years.

392
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,560
And when she decides to return,
she asks innocently,

393
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,825
"What brings you here, sir?"

394
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:52,157
I never left.
I knew you'd be back.

395
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:55,168
I waited in this chair.
For years.

396
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:57,338
You haven't changed.

397
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,842
Neither have you, Madame Garance.

398
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,673
But, in fact, you have.

399
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:05,675
You have changed.

400
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:08,810
You're more desirable than ever.

401
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,150
And I don't know... you're...

402
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,687
More "distinguished"?

403
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:23,061
- You're hurt?
- It's nothing. It's already healed.

404
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:26,728
There are other wounds
that take longer to heal.

405
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:31,639
Wounded pride, perhaps,
but a wound all the same.

406
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,465
So it was that man,

407
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:37,340
Desdemona,

408
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:41,643
that man with the flowers
you left with?

409
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,215
Where did you go?
Where did he take you?

410
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:48,879
That nabob. To India?

411
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,050
I did go to India.

412
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,726
But not for long.

413
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:57,457
I lived in England
most of the time.

414
00:26:57,565 --> 00:27:00,932
- And Scotland.
- Is Scotland beautiful?

415
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,003
Yes...

416
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,773
but it's so far away.

417
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,936
I love only Paris.

418
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,237
And memories of Paris.

419
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:14,407
Baptiste, for example.

420
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,417
Baptiste,
whom you watch every night.

421
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:21,711
As if you didn't know
that Frédérick Lemaître

422
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,281
also performs nightly.

423
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,509
Listen to the Gods!

424
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,347
I used to laugh like that once.

425
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:32,374
I'd burst out laughing, just like that,
without thinking.

426
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:35,593
- But nowadays...
- You're sad.

427
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:38,693
No, but I'm not cheerful either.

428
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,428
A spring broke in the music box.

429
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,296
The tune is the same

430
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,666
but it's in a different key.

431
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,371
He truly is wonderful!

432
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,469
He's gentleness itself.
How can he look so cruel?

433
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,959
So you love him?

434
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,799
Since I left,

435
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,767
not a day goes by
that I don't think of him.

436
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:05,067
He knows you come every night
to see him?

437
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:08,308
No. He has his life,
and I have mine.

438
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,276
What would be the point?

439
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:15,381
This can't be happening to me.

440
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,512
This is absurd.

441
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,748
What is it?

442
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:24,155
I think I'm jealous.

443
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,293
I don't know.

444
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,821
I've never felt anything like this.

445
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,592
It's insidious, unpleasant.

446
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,198
It infects your heart.

447
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,864
You reason,
but your reason fails you.

448
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,372
Do you realize, Garance?

449
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:44,574
Just now,

450
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:47,274
because of you,
because of Baptiste,

451
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,145
I felt jealous.

452
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,412
Me, jealous!

453
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:54,519
And full of regrets.

454
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,852
That man,
that traveler taking you away,

455
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,621
and me letting you go.

456
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:04,364
And to make things worse,

457
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:08,097
there's Baptiste
performing like a god.

458
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:11,870
It's not that I want him to be awful,

459
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,871
but maybe just...

460
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,909
Yes, just a bit bad.

461
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:18,411
Not bad.

462
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,345
But mediocre...
I wouldn't mind that.

463
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,149
At least, when I talk about it,
it stops.

464
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,052
You see?
It wasn't so serious.

465
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,387
A mild fit.
You're already recovered.

466
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,754
Recovered?

467
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,465
Why should I recover so fast?

468
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,266
What if I enjoyed it?

469
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:44,297
What if jealousy
was helpful to me?

470
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,039
Helpful, even necessary.

471
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,110
Thank you, Garance.

472
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:52,836
Thanks to all of you,

473
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:55,576
I can at last play Othello!

474
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,485
I didn't feel the character.
He was alien to me.

475
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:03,880
Now he's a friend, a brother.
I've found him.

476
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:07,760
Othello, my heart's desire!

477
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:09,694
After you, Desdemona.

478
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:14,899
I'll go embrace Baptiste.
I owe him that much.

479
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,635
Shall I take him a message?

480
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,300
Really, Frédérick!

481
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:24,038
I mean it.

482
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:26,137
True, I'm jealous,
but I understand.

483
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:31,143
And he has a wife and child.
That makes me feel better.

484
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:36,156
Whereas that other man...

485
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:38,681
Well, Garance?

486
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,623
You might mention me.

487
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:45,662
And if he seems to care,

488
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:49,469
say I'm passing through Paris,
that I'm leaving soon,

489
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,599
and that I'd be happy,
so very happy,

490
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,139
if he came to say hello.

491
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,627
So it's you, ingrate!
After all these years!

492
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,859
But the prodigal son returns!

493
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,495
Don't forget Alexis's fine

494
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,269
for being drunk, brawling,
and breaking a vase.

495
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,071
Five francs.

496
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,977
- The fine's gone up?
- Noblesse oblige. The price of success.

497
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,881
You're not doing so badly yourself!

498
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,243
I'm glad! Bravo!

499
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,726
Frédérick, you've come!

500
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,298
And I took the first step.
On one hand.

501
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,371
Hardly. I've been to see you
several times.

502
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,202
And no hello?

503
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:04,643
I didn't dare.
Besides, I was so moved.

504
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,374
You're a great actor now.
The greatest.

505
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,377
Really, no!

506
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,145
What you do is sublime!

507
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:14,655
No, it's you.
There are many great actors...

508
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:16,212
a few, anyway...

509
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,191
but great mimes...
you're the finest.

510
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,626
You're unique.
You invented it all.

511
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,995
I'm glad you like my work.

512
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,496
It's Nathalie!

513
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,633
You're a real beauty now.

514
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,573
I'm not beautiful, Frédérick.

515
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:38,611
Just happy.

516
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,376
Beauty and happiness go together.

517
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,484
This little fellow's yours?

518
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:47,348
What's your name?

519
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:49,651
- Baptiste.
- Like his father.

520
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,790
Quite a family, is it not?

521
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,488
Greetings, Frédérick.

522
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:58,724
It's a great day

523
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,859
when the greatest actor
in Europe and beyond

524
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:07,100
at last calls on the world's
undisputed masters of pantomime.

525
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,937
And there we are!

526
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,102
Greetings, all!

527
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,380
This is Jericho,

528
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:17,778
alias Wild Boar, Lone Sleeper.

529
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:22,380
I can't stand his repulsive looks
and distasteful voice.

530
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,089
Here you are, bandit,
body snatcher!

531
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,026
Don't start!

532
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,464
Shame on you!
You stole my looks, my identity!

533
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:36,731
You're not the only ragman
in Paris.

534
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:39,102
Besides,
you supplied the costume.

535
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,573
I didn't realize
what it was for.

536
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:45,442
Every night, Baptiste kills
a poor old man like me...

537
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,909
as entertainment!

538
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,641
- What an example!
- Enough, friend.

539
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:52,777
You're drunk and babbling.

540
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,616
You should be in bed.

541
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,625
I may be drunk,
but I've still got principles.

542
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,469
Why don't you ever say hello
to OI' Papa Joshua?

543
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,869
You're just like your father!

544
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,807
You despise and shun me.

545
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,146
What's Baptiste got against me?

546
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,704
Nothing.

547
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:23,750
Only that you don't mind
your own business.

548
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:26,948
Is it his business
what is or isn't mine?

549
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:31,014
I've always lived all alone.
So I take an interest in others.

550
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,392
Always alone.
That's not living.

551
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,460
No one to love me.
Nothing, zero, naught.

552
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,459
If I were a widower,
at least I'd have memories.

553
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:43,895
But no woman would have me.

554
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:48,670
They preferred
petty fly-by-nights and libertines.

555
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,603
Listen, Nathalie.
Let me tell you something.

556
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:58,274
Sure, it's none of my business,
but it's for your own good.

557
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:00,183
Spare me your gossip.

558
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,415
Just listen.
This won't take long.

559
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,959
Garance is back.

560
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,518
She's here, in Box 7,

561
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,126
and she's waiting for Baptiste.

562
00:39:11,532 --> 00:39:13,397
Garance!

563
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,730
Like the flower.

564
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,733
Box 7. Don't forget.

565
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,354
- Mama.
- Listen.

566
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:40,555
It's true, you know.
I often miss the Funambules.

567
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:46,056
Do you also have good memories
of our work together?

568
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,531
Yes, good memories.

569
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,304
You're not angry with me?

570
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,499
Why should I be angry?

571
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,737
Garance.

572
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:01,413
Let bygones be bygones.
It's all behind us now.

573
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:04,842
Come in.

574
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:11,324
Hello, Madame.
I have a message for you.

575
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,494
I came to say we're happy
together, Mama, Papa and me.

576
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,225
Did your father send you?

577
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,633
No, Mama did.

578
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:26,070
But Mama, Papa or me...
it's the same.

579
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:31,209
- Mama was right.
- About what?

580
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:33,906
You're beautiful.

581
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,908
When I grow up,
I'll get married

582
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:40,281
to someone like you.

583
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,713
Or like Mama, if I can.

584
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,619
You're a darling boy.

585
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,787
Are you married?

586
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,265
You don't have a little boy?

587
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:56,565
No, I don't have a little boy.

588
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:00,597
Then you're all alone?

589
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:02,700
Yes.

590
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:06,137
I'm all alone.

591
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,918
Aren't you curious about this woman
who comes nightly to see you?

592
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,861
Perhaps you're used to it.

593
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,301
You're on, Baptiste.

594
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,241
Listen, Baptiste.

595
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:41,440
I should have told you sooner.

596
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:44,177
That woman is Garance.

597
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,586
She's back, but not for long.

598
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,521
She'd like to see you,
you understand?

599
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,013
What's wrong?

600
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,200
Good evening, my angel.

601
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:12,933
- Pierre-François!
- Who?

602
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,201
Ah, yes, Pierre-François.

603
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:18,643
Forgive me. I lose track
of all the names I use.

604
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,107
A childish precaution.
The police are so inept.

605
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:25,585
Unlike me.
I am well informed.

606
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,213
For example,
I knew about your return at once.

607
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:31,952
I learned where you were living,
and with whom.

608
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,655
Nothing escapes you.

609
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:39,028
And I know they've put
my angel in a gilded cage.

610
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,794
I'm not throwing stones.

611
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:44,530
I've been in prison myself lately,
and in the provinces!

612
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:49,405
Not even a hint of a smile?
I used to amuse you.

613
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:54,505
Have you lost your gaiety,
or it so unpleasant to see me?

614
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,708
On the contrary,
I'm glad to see you.

615
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,117
- Yes, it reminds me of...
- An entire era!

616
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,214
Yes, the easy years,

617
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:08,395
the happy days, the good life.

618
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:10,656
Never look back at the past,
my angel.

619
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:14,165
It leaps at your throat
like a mad dog.

620
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,429
Still, fortunately, I was happy.

621
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,496
- Despite all.
- Back then.

622
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:22,064
Don't be silly.
Then as now.

623
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:24,043
Time has nothing to do
with happiness.

624
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,842
Really?
And the man in white?

625
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,849
Do you think your friend,
the mime, is happy?

626
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,948
To think I had
the absurd notion of killing him.

627
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:36,080
Comical, no?

628
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:39,284
One might as well stab
at a breeze or a moonbeam.

629
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,385
And the other one: Frédérick.

630
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,698
I considered him too, my angel.

631
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,734
I even called on him
on an amusing pretext.

632
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:49,462
Which was?

633
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:53,302
To ask this complete stranger
for money. He'd refuse and...

634
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:56,901
- And he gave it to you?
- A large sum. Amazing!

635
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:59,504
Unselfish people still exist.

636
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,605
People!

637
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:05,516
Actors aren't people.
They're every man and no man.

638
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:09,180
People of high society:
Those are people!

639
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:12,885
Like Count de Montray,
one of France's richest notables.

640
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:17,652
- You've changed, Pierre-François.
- Have I?

641
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:20,656
Yes. You used to speak of yourself,
rarely of others.

642
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:24,834
But what's become of you?

643
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:27,370
I've become famous.

644
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:29,841
Yes, a few sensational crimes.

645
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,038
The name Lacenaire has been
in the crime columns.

646
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,877
Hunted by police in the provinces,

647
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:39,817
while he is here in Paris
with his guardian angel.

648
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,979
- You're a celebrity.
- I'm becoming one.

649
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:47,824
But upon reflection,
I'd have preferred literary success.

650
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:50,220
Never satisfied, Pierre-François.

651
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,562
They say the count
is a generous patron of the arts.

652
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,326
I'd enjoy meeting him.

653
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,000
- Do you really need to?
- Don't worry.

654
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:04,210
It's just to meet the man
who laid the icy hand of wealth

655
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:06,372
on the pale shoulder of my angel.

656
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,649
There were no strings attached.

657
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:14,617
I'm still free.

658
00:46:14,822 --> 00:46:17,450
Perhaps.
That's what bothers me.

659
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:23,219
It's so painful to see you again,

660
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,598
and find you unchanged.

661
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:29,668
I'd prefer to find you
ravaged, submissive,

662
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,499
rendered stupid by wealth.

663
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:35,265
Then I could have lived
with an easy conscience,

664
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:38,004
and my fine idea of mankind.

665
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,505
My poor Pierre-François!

666
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:42,845
You think I'm a monster,
don't you?

667
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:47,620
Possibly,
but you're not the only one.

668
00:46:47,688 --> 00:46:49,053
Alas.

669
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:23,648
- Edouard de Montray, I presume?
- In person.

670
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:25,851
I was so anxious to meet you.

671
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,157
- And now I have. I'm delighted.
- How amusing.

672
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,963
Amusing and unexpected.
And to whom...

673
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,501
No one.
It's of no importance.

674
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:40,266
You do realize that I find
your manner most distasteful.

675
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:42,642
Who are you, Monsieur?

676
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:46,544
Is it not absurd to ask people
who they are?

677
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,049
- Excuse me?
- That's why they're so evasive.

678
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:54,079
They give you the easy reply:
A name, a title.

679
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,756
But who they are really,

680
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:59,552
who they are deep down,

681
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,857
they conceal with great care.

682
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:07,127
- You speak for yourself.
- No, everyone. You as well.

683
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:10,101
I find your ways quite indiscreet.

684
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,762
You don't know me,
yet you ask who I am. The gall!

685
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,365
Enough.
Where can my seconds...

686
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:21,471
Pointless! I'm not a man who duels.
Absolutely not!

687
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:24,039
That explains things in part.

688
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:27,484
Or if I do,
the choice of arms is always mine.

689
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:30,757
I choose one, just one,

690
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,649
and I keep one for me, on me,

691
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,596
and I kill when I'm sure,
when it pleases me.

692
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:40,257
Obviously, more expedient.

693
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,267
To each his own method.

694
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:44,498
Quite.

695
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:47,369
I presume
you have nothing more to say.

696
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:49,238
Valentin!

697
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:52,570
I warn you I am not a man
one throws out.

698
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:55,012
I would regret
having to kill a servant.

699
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:58,449
Valentin is an old retainer
whom I'm fond of.

700
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:02,011
Valentin,
will you show Monsieur out?

701
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,847
Good evening, Garance.

702
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:08,353
Good evening, my friend.

703
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,288
How strange.
When I'm not home you sing,

704
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:17,157
but when I come in,
you fall silent.

705
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,625
You only like serious music.

706
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,234
Sadly, our tastes differ.

707
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:24,930
May I ask where you spent
the evening?

708
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,029
At the Funambules.

709
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,438
Again!

710
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:32,501
And you,
at those ghastly animal fights.

711
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,308
"Ghastly" is too strong a word.

712
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:38,112
A mangy bear tossed like a bone
to three mastiffs.

713
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:42,220
It wasn't sport, but butchery.
A most dreary evening.

714
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,280
And the Funambules?

715
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,787
I won't be going back again.

716
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:49,522
I'm delighted.

717
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,257
Don't belittle the Funambules.

718
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:54,891
You forget we met there.

719
00:50:55,001 --> 00:51:00,098
Which no doubt explains
your pious nightly pilgrimage?

720
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:01,640
No, my friend.

721
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,642
The contrary would surprise me.

722
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,202
May I know the name of that man
who just left?

723
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,579
Were you at the Funambules
with him?

724
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,413
That man?

725
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,045
Oh, him.

726
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:17,750
An old acquaintance.
He came to say hello.

727
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:21,783
A most peculiar individual.
What does he do?

728
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,523
He writes.

729
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,599
To be honest, when I knew him,
he was also a thief,

730
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,731
and a bit of a murderer.

731
00:51:28,802 --> 00:51:33,136
I hope there was nothing

732
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:34,901
between you and this individual.

733
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:36,704
I trust you entirely.

734
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:40,975
That does you no credit.
I've never had occasion to lie to you.

735
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:42,674
True enough.

736
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:46,947
But please oblige me by seeing
such people as seldom as possible.

737
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,045
Actors, perhaps,

738
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:52,683
but thieves, murderers...
isn't that rather appalling?

739
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:58,493
Remember the young Scot
you challenged to a duel in Edinburgh?

740
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:00,725
I remember quite well.
Why?

741
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:04,493
He wasn't nearly
as good a shot as you.

742
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:07,198
Of course.
Everyone knew it.

743
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:09,174
But you killed him anyway.

744
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:12,234
Feelings, Garance,
in an affair of honor!

745
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,576
All because I smiled at him.

746
00:52:14,648 --> 00:52:18,049
Yes.
In public, and frequently.

747
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:21,383
But I told you
I was thinking of another.

748
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,451
Please understand
how much I want your love.

749
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,585
- For yourself.
- Don't torment me, Garance.

750
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:34,623
You know what I'd do for you,
because of you.

751
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:38,163
- Because of me!
- I love you as no man...

752
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,264
Could ever love me.
So why complain?

753
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:44,967
I want you to love me.

754
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,804
I do love you, my friend.

755
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:51,346
You're charming, rich, witty.

756
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,849
Friends admire you,
foes fear you.

757
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,817
You appeal to women.
Everyone loves you, Edouard.

758
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,423
How could I not do the same?

759
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:02,155
Stop it, Garance.

760
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:04,094
You know what I desire,
what I want.

761
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:06,665
You're incredible, Edouard.

762
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,896
Not only are you rich,

763
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:11,699
but you want to be loved
as if you were poor.

764
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:13,701
But what about the poor?

765
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,140
Be reasonable.
Don't deprive them of everything.

766
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:21,208
- Understand me...
- I do.

767
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,341
And I'll continue to do
my best to please you.

768
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,317
But don't ask the impossible.

769
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,050
However, if you like,

770
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:31,151
if it makes you happy,

771
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:34,853
tomorrow all Paris will know
I'm mad about you.

772
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,656
Yes, mad.

773
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:40,666
I'll shout it from the rooftops.

774
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:45,201
But to you, privately,
my friend, I say this:

775
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,904
I loved a man,
and I still love him.

776
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:52,470
I came back to Paris to see him.

777
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:55,612
He let me know
he'd forgotten me.

778
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,276
All I can think of now

779
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:01,149
is to leave once again, to get away.

780
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:22,370
THE RAGMAN
NO PERFORMANCE

781
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,811
Come in.

782
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:34,248
Your dinner, Mr Baptiste.

783
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:38,054
Thank you, but I'm not hungry.

784
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,484
You're being unreasonable.

785
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,858
True, I'm unreasonable.

786
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,459
Shutting yourself up like a monk!

787
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:50,195
No, monks pray.

788
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,170
I sleep, I dream.

789
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,069
Everyone's looking for you.

790
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,664
Hardly everyone.

791
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:58,609
The Funambules is closed.

792
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:02,307
Your wife, your son, your father,
the whole troupe...

793
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,909
you can't just forget them
like that!

794
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:12,148
But I couldn't go on living
like a fool in an asylum,

795
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:14,989
with everyone around me
whispering,

796
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,052
"What's wrong? Is he ill?"

797
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:21,229
I even saw a doctor for them.

798
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:25,300
- What did he say?
- That I was fit as a fiddle.

799
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:28,136
"Mild depression, overwork.
It's nothing!"

800
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,642
And what was his prescription?

801
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:34,171
"Go see Baptiste.
He'll cheer you up."

802
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:37,714
What if I don't want to cheer up?

803
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,817
- What's today?
- Thursday.

804
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,790
Tonight's the premiere
of Othello, with Mr Frédérick.

805
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:49,920
You should go.
It will cheer you up.

806
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,691
Oh, sorry!

807
00:55:52,899 --> 00:55:55,834
Othello would make
a nice pantomime.

808
00:55:56,903 --> 00:55:59,371
A man kills his beloved

809
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,241
and it kills him, poor man!

810
00:56:03,977 --> 00:56:07,504
A sad, absurd tale,
like so many others.

811
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,677
Like mine or yours,
Madame Hermine.

812
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,885
You spend your empty days
in your empty rooms

813
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:17,114
with your poor empty heart.

814
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,159
It's all so sad and absurd.

815
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:23,919
Like me.

816
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:27,929
Years ago,
I stood here by this bed,

817
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,731
in this very room.

818
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:36,804
And she stood there,
smiling, happy,

819
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:40,243
so lovely in the fresh night air.

820
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,110
And she said,

821
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:44,309
"Love is so simple."

822
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:47,746
And I didn't listen!

823
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:50,853
I didn't take her in my arms!

824
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:54,084
I set conditions:
"Love me as I love you."

825
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,957
And I shut the door,

826
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:58,963
forever, between my love and me.

827
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,463
What are you doing here?

828
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:05,629
I'm talking to myself.
Not to you.

829
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,271
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to be unpleasant.

830
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:15,405
You've helped me
and been so discreet.

831
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:17,279
It's only natural.

832
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,156
I can't...

833
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:29,520
I can't stay here any longer.

834
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,959
All alone.

835
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,100
I have to get out.
I have to walk.

836
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:48,109
Did he eat?

837
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,240
- He will.
- Good.

838
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:54,447
Thank you for telling me.
I was so anxious.

839
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:57,046
It's only natural,
between women.

840
00:57:57,824 --> 00:57:59,985
He needs to be alone.

841
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,153
We mustn't disturb him.
He's not like other men.

842
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:05,831
Of course not.

843
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:08,400
He's like a sleepwalker on a roof.

844
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:12,568
If you call to him, he falls.
That's Baptiste.

845
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:15,407
We mustn't call him.

846
00:58:15,475 --> 00:58:19,241
We have to leave him,
wait until he's calm

847
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,241
and wakes on his own.

848
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,440
When he wakes,

849
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,884
he'll come back.

850
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,328
Get me some poison, lago,
this night.

851
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:51,135
I'll not expostulate with her

852
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:54,405
lest her body and beauty

853
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:58,115
unprovide my mind again.

854
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:00,182
Do it not with poison.

855
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:02,483
Strangle her in her bed,

856
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:04,989
even the bed
she hath contaminated.

857
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,852
Let her rot

858
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:10,860
and perish

859
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:14,563
and be damned tonight,

860
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:19,301
for she shall not live.

861
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:26,304
Such savagery
and lack of decorum.

862
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,509
I can't say I like
this Monsieur Shakespeare.

863
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,811
True, one goes to the theater today
not for the play,

864
00:59:32,886 --> 00:59:34,877
but for the actors.

865
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:38,515
You insisted on coming,
my friend.

866
00:59:39,092 --> 00:59:41,356
No doubt I had my reasons.

867
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:44,496
Hang her!

868
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:47,465
I do but say what she is.

869
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:49,528
The pity of it, lago!

870
00:59:52,105 --> 00:59:54,266
The pity of it!

871
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:12,919
- May I?
- Of course.

872
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,297
"Desdemona came tonight.

873
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:22,300
Othello is no longer jealous.
He is cured. Thank you."

874
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:24,830
You see?

875
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:27,270
I assure you, you're wrong.

876
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,908
Naturally, I'm wrong

877
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,801
and you're innocent.

878
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,743
Othello, too.

879
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,879
Please tell me the truth.
Is it him?

880
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,180
No, my friend, it's not him.

881
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:10,045
That handkerchief which
I so loved and gave thee

882
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,811
thou gavest to Cassio.

883
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:17,117
No, by my life and soul.
Send for the man and ask him.

884
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:19,188
Sweet soul,

885
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:22,251
take heed.

886
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:26,489
Take heed of perjury:
Thou art on thy deathbed.

887
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,864
Dying: Easily said,
and just as easily done.

888
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:32,866
Why do you laugh?

889
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,305
Because if we duel in the morning

890
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,833
he won't be here to talk of death
in the evening.

891
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,242
You're mad, Edouard!

892
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:44,806
Why should you care,
if it's not him you love?

893
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,220
Kill me tomorrow:
Let me live tonight!

894
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,756
Nay, if you strive...

895
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,655
But half an hour!

896
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:55,523
Being done,
there is no pause.

897
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,619
But while I say one prayer.

898
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,527
It is too late!

899
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:31,291
The play's not over!

900
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,763
We're getting some air.

901
01:02:34,634 --> 01:02:39,833
I really must congratulate
this remarkable actor.

902
01:02:40,807 --> 01:02:43,503
If you do,
I'll never see you again.

903
01:02:43,576 --> 01:02:45,908
Nor him either,
for that matter.

904
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,389
Come!

905
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,120
Where?

906
01:03:06,232 --> 01:03:08,757
I don't know. Anywhere.

907
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:31,151
Monsieur, you play
the bloodthirsty brute so naturally.

908
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:34,054
You're too kind.

909
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:38,120
I merely played him
as Shakespeare wrote him,

910
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,790
as naturally as possible.

911
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,767
A peculiar fellow,
this Mr Shakespeare.

912
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:48,873
I hear he made his literary debut
as a butcher's apprentice.

913
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:50,272
Why not?

914
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:54,177
Which would explain
the bestial nature of his plays,

915
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,876
and his popularity among dockers
and carters.

916
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,247
And kings!

917
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:03,311
I see why I found this play
so distasteful and shocking.

918
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,952
I'll buy my coachman a seat.

919
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:09,119
It's worth trying.

920
01:04:09,395 --> 01:04:12,387
Then allow me
to offer you a box

921
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:14,359
for your horses.

922
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:16,560
It's worth trying.

923
01:04:19,005 --> 01:04:20,939
I thought you'd forgotten me.

924
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:23,567
I thought I'd lost you forever.

925
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:26,305
I've never forgotten you.

926
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,513
You were even in my dreams.

927
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:35,513
You saved me from growing old,
dull and used up.

928
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:40,422
My life was so empty.
I felt so alone.

929
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:43,618
But I kept thinking:
I've no right to be sad.

930
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:46,358
I'm happy.
Someone loved me.

931
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:49,559
But I still love you.
I always have.

932
01:04:49,936 --> 01:04:51,767
And do you love me?

933
01:04:51,837 --> 01:04:54,806
No, don't answer.

934
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:56,838
I won't ask for anything.

935
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,171
You're here.
That's all that matters.

936
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:03,039
Here, alive in my arms,

937
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,106
like the first time.

938
01:05:05,384 --> 01:05:07,579
No, I ask for nothing.

939
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:09,851
Only...

940
01:05:10,957 --> 01:05:13,448
the warmth of your body
against my body,

941
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,326
this mouth of yours.

942
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,492
These eyes of yours.

943
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,981
My compliments, Frédérick.
You were superb.

944
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:13,243
- May I introduce...
- No need.

945
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:16,152
We met once before.
Once too often.

946
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,917
Amusing!

947
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,585
These gentlemen seek
a quarrel with me,

948
01:06:21,661 --> 01:06:23,891
all very politely, I admit.

949
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:26,260
We all must kill time in some way.

950
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:30,966
Gentlemen, you're wrong
about my friend here.

951
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:35,400
I haven't known him long,
but in his way,

952
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,232
he's a remarkable fellow,

953
01:06:38,844 --> 01:06:40,835
and not lacking in talent.

954
01:06:41,547 --> 01:06:43,378
All kinds of talents, no doubt.

955
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:46,646
It takes all kinds to make a world,
or unmake it.

956
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:47,981
Amusing.

957
01:06:48,054 --> 01:06:50,045
An amusing pleasantry.

958
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:53,990
- Quite.
- You really find him amusing?

959
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,187
Then let us amuse ourselves.

960
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:59,764
Besides, we run no risk.

961
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:01,833
The gentleman doesn't fight duels.

962
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,425
Absolutely not.

963
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,139
How do you ply your talents
these days?

964
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,906
Since you ask,

965
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:14,241
I'm putting
the finishing touches

966
01:07:14,313 --> 01:07:18,113
on something
that will cause a sensation.

967
01:07:19,752 --> 01:07:21,413
A tragedy, no doubt.

968
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,978
No, a comedy, a farce.

969
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:26,547
Or a tragedy, if you prefer.

970
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,594
It's all the same.
There's no difference.

971
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:31,321
Or very little.

972
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:33,864
For example,
if a king is deceived,

973
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:36,993
it's a tragedy of infidelity.

974
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:39,071
He's deceived not by his wife...

975
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:42,231
- But by Fate.
- Yes, Fate.

976
01:07:42,908 --> 01:07:46,742
But if it's a poor devil like you or me,
Monsieur de Montray...

977
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:49,742
and I use "me" as a figure of speech...

978
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:52,579
it's no longer a tragedy,

979
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:57,278
but mere buffoonery,
a sorry tale of cuckolds.

980
01:07:58,891 --> 01:08:03,453
Yet it's the same matter
under the pauper's cap or the crown.

981
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:06,855
The dead matter of love

982
01:08:06,966 --> 01:08:08,991
rotting in the heads
of the unloved.

983
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:13,596
Always the same matter,
the same stories, the same tears.

984
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,474
So the genre is nothing.
My play need only amuse.

985
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:21,104
Starting with the author.

986
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:24,839
- If it's performed.
- Don't worry, gentlemen.

987
01:08:24,917 --> 01:08:26,384
It will be.

988
01:08:26,452 --> 01:08:29,717
It's in progress as we speak.
If you'd like a part...

989
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:32,519
- Very funny.
- Yes, it is very funny.

990
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:35,953
But, I warn you,
there are murders,

991
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:40,989
and at the final curtain,
the dead won't rise for a bow.

992
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,660
This man is tedious.

993
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:45,862
- Shall we throw him out?
- Good idea!

994
01:08:45,938 --> 01:08:49,499
Don't try to humiliate me.

995
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:51,634
I'm not some character
out of a farce.

996
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,337
But you are!

997
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:55,876
And I'll prove it!

998
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,683
What have you done?

999
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:09,184
It doesn't concern you.

1000
01:09:10,496 --> 01:09:15,126
Gentlemen, I've just savoured
a most exquisite moment.

1001
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:19,998
Too bad for you.

1002
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:23,803
I said I wasn't a man
to be thrown out with impunity.

1003
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,019
Again, this doesn't concern you.

1004
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,718
How do you know?

1005
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:43,887
Jealousy belongs to all
if a woman belongs to none.

1006
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:47,627
- They're going to duel.
- Because of us?

1007
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:50,099
No, because of me.

1008
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,900
But not before tomorrow.

1009
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:54,405
So?

1010
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:56,407
We have the night before us,

1011
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,909
with us,

1012
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:00,972
for us.

1013
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:06,642
If I'm not home, I'll be at the baths,
where I'll be expecting...

1014
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,051
My seconds.

1015
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:12,419
You do me a great honor,

1016
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:17,524
by sending off to the next world
a man alien to yours.

1017
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:45,988
You see before you a man
who's been ousted unceremoniously.

1018
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,321
But the mere thought of them

1019
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:54,058
killing one another
over a woman, because of me,

1020
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,066
comforts me.

1021
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:58,399
So we'll be seconds again?

1022
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:00,597
I doubt we'll be asked this time.

1023
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,834
Too bad! I like duels.

1024
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,569
That can be arranged.

1025
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:09,444
If not a duel, you may
be witness to something else.

1026
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:13,080
Because in this affair of honor

1027
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:15,882
I, Lacenaire,
am the offended party.

1028
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:18,890
Offended, insulted,
even humiliated,

1029
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,518
because they contemptuously
threw me out.

1030
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:47,881
How lovely the moonlight is.

1031
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,849
Look, Baptiste.

1032
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,024
It's shining for us,
like that first night.

1033
01:11:56,328 --> 01:11:59,661
And like that first night,
the window is wide open.

1034
01:12:04,303 --> 01:12:06,168
It's wonderful.

1035
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:09,703
Everything is the same.
Nothing has changed.

1036
01:12:11,677 --> 01:12:14,168
The table in the same place.

1037
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:24,516
The bed I slept in.

1038
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:32,123
You haven't changed either,
Garance.

1039
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:34,525
The same gentleness in your voice.

1040
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:37,399
The same light in your eyes.

1041
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:40,998
A little glimmer.

1042
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:56,110
Your heart beating
against my hand.

1043
01:12:58,691 --> 01:13:00,625
You were right, Garance.

1044
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:02,661
Love is so simple.

1045
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,874
Carnival time!
Life is beautiful.

1046
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:50,340
A bath, gentlemen?

1047
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:53,173
We merely wish
to see Count de Montray.

1048
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:55,376
At this hour? He's resting.

1049
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,278
He's expecting us.

1050
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,245
In that case,

1051
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:02,046
please follow me.

1052
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:37,546
- What is it?
- Two gentlemen.

1053
01:14:37,623 --> 01:14:39,784
They say you're expecting them.

1054
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:41,655
Two gentlemen.

1055
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:43,918
Yes. Show them in.

1056
01:15:36,648 --> 01:15:38,548
My poor Avril.

1057
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:40,885
The play is over.

1058
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,114
You can go now.

1059
01:15:43,255 --> 01:15:46,622
You'd be wise to go
to the country for a while.

1060
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:50,722
What about you?

1061
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:53,857
Oh, me!
I'm staying here.

1062
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:58,169
I won't risk losing my head
to a country executioner.

1063
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,737
Absolutely not!

1064
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,742
It was a wonderful night.

1065
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:16,405
But I must go now.

1066
01:17:16,481 --> 01:17:18,915
I can't let Frédérick die
because of me.

1067
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:21,745
- What will you do?
- Find Edouard.

1068
01:17:22,254 --> 01:17:24,722
Tell him I lost my head.

1069
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,553
I'll beg him not to duel.

1070
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,820
- Will he listen?
- Yes.

1071
01:17:29,761 --> 01:17:32,457
If I say I love him,
and him alone.

1072
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,089
You're incapable of lying.
He won't believe you.

1073
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:38,029
He doesn't care
if it's not true.

1074
01:17:38,103 --> 01:17:39,832
I know him.

1075
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,806
All he really wants
is to hear me say it.

1076
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,737
What matters
is not that I love him,

1077
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:48,039
but that I love no one else.

1078
01:17:49,214 --> 01:17:50,909
That's love to him.

1079
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:53,417
What if he asks you
to leave with him?

1080
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,453
I'll go.

1081
01:17:55,554 --> 01:17:57,818
Perhaps I'll come back.

1082
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,420
I'd have to leave someday.

1083
01:18:00,492 --> 01:18:02,255
Why?

1084
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,086
You know why.

1085
01:18:06,965 --> 01:18:08,762
You have a sweet little boy.

1086
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,461
Stop it!

1087
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,737
You love your little boy,

1088
01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:16,872
and you love your work.

1089
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,568
And Nathalie.

1090
01:18:19,644 --> 01:18:22,135
It's you I love, Garance!

1091
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:31,417
- Wait here and be good.
- Will you be long?

1092
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,424
No, I'll come back for you.

1093
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:36,518
- What for?
- It's a surprise.

1094
01:18:52,277 --> 01:18:55,542
Don't leave me.
I can't bear it.

1095
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:58,047
What about me?
I have only you.

1096
01:19:17,536 --> 01:19:19,504
Excuse me, Baptiste.

1097
01:19:20,038 --> 01:19:22,029
I came by...

1098
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:24,302
I thought you'd be alone.

1099
01:19:24,376 --> 01:19:26,207
All alone.

1100
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:31,977
You see, it's carnival today.

1101
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,910
Our son was so happy.

1102
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,285
So I came by...

1103
01:19:39,224 --> 01:19:41,522
He's dressed up as a cavalryman.

1104
01:19:42,394 --> 01:19:44,328
A lovely cavalry uniform.

1105
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:51,631
Please don't let me
stand here like this.

1106
01:19:51,703 --> 01:19:53,637
It's awful!

1107
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,400
Speak to me at least.

1108
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:58,572
Answer me! Say something!

1109
01:19:58,643 --> 01:20:00,634
Anything!

1110
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:03,374
Tell me to go away,
laugh in my face!

1111
01:20:06,818 --> 01:20:08,718
Is that all you can say?

1112
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:18,187
I really must go.

1113
01:20:18,296 --> 01:20:20,287
Again!

1114
01:20:20,799 --> 01:20:22,460
How easy it must be.

1115
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:24,864
How easy what must be?

1116
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:28,532
Easy to go, then come back.

1117
01:20:28,974 --> 01:20:30,942
You go. You're missed.

1118
01:20:31,009 --> 01:20:32,977
Time works for you.

1119
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:36,374
Then you come back,
embellished by memory.

1120
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,117
Yes, that must be easy.

1121
01:20:41,386 --> 01:20:45,288
But to stay and live
with someone,

1122
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:48,186
share his everyday life...

1123
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:50,922
that's something else.

1124
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:53,998
You can't fight that.

1125
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:57,401
I've lived with him for six years.

1126
01:20:58,803 --> 01:21:00,771
So have I.

1127
01:21:02,674 --> 01:21:05,700
- You, too?
- Yes. Me, too.

1128
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,606
Anywhere, everywhere,
every day.

1129
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:11,081
And every night.

1130
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:15,916
All those nights spent at another's side,
I was with him.

1131
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:19,581
Let her finish.

1132
01:21:19,658 --> 01:21:21,717
I want to know
everything about you two,

1133
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:24,584
know what's left for me.

1134
01:21:24,763 --> 01:21:27,163
If there's enough to live on.

1135
01:21:27,832 --> 01:21:30,392
What do I care
if you love him?

1136
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:33,231
You don't count.
You don't exist for me.

1137
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:39,304
Listen to me, Baptiste.
Answer me.

1138
01:21:40,011 --> 01:21:43,947
I'm not afraid to suffer.
Everybody suffers.

1139
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:48,080
But I must know.
Tell me now.

1140
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,479
Without thinking about it!

1141
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:52,689
Look at me!

1142
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:56,152
Were you always thinking of her
while living with me?

1143
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:01,588
You don't dare answer.

1144
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:05,665
But your silence tells me
a lot of things,

1145
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:07,731
things I do understand.

1146
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:13,243
Answer me!

1147
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:16,007
Were you always thinking of her?

1148
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:18,875
Even at night? Answer me!
Even at night?

1149
01:22:24,155 --> 01:22:26,316
What about me, Baptiste?

1150
01:22:26,391 --> 01:22:28,052
What about me?

1151
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:14,503
The game's up!
Time to go home.

1152
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,472
- Let me go!
- For shame!

1153
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:19,408
As sure as I'm called Old Maid,

1154
01:23:19,477 --> 01:23:22,708
Wise Counsel, Prim and Proper,

1155
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:25,011
for my sense of morality.

1156
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,675
Let go!
You make me sick!

1157
01:24:12,864 --> 01:24:14,525
Out of my way!
