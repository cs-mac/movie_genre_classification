1
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,304
So it was like
my second or third home game,

2
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,173
And I hadn't even
been in a game yet,

3
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,442
And I had tried to get
in the gym,

4
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,743
And they stopped me.

5
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,676
And they were like,

6
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,278
"oh, sorry, this is
the players' entrance."

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,781
I was like, "I know."

8
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,416
He looked at me confused,

9
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:54,584
And then so I was looking
at him confused.

10
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,253
And then he was like,

11
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:58,622
"oh, I'm sorry.
Are you a trainer ?"

12
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,825
And I was just kind
of just like standing there.

13
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,295
And then another
security guard came over

14
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,432
And, like, whispered,
"I think he plays on the team."

15
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,334
At guard it's...

16
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:15,940
Number 17, Jeremy Lin !

17
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,881
Commentator:
Nobody thought
he could play.

18
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,784
He had to fight for
everything that he got.

19
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:31,921
It's not often you think
you've seen something

20
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:34,690
You couldn't possibly see
in the nba.

21
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,826
Lin puts it up !

22
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:38,225
Bang !

23
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:40,461
Wait a minute.
Who's this kid ?

24
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:41,528
Wait. Where's he from ?

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,596
Wait. Not drafted ?

26
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:43,797
Wait. How many teams
waived him ?

27
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,365
When this guy is playing,

28
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,267
And golden state
doesn't know
he's any good,

29
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:48,836
Houston doesn't know
he's any good,

30
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,904
I got to imagine that
something has to do with

31
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,673
He doesn't
look the part.

32
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:56,211
Jeremy Lin came from
nothing to greatness.

33
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,180
Hey, this kid is giving hope
to all those kids

34
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:02,283
That think,
"never could I have a chance."

35
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:05,186
I always told myself
my progression is gonna be

36
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,655
Become a rotation player,
become a starting point guard,

37
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,457
And then win
an nba championship.

38
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:13,526
And people are definitely
gonna laugh when they hear that.

39
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,061
You know, they're
not gonna be laughing

40
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,462
If it actually happens.

41
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,774
De-fense !

42
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:43,187
New york foul
is on shumpert, his second.

43
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:45,823
And now, he'll have
to take a seat,

44
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,392
And, again, mike,
look who's coming in.

45
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:51,129
Jeremy Lin, and you hear
a pretty big ovation.

46
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,904
I know god orchestrated
this whole thing.

47
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,140
There's just too much
out of my control.

48
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:10,880
And just the way it happened
is just miraculous.

49
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,458
It's actually true.

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,596
After, I think,
age maybe 8 or 9,

51
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,131
We got rid of the tv,

52
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,300
And we would just get it
during the playoffs.

53
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:34,769
We would watch it
in the house

54
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,170
And then, in the backyard,

55
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:37,538
There's a glass door
and a hoop outside,

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,775
So we would just watch
through the window,

57
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,578
And then any time there was,
like, a break or a time-out,

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,680
We'd go out,
and we'd do the exact move

59
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,281
That just happened.

60
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:49,051
And it was pretty much all
just copying michael jordan

61
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,053
And watching him win.

62
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:53,455
And so we loved watching
basketball that way,

63
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:55,257
And it was always
a dream of mine,

64
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,925
But I didn't actually think
it would be a reality.

65
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,227
Where did you get this done ?

66
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:01,861
Downtown.
Oh, yeah ?
Down in the village ?

67
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,263
Can you take a look ?
Look at this.

68
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,864
Let me see what you...
This is the back of...

69
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:07,901
What do you think ?

70
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,569
Beautifully done.

71
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,572
Lintastic.

72
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:14,105
Thank you.

Cheese !

81
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:38,154
My dad was
taking us to the ymca.

82
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:42,089
We were still, like,
in elementary school.

83
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,991
There's like open gym Monday,
Wednesday, fridays,

84
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,459
From like 7:30 to 9:30.

85
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,298
And we would just
come home from school,

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,734
And we would just
all do our homework
as fast as possible.

87
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,868
And then when
someone couldn't finish
their assignment,

88
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,804
Then we would go
and help them,

89
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,005
So if I couldn't finish,

90
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,006
Josh would come over
and help me.

91
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,341
If joe couldn't finish,

92
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:04,443
You know, we would go
over and help joe.

93
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:08,180
That's everything
we've always known
is just, you know,

94
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:11,316
Having each other
and being best friends
with each other.

95
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,925
I didn't want to play
the piano,

96
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,294
And I was horrible
at the piano.

97
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:24,497
Like, every year,
the recital would come around,

98
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,632
And I'd be pretty much
playing the same song.

99
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:36,807
And they were just like,
"this is not working.

100
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,008
"I'm wasting my money.

101
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,443
"all he does
is play basketball,

102
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:42,580
So let's just let him
play basketball."

103
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,182
As we grew
to love the game,

104
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:48,285
My mom became
a huge supporter.

105
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:51,153
I think she could just see
that we loved basketball,

106
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,755
That we were
passionate about it.

107
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,456
And she's passionate
about us,

108
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,991
So whatever
we wanted to do,

109
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:58,160
She always
wanted to support us.

110
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,729
She always drove.
She was always a team parent

111
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,132
For every njb, aau

112
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,935
That jeremy played for,
that I played for.

113
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,504
She was always there.

114
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,406
She was
always supporting us.

115
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:12,709
You know, not every mom,
asian mom especially,

116
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:16,379
Is gonna support
their child playing basketball.

117
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:17,714
Cheese !

118
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,885
Hi !

119
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:24,886
Strong will.

120
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:26,020
Strong will ?

121
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,088
Strong will.

122
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,323
If he wants something,

123
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,361
He will do anything
to get that thing.

124
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:36,297
So he will knock
his head on the ground.

125
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,700
He will just
make himself fall.

126
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:43,769
He will do anything
to get what he wants.

Growing up, my family
always emphasized god first,

130
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,387
School second,
athletics third.

131
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,289
In the beginning,
they weren't sure

132
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,024
How long I could
play basketball.

133
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,393
They were just gonna
ride it out

134
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,829
And have fun with it
as long as we could.

135
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,842
I got invited to a y league game
in palo alto.

136
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,510
And he's
just this little kid.

137
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:27,579
You know,
you wouldn't think it,

138
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:31,249
But he just scored
the basketball so well.

139
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:36,319
The first tournament
we played,

140
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,722
And he just starts
just raining 3-pointers.

141
00:08:39,724 --> 00:08:42,225
Yeah !

142
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:44,594
They will say
I am so loud,

143
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,864
Because I will keep
talking, "defense !"

144
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:49,733
You know,
"get a rebound !"

145
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,903
Yeah !

146
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,471
Of course, mom's like,

147
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,206
"how many points
did he score ?"

148
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,641
She'd say, "I told you
he was pretty good."

149
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,410
I go, "I know. I know
he's pretty good."

150
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:04,615
All the aau team,
they never want jeremy,

151
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:07,816
Even though he's
the best point guard
at that time.

152
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:10,352
Only this particular aau,

153
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:12,587
Metro mirage,
want him so bad.

154
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,291
Yeah, jeremy !

155
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,729
I love
being the underdog

156
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:24,597
Just because it's
just what I'm used to.

157
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,299
You know, I would be good
in this league,

158
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,667
And then people would say,

159
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:30,570
"oh, but he can't play well
in this league."

160
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:34,741
Every time jeremy
play against somebody
who people say is good,

161
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,809
If jeremy played better,

162
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,045
Then they start thinking,
"that person's not good."

163
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,980
They don't
give jeremy credit.

164
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,120
There's a $14
extra-large burrito

165
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,354
That's like this.

166
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:51,325
Oh, my gosh, you should
totally get that.

167
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,227
Jeremy, you gonna
get the big one ?

168
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:54,728
Yeah.

169
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:58,432
Man versus food.

170
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,665
I'm about to beast this.

171
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,337
I don't know
how I got so tall, dude.

172
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,406
I ate a lot.

173
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,875
I would hang
from monkey bars.

174
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,878
Um, I would lie off the edge
of my bed thinking

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,980
That gravity would pull me
and make me taller.

176
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:21,751
When I was 5'3"
as a freshman in high school,

177
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,787
I remember--
my mom remembers this, too--

178
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,555
I would get in the car
every single day,

179
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,257
And they'd be like,
"why aren't you taller ?"

180
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,693
Like, "this is
why I'm so short."

181
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:33,965
She always said,
"blame your dad.

182
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm not that short."

183
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,901
She's 5'6".

184
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,936
For an asian woman,
that's pretty tall.

185
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,706
And my dad's also 5'6".

186
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:00,923
I think
my biggest influence
on him as a player,

187
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,893
The most
constant dominant
conversation we had

188
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,762
Was him creating
for others.

189
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:11,598
In high school,
he knew he could get by

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,800
And do well
on his talent.

191
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,170
A lot of kids,
and him especially,

192
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,172
It was
all about scoring.

193
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,440
And my constant
conversation,

194
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,075
My constant challenge
with him was,

195
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:24,211
"jeremy,
you're a creator.

196
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:25,847
"you could
really be the man

197
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:29,817
If you just embraced
who you are
as a player."

198
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,520
<i>During his junior year,</i>

199
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:35,223
<i>Jeremy emerged
as the vikings' star.</i>

200
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:39,093
<i>With every game,
his skills and confidence grew,</i>

201
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,828
<i>But so did his ego.</i>

202
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,663
We were like
30 and 1 at one point.

203
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:47,233
We were
killing everybody.

204
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,268
I was starting to get
a big head,

205
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,937
Thinking I was sweet
and everything,

206
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,673
And then I get hurt.

207
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,045
<i>Jeremy had a tradition
of shooting around</i>

208
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,111
<i>The night before
his high school games.</i>

209
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:04,815
<i>But on the eve
of the state semifinal game,</i>

210
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,017
<i>The high school gym
was closed,</i>

211
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,087
<i>And jeremy played in a pick-up
game at his local ymca.</i>

212
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,925
<i>That night,
jeremy fractured his ankle,</i>

213
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:18,096
<i>And his faith
would be tested.</i>

214
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,566
I just pretty much
broke down.

215
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,302
Um, I broke down crying.

216
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:28,773
Up until then, like,
I'd never gone through
any serious tragedy.

217
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,709
That was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

218
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,945
<i>With jeremy on the bench,</i>

219
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:37,447
<i>The vikings' hopes for a state
championship quickly faded.</i>

220
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:40,149
You know, from
a high schooler's perspective,

221
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,751
That's like everything.

222
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,653
I told him
to take a step back

223
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:47,256
And to look at it
from a bigger perspective.

224
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:50,693
I remember my brother
sent me this really long letter.

225
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:54,662
He talks about how god
gives and takes away.

226
00:12:54,664 --> 00:13:00,167
And so god took what I really
cared about at that time

227
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:03,104
To show me that I can't do
what I want to do,

228
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:06,407
I can't accomplish what I want
to accomplish without him,

229
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,977
And that nothing
in this world, in my life,

230
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,747
Will happen that's
not according to his plan.

231
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,092
When david faced goliath,

232
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,627
He didn't know the outcome,

233
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,029
But he was zealous
for the living god.

234
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:34,734
With jeremy, I know he puts
the order, god first,

235
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:37,704
Family second,
basketball third.

236
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:40,006
And he'll tell you
this now at least.

237
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:45,843
Looking back, it's more of,
god is in all those things.

238
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,548
And in high school,
he was humbled.

239
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,318
He learned that he couldn't
do everything himself.

240
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
Amen.

241
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:58,189
And he could only put
his faith in god.

242
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,566
I told myself,

243
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:10,702
I have one year left
of guaranteed basketball.

244
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,738
I said I'm gonna do
everything I can,

245
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,206
And I'm gonna
go out fighting,

246
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,142
And I'm gonna make sure
that we get back here.

247
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:22,312
He had unusual poise
for a high school senior,

248
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:23,880
Unusual confidence.

249
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,516
There was something about him
that I could see

250
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,385
Why he was a great leader
on the court,

251
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,786
'cause you're
just driven to him.

252
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,822
You can feel
his heartbeat.

253
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:34,558
Every close game
they had,

254
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,291
Jeremy Lin
was making a big play.

255
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,159
And it was
every different way--

256
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,495
A 3-pointer, a steal
at the end of the game.

257
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:42,497
But every one,
he was in the middle of.

258
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,732
He was
the guy doing it.

259
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:47,168
Lin takes
a jump shot right side.

260
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,304
Hits !

261
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,040
Oh, a nice jump shot.

262
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:55,978
Lin for 3. Buries it !

263
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,948
<i>Nothing was going
to stop jeremy</i>

264
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>From getting his team back
to the state championship,</i>

265
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:05,654
<i>And, soon enough,
palo alto faced goliath.</i>

266
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:11,225
Inside arco arena,
it's mater dei and palo alto.

267
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,961
It's the cif division ii
state championship

268
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:16,363
Just moments away
from tip-off.

269
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,167
I think a lot
of people just assumed

270
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,069
That getting to
the state championship game,

271
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,837
Palo alto would be
satisfied with.

272
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,873
Jeremy Lin would be
satisfied with it.

273
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,707
And it was just much more
of a formality

274
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,675
When they played
mater dei high school.

275
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:33,578
Southern california schools
dominate the rankings.

276
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,614
They're the powers
that be.

277
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:38,216
Palo alto,
out in the suburbs,
not so much.

278
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:41,186
Everybody said
mater dei was the team,

279
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:43,054
Mater dei is the big dog.

280
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,057
Mater dei,
number 11 in the country.

281
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,827
The whole week
leading up to the game,

282
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,829
It was just like, "how we gonna
get a rebound ?

283
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,197
How we gonna
be able to play ?"

284
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,332
I remember walking
around campus,

285
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,635
And there are
all these reporters.

286
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,603
And they'd be like, "oh,
you think you can win ?"

287
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,472
Like, "how you
gonna beat 'em ?"

288
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:01,807
And everyone's
asking me, my friends
were asking me.

289
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,174
By the end, they're
like, "you think you
can beat 'em ?"

290
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,776
I was like,
"man, just come
to the game and watch."

291
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,444
<i>Along with mater dei's</i>

292
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:10,881
<i>Decorated history
and dominant reputation,</i>

293
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:14,985
<i>This varsity team
had 8 players over 6'6".</i>

294
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:20,055
I was kind of relieved that we were
playing palo alto,

295
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:23,091
But the more
I watched them on tape,
I just had a feeling.

296
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,059
You know what ?

297
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,961
These guys are better
than I thought.

298
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:28,830
You know, you don't get
to the state finals
by not being good.

299
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,232
Here's lin.

300
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,634
Needs something good,
and he finally got it.

301
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,670
We were not intimidated at all

302
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:36,973
And really came out
playing our game.

303
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,409
Here's lin. Oh,
there's that quick first step

304
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,743
That they talked about.

305
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:44,147
Palo alto on a 9-2 run,
and that's over.

306
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:46,849
That kid can throw
the triple.

307
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,584
Everybody on paper
would say the size,

308
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:51,054
The athleticism, the quickness
is with the monarchs,

309
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,723
But it's the heart
that is with the vikings,

310
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:56,824
And their heart has been
on display so far tonight.

311
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,492
At the end of the game,

312
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,227
He hit the big shots
at the big moments.

313
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,462
Here's lin.

314
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,165
Without that 7-footer,
he can go to the rack !

315
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,901
When the game was on the line,
yeah, he took over.

316
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,269
Four seconds
on the shot clock,

317
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,537
And lin is gonna
have to launch a 25-footer.

318
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,038
Oh, it went in !

319
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,575
Did he call that ?
I think he called that.

320
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:19,845
It happened.

321
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,248
No one gave them
a prayer to be on the floor

322
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,918
With the athletes
and the thoroughbreds

323
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,488
That the monarchs have.

324
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,590
It's the best feeling to go out on top.

325
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,492
I mean, it is
a dream come true.

326
00:17:32,494 --> 00:17:34,761
It's why we love
high school basketball

327
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,763
Because of faces like that.

328
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,241
When I really looked at everything,

329
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,076
Everything
a basketball player

330
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:54,479
Could do for himself
individually

331
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:55,813
And for a team,

332
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:58,883
Jeremy Lin was
the best player here,

333
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:03,319
But yet colleges
weren't clamoring for him.

334
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,455
He just didn't fit the mold.

335
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:09,291
After my senior year,

336
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,594
I was just dying to play
in college,

337
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:15,231
And I felt
like I deserved it.

338
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,033
I remember it was
just a very long process,

339
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:19,268
Very frustrating,
because I was going

340
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,872
From pac 10 school
to pac 10 school.

341
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,240
I couldn't even get

342
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:25,642
Some division iii schools
to look at me.

343
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,478
And I was dying
to go to stanford.

344
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,348
Um, I would go there
and play with them all the time.

345
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,116
I would always ask their coach,
you know,

346
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,952
"what can I do
to play for you ?"

347
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,821
Yeah, I've always said,
if I was black,

348
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,756
I would have gotten
a d-1 scholarship,

349
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:43,324
But that's
my personal opinion.

350
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:46,561
Well, he's an asian kid.

351
00:18:46,563 --> 00:18:48,930
He's an asian kid,
and he's not 7-foot tall.

352
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:51,666
And you don't see
a lot of asian point guards

353
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:55,435
Making it
in division I basketball.

354
00:18:55,437 --> 00:19:00,807
Such a simple kind of thought,
but that was the thinking.

355
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:16,056
I say... I say he's relatable.

356
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,492
He's one of the most
down-to-earth guys I know.

357
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,994
We're always joking around.

358
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:24,398
We're always, you know,
pranking on each other.

359
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,834
Um, did you see
the blue accented stuff ?

360
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,702
I did see it.
You like that blue ?

361
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,502
Yeah. I really
like that blue,

362
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,070
'cause when I walk in,

363
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:33,305
I don't want it to be
like black, white, black.

364
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,906
I want people
to be like, "dang."

365
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,008
Oh, shoot, son.

366
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,844
Different walls
need different accents.

367
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,645
These are clearance.

368
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,382
Yeah, dang, look at that.

369
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,050
Look at this. 10 bucks.

370
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,786
I think when people
hang out with him,

371
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,721
They just realize
he's just...

372
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,857
You know, he's human.

373
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:02,132
Sounds good. All right,
see you later, bro.

374
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:18,015
<i>Despite being named
player of the year</i>

375
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,050
<i>And winning
a state championship,</i>

376
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,483
<i>Jeremy's only offer</i>

377
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:23,185
<i>To play basketball
on the collegiate level</i>

378
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,487
<i>Was from a small university</i>

379
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,822
<i>Called harvard.</i>

380
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:28,924
My first day at class,

381
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,059
I was
just super-intimidated.

382
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,228
I went and took
my math placement test,

383
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,365
And they were like, "if you
don't know how to do this,

384
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,832
Feel free to turn it in
and leave."

385
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,901
I looked at it
and I was, like,

386
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:42,702
"dude, I don't know
what's going on here."

387
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,272
So I turned it in,
and I was,

388
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:48,074
Like, maybe the second person
who turned it in.

389
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:49,442
I was like,
"man, I just, like,

390
00:20:49,444 --> 00:20:51,878
Failed my first test
at harvard."

391
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:56,350
The next day, we had
the chinese placement test,

392
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,119
And they gave us the test,
and they're like,

393
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,021
"if you can't read it,
just turn it in."

394
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:04,926
I couldn't read it,
so I turned it in again,

395
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:06,761
And that was
back-to-back failed tests

396
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,596
Without even
filling in an answer.

397
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,566
I called my mom,
I was like, "man,

398
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:16,001
This is gonna be pretty tough,
so just get ready."

399
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,242
In a lot of ways,
Jeremy Lin going to harvard

400
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:25,911
Was a very logical thing.

401
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:29,982
There were 23 asian-americans
at harvard

402
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,082
Whose last name was lin.

403
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,951
And so for Jeremy Lin
to show up at harvard,

404
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,319
Being this asian-american kid,

405
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:39,022
Who had a perfect math
sat ii score was,

406
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:40,991
You know, nothing rare.

407
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:44,695
But the fact that he was
amazing at this game,

408
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:48,666
The question was then
how did he fit in at harvard ?

409
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,170
There is tommy amaker,

410
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,105
1987 graduate of duke,
of course,

411
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:55,306
First year at harvard,

412
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:57,542
11th year overall
as a head coach,

413
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:59,644
180 career wins.

414
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:03,081
<i>With the hiring of former
michigan coach tommy amaker,</i>

415
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,782
<i>Harvard was committed
to a new era</i>

416
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,582
<i>In their basketball program.</i>

417
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:10,119
<i>Amaker was a star player
at duke university,</i>

418
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,088
<i>Then spent nine years
as an assistant coach</i>

419
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,657
<i>To the legendary
mike krzyzewski.</i>

420
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,759
<i>The basketball landscape
at harvard</i>

421
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,128
<i>Was about to be transformed,</i>

422
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,265
<i>And jeremy
was leading the charge.</i>

423
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,698
We knew we had something
pretty interesting,

424
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,066
Especially with jeremy,

425
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:28,335
Because of
how hard he worked,
first of all,

426
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:30,704
And how important
basketball was to him.

427
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:31,905
And then his talent.

428
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:34,208
I think he was
very much underrated,

429
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,876
And I think he wanted
to play in the style

430
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:37,211
And the system, you know,

431
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,712
That we were
gonna implement,

432
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,315
Which is gonna
be high octane.

433
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,916
And he's a hard-charging,

434
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:44,352
Aggressive,
fearless player.

435
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:45,887
A steal by Jeremy Lin.

436
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,656
He's gonna go in
for the easy jam.

437
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,823
Looking up ahead,

438
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,127
Lin splits defenders
and lays it in !

439
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:53,928
In my 15 years of coaching,

440
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,964
My four years at duke,

441
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,330
I've never seen anybody

442
00:22:57,332 --> 00:23:00,566
Work as diligent
and as hard as jeremy.

443
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,869
He came in every day
and put the work in.

444
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,704
We watched film every day.

445
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:07,707
We did work
before and after practice.

446
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:09,142
He busted his tail,

447
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,510
And he did all the things
that we asked him to do.

448
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:13,346
Top of the circle,
deep 3, Jeremy Lin !

449
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:16,347
It seems
the bigger the game,
the better he played.

450
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:18,182
It's big east basketball,

451
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:21,185
As the 13th ranked uconn huskies
host the crimson of harvard.

452
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:23,054
Now, keep an eye on Jeremy Lin today.

453
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,388
This is the type
of player

454
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,657
That can single-handedly
help the crimson

455
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,492
Pull off
a miraculous upset.

456
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,194
He was the best player
on the floor.

457
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:31,495
You know,
that's saying a lot

458
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,998
When you're speaking
of a team

459
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,733
That was
the caliber of connecticut.

460
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,936
What a move on
the runner off the glass.

461
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:40,539
I think that's
when everybody was like,

462
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,041
"all right, he's more than just,
like, a good college player.

463
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:45,977
Like, he just made
a very good team look bad."

464
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:49,112
Casey had it knocked away,
and a steal by dyson.

465
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:50,380
Takes lin to the basket,

466
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:51,881
And lin blocks him
at the rim !

467
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:53,083
What a block.

468
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,784
Scoring 30 points there,

469
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:57,387
Being a force to deal with
in every way.

470
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:58,988
Back to lin top of the key,
pump fake, drives

471
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,990
And throws it down
with both hands !

472
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:03,259
Oh, what a dunk
by Jeremy Lin !

473
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,929
He kept us believing
all the way through

474
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:09,630
That we have a chance.

475
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:12,333
This guy's leading
this team in every
category, not just one.

476
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,202
I mean, it wasn't like
he was just a scorer.

477
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,603
He was the best
defensive player,

478
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,638
He was
the best rebounder,
the best passer.

479
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,707
You know,
he pretty much
could do it all.

480
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,743
It was just kind
of like those moments

481
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:24,613
Where it was crunch time
and winning time,

482
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:26,382
You know,
who's gonna step up ?

483
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:27,983
Back the other way,
comes to gurdy,

484
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:29,318
Into the frontcourt.

485
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,652
Drives down
the right lane line,

486
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,221
Goes up with the right hand !
Lays it in !

487
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,256
Three seconds left !
Harvard back the other way !

488
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:35,758
Down by a point,
Jeremy Lin !

489
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,892
Bumped at midcourt !

490
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,560
He's fouled,
but got it to go !

491
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,027
Harvard wins it !
Harvard wins it !

492
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:42,295
Unbelievable !

493
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:44,965
Jeremy Lin
on an unbelievable shot,

494
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,099
And harvard has won

495
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,268
In the most
improbable fashion !

496
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,803
I don't believe it !

497
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,209
When I was growing up,

498
00:24:58,211 --> 00:24:59,978
I was playing
in the aau tournaments.

499
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,479
We would play in games,

500
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:02,914
And a couple of times,
people would be like,

501
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,849
"yo, take your ass
back to china,"

502
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,352
Or like, "you're
a chinese import," or whatever.

503
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:10,321
When I got to college,
it just, like, got crazy.

504
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:11,556
It was just like,
"you chink !"

505
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,258
You know, "can you even
open your eyes ?

506
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,459
Can you see
the scoreboard ?"

507
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,028
You know,
just like crazy stuff.

508
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,799
And I'd just be like,
"dude, like, what is going on ?"

509
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:22,501
<i>Being in the spotlight</i>

510
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:24,470
<i>Brought jeremy
an inevitable by product:</i>

511
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:29,008
<i>Attention,
both positive and negative.</i>

512
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,943
I mean, people look
at basketball players
in terms of...

513
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:34,912
Of race
a lot of times.

514
00:25:34,914 --> 00:25:36,947
Basketball
is not considered

515
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,183
An asian sport
here in america.

516
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,284
We'd be playing
on the road,

517
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:41,819
Specific gyms
in the ivy league,

518
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:45,456
And they would yell
racial slurs to him.

519
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,124
It was shocking to me
to see racial taunts

520
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,459
In the ivy league,

521
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,792
Because you think
that at that level,

522
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:53,728
Certainly in the supposed,
you know,

523
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,898
Very academically
progressively oriented

524
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,535
Group of schools full of
asian students on their campuses

525
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:03,338
That that would be something
that was unthinkable,

526
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,140
But it wasn't.

527
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,743
I just told him,
it's a sign of respect.

528
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:09,212
Yeah, they're ignorant,

529
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:10,546
But at the end
of the day,

530
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:12,114
They're trying to get
in your head.

531
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,050
You're thinking
about what they saying

532
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:15,885
And not thinking
about the game.

533
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,926
I think we were just working out,

534
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:28,662
And kind of was like,
you know

535
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:30,865
"j, can I speak to you
for a moment ?"

536
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,132
He sat me down,

537
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,968
Like, right outside
the gym on the stairs,

538
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,603
And he was like...

539
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:37,404
"I don't know
if anybody's
ever told you this,

540
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,840
But I think you can be
an nba player."

541
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:42,508
And he kind of looked
at me like, you know,

542
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,776
He just saw santa claus
or something.

543
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:47,846
You know, I was just like,
"you're crazy," you know.

544
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:50,315
I was like,
"dude, you are crazy."

545
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,253
My mom, you know,
would be like,

546
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,988
"you can make it
to the nba."

547
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,024
"all right. Um, okay, mom."

548
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:02,028
Is this possible ?

549
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,363
I thought maybe
he really...

550
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,331
Really have a chance.

551
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,900
When the question
was broached,

552
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:09,068
Is Jeremy Lin good enough
to make the nba,

553
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,305
That's when I think a lot
of the interest started surging.

554
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,542
Can you tell me
the history
of this blanket ?

555
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,210
Oh, this blanket
is legendary.

556
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:20,411
Yeah ?

557
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,846
<i>It's all
about lion king.</i>

558
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,214
We have nala right here,

559
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:25,783
Baby simba,
timon and pumbaa.

560
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:28,152
This is one of
my favorite blankets
of all time.

561
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:30,154
<i>What about
the sesame street
blanket ?</i>

562
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,223
No. My second favorite
is the garfield,

563
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,491
<i>And then sesame street.</i>

564
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:36,425
Oh, man.
All right, fans.

565
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:41,597
Good evening,
and welcome to the 2010 draft

566
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,700
At madison square garden
in new york city.

567
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:47,636
The first round,
we weren't expecting
really much of anything.

568
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,872
Tonight marks
the realization of a dream

569
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,375
For the best young players
in the world.

570
00:27:52,377 --> 00:27:54,110
We were just
all real nervous,

571
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:56,646
Just 'cause there
were so many odds
to overcome for him.

572
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:59,916
And with the first pick,
the washington wizards

573
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:03,653
Select john wall from
the university of kentucky.

574
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,958
I was hopeful,
but to be completely honest,

575
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,725
I was like, "let's just wait
and see what happens."

576
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:13,895
The thing that I'm always
interested in is race

577
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:17,665
And the way discrimination,
you know, rears its ugly head.

578
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:21,536
I was really interested
in seeing if a team
would take the plunge

579
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,504
And take this
asian-american player.

580
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,539
You know, it was funny.

581
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:29,508
Like, the team that I had
the highest chance

582
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,577
To get drafted by
was the knicks,

583
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:34,246
'cause I crushed
that workout.

584
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:38,951
With the 39th pick
in the 2010 nba draft...

585
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:41,454
I was like, "if I don't
get drafted here,

586
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,056
I probably
won't get drafted."

587
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:44,825
The new york knicks select...

588
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,561
I'm thinking like,
"oh, if I get drafted,
what's gonna happen ?

589
00:28:47,563 --> 00:28:49,663
"I'm just gonna run
around, like,
hugging everyone.

590
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:50,998
I'm gonna fly
to new york tomorrow."

591
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,369
Landry fields
from stanford university.

592
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:01,740
<i>10 minutes
after the draft ended,</i>

593
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,541
<i>Donny nelson,
the general manager</i>

594
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:06,177
<i>Of the dallas mavericks,
personally called jeremy</i>

595
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,347
<i>And asked him to play
on his summer league team.</i>

596
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:13,418
I think everyone
who goes undrafted,
you know,

597
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,388
Feels like they
have to prove themselves,
because they do.

598
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,821
And so, you know,
this is a chance

599
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,390
Where you get to play
against people

600
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,291
Who are drafted
every single night,

601
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,861
And you get to compete
with them in practice.

602
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,031
And this is
the best opportunity
to, you know,

603
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,332
Prove to
all the other teams

604
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,800
That you deserved
to be drafted

605
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,869
And you deserved
to have that contract.

606
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,604
Lin, surprise attack.

607
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,906
Oh, this is gonna
be interesting.

608
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,876
Sanders there,
lin protected it home !

609
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,045
Wow ! Nice play.

610
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,281
I hoped that jeremy
would make it,

611
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,083
Because I had confidence
in his ability,

612
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,551
But I was skeptical

613
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,220
In terms of him getting
a real shot anywhere.

614
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,220
Jeremy Lin !

615
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,922
And then I watched him play

616
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:56,858
In the summer league
against john wall.

617
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,694
I think we got
a primetime match-up.

618
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,196
John wall, the number one
overall selection.

619
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:05,200
Wall, creative !
On the reverse.

620
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:06,601
How fast was that ?

621
00:30:07,804 --> 00:30:10,503
I talked to him the day before

622
00:30:10,505 --> 00:30:12,272
He was gonna play
against john wall,

623
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,874
And I told him,
"it's your one shot.

624
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:18,378
There's no doubt that you
can play against the guy."

625
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,947
Lin.
Lin gettin' up there !

626
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,249
He's gonna be
an nba crowd favorite.

627
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:25,719
Gotta work on the d.

628
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,656
Lin went
right around him
on his strong side.

629
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:30,691
The fact that he could do that

630
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:35,830
Against the number-one player
in the nba draft was tremendous.

631
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,467
Assessing,
constructive criticism.

632
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,502
No way.
Man !

633
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:44,803
If you explode on him,
you'll have something.

634
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:46,805
You're gonna
get your opportunity.

635
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,241
As he splits, spins...

636
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,477
Oh, no, ref !
Don't you do that !

637
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,945
They're on their feet !

638
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:56,081
Oh, my god.
This is about to be
a melee here.

639
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,382
Hold 'em back,
hold 'em back !

640
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,551
Oh, lookit, the crowd
is going crazy !

641
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:02,886
He's opened some eyes,

642
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:04,955
And if lin doesn't stick
with the mavs,

643
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:07,157
There are teams out there
that are looking at him saying,

644
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,959
"boy, he beats
their system very nicely."

645
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:10,927
Whether he's in the league
this year or not...

646
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,262
He'll have some options.

647
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:14,598
Oh, he will
have some options.

648
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,399
I'm just trying to play,

649
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,901
And if someone's interested,
you know,

650
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,571
I'd love to talk
about an opportunity.

651
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,544
My son and he
both were point guards,

652
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:28,246
And they were
on different aau teams,

653
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:29,947
And so I remember
watching them play

654
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,483
These aau games
in these local gyms.

655
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:37,586
But I just happened to buy
the team at that time
with my partners.

656
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,121
One of the first things
I told our gm was,

657
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,924
"look, I know this kid.
My son knows this kid.

658
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,593
He's really talented.
We ought to give him a shot."

659
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:46,529
I think they thought
we were a little crazy,

660
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:49,165
But we did, and, you know,
when you're the owner,

661
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:50,900
You get to do things
like that.

662
00:31:52,236 --> 00:31:54,868
The warriors' iq
and basketball iq

663
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,203
Just went up a few points.

664
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,239
They signed harvard guard
Jeremy Lin.

665
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:00,674
I called jeremy
to tell him.

666
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,142
He didn't believe me.

667
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:04,545
He was like,
"stop playing, man.
Are you serious ?"

668
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,747
I said,
"man, it's for real.

669
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:08,482
"go down to the practice
facility tomorrow

670
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:10,785
And sign the contract.
It's good."

671
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:15,490
And he was like,
"man ! I'll call you back."

672
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:18,693
I was like, "aah !"
you know.

673
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,428
I picked
my little brother up,

674
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,564
I'm like, "I'm signing
with golden state !"

675
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,898
And I ran
into the next room,

676
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,600
I picked
my other brother up.

677
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:27,335
"I'm signing
with golden state !"

678
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,402
I can't even
really describe it,

679
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:33,806
'cause we, like, grew up,
like, fantasizing
about the nba,

680
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:36,976
And, like, the fact
that we grew up rooting
for the warriors

681
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,811
Made it even
that much crazier.

682
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,780
Lin has a chance
to make history

683
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:43,950
As the first asian-american
nba player in the modern era.

684
00:32:43,952 --> 00:32:47,084
When he got picked up
by warriors,

685
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,486
That moment,
we think,

686
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:51,422
"this is what
I want him to do."

687
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:53,858
My dream was to play
in the nba,

688
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,360
And now I get to do it
for the warriors,

689
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:57,728
The team
that I grew up watching.

690
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,930
It's more
than a dream come true.

691
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,202
We know what that's about.

692
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:09,741
Jeremy Lin.
Palo alto high school's own.

693
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:13,745
Warrior rookie
out of harvard.

694
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:15,113
It got pretty loud,

695
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,848
And people were standing up
and clapping,

696
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,417
And I just remember
looking around.

697
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:20,850
Grew up a warrior fan,

698
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:22,619
Signed
by his hometown team.

699
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:23,753
It's a great story.

700
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:25,288
It really is.

701
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,824
It was so emotional for me
to finally get there,

702
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:29,492
For me to finally be there,

703
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:33,930
And I couldn't envision myself
there even a year ago.

704
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:38,933
When I saw
him guarding kobe,
I was like, "wow."

705
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:42,703
We've been watching this guy
ever since we were little.

706
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:45,206
He's actually...
He's there.

707
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:50,912
Missing,
lee with the rebound.

708
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,080
I love what lin did.
Didn't foul him.

709
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:55,651
Ohh !

710
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:58,520
Ready to return
for the grizzlies.
Williams.

711
00:33:58,522 --> 00:34:00,155
Lin's got an open look,

712
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:02,224
And then threw it
to battier inexplicably.

713
00:34:02,226 --> 00:34:05,694
Welcome to the nba.

714
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,763
I hate when everyone's
looking at me.

715
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,899
I hate the spotlight.

716
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:12,565
How am I gonna be myself

717
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:13,934
When every time
I touch the ball,

718
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,468
Everyone's expecting me
to do

719
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,103
Some crazy, miraculous play ?

720
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,638
He scores !

721
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,839
People could see it
on my face.

722
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,308
Like, I was
out there playing,

723
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,776
But I wasn't playing
my brand of basketball.

724
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:25,512
I was scared, nervous,

725
00:34:25,514 --> 00:34:26,880
And just, like,
a lot of questions

726
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,114
And a lot of stress

727
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,014
And a lot of uncertainty
floating around.

728
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:33,985
The ingredient that's missing

729
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:36,688
Is the fact there was
a player named monta ellis

730
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,091
And steph curry
ahead of him.

731
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:44,128
You know, coaches need to win,
at the nba level,

732
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,665
And so keith smart,
who was our coach at the time,

733
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,100
Really didn't
play him a lot,

734
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:50,069
And this is
how these things happen.

735
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,404
At first, I was like,

736
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,873
"he knows I can play,
he knows I can play."

737
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,375
And then
I wasn't playing at all,

738
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,943
And then I was, like,
reading all these articles like,

739
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,345
"oh, he's just here
to sell jerseys

740
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,580
And increase revenue."

741
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:04,715
I was like,
"maybe that's all it is.

742
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:06,750
Maybe that's all I'm good for,"
you know.

743
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:09,920
I think we have
to be honest with ourselves.

744
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,922
There was definitely
a marketing element to it.

745
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:13,490
I mean,
he's a hometown guy.

746
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:17,928
The area has a significant
asian-american population.

747
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,229
And the way it played out,

748
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,229
You know, people
went bonkers for that.

749
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:30,505
A lot of what america perceives
as asian is very foreign.

750
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:33,074
Yao ming was kind of a
quintessential example of that.

751
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:35,744
He's from china,
he's from the east,

752
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,212
And he's coming
to our shores.

753
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:39,148
Whereas,
jeremy is like homegrown.

754
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,285
He's a homegrown asian-american
kid from the suburbs.

755
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:46,088
He grew up with hoop dreams
just like the rest of us.

756
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,591
Seeing a kid like jeremy
on the court

757
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:52,261
In a warriors uniform,

758
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:54,530
You know,
that's a huge impact.

759
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:57,431
You know, he was
happy to be playing
for his hometown team,

760
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:03,237
But we weren't satisfied
with just being in the nba.

761
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,040
Fans want Jeremy Lin
to go all the way to the rim,

762
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,342
And he has it taken away.

763
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,278
<i>The warriors' management</i>

764
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,313
<i>Sent jeremy
down to the d-league,</i>

765
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:18,817
<i>The nba's version
of a minor league farm system.</i>

766
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:21,186
<i>He was faced
with a harsh reality.</i>

767
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,825
The d-league is one
of the toughest things

768
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:30,129
When it comes
to a basketball career.

769
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,165
The d-league,
you know, it's a showcase.

770
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,033
People don't care
how many wins you have.

771
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,903
All they care about
is your stats.

772
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,805
It's all about you,
and you have teammates,

773
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,306
But they're not really
on your team.

774
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,241
You know, they'll take
your job if they can.

775
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,509
You cut off ?

776
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:44,677
You the point guard ?
Yeah.

777
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,546
You pass it to me...
Okay.

778
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:49,080
And then just
wait out there.

779
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,282
What I told him when he went
to the d-league was simple.

780
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:52,616
Go kill it.

781
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:55,653
Go and crush the d-league,
and let's get called up.

782
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:58,522
Because it's a battle,
you know.

783
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:01,392
It's a battle right here.

784
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:05,494
I was like,
"man, like,
if I play bad,

785
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:06,929
This may be it."

786
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,464
Jeremy Lin drives
against squeaky,

787
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,300
Tries to get to the rack,
throws it away !

788
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:15,270
I couldn't
really sleep, 'cause
I was so stressed.

789
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:16,705
I called my brother.

790
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,140
I was like, "I'm
trippin' right now,

791
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,409
Like, I don't know
what's going on."

792
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:22,612
I think, for him,
it was just like the journey

793
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:23,947
Was kind of wearing
on him.

794
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,415
'cause, like,
at every step of the way,

795
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,916
You have to, like,
overcome all these odds,

796
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:28,485
And, like, I think
at a certain point,

797
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:31,121
It felt insurmountable
for him.

798
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,423
So he was
not in a good place.

799
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,091
Lin needs to settle down.

800
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:36,826
Yeah,
he's running out of gas.

801
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:39,127
<i>Jeremy desperately
wanted to prove</i>

802
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,863
<i>That he belonged,
but in his rookie year,</i>

803
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:44,699
<i>He was sent to the d-league
three times.</i>

804
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:49,170
I think getting
sent back and forth

805
00:37:49,172 --> 00:37:52,140
And the constant
yo-yo effect

806
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,541
Of being taken up
by the warriors,

807
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:55,042
Sent back down,

808
00:37:55,044 --> 00:38:00,179
The cumulative effect of it
weighed heavily on him.

809
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,647
You know, I've always
had that desire,

810
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,249
And I've always
had that within me

811
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,284
Where I want to prove
that I could play in the nba.

812
00:38:05,286 --> 00:38:07,953
But, you know, I'm here
right now for a reason,

813
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:10,556
And, you know, god works
in very different ways.

814
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:16,129
Stay up ! Stay up !
Come here !

815
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:17,864
Eric musselYou know,
I thought with each game,

816
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:19,432
His confidence grew,
and you could see it

817
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:21,868
Almost with each possession
up the floor.

818
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,070
And after
his 20-game stint,

819
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:27,073
I think he came out
of that d-league experience

820
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:30,243
Really believing that he could
have an impact in the nba.

821
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:33,378
It was tough, because
we knew he could play.

822
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,480
It was just frustrating
because so many people

823
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:40,084
Were so ready
to just bury him
and give up on him.

824
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:41,219
It's hard for me,

825
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:45,823
Because I really
love basketball.

826
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,892
Like, I love my dream.

827
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:49,458
My dream is to play
in the nba,

828
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,429
And I wanted it so bad
that I couldn't imagine

829
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,400
Finally getting it,
and then losing it right away.

830
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:10,314
Does anyone in here think
lebron is not as good
as kobe right now ?

831
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:13,450
I think lebron
is definitely
not better,

832
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,319
Just bigger.

833
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,654
Well, it's kind
of hard to say.

834
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,656
You'd know better
than us, so...

835
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,225
No, I don't know.

836
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:23,592
I just had
closer seats.

837
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,467
Older kids ?

838
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:34,970
Hey, you guys
are in here. In here.

839
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,605
Nice, perfect.

840
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:40,041
And then left, left,
or a right, right. Perfect.

841
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,474
Yeah, I like that.

842
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:43,643
This is a good group
right here !

843
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:45,478
Hey ! Don't move, don't move,
don't move, don't move !

844
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,779
Stay out there.

845
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:50,016
All these asian kids
are, like, intimidated by me.

846
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,285
I like talk to them,
they're like, "uh..."

847
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:54,687
I'm like, "dude,
I'm not, like, frankenstein."

848
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,389
If they're really tall,
you're gonna get stuck,

849
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:57,725
And then you'll get called
for a travel.

850
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,293
Right here.

851
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:00,928
Ricky has
something to say.

852
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:03,664
No problem.
Thanks for coming.

853
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:06,667
I remember in the d-league,
I kept a little diary.

854
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,702
I know that's a little girlie
to some of you guys,

855
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,170
But I like to write down
some of my thoughts

856
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:11,538
Every once in a while

857
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,107
So I can look back
and remember.

858
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:16,041
And I remember
on December 29th,

859
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:19,011
I wrote about
how I actually wish

860
00:40:19,013 --> 00:40:20,746
I had never signed
with the warriors.

861
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:26,051
I wish I could quit basketball,
because I wasn't having fun.

862
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:28,020
And what got me
through those times--

863
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:30,022
Obviously,
I don't feel that way now.

864
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,322
But what got me
through that time

865
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:34,991
Was the number one reason

866
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:37,727
Why all the leaders
are here today.

867
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,796
And that's because we want
to let you guys know

868
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:44,301
That god loves me and that he
has a perfect plan for me,

869
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:46,102
And that his plan
will take you

870
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:47,804
Through
a lot of ups and downs,

871
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:49,473
But if I stay faithful
to him,

872
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:51,175
In the end,
I know that he's gonna work

873
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:53,077
Everything for my good.

874
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,578
Now when I play basketball,

875
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,614
I don't play
for anybody else anymore.

876
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:58,382
I only play for god.

877
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:00,117
And that's the type of purpose
that he gave me,

878
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,419
And once he gave me
that purpose,

879
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:03,154
Then that's
when I had my peace.

880
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:06,223
And once I got my peace,
that's when I got my joy.

881
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,829
<i>Sometimes
a change of scenery</i>

882
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:15,564
<i>Can shift
a perspective on life.</i>

883
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:18,767
My roots is important
for me to know,

884
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,302
Because it's who I am.

885
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:22,771
It's a huge part
of my identity.

886
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,971
I understand
where my parents came from,

887
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:26,640
How they grew up
in the culture.

888
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:32,813
Oh ! Oh !
You dropped it !

889
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:34,314
You dropped it !

890
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,316
So that's
why I come back every summer

891
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:37,751
Just to get a good feel
for that.

892
00:41:37,753 --> 00:41:42,590
I'm very proud to be,
you know, who I am.

893
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,571
Back on the farm.

894
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,578
Oh, I'm gonna back up
a little bit now.

895
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:33,405
Seeing
where my dad grew up,

896
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:35,240
So 40 years makes
a huge difference,

897
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:38,376
You know, from him
growing up here

898
00:42:38,378 --> 00:42:41,613
To how we grew up
in the u.S.

899
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:43,848
It's definitely
humble beginnings.

900
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,611
Hey, man,
you see this shrimp ?

901
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,685
Oh, hey, hey.
Watch yourself.

902
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:28,757
My grandparents are
born and raised in china.

903
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,625
My parents are born
and raised in taiwan,

904
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:32,694
And I was born
and raised in the u.S.,

905
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,329
And so there's a lot
of history

906
00:43:34,331 --> 00:43:37,232
And a lot of culture
behind who I am.

907
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,251
What are you
about to do right now ?

908
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,318
I'm about to go out here

909
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,286
And judge
this dunk contest.

910
00:44:36,288 --> 00:44:37,921
This is the finale,
the championship game,

911
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:39,356
For the nike
summer league,

912
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,158
So I'm about to get
into this right now.

913
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:46,863
They said
I could speak chinese.

914
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:48,832
Tricked 'em !

915
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,907
Jeremy Lin !

916
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:04,245
Basketball culture
here is crazy.

917
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:06,381
The fans,
they love basketball.

918
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:07,615
There's people playing
basketball

919
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:09,919
All the time
on all the courts.

920
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:12,121
The level of competition
is definitely growing.

921
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,689
Got a chance
to see some games.

922
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,926
So, you know, it's definitely
awesome coming back

923
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:19,595
And seeing how much the sport
has grown in the country.

924
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:22,565
Ready, set, go !

925
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:28,435
I just think coming here,

926
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:32,906
I'm seeing a lot of really
diligent, hard workers.

927
00:45:32,908 --> 00:45:35,309
I feel like everybody
works very hard,

928
00:45:35,311 --> 00:45:36,677
And they do everything
they can

929
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,178
To support themselves
and their families,

930
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,881
And for me,
that way is basketball.

931
00:45:40,883 --> 00:45:42,683
And I think hard work
is definitely ingrained

932
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:46,284
In taiwanese culture,
in chinese culture.

933
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,820
And so, for me,
that's something

934
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:51,590
I try to pick up on
and really embrace.

935
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,535
Yo, man,
we gotta go.

936
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:04,437
Jeremy ?

937
00:46:12,713 --> 00:46:14,780
At 12:01 Friday morning,

938
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,049
The nba locked out
its players

939
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:20,117
After failing to reach a new
collective bargaining agreement.

940
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,621
The lockout has
a very large impact
on a lot of people.

941
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:25,322
The current offer
that is on the table

942
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,590
Is not one
that we can accept.

943
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:27,658
It could be
a couple weeks,

944
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,792
Could be
a couple months.

945
00:46:28,794 --> 00:46:30,127
We're already hearing

946
00:46:30,129 --> 00:46:31,996
This is gonna be
a very long lockout.

947
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:36,531
We're about to go into
the nuclear winter of the nba.

948
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:40,602
The collective bargaining
process

949
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:42,337
Has completely broken down.

950
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:43,538
We're all in this together.

951
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,906
And if these players
don't give them

952
00:46:44,908 --> 00:46:46,808
What they want,
they're not
going to play.

953
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,243
I don't think it's resolved.

954
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:49,911
I think it's bad advice.

955
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:52,649
I actually secretly

956
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:54,150
Wanted the lockout
to continue,

957
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:57,520
Because it gave me
extra time to get better.

958
00:46:57,522 --> 00:46:59,555
We are willing
to continue discussions

959
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:01,724
On a potential compromise.

960
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:03,026
There are some owners

961
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,694
Who are willing
to forego the season.

962
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,062
We want to play basketball.

963
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:07,530
That's what we do,

964
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,666
And right now,
we don't have an opportunity

965
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:10,931
To go out and do
what we do best.

966
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:13,067
If we need to lose
an entire season,

967
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:14,969
We should go ahead
and do it.

968
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:17,571
I got all my sweaty t-shirts
in here, man.

969
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:19,940
That's disgusting.

970
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:23,210
So I knew
the longer the lockout went,

971
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:25,613
The better player
I would become.

972
00:47:29,649 --> 00:47:30,849
We're warming up.

973
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:33,552
We're just warming up.

974
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:36,422
Boom. That's it.
That one was perfect.

975
00:47:36,424 --> 00:47:38,490
Feel good ?
Feels good.

976
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:40,259
As he gets better
as a shooter,

977
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:43,796
Over time it's gonna be like
money, money, money.

978
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:46,332
He's only gonna get better,

979
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:49,436
And he's awfully good now,
don't you think ?

980
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:53,673
That's the other part,
getting into this cranium

981
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:56,976
To get him to believe
like I believe in him.

982
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:59,279
Merry christmas, basketball fans.

983
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:00,680
The nba is coming back.

984
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:02,046
Fans are getting
what they want.

985
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,482
Owners and players reached
a tentative agreement

986
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:07,151
To end
the 149-day lockout.

987
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,531
Going into my second year,

988
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:26,302
I'm not really, like,

989
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,637
Thinking about
anything I'm afraid of.

990
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,941
You know, I feel like
through my first year,

991
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:33,342
At least in my own eyes,

992
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:36,313
Like, I proved to myself
that I can play at this level.

993
00:48:36,315 --> 00:48:39,983
And I think mentally,
I'm at a much better place

994
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:42,452
Where I'm just going in,
and I'm just gonna be myself

995
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:44,054
And play my own game,

996
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:46,490
And from that standpoint,
I'm really not afraid

997
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:47,724
Of anything going
into training camp.

998
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:49,760
I feel like I have
nothing to lose.

999
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:00,969
We didn't have a center
that we felt good about,

1000
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:05,974
And we needed to create
enough salary cap space

1001
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,175
To go make an offer,

1002
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,578
And in order to do so,
we had to cut somebody.

1003
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,712
It was one
of the hardest decisions

1004
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:14,547
That we could
have had to make.

1005
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:17,316
They called me up
midway through

1006
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:18,818
In the middle of a drill.

1007
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,386
They're like, "hey,
you got to go upstairs."

1008
00:49:20,388 --> 00:49:21,788
I went in there,
and the general manager

1009
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,389
And assistant general manager
were like,

1010
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:24,724
"we gotta let you go.

1011
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:26,559
We're trying
to get deandre jordan."

1012
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:31,698
He had worked
tremendously hard pre-season,

1013
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,735
So I was like,
"man, this is a blow.

1014
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:37,204
I mean, this is a kick
in the stomach right here."

1015
00:49:38,673 --> 00:49:39,973
They were like,

1016
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:41,475
"oh, we wish you
the best of luck."

1017
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:44,478
I was like, "thanks."

1018
00:49:48,181 --> 00:49:49,981
<i>Within 48 hours,</i>

1019
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:52,651
<i>He was picked up
by the houston rockets.</i>

1020
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:55,554
Yeah, we were hoping

1021
00:49:55,556 --> 00:49:57,088
That no one else
picked him up.

1022
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,124
We were interested in him
for quite a long time.

1023
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:01,760
Had been to his games
at harvard.

1024
00:50:01,762 --> 00:50:04,460
At the time,
we just added him and said,

1025
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:08,131
"hey, let's bring him in
and see what happens."

1026
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:11,601
I went to houston.

1027
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:13,069
There were
six point guards there.

1028
00:50:13,071 --> 00:50:16,239
I couldn't even
get reps in practice.

1029
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:17,907
I don't understand.

1030
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:19,843
I was backup point guard
at golden state,

1031
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:21,111
And now they're gonna
bring me here,

1032
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:22,546
And I'm sixth string ?

1033
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:24,648
Jeremy Lin on the drive.

1034
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:28,152
Take it to the rim,
lays it up.

1035
00:50:28,154 --> 00:50:31,222
Good shot with the spurs'
bigs right in his face.

1036
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:33,023
When the rockets picked him up,

1037
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:36,093
That was probably the bottom
of the barrel for him.

1038
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:37,759
Sunday night,
we were in fellowship,

1039
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:43,232
And I remember jeremy said,
"hey, I gotta go.

1040
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:45,367
I gotta catch
my flight to houston."

1041
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:47,102
He was standing
at the door,

1042
00:50:47,104 --> 00:50:52,040
And he had tears in his eyes,
because, um...

1043
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:53,842
Because the pressure
was really getting to him.

1044
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:56,877
He just didn't know what
his future was gonna hold.

1045
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:59,145
And I remember
he turned to me and he says,

1046
00:50:59,147 --> 00:51:01,214
"I don't know
if I can keep doing this."

1047
00:51:02,717 --> 00:51:05,318
<i>After only 12 days
with the rockets,</i>

1048
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,454
<i>He was cut again.</i>

1049
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:09,789
<i>It was christmas day.</i>

1050
00:51:12,294 --> 00:51:15,730
So obviously a lot has been happening

1051
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:17,331
The last couple
of weeks.

1052
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,399
What's going
through your mind,

1053
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:20,568
And how
you feeling today ?

1054
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,104
Christmas morning,
I was waived.

1055
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:26,607
Flew back home
on christmas night,

1056
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,375
And within two weeks,
I had been waived twice

1057
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:34,146
By two teams who said
they still wanted me.

1058
00:51:34,148 --> 00:51:36,115
10 a.M. This morning,

1059
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:38,250
Um, found out the knicks
had picked me up.

1060
00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:40,853
And that's gonna be
my first game with the knicks.

1061
00:51:40,855 --> 00:51:42,955
It's gonna be
at oracle arena.

1062
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:47,858
You know, I'm literally going
into this game tomorrow night,

1063
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,294
I have no idea
who my teammates are.

1064
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:52,062
I've never played
with them one time.

1065
00:51:52,064 --> 00:51:53,797
I have no idea
what plays we run.

1066
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:55,799
I don't know
a single play,

1067
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:57,801
And, you know, I haven't
even talked to the coach yet,

1068
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:00,003
So it's gonna be
interesting.

1069
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:01,939
I see Jeremy Lin coming in.

1070
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:03,206
They just
signed him today.

1071
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:06,811
Went through a walk-through,
at shoot-around today.

1072
00:52:06,813 --> 00:52:09,747
Lin, who played
with golden state
last year sparingly,

1073
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:11,182
Played in the d-league,

1074
00:52:11,184 --> 00:52:12,884
Gets a nice ovation.

1075
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:14,585
It's
a great opportunity for me

1076
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:15,853
To be able to just play,

1077
00:52:15,855 --> 00:52:17,188
And I think,
for me right now,

1078
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,023
The one thing
I really care about

1079
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:23,092
Is just an opportunity
to play.

1080
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:24,493
I'm gonna
give my best effort,

1081
00:52:24,495 --> 00:52:26,429
And, you know, if I go down,

1082
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:28,664
I'm gonna make sure
I go down doing it my way,

1083
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:30,967
Which is god's way.

1084
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:33,402
So it's the night before,

1085
00:52:33,404 --> 00:52:35,237
And, you know,
I gotta get my bags ready,

1086
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,807
And after the game tomorrow,
we head to l.A.,

1087
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:40,641
Sacramento, and then
I'm off to new york for good.

1088
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:58,660
Five games go by,
and I'm not playing at all.

1089
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:02,764
Nothing was
really making sense to me.

1090
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,165
If you bring me in,

1091
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:06,067
And you don't let me
play in practice,

1092
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:08,703
Let alone the games,
then why am I here ?

1093
00:53:08,705 --> 00:53:11,706
I felt like, you know,
I could help you,

1094
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,139
And I was watching us lose.

1095
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:16,209
The knicks have lost
four straight games.

1096
00:53:16,211 --> 00:53:18,177
And
the losing streak continues.

1097
00:53:18,179 --> 00:53:21,014
Knicks have now lost
six in a row.

1098
00:53:21,016 --> 00:53:23,916
There's a chemistry problem
there on the floor.

1099
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:27,987
They need a point guard
to distribute the ball.

1100
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:29,989
<i>Jeremy's original
two-year contract</i>

1101
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:31,522
<i>Was about to expire,</i>

1102
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:33,524
<i>Which meant that,
if the knicks let him go,</i>

1103
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:37,161
<i>He'd be dropped with no pay,
and, this time, for good.</i>

1104
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:40,931
During practice,
jeremy was standing
right beside me

1105
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,233
On the side
of the court

1106
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:45,302
And not really get in
even in practice.

1107
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:49,775
He was just there
in case one of
these guys got hurt.

1108
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:51,843
I pretty much saw
the writing on the wall.

1109
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,812
I was like,
"I'm pretty much done,"

1110
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,547
And, like, I was resigned
to the fact

1111
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,449
That I was
gonna get let go.

1112
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,751
Standing on the side
of the court,
he comes up to me,

1113
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:01,820
And he goes,
"hey, coach, I've
got a question."

1114
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,188
I go, "what is it,
jeremy ?"

1115
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,355
"I'm taking
a taxi everywhere.

1116
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:07,457
Should I ship
my car out here ?"

1117
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:13,029
And he was like,
"uh, you know, probably not."

1118
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:16,866
I was like, "oh, hell,
I'm gonna get waived."

1119
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:19,702
And so I went
and talked to glen.

1120
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:21,237
I said, "glen,
what do you think ?"

1121
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:22,470
And he goes,
"well, we haven't
really seen him.

1122
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:23,938
We don't know."

1123
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,140
And I said,
"you know what ?
Let me try to see

1124
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:27,875
"if we can get him
in a couple games

1125
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:30,978
Before Tuesday and just
see what happens."

1126
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,916
They're like, "look,
you're gonna play tonight.

1127
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:38,519
"I want you to go out there.

1128
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:41,056
I don't want you
to do too much."

1129
00:54:41,058 --> 00:54:44,526
I was like,
"okay, I won't."

1130
00:54:47,764 --> 00:54:49,264
8 points for garnett.

1131
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:52,000
Lin coughs it up,
bradley to the rim.

1132
00:54:52,002 --> 00:54:53,669
I didn't do too much.

1133
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:56,004
I pretty much did nothing,
and I played horrible.

1134
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:57,637
You know, I missed shots,

1135
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,506
I had turnovers,
I had bad fouls.

1136
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:02,542
Lin reached in.

1137
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:03,877
I thought, at most,

1138
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:05,545
I had one more chance
the next game.

1139
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:09,082
I was like, "okay, I just
screwed the boston game.

1140
00:55:09,084 --> 00:55:11,918
"I probably will get cut,

1141
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,486
But they may give me
one more chance tomorrow."

1142
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:17,689
I think at the time,

1143
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:20,391
Jeremy was actually staying
with his brother in new york,

1144
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,227
And he was talking
to me on the plane.

1145
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:23,528
He's like,
"you know, my brother,

1146
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,063
"he's got some people over,

1147
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:26,698
"um, so, you know,
is it cool

1148
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,067
If I crash
at your place instead ?"

1149
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:31,804
You know, I was like,
"yeah, sure, man, you can come."

1150
00:55:31,806 --> 00:55:33,539
I was giving him
forewarning, though,

1151
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,907
That my couch wasn't huge.

1152
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:36,442
It was actually
a rental couch at the time.

1153
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:39,478
It might have been
maybe six feet long.

1154
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,048
We get in at, like,
2:00 in the morning.

1155
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,750
I go over to landry's place.

1156
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:47,052
He's like,
"this is my couch,"

1157
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:48,685
And his couch
is like this big.

1158
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:49,987
I'm like, "dude."

1159
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:51,855
I have my head
hanging off of one end

1160
00:55:51,857 --> 00:55:53,790
And my legs
hanging off the other.

1161
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:56,226
I'm like, "oh, my gosh, how am I
gonna get a good night's rest ?"

1162
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,628
Like, "I might play tomorrow.

1163
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,129
This might be
my last chance."

1164
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,434
I remember thinking to myself,

1165
00:56:04,436 --> 00:56:06,635
One, I hope he gets in,

1166
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:09,404
Because he really didn't do
enough in the boston game

1167
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:12,974
To warrant
getting big minutes.

1168
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:16,878
And, two, if he gets in,
he's gotta play well,

1169
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,281
Or they're gonna release him
after the game.

1170
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:21,783
It's funny.

1171
00:56:21,785 --> 00:56:23,185
This season was
the only season

1172
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:25,021
In the last,
like, 11, 12 years

1173
00:56:25,023 --> 00:56:26,522
Since the last lockout

1174
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:29,125
Where people have played
back-to-back-to-back games.

1175
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:32,328
And new york only
had one stretch

1176
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,130
Of back-to-back-to-back
games.

1177
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:36,232
And if we had
more days to rest,

1178
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:39,302
I'm not sure if I would have
been able to play in that game.

1179
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:44,138
I prayed that day,

1180
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,241
And my prayer is,

1181
00:56:47,243 --> 00:56:51,879
"god, if this is your will
for him to play nba,

1182
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:53,647
You need to show it."

1183
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,654
There's morrow.
Morrow knocks it down.

1184
00:57:02,656 --> 00:57:04,556
Williams sets himself,

1185
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:06,291
Puts up the 3,
and knocks that one down.

1186
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:09,962
The knicks find themselves
down by 10 already.

1187
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:13,098
New york foul
is on shumpert, his second.

1188
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,134
Again, mike,
look who's coming in.

1189
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:18,705
Jeremy Lin,
and you hear
a pretty big ovation.

1190
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:39,390
He didn't look tentative,

1191
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:41,592
He didn't look
overly concerned.

1192
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:44,095
He looked like,
"dude, I'm about to go do it.

1193
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,264
"if they cut me,
they cut me.

1194
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:49,500
"if I don't never play
another nba game, so be it.

1195
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:52,534
I'm going to play
like Jeremy Lin can play."

1196
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,673
Jeremy Lin
drives and finishes.

1197
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,942
Nice play from lin.

1198
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,477
There's a strip
of it.

1199
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,679
Lin throws it ahead
to toney douglas.

1200
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,148
Up for the layup !
Banks it in !

1201
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,984
Here comes shumpert
to lin.

1202
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,553
Lin flips it up
and puts it in.

1203
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:13,223
Jeremy Lin once again !

1204
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:16,493
He finished the half
with like 10, 4, and 4,

1205
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,962
Like, good numbers
for a half.

1206
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:20,430
That was such a higher high

1207
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:22,399
Than, like,
anything he's, like, done.

1208
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:24,766
So I was, like, ecstatic
at that point.

1209
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:27,769
The second half,
he just went...

1210
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:29,170
He just went nuts.

1211
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,738
Driving to the basket,
does it again.

1212
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,108
He's got a chance
for a 3-point play
as he got hit.

1213
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,544
Bumped by petro,
gets to the rim.

1214
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,246
Count it
and a foul !

1215
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,315
Jeremy Lin !

1216
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,515
He has
in one special night

1217
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:43,582
Become
a garden favorite.

1218
00:58:43,584 --> 00:58:45,751
Will it be remembered ?

1219
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:47,086
He was stringing together,

1220
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:48,554
Like, three crossover moves
in a row.

1221
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,389
Like, things
he's never done before.

1222
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:51,957
Splits the defense again !

1223
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,026
Gets to the rim !
Pops it in !

1224
00:58:54,028 --> 00:58:56,095
And a foul ! Wow !

1225
00:58:58,132 --> 00:58:59,933
And the crowd on their feet

1226
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:01,501
Paying homage
to this man.

1227
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,270
Clyde, even it looks
like his teammates

1228
00:59:03,272 --> 00:59:05,305
Don't believe
what they're seeing.

1229
00:59:05,307 --> 00:59:08,108
I was just so emotional.

1230
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,243
There's no way
they can cut me now.

1231
00:59:10,245 --> 00:59:13,347
I just had
the game of my life.

1232
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,349
Again,
the crossover, the basket.

1233
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,682
Puts it up,
pops it in !

1234
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:21,753
Jeremy Lin with 25 !

1235
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:24,522
And this crowd
is going crazy !

1236
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:26,825
Penetrating, manipulating,

1237
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,493
Devastating the nets !

1238
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:30,862
He's the hero
from harvard,

1239
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:32,397
As the knicks

1240
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:35,498
Get a much-needed victory
on the game of his life.

1241
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,768
And he is swarmed
by his ecstatic teammates

1242
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,804
And a jubilant crowd here
at madison square garden.

1243
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:43,506
I'm just thankful to god

1244
00:59:43,508 --> 00:59:45,174
For this opportunity
to be able to come out here

1245
00:59:45,176 --> 00:59:47,210
And play with this team
and this organization.

1246
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:53,350
Man, I was taking a shower,

1247
00:59:53,352 --> 00:59:55,319
And I was like...
I didn't even know.

1248
00:59:55,321 --> 00:59:58,455
I was like, "is this water,
like, from the shower,

1249
00:59:58,457 --> 01:00:00,524
Or am I actually crying,
like, tears of joy ?"

1250
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:04,428
Oh, I was just, like,
so high on emotion.

1251
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,030
I was so happy.
I was sitting in the shower,

1252
01:00:07,032 --> 01:00:09,231
Replaying all the times
in the d-league,

1253
01:00:09,233 --> 01:00:11,600
All these flashbacks
of these tough times

1254
01:00:11,602 --> 01:00:12,901
I had to go through.

1255
01:00:12,903 --> 01:00:14,436
And I remember
I got out,

1256
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:18,707
I saw my family,
and they were all smiling.

1257
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,008
I called my agent,

1258
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,444
And he was yelling at me
on the phone, you know, like,

1259
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:25,013
"I'm so proud of you.
I knew you could do it."

1260
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:29,182
That was kind of like
the much-needed breakthrough

1261
01:00:29,184 --> 01:00:30,583
That I was hoping for.

1262
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,486
Before Jeremy Lin's

1263
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:35,422
First big game
against new jersey,

1264
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,091
He really wasn't in the knicks'
plans at that point,

1265
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,659
And I'm told
they had begun

1266
01:00:39,661 --> 01:00:43,631
To look seriously
at replacements.

1267
01:00:43,633 --> 01:00:46,133
Clyde, Saturday night,
madison square garden

1268
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:48,869
Sounded as loud
as we've heard it all season.

1269
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:50,538
He was magnificent.

1270
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,840
You just hope
from a knicks standpoint

1271
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:53,941
That he can
run the offense

1272
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,876
As well as he ran it
on Saturday.

1273
01:00:55,878 --> 01:00:59,046
I just really wasn't
nervous for my first start.

1274
01:00:59,048 --> 01:01:01,246
And, you know,
usually, I would be,

1275
01:01:01,248 --> 01:01:04,583
But I don't know why I just felt
really comfortable,

1276
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:06,485
And it was just
a supernatural peace,

1277
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:09,054
And it's one
of those things that,

1278
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:10,656
You know,
I can't really explain.

1279
01:01:12,058 --> 01:01:13,926
<i>For jeremy's first nba start,</i>

1280
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:16,562
<i>Amar'e stoudemire
was out for personal reasons,</i>

1281
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:19,729
<i>And carmelo anthony suffered
an injury in the first half.</i>

1282
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:22,532
Carmelo anthony
comes up hobbling.

1283
01:01:22,534 --> 01:01:23,900
He's in a lot
of discomfort.

1284
01:01:23,902 --> 01:01:25,769
He can't move right now.

1285
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:28,205
<i>The knicks
desperately needed a leader,</i>

1286
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:30,373
<i>And jeremy
would answer the call.</i>

1287
01:01:31,976 --> 01:01:33,210
Lin gets around jefferson,

1288
01:01:33,212 --> 01:01:34,545
Looking,
and backs it in.

1289
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:36,814
He had a couple of those
the other night.

1290
01:01:36,816 --> 01:01:38,349
We were running pick and roll

1291
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:39,650
After pick and roll
after pick and roll.

1292
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:41,986
Lin inside to jeffries !

1293
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:43,788
I didn't know
how he would follow up

1294
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,224
That new jersey game,
'cause it was such a high,

1295
01:01:46,226 --> 01:01:48,926
But he just kept making
ridiculous layups,

1296
01:01:48,928 --> 01:01:50,328
He was hitting jumpers.

1297
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,927
They didn't know my tendencies,

1298
01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:53,662
They didn't know
my weak spots,

1299
01:01:53,664 --> 01:01:55,364
My strong spots,
my sweet spots.

1300
01:01:55,366 --> 01:01:56,832
Lin on the drive,

1301
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,334
Flips it up,
drops it in !

1302
01:01:58,336 --> 01:02:00,369
And a foul !
Reverse layup !

1303
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:01,837
They had never
seen me play.

1304
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,707
Pushing it,
ahead to shumpert, back to lin.

1305
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:08,744
Lin gets hit,
puts it in, and a foul !

1306
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:11,144
Lays it up,
puts it up,

1307
01:02:11,146 --> 01:02:12,412
Chandler
keeps it alive.

1308
01:02:12,414 --> 01:02:14,181
Lin has to put it up.

1309
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:18,252
A 3-pointer
as the shot clock expired !

1310
01:02:18,254 --> 01:02:20,120
I'm riding him
like friggin' secretariat.

1311
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:24,091
Jeremy Lin

1312
01:02:24,093 --> 01:02:26,694
With his second
consecutive career night.

1313
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:30,331
He is the new starting
point guard of the knicks.

1314
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:35,303
And the knicks win again.

1315
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:37,772
A standing ovation
for Jeremy Lin.

1316
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,647
You know, there's
so many little variables

1317
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:51,284
With every step of the way
being something I can't control.

1318
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:53,986
You know, houston
waives me a day late.

1319
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:55,621
If they waive me
a day earlier,

1320
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:58,224
I would have been
past the waiver wire.

1321
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:00,526
Shumpert gets
hurt that morning.

1322
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:01,926
The knicks pick me up,

1323
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:03,961
Because they had worked me out
the year before.

1324
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:07,598
You know, it happens to be
d'antoni who's coaching here

1325
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,600
Whose offense
is tailor-made for me.

1326
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:11,735
And all of a sudden,
things just go crazy.

1327
01:03:13,104 --> 01:03:15,673
He's averaging 26 1/2 points
a game the last two games.

1328
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:17,341
I don't think
that's gonna continue.

1329
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:19,277
Obviously,
that's not gonna continue.

1330
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:22,547
Then we hit the road
and go to washington,

1331
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,883
And it's like
john wall again, you know.

1332
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:27,485
Like, I played against john wall
in the summer league,

1333
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,021
And now
it's, like, a rematch.

1334
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,357
Now I'm playing
against him again.

1335
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,428
Lin on the drive, gets inside.

1336
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,965
Reverse layup.
Great play by Jeremy Lin.

1337
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:43,433
Here comes wall.
Look at wall.

1338
01:03:43,435 --> 01:03:44,634
Breaks the press,

1339
01:03:44,636 --> 01:03:47,070
And throws it down
with the left hand !

1340
01:03:47,072 --> 01:03:50,840
I was like, "dang,
he kinda dunked on my head."

1341
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:53,674
I was like, "I'm gonna try
to get him back."

1342
01:03:53,676 --> 01:03:56,344
Couple possessions later,
they messed up their coverage,

1343
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:57,778
I had a free lane,

1344
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,513
And I just tried
to take the rim down.

1345
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:01,816
Lin drives !

1346
01:04:01,818 --> 01:04:03,618
There's the dunk
you're talking about, clyde.

1347
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:06,420
Jeremy Lin
fires up the crowd.

1348
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:07,888
When I saw that opening,

1349
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,660
I just tried to dunk it
as hard as I could.

1350
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:14,630
I don't know.
There's just...

1351
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:19,167
There's been so much pain
and so many trying times,

1352
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,569
And now
that I get to play,

1353
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:22,437
I'm just letting it
all out, man.

1354
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:24,339
I'm just letting
it all out on the floor.

1355
01:04:24,341 --> 01:04:27,442
After the game,
I just look back,

1356
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:30,276
And I'm like,
"man, that was so fun."

1357
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:31,378
The great story

1358
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,712
That's brewing is
Jeremy Lin,

1359
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:34,581
And this week,
contracts are guaranteed

1360
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,749
For the rest
of the year.

1361
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:37,083
He's been balling out,
saying,

1362
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:38,952
"show that man
his money."

1363
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:41,121
The things that's
for real is his vision,

1364
01:04:41,123 --> 01:04:42,355
Which won't change,

1365
01:04:42,357 --> 01:04:43,857
His speed, which won't change,

1366
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,257
His knowledge of the game,
which won't change.

1367
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:47,759
I just don't see it changing.

1368
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:49,794
Now, again, please
don't quote me on that one.

1369
01:04:49,796 --> 01:04:51,162
Now he's on
the scouting report.

1370
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:52,797
Yeah, he is now.

1371
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,432
Let's see if he's in the
scouting report for the lakers

1372
01:04:54,434 --> 01:04:57,535
Oh, yeah, he is.
On Friday night at the garden.

1373
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:04,343
This is basically where
I lived the last two weeks

1374
01:05:04,345 --> 01:05:07,346
And so it's the couch
I slept on.

1375
01:05:07,348 --> 01:05:10,249
Uh, my brother
and sister-in-law,

1376
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:14,086
Uh, did a good job
of hosting me.

1377
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:15,154
Had a lot of fun.

1378
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,489
And now their little kid
might have to move out.

1379
01:05:20,726 --> 01:05:22,592
If I don't do laundry now,

1380
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:24,628
I won't do laundry
when I'm married. Fact.

1381
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,363
You guys are brats.

1382
01:05:26,365 --> 01:05:27,798
So ? We do other things.

1383
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:30,734
Like what ?

1384
01:05:30,736 --> 01:05:31,768
Like...

1385
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,537
What do you mean,
like what ?

1386
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:36,473
Like, what don't we do,
is the question.

1387
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:37,639
What do you do ?

1388
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,207
<i>What do you do ?</i>

1389
01:05:39,209 --> 01:05:40,408
I take a nap every day.

1390
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,676
Yeah, that I know.

1391
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:43,545
Who does that ?
Not many people can.

1392
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:45,113
Not many people can.

1393
01:05:45,115 --> 01:05:46,247
And you eat a lot,

1394
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:48,917
Nonstop all day long.
Yeah.

1395
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:50,785
Yesterday, the general manager
was like,

1396
01:05:50,787 --> 01:05:53,521
"hey, jeremy, by the way,
you're guaranteed now,

1397
01:05:53,523 --> 01:05:55,458
So get off the couch."

1398
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:58,627
I was like...

1399
01:05:58,629 --> 01:06:00,863
This guy has
a place to stay,

1400
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:03,065
But he doesn't
want to stay there.

1401
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:04,567
He want to crash
in here.

1402
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:06,368
They don't want
this to be on
the news, jeremy,

1403
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,904
sleeping on the couch
at his brother's.

1404
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:10,573
Why ?

1405
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,072
It's crazy.

1406
01:06:12,074 --> 01:06:13,941
It's just crazy to...

1407
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:16,410
I'm telling you,
social media,

1408
01:06:16,412 --> 01:06:18,779
Twitter, facebook,
my phone, it's just...

1409
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:22,750
I don't know if it could get
crazier than this.

1410
01:06:22,752 --> 01:06:25,519
Like, I really don't.

1411
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:26,653
Jeremy Lin ?

1412
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:27,821
Are you following
that story at all ?

1413
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:29,821
No idea.
I know who he is,

1414
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,223
But I don't really know what's
going on too much with that.

1415
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:32,624
Are you surprised
at the production

1416
01:06:32,626 --> 01:06:33,925
That lin's had
over the past week ?

1417
01:06:33,927 --> 01:06:35,761
I don't even know
what he's done.

1418
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:39,898
Like, I have no idea
what you guys are talking about.

1419
01:06:41,902 --> 01:06:44,035
I'm reading
all these quotes

1420
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:45,604
About what he's saying.

1421
01:06:45,606 --> 01:06:48,174
"kobe bryant has no idea
who Jeremy Lin is."

1422
01:06:48,176 --> 01:06:49,742
I'm like, "what ?"

1423
01:06:51,645 --> 01:06:53,045
I'm like,
"why would you do that ?

1424
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:54,447
"I didn't say
anything about you.

1425
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:57,383
I never talked bad
about you."

1426
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:59,318
So when I heard that,
I was like...

1427
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:01,721
"here we go."

1428
01:07:04,156 --> 01:07:05,923
Would you consider
guarding him

1429
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:07,958
If he's having
one of those games ?

1430
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:11,195
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves here.

1431
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:15,499
Let's go !

1432
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:17,067
There is a new man in town.

1433
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:19,203
"may the best man lin."

1434
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:23,005
Over-under, 23 points for lin
tonight, bomani.

1435
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,507
Against the lakers
with those trees
they've got inside ?

1436
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:27,676
It won't be
so linsane tonight.

1437
01:07:27,678 --> 01:07:30,746
Kobe or lin ?
Who scores more tonight ?

1438
01:07:30,748 --> 01:07:33,448
I'm going with my guy,
Jeremy Lin, my hero.

1439
01:07:34,685 --> 01:07:36,952
Because all he does
is lin, baby !

1440
01:07:36,954 --> 01:07:39,589
Jeremy Lin in just one week

1441
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:41,024
Has turned things around

1442
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:43,426
For his career
and for the new york knicks.

1443
01:07:43,428 --> 01:07:46,029
I love it !
It's awesome, man !

1444
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,464
This is like
the greatest thing that's
happened to new york ever.

1445
01:07:48,466 --> 01:07:49,632
It's one of those nights,

1446
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:50,867
And it's
one of those stories

1447
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:53,803
Where it really is
why we love sports.

1448
01:07:53,805 --> 01:07:56,037
I didn't know how
it was gonna turn out,

1449
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:57,371
But I was like,

1450
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,073
"I'm just gonna be really,
really aggressive."

1451
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:09,283
Everything was going well,
everything was going down.

1452
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:15,788
Lin puts it up,
puts it in !

1453
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,657
Terrific start !

1454
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,627
And listen
to this garden crowd.

1455
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:25,297
I think the one thing
where I kind of lost it
a little bit,

1456
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:26,432
He'd come down,

1457
01:08:26,434 --> 01:08:28,567
He kind of
like stutter-stepped,

1458
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:31,371
And spun
and finger-rolled it.

1459
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,706
Lin likes the open floor.

1460
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,407
Spinning,
puts it up and puts it in !

1461
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:37,711
Sensational play
for Jeremy Lin !

1462
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:41,214
The garden erupted,
and to do it
on the national stage,

1463
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:45,151
Anybody
who saw that moment
will never forget.

1464
01:08:45,153 --> 01:08:48,052
Electrifying
the garden again !

1465
01:08:48,054 --> 01:08:49,821
He's got 18 points.

1466
01:08:49,823 --> 01:08:55,593
Welcome to our studios
for the Jeremy Lin
toyota halftime show.

1467
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:57,695
Jeremy Lin was superb,

1468
01:08:57,697 --> 01:08:59,430
7 of 12 from the field,

1469
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:01,065
18 points, 5 assists.

1470
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:03,468
Kobe bryant and the lakers
struggling shooting the ball,

1471
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,268
But they're
only down by 8.

1472
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:07,069
Bryant, a couple of fakes,

1473
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:10,539
Gonna put it up,
and knocks it down.

1474
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,942
Stripped by lin,
stolen by lin.

1475
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:16,679
Left side, shumpert,
left-handed layup !

1476
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:20,449
Bryant spinning,
difficult shot.

1477
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:22,052
For some, yeah.

1478
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:24,154
Kobe bryant again.

1479
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:27,224
He is starting to get
in one of those zones
right now.

1480
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:32,129
Gasol is on lin.

1481
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:34,698
Puts up the 2-pointer.
Puts it in !

1482
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,100
Jeremy Lin with 31 !

1483
01:09:39,535 --> 01:09:41,202
And the rebound
by jeffries.

1484
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:44,339
Lin for 3.

1485
01:09:44,341 --> 01:09:45,373
Bang !

1486
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,776
3-pointer !

1487
01:09:47,778 --> 01:09:51,980
Jeremy Lin !

1488
01:09:51,982 --> 01:09:54,749
And my favorite play
of this whole year

1489
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:56,749
Was when I hit
that 3 in the corner

1490
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:59,719
Just because that game
had so much hype,

1491
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:03,056
And that shot
was kind of the dagger

1492
01:10:03,058 --> 01:10:05,625
That put the game
out of reach for them.

1493
01:10:05,627 --> 01:10:07,860
Already cut twice this season,

1494
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:09,228
Sleeping on
a teammate's couch,

1495
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,997
Because he had
nowhere else to go,

1496
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:14,501
And, suddenly, Jeremy Lin
is the toast of manhattan.

1497
01:10:14,503 --> 01:10:15,803
This is it right here.

1498
01:10:15,805 --> 01:10:16,971
This is my dream,
and, uh,

1499
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:18,772
I'm just thankful
to god, man,

1500
01:10:18,774 --> 01:10:21,342
Because this is my dream
being lived out,

1501
01:10:21,344 --> 01:10:23,010
And I'm so thankful
for that.

1502
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:25,646
Jeremy Lin, 38 points.

1503
01:10:25,648 --> 01:10:28,415
It's the most
by a knick this season.

1504
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:32,784
Linsanity continues here
in madison square garden.

1505
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:34,119
It's indescribable,
really.

1506
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:36,321
It's something
I've never seen before.

1507
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:37,522
I didn't foresee
this coming.

1508
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,125
You know,
it's unbelievable.

1509
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,327
This is,
like, how weird I am.

1510
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:44,396
I was like, "I'm gonna go
off this game,"

1511
01:10:44,398 --> 01:10:47,299
And at the end of the interview,
they're gonna be like,

1512
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:49,165
"oh, so do you think
kobe knows who you are now ?"

1513
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:51,735
Jeremy, you knew somebody
was gonna ask you this,

1514
01:10:51,737 --> 01:10:53,870
But do you think kobe
knows who you are now ?

1515
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:55,338
If they ask me that question,

1516
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,107
I'm gonna be like,
"who the hell is kobe ?"

1517
01:10:57,109 --> 01:10:58,675
That's
what I was gonna say.

1518
01:10:58,677 --> 01:11:01,311
And then I,
like, thought about it,

1519
01:11:01,313 --> 01:11:02,779
And I prayed about it,

1520
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:04,381
I was like, you know,
"what would jesus do ?"

1521
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,517
And I'm like, "jesus
probably wouldn't say that,"

1522
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:09,387
So I was like,
"I'm gonna change my answer."

1523
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:12,757
Aw, well,
you guys have to ask kobe.

1524
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:14,392
I don't know.

1525
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:17,762
Let's get to what matters
in sports today, Jeremy Lin.

1526
01:11:17,764 --> 01:11:20,331
Right now,
the biggest star in
new york is Jeremy Lin.

1527
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,799
I don't even think
you have to be a sports fan

1528
01:11:21,801 --> 01:11:22,998
To hear about this story.

1529
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,968
New york has a raging case
of linsanity.

1530
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:29,371
That's what it is right now.
It's madness right now.

1531
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:31,874
All I do
is lin, lin, lin.

1532
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,310
What do you think ?

1533
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:36,779
What do you think
about all this ?

1534
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,048
Um, it's crazy.
It's just crazy.

1535
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,680
One of the biggest headlines

1536
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:43,083
In sports right now is
linsanity.

1537
01:11:43,085 --> 01:11:44,918
If you haven't
caught it yet, you will.

1538
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,954
Linsanity takes
new york by storm.

1539
01:11:47,956 --> 01:11:50,023
He was a last-ditch
effort for the knicks.

1540
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,059
They sort of said,
"all right, who wants to play ?"

1541
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:54,528
And he raised his hand and,
"all right, get in there."

1542
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:56,797
I have never seen anything like this

1543
01:11:56,799 --> 01:11:59,333
In all my years
of covering sports.

1544
01:11:59,335 --> 01:12:01,402
I've never seen somebody
go from a no-name

1545
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,738
To an absolute phenomenon
inside of two weeks.

1546
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,306
It's unbelievable.

1547
01:12:05,308 --> 01:12:09,377
He's doing it with charisma,
with style, with flair,

1548
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:12,013
And he's having fun.

1549
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,681
It's crazy.
It's catching fire.

1550
01:12:13,683 --> 01:12:15,881
Linsanity,
I think it'll probably be

1551
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:17,783
In the dictionary
in the next version.

1552
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:19,518
Linsanity ? I love it.

1553
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,821
I love linsanity.
I'm so happy for him.

1554
01:12:21,823 --> 01:12:23,389
Jeremy Lin's 89 points,

1555
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:25,024
The most by any player

1556
01:12:25,026 --> 01:12:28,160
In his first three pro starts
since the aba-nba merger.

1557
01:12:28,162 --> 01:12:30,796
Outside to lin,
crosses over ridnour,

1558
01:12:30,798 --> 01:12:31,929
And hits.

1559
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,231
Jeremy Lin
up top to fields.

1560
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:37,000
Lin a whirling dervish
right to the rim,

1561
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:38,869
Zigzagging to the cup.

1562
01:12:40,004 --> 01:12:42,106
The knicks have stolen one.

1563
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:46,910
It's their fifth straight win,
their longest of the season.

1564
01:12:46,912 --> 01:12:48,812
You have been surpassed
as the most famous person

1565
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:50,315
Who is
a harvard graduate.

1566
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:52,283
I knew about jeremy
before you did.

1567
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,918
Are you taking credit
for linsanity ?

1568
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,086
It kind of feels
like you are a little bit.

1569
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:56,354
I can't
take credit for it,

1570
01:12:56,356 --> 01:13:00,458
But I'm just saying
I was there early.

1571
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:03,895
As you said, it's a great story.

1572
01:13:03,897 --> 01:13:07,163
What's the greatest part
in it for you ?

1573
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:08,564
That we've won five in a row.

1574
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,100
That's it for me.

1575
01:13:11,102 --> 01:13:13,269
Uh, just everything,

1576
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:16,139
Just here's just
what's right with sports.

1577
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,441
He's an underdog
that came up.

1578
01:13:18,443 --> 01:13:19,709
He does it the right way.

1579
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:21,644
Can he play in the nba ?
Yeah, of course.

1580
01:13:21,646 --> 01:13:24,011
He's got all the tools,
and he's playing really well.

1581
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:26,447
That's not a fluke,
how he's playing.

1582
01:13:28,316 --> 01:13:30,251
I had
this one dude courtside

1583
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:32,186
Who was just yelling
at me the whole game.

1584
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:34,121
He's like,
"you're a one-week wonder."

1585
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:37,091
You know, "you're not gonna
win this game. You suck."

1586
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:40,594
We were playing bad.

1587
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:42,097
We were tired,
and I was like,

1588
01:13:42,099 --> 01:13:45,033
"man, this is gonna be
a tough one to pull out."

1589
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:47,569
We were down 5
with a minute left.

1590
01:13:47,571 --> 01:13:49,671
You know, we got
this huge steal,

1591
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:51,540
Layup, down 3.

1592
01:13:52,942 --> 01:13:55,944
They're coming down,
we get a stop.

1593
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:57,779
The and-1 at amir johnson,

1594
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,612
Who I believe had 5 blocks
to that point,

1595
01:13:59,614 --> 01:14:01,014
Ties the game.

1596
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:02,849
Lin fakes the 3, drives,

1597
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:03,983
Goes in for the layup,

1598
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:05,919
It's good,
and a foul !

1599
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:09,822
Lin can tie it
with a free throw.

1600
01:14:09,824 --> 01:14:11,424
They come down,
missed shot,

1601
01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:14,160
And now we got the ball
with, like, 20 seconds left.

1602
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:15,660
Lin to shumpert,

1603
01:14:15,662 --> 01:14:17,295
Shumpert,
pull-up jump shot.

1604
01:14:17,297 --> 01:14:19,297
Won't go,
chandler the rebound.

1605
01:14:19,299 --> 01:14:21,766
And the knicks will hold it
for the final shot

1606
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:24,635
As the 24-second clock
is shut off.

1607
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:28,806
Mike d'antoni
won't call time out

1608
01:14:28,808 --> 01:14:30,942
And let the raptors
set up their d.

1609
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:34,313
The crowd on its feet
here at the air canada centre.

1610
01:14:36,749 --> 01:14:38,217
Lin puts it up.

1611
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:39,818
Bang !

1612
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,154
Jeremy Lin
from downtown,

1613
01:14:42,156 --> 01:14:43,655
And the knicks
take the lead !

1614
01:14:46,426 --> 01:14:50,028
Amazing here
at the air canada centre !

1615
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:52,629
10 seconds, everyone standing,

1616
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:54,231
20,000 in toronto.

1617
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:55,999
Get out of his way !

1618
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:59,102
Let him just take
calderon himself !

1619
01:14:59,104 --> 01:15:00,937
Three seconds, lin sizes him up,

1620
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:03,406
Straightaway 3, buries it !

1621
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:05,075
.5 remaining !

1622
01:15:05,077 --> 01:15:07,344
Linsanity continues !

1623
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:08,977
I'm just glad
it went like this,

1624
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:11,346
So we can calm
the linsanity down
a little bit.

1625
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:13,982
Where we couldn't
get a stop...

1626
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:15,583
Mwah !

1627
01:15:19,321 --> 01:15:21,489
That's all I dream about
is hitting the game winner,

1628
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:24,025
And then doing
some cool little dorky pose

1629
01:15:24,027 --> 01:15:25,561
And then walking off.

1630
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:28,831
You know, that's,
like, all I did growing up.

1631
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,065
I always wanted to do that.

1632
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,533
I wanted to know
what that felt like.

1633
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:34,870
He's got the game,

1634
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:37,773
He's got the attitude,
he's got the swag.

1635
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:38,807
He's got all of that.

1636
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,377
Okay.
"thank you for being..."

1637
01:15:41,379 --> 01:15:42,909
Or do I just do
the first part ?

1638
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:44,011
WoYeah.
Okay.

1639
01:15:44,013 --> 01:15:48,181
"hey, jeremy..."
I mean...Whoops.

1640
01:15:48,183 --> 01:15:52,185
♪ it's driving me
out of my mind ♪

1641
01:15:52,187 --> 01:15:53,420
"just dial star-star-knicks

1642
01:15:53,422 --> 01:15:55,989
On your iphone
or android phone..."

1643
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:57,858
Or go to nyknicks.

1644
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:09,301
Perfect.

1645
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:11,002
"to all my friends
in indonesia..."

1646
01:16:11,004 --> 01:16:12,904
"to all
my fans in singapore..."

1647
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,439
"to all my fans
around the world,

1648
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:16,408
Thank you
for all your support."

1649
01:16:18,513 --> 01:16:20,279
Linsanity is catching on

1650
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:23,015
Even halfway around
the world in taiwan,

1651
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:25,685
Igniting a crowd in taipei
that went to a bar

1652
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:28,187
At 8:00 in the morning
to watch him on tv.

1653
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,084
He's handled everything very well,

1654
01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:03,552
As you said, unflappable,

1655
01:17:03,554 --> 01:17:05,420
But if there is a chink
in the armor,

1656
01:17:05,422 --> 01:17:07,489
Where can lin
improve his game ?

1657
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,792
Chink in the armor...

1658
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:11,327
a chink in the armor...

1659
01:17:11,329 --> 01:17:12,862
Nice build,
he's got long arms.

1660
01:17:12,864 --> 01:17:14,130
That's what you need
as a point guard.

1661
01:17:14,132 --> 01:17:15,365
And he's really,
I mean...

1662
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,034
What about his eyes ?

1663
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:19,135
Dreamy.

1664
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:21,137
He has
great court vision.

1665
01:17:21,139 --> 01:17:23,039
Take away the lin puns...
Mm-hmm.

1666
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:25,375
This is what you
end up with.

1667
01:17:25,377 --> 01:17:26,974
"amasian."
now is that even...

1668
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,610
Is that even legal ?

1669
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:33,247
Jeremy Lin.
Yes, that's real.

1670
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:35,850
Jeremy Lin coming out
of a fortune cookie.

1671
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:38,552
This whole thing has
shown how unprepared

1672
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:41,689
We were to deal
with this culture
in this context.

1673
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:45,023
Floyd mayweather
on Jeremy Lin tweets...

1674
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:47,159
"all the hype
is because he's asian.

1675
01:17:47,161 --> 01:17:49,027
"black players do
what he does every night

1676
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:50,529
And don't get
the same praise."

1677
01:17:50,531 --> 01:17:52,431
First of all, what he said
I think is racist.

1678
01:17:52,433 --> 01:17:55,968
Not only can he compete
and make it in the nba,

1679
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,438
The guy's tearing it up
and is breaking records,
you knucklehead.

1680
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,008
Check it out.
"he does the math to win."

1681
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,045
For many years,
we've had many stereotypes

1682
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:07,414
About asian-americans,

1683
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,648
And now they're
all kind of coming out

1684
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:09,682
Like they're no big deal.

1685
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:10,917
They are a big deal.

1686
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,285
And that'll do it.

1687
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,120
The winning streak comes
to an end

1688
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,388
In disappointing fashion,

1689
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,956
As the new orleans hornets

1690
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,189
Hand Jeremy Lin
and the knicks

1691
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:22,593
Their first loss
in the Jeremy Lin era.

1692
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:24,195
Now it's easier
for me, you know.

1693
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:25,763
Someone will say
something racist,

1694
01:18:25,765 --> 01:18:28,800
And I'll laugh,
and I'll think it's funny.

1695
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:32,069
Everything I get now,
like, all the negative stuff,

1696
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:33,704
I'll just put it
in one place

1697
01:18:33,706 --> 01:18:35,204
And turn it
into positive stuff

1698
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:36,605
So that I could use it
the right way,

1699
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:39,742
And when I play out of anger,
I play horrible.

1700
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:43,879
And so I had to learn
how to control my emotions

1701
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,582
And then just,
like, let it go.

1702
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,658
Don't break your hand.

1703
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,506
Sweet.

1704
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:25,875
So did you know that new
knicks sensation, Jeremy Lin,

1705
01:20:25,877 --> 01:20:27,510
Has a brother
who's a freshman point guard

1706
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:28,811
For hamilton college ?

1707
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:30,446
We did, though even
we didn't know

1708
01:20:30,448 --> 01:20:31,848
That today's continental
home finale

1709
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,750
Would bring out
the entire lin clan,

1710
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:36,520
Including the linsational
jeremy himself.

1711
01:20:36,522 --> 01:20:39,490
I did not know
he was coming to my game,

1712
01:20:39,492 --> 01:20:45,162
And I actually heard
from a couple people
on campus like,

1713
01:20:45,164 --> 01:20:47,364
"hey, your brother's
coming."

1714
01:20:47,366 --> 01:20:50,668
I was like,
"no, he's not."

1715
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:53,368
I've never really
had that before,

1716
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:58,240
Had that kind of hype
around one of my games.

1717
01:20:58,242 --> 01:21:00,776
But I didn't see it
as that big of a difference.

1718
01:21:00,778 --> 01:21:03,378
It was just my family
watching my game, so...

1719
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,748
I mean, he did come down
before linsanity happened.

1720
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,084
He had come down to watch
my games before that,

1721
01:21:09,086 --> 01:21:10,617
And no one really cared.

1722
01:21:13,554 --> 01:21:14,988
For the last, like, two years,

1723
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:18,725
He was never enjoying
himself out there.

1724
01:21:18,727 --> 01:21:21,127
But that new jersey game,
when things were rolling,

1725
01:21:21,129 --> 01:21:24,364
For the first time,
he was just, like, having fun,

1726
01:21:24,366 --> 01:21:25,932
Living his dream.

1727
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:30,771
I think that was, like,
the best thing from linsanity.

1728
01:21:32,441 --> 01:21:36,210
The big question now is,
can linsanity continue ?

1729
01:21:36,212 --> 01:21:38,312
I don't know how long
it's gonna last,

1730
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:39,680
But right now,
I don't care.

1731
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:41,782
Lin out of the corner for 3.

1732
01:21:41,784 --> 01:21:44,518
Count 'em all !

1733
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,653
Anyone who said they saw
this coming is lying !

1734
01:21:49,522 --> 01:21:51,523
There's a lot more
that he can do

1735
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:54,159
Than anybody knew,
and it comes down
to confidence.

1736
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:55,260
Jeremy on the drive.

1737
01:21:55,262 --> 01:21:57,262
And-1 for Jeremy Lin !

1738
01:21:57,264 --> 01:21:59,632
He got the bang
and the bucket.

1739
01:21:59,634 --> 01:22:01,533
He's got that swagger.

1740
01:22:01,535 --> 01:22:02,833
He has that "it"
right now.

1741
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,469
This transcends sports.
It really does.

1742
01:22:05,471 --> 01:22:07,204
He has shined and evolved

1743
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:10,374
<i>Into the best story
in sports today.</i>

1744
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:11,708
Pressure in the backcourt.

1745
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,711
Oh, and lin the steal !
To the basket !

1746
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:27,191
Lin, over dirk.

1747
01:22:29,229 --> 01:22:31,396
How good is this ?

1748
01:22:32,965 --> 01:22:35,266
I'm just out there
having fun

1749
01:22:35,268 --> 01:22:36,567
And playing a game.

1750
01:22:36,569 --> 01:22:38,901
I can have bad games,
and, you know,

1751
01:22:38,903 --> 01:22:41,704
They may not like me,
or they may boo me.

1752
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,272
There's
a lot more important things

1753
01:22:43,274 --> 01:22:45,007
In life
than just basketball,

1754
01:22:45,009 --> 01:22:47,943
'cause at the end of the day,
basketball's just a game.

1755
01:22:47,945 --> 01:22:50,913
The show
continues on broadway.

1756
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:55,282
It's a story
with many spokes.

1757
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:57,651
An ivy leaguer,
asian-american athlete,

1758
01:22:57,653 --> 01:22:59,486
Guy off the end
of the bench.

1759
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:01,889
Speaks for everyone
who didn't get
their chance.

1760
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:05,325
It's only a couple of weeks,
but in new york city,

1761
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:07,494
And on basketball's
big stage,

1762
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:09,129
This guy has hit it
out of the park.

1763
01:23:10,965 --> 01:23:12,801
What happened to me,
the story that happened to me,

1764
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:14,969
I mean,
it wasn't like I knew

1765
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:16,938
I could just come
off the bench and do that.

1766
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,106
I really didn't.

1767
01:23:18,108 --> 01:23:20,608
Um, I thought I could play
at this level,

1768
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:21,976
And I thought
I could be a good player,

1769
01:23:21,978 --> 01:23:23,878
But I didn't feel
like that would happen.

1770
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,681
And some
of those experiences out there

1771
01:23:26,683 --> 01:23:28,683
When I was on the court,

1772
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:30,850
I felt like I was being
controlled by something else.

1773
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:33,486
I felt like I was having
an out-of-body experience.

1774
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:35,588
Some of the plays
that I made,

1775
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,356
Some of the wins
that we had,

1776
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:39,826
Were just so
out of this world

1777
01:23:39,828 --> 01:23:42,662
That I still have
to pinch myself

1778
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:46,065
To really believe it.

1779
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:40,114
<i>As jeremy ends one chapter
and begins another,</i>

1780
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:43,718
<i>The road ahead will continue
to test his perseverance.</i>

1781
01:24:44,887 --> 01:24:48,089
<i>But his faith
will forever guide him.</i>

1782
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:54,862
The thing
I had to learn last year

1783
01:24:54,864 --> 01:24:56,231
Is a perfect plan
doesn't mean

1784
01:24:56,233 --> 01:25:00,202
That it ends up the way
you want it to end up.

1785
01:25:00,204 --> 01:25:02,471
In the past, if you asked me
what's a perfect plan,

1786
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:03,672
I'd be like,
"I get what I want,

1787
01:25:03,674 --> 01:25:05,808
I get my dream, I play well."

1788
01:25:08,745 --> 01:25:10,612
Now I have
a different perspective

1789
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:13,146
On what a perfect plan is.

1790
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:16,850
You don't get better
if you win all the time.

1791
01:25:16,852 --> 01:25:18,652
You know, you get better
when you lose.

1792
01:25:18,654 --> 01:25:20,020
You improve when you lose.

1793
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:21,922
You look at yourself more
when you lose.

1794
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:24,558
So if you learn a lot
or if I learn a lot,

1795
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,026
If I grow a lot,

1796
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:29,362
If I become a better person
through tough times,

1797
01:25:29,364 --> 01:25:30,795
That's part
of his perfect plan.

1798
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,764
That's part of his perfect will.

1799
01:25:49,549 --> 01:25:51,750
When I was going
through all my insecurities

1800
01:25:51,752 --> 01:25:53,819
And uncertainty
and lack of confidence,

1801
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:56,555
I was losing focus on god.

1802
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:58,123
I was focusing
on all these other things,

1803
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,794
Like my job and what
other people thought of me

1804
01:26:01,796 --> 01:26:04,828
And what the reporters
were writing.

1805
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:08,532
You know, over time,
I was able to check myself

1806
01:26:08,534 --> 01:26:10,567
And kind of
get my focus back.

1807
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,937
And I think god did
something supernatural in me,

1808
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:16,773
Something that I couldn't
do on my own,

1809
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:20,711
Something that I may
never be able to recreate.

1810
01:26:21,978 --> 01:26:23,612
So I think, in that instance,

1811
01:26:23,614 --> 01:26:27,182
I was just learning
to fight

1812
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:30,218
To constantly
live and play for god.

1813
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,855
And when I do that,
I'll be able to walk on water.

1814
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:03,617
<i>It's all about lion king.</i>

1815
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:05,119
We have nala right here,

1816
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:08,022
Baby simba,
timon and pumbaa.
