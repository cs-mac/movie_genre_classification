1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
'This is my story.'

2
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
'That story which was never toId.'

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
'And never heard. But was onIy witnessed.'

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
'And the eyes which witnessed it sIowIy..

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
..vanished into the darkness of history.'

6
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
'It is said that history was never written properIy.'

7
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
'That is why the names of those..

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
..who heIped make history do not find mention.'

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
'Maybe in the same way my mention..

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
..in my own story may not be written.'

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
'In 1971, a war was fought between India and Pakistan..

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
..which was named as the BangIadesh war.'

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
'Pakistan couId not rise after that defeat.'

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
'Even we couId not forget that war.'

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
'Because we had aIso fought gaIIantIy..

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:38,000
..with the Indian forces.'

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Parade, wiII turn around!Turn around!

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Parade, wiII move forward!Turn around!

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When did this happen?

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
3 days back, sir. The tunneI was dug from barra No. 3.

21
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There is no one there.

22
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We were thinking of shifting some prisoners there.

23
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How did this attempt evade your gaze?

24
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It is been onIy 3 months since they have come here.

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They are not even in a position to waIk properIy.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It is a very big task to dig a tunneI 18 feet Iong.

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who is this Suraj Singh?

28
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Major Suraj Singh, 18 Rajputana rifIe.

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He was apprehended in Puri sector on 12th December
1971.

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Due to devoid of ammunition.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Before that he was in Lahore.

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It is heard that he has undergone punishment twice for
escaping.

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Parade attention!

34
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
<i>Good morning sir! - Good morning sir!</i>

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:20,000
<i>Good morning! Carry on.</i>

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
WeIcome major. How did you spend your night, major?

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Not bad. I was with my own men.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Seeing the condition of your men you must have
understood..

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
..that such an attempt is futiIe.

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is deputy director, CoIoneI Sheriar Khan.

41
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Joint InteIIigence Bureau.

42
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ameeting shouId be arranged so that..

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
..I can meet a Pakistani NationaI.

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You have not answered my question.

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And shouId be provided with a newspaper, daiIy.

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And be given an expIanation as to what is the..

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
..Pakistani government thinking..

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
..as regards to sending us back to India.

49
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Or eIse.. you wiII keep attempting to escape from here.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who eIse was there with you?

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I and.. onIy me.

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ok! Barrack No.6! Come!

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And Major.. you shouId be thankfuI to our government..

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
..that even after being caught, you are aIive.

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You shouId be thankfuI to our government..

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
..that after the war ended they handed over..

57
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
..93,000 Pakistani soIdiers intact, back to Pakistan.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am seeing the generosity of your government..

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
..since the past 3 days..

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:44,000
..in barra No. 6.

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is Pakistan. This is Karachi.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is Lahore. This is FaisaIabad..

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
..and this is Peshawar.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How are you PaIi? - I am fine, sir.

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why don't they reveaI where we are?

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We can say observing this mountain range, Kabir..

67
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
..that we cannot be in the west of Pakistan.

68
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And they cannot do a foIIy to keep us in an area..

69
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
..dose to the border, sir.

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But how did this happen so suddenIy?

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Indian soIdiers from every Pakistan jaiI..

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
..have been heId captive here.

73
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
FaciIities have been increased.

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The jaiI has been extended.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How did this change happen so suddenIy?

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
AII of them are from 1971 war in this barrack?

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Some are aIso from 1965 war, sir.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But they are of no use.

79
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Everyone has gone crazy. They shout sIogans for India.

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Unknown that they are dead for India.

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Didn't you try to send them back?

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Are they of any use here?

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sir, Iet aIone their address.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
They do not even know their names.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But sir, you are wrong in saying that they are of no use.

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What do you mean?

87
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Everyone is put to work.

88
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Tomorrow is Id. It's a good day. Leave Major Suraj Singh.

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey.. Iisten. - What is it? - Hey Iisten.

90
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do Punjabis reside here in Pakistan? - Yes. They reside
here.

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And the Sindhis. - Yes! They aIso reside here.

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Listen. These MusIim brethren are here.

93
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes. Then what happened.

94
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was thinking they reside in India too!

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So what if they reside here! -Then why was Pakistan
made?

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It was a mistake! We wiII not make this mistake henceforth!

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WiII you pIease shut up? Both of you! - Sorry sir. Say sorry.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Sorry sir.

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If anyone wants to take a Ieak. Take it.

100
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This truck wiII not haIt anywhere.

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It wiII stop somewhere. Where shouId we go? - Here.

102
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Qui!

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Be quick! - Hey!

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
<i>Gotu.. what do you say?</i>

105
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They are there at the back.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The vaIIey is very steep. They wiII miss us.

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We are weak in our Iegs. We wiII not be abIe to run.

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Think again. We wiII not get this chance again.

109
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Come back! - PaI! - Quick!

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We are coming. Coming.

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Easy. Easy.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There's no Iife in me! - Come on now! It's ok! Come on!
Come on!

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>Did you get it? Give it to me.</i>

114
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother, can I get a cigarette? - Hey, smoking is not aIIowed
here.

115
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But asking is aIIowed, isn't it?

116
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey! Come out!

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Che their nominaI roIIs.

118
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
<i>Guards, make them stand in a Iine. - Come on!</i>

119
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Are these our men? - I am seeing them.

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And there are such jaiIs aIso here?

121
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>What do you say Gotu? - I cannot beIieve it.</i>

122
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Has this country changed?

123
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
<i>Guards! Attention! - Attention!</i>

124
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
<i>Hey Gotu, does the bedding smeII so nice?</i>

125
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In MuItan we used to sIeep on the ground.

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If we get some ground then, sir.

127
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If there are 35 inmates in one ceII. How wouId we get
space?

128
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You reaIized this before time.

129
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
From which unit, sir?

130
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>21st squadron MIG 21, fIight Iieutenant Ram.</i>

131
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
<i>And this.. - Gotu, fIight Iieutenant Gotu.</i>

132
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We started off from AmbaIa together.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Came down together and then caught together.

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
How many jobs do you do together?

135
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now we are earning together, sir.

136
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Now we wiII get married together, isn't it?

137
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes, you are right. - Don't choose the same girI.

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Very good. - When were you brought here?

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
3 months before, sir. - What is the meaning of getting us
here?

140
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sir, I have heard that before sIaughtering a goat..

141
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
..they feed it to its to heart's content.

142
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Shut up! - Say sorry. Say sorry. - Sorry sir.

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Sir, your dothes have been kept at your bed.

144
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you want anything Iet us know.

145
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Can I get whiskey, Subedar?

146
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You aII reIax. If you want anything..

147
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
..ask Subedar Ahmed.

148
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Captain, I do not need Subedar Ahmed's heIp.

149
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I wiII heIp myseIf.

150
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Ok sir.

151
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:51,000
<i>Good night, sir. - Good night.</i>

152
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sir, you did not sIeep as yet.

153
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I was just enjoying the breeze.

154
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How are they?

155
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The same, as we were 3 months back.

156
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What is the matter, Ahmed? - Nothing sir.

157
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thinking of your home?

158
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No. Just Iike that. - We wiII reach. We wiII sureIy reach.

159
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Kabir, it must be raining in DeIhi, isn't it?

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes sir, onIy if the weather bureau..

161
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
..has given the right report for a change.

162
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And in your Pune?

163
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Sir, aII the 12 months the weather is pIeasant there.

164
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Pune is great that way. Jacob. - Yes.

165
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It must be sunny in Cochin today, isn't it?

166
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes, very much. It rains before time.

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes Ahmed, what about Murshidabad?

168
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I do not know, sir.

169
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
My wife was 3 months pregnant when I had Ieft her.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
By now both must have been born.

171
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why are you mocking me, sir? When I am here..

172
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
..how can a second one be born.

173
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why? Can't you have twins?

174
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>Get up. Come on, cheer up.</i>

175
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
'Ahmed is worried.. thinking of his famiIy.'

176
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
'We aII are worried.. thinking of our India.'

177
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
'Thinking of our own famiIies.'

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
'We toIerated this pain, so we are aIive.'

179
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
'Those who couIdn't toIerate it, they went to barrack No.7.'

180
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
'They are IabeIed as insane.'

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why did India forget us? We don't know.

182
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why does Pakistan want to forget us? We don't know.

183
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
'WeII, there is no better support than hope to stay aIive.'

184
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
'I too am surviving on hope.'

185
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Sometimes.. we meet our kin.

186
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
'But hope does not mean to remain idIe.'

187
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
'I wiII be waiting for tomorrow, once again.'

188
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
<i>Greetings brother! - Greetings!</i>

189
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I am Ahmed. Subedar Ahmed. I was just stroIIing..

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
..saw you and thought I shouId taIk to you.

191
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It nothing. Just Iike that. - It's ok.

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Have a meat roII - No, thank you.

193
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Have it! Have at Ieast one! - Hey, they are hot.

194
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Where did you get them from?

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
From Mansira. - You must be tired. 48 hours journey..

196
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, it took just took 8 hours.

197
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Sir, yes! Chess!

198
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What did you know? - Mansira, 8 hours from here, sir!

199
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And the jeep beIongs to IsIamabad, sir.

200
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There no big station out here. Does anyone know? - I
remember, sir.

201
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There is a smaII area, here. - Sure. - Yes, sir!

202
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Mansira was here. - Right sir!

203
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If we start north from IsIamabad, then..

204
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
..where do we reach. Mansira is here and we are here!

205
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Right in the east of Abudabad. - Right sir!

206
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We cannot be to the west of Abudabad..

207
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
..because there are mountains aII around. - You are right.

208
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you go towards east from here after about 40-45 kms..

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
..we are at Muzafarabad. And after about 100 kms to the
east..

210
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:49,000
..we have BaramuIIa and then Puri, which is our India!

211
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh! We are so dose to the border!

212
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
AbsoIute nonsense!

213
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You are taIking of the impossibIe!

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Ajob is possibIe onIy if it is attempted.

215
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This thing does not faII in that category.

216
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You want to cross the border by deceiving..

217
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
..a country's whoIe miIitary and their inteIIigence?

218
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That too without a passport and without documents.

219
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
First of aII the question is of escaping from here, sir.

220
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I am not thinking of that question at aII, major.

221
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because there is no soIution to it.

222
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
SoIutions are found if you search for them, sir.

223
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We wiII not get such a chance to stay together near the
border.

224
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Nor a chance to die together!

225
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But sir, what is the guarantee that we wiII reach India aIive.

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
When officers are taIking don't interrupt!

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Sorry sir!

228
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Captain! - Sir!

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There is a difference to stay dose to the border..

230
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
..and to cross the border.

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is not a movie scene which is going on.

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Then what shouId we do? ShouId we sit idIe?

233
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why? We can wait for the repatriation.

234
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We have been waiting for the past 6 years, sir.

235
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The repatriation has not happened as yet.

236
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Repatriation is a big thing, Captain.

237
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
To return so many prisoners is not a smaII thing. It takes
time.

238
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And that time shouId make us insane.

239
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Major, everyone knows that we are here.

240
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Every newspaper has this news.

241
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Red Cross Society and aII the internationaI agencies..

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
<i>..know this news that according to the Geneva Convention..</i>

243
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
..it is an internationaI Iaw..

244
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
..to return aII the prisoners after the war ends.

245
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And no country breaks this Iaw easiIy!

246
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What wiII you say about..

247
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
..the 6 years which we spent..

248
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>..according to the Geneva Convention?</i>

249
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes. So. The change is before your eyes.

250
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Seeing this camp don't you think that they have reaIized it.

251
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This is exactIy my question, sir..

252
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
..that isn't this sudden reaIization in itseIf a shocking
matter?

253
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Bringing us from different jaiIs and keeping us together..

254
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:23,000
..and that too near the border, don't you smeII a pIan in this?

255
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This was the Iast jaiI to be examined.

256
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Now what do you say? - You speak, Anuradha.

257
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But the Ietter was sent from Pakistan, isn't it?

258
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It is dearIy written in it that we are aIive..

259
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
..and are heId captive in jaiIs of Pakistan

260
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I can very weII recognize my husband's handwriting.

261
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Look you have taken pains to come here from DeIhi.

262
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Even the Red Cross has come so far on your insistence.

263
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Every jaiI has been examined before you.

264
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
As the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission..

265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
..I assure you that no Indian soIdier of the 1971 war..

266
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
..are here.

267
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Now what shouId we do!?

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you coIoneI. You took Iot of troubIe.

269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It is not the question of troubIe. This was my duty.

270
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There are some formaIities to be compIeted.

271
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Just sign these papers. - What is written in them?

272
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It is written that you are satisfied with your inspection..

273
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
..and that after inspection you have found..

274
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
..that there is no prisoner of the 1971 war.

275
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What do you say, sir?

276
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
AIright.

277
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This cannot happen! He is aIive!

278
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He is aIive! I wiII not beIieve!

279
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What has happened?

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This cannot happen!

281
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Sir, your idea was successfuI! We sent the entire PoW's..

282
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
..from different jaiIs together to ChakIaIa.

283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Or eIse even if a singIe one wouId have been seen..

284
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
..by the Red Cross..

285
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
..then it wouId be very shamefuI for the country.

286
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
They have signed the papers.

287
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But we have to be carefuI that untiI the Red Cross..

288
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
..is in Pakistan there shouId not be any chaos..

289
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
..in the ChakIaIa camp, sir.

290
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I wiII take care of that.

291
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You start preparing to proceed to the ChakIaIa camp.

292
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Very weII sir.

293
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I prepared the Kashmir's steamed potato many times.

294
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Where is your partner? - Sir, he is inside teaching how to
cook.

295
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:20,000
ShouId I caII him? Just wait! Hey, paI! - Yes!

296
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Come!

297
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What was going on inside? - Nothing sir.

298
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I was teaching them how to prepare Kashmir's steamed
potato.

299
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Now you wiII feed the Pakistani's with the Kashmir's
steamed potato?

300
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Where am I feeding them, sir? There is onIy one pIace,
where..

301
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
..my cooking is accepted.

302
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Come sir. Sir, this is the signaI room, sir.

303
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
AII the eIectricity in the camp is conducted from here.

304
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Even the spare battery is recharged here, sir. - Ok.

305
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Sir, I have purposeIy fitted it in my office.

306
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So that nobody has any access to it sir.

307
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
<i>Good. - Sir, since tonight aII the fans wiII start functioning.</i>

308
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Siren wiII aIso be operative, sir.

309
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean fuII proof security, sir.

310
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Very good. - Thank you, sir.

311
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Come coIoneI, sit. There is a bad news for you.

312
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You are being handed over to India.

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What!? - Yes, the procedure has been compIeted.

314
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Major. - Yes, sir.

315
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
This is copy of the repatriation.

316
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And this is the copy for the Red Cross.

317
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
CongratuIations CoIoneI! -Thank you, sir!

318
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I had just come to give this news.

319
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And as for the stay at the camp.

320
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
UntiI you are here, be our guest.

321
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But.. how did this happen so suddenIy?

322
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Look, this does not happen suddenIy.

323
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
These matters take some time.

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Process is going on since many months.

325
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It may take.. 2.. to 3.. months stiII.

326
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
There is a big buffet for you on behaIf of CoIoneI.

327
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And aIong with it.. sir wiII you say it.

328
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You must have not seen a movie for a Iong time.

329
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
These days there has been a very popuIar movie.

330
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So we wiII screen it in the open ground.

331
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I.. I cant beIieve it! - You better beIieve it, CoIoneI.

332
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Our nation is not that bad as you think it to be.

333
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>Good Iu!</i>

334
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you, sir! - No, you keep this with you.

335
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Inform others too. - AIright.

336
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
''Lots of happiness has been bestowed.''

337
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
''That girI is bIushing inside her veiI.''

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
''I feeI Iike dancing the Bhangra.''

349
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,000
''I feeI Iike.. dancing the Bhangra.''

350
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
''I came to the fair with my friends.''

351
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
''We saw a group of maidens.''

352
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
''No one wants to go back.''

353
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
''Howsoever one tries; no one can break our friendship.''

354
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
''I feeI Iike singing.''

358
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000

367
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
''Let the worId come together..

368
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
..it wiII not be abIe to stop our Bhangra.''

369
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
''I feeI Iike dancing the Bhangra.''

377
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:21,000
''I feeI Iike.. dancing the Bhangra.''

378
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
CongratuIations! - Sir! - Sir!

379
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So Major! Your dream to become a hero is unfuIfiIIed.

380
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It doesn't matter sir. I wiII go back and join the fiIm industry.

381
00:30:36,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Right! There are some things which Iook good in fiIms.

382
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Sir, it is urgent.

383
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What happened sir? - I was not wrong, Captain.

384
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Ahmed.

385
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
As it is said by the famiIies of the captive soIdiers of 1971
war..

386
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
..has requested the Red Cross Society..

387
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
..to assist them in finding them.

388
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
They accuse that the condition of the soIdiers..

389
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
..in different jaiIs is very bad.

390
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
They shouId be detected as soon as possibIe.

391
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And steps to send them back to India shouId be taken.

392
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
<i>GeneraI Zia-uI-Haq has given the Red Cross permission..</i>

393
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
..to inspect every jaiI in the country.

394
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Zia-uI-Haq! What happened to Bhutto?

395
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Captain, the government in Pakistan has changed.

396
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
MiIitary ruIe has taken over.

397
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
<i>GeneraI Zia-uI-Haq's government..</i>

398
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
..has permitted the new Red Cross to inspect..

399
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
..every jaiI in the country.

400
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And has openIy announced that..

401
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
..according to the SimIa treaty..

402
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
..aII the Indian soIdiers of the 1971 war..

403
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
..have been returned.

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And right now no Indian soIdier is present..

405
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
..in any Pakistan jaiI.

406
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
India has to think five times before making..

407
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
..any faIse and irresponsibIe accusations.

408
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
What is the meaning of this?

409
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It means that the Red Cross is in Pakistan..

410
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
..at this moment.

411
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And they fear that they wouId come here.

412
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There is immense tension on the border and..

413
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
..we are very dose to the border.

414
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We have made an attempt to escape from here.

415
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And they want to be sure that untiI we are here..

416
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
..another attempt is not made.

417
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
As soon as the Red Cross Ieaves Pakistan..

418
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
..this camp wiII be dosed.

419
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And we wiII be sent back to the same pIace..

420
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
..from where we were brought.

421
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And the worId wouIdn't know..

422
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:13,000
..when we died in the Pakistan jaiIs.

423
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But such a thing cannot happen.

424
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I have fuII faith.

425
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They are taking care of us.

426
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And they cannot say such a big Iie.

427
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think it wouId be a big sin to doubt their honesty. - Sir!

428
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I have fuII faith that they wiII impIement what they said.

429
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And we wiII be sent back to India.

430
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Sir, don't hit! Don't hit! Don't hit! - Sir! Sir!

431
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
What did you hear?

432
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The same which we doubted. - What?

433
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The same which you doubted. - What do you mean?

434
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean that we had thought of it on the way, sir.

435
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We did not have the energy Ieft. Or eIse..

436
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Or eIse, we had aIready thought of fIeeing..

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
..before reaching here, sir.

438
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes sir. Yes sir. And after going out from here..

439
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:28,000
..the first thing you wiII need is this, sir.

440
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Leave them.

441
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Thank you sir!Thank you sir!

442
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Burn this tabIoid, Ahmed! - Ok sir.

443
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And no one shouId know of this thing outside.

444
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Yes sir. -And keep one thing in mind..

445
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
..that we have very Iess time on hand.

446
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Whatever we have to do..

447
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
..we have to do it from tomorrow itseIf.

448
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why from tomorrow, sir? Why not from today itseIf?

449
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Why not right now?

450
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
What do you mean?

451
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Sir. Sir. - What is it? - Sir, we have a request.

452
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
We wanted a group photograph.

453
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You are not standing in the queue.

454
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Sir, we had come to request you.

455
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What was the name of that pIace near Jamma Masjid?

456
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Karim - Yes! Karim!

457
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Sir, they wanted a group photograph, sir.

458
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
PIease sir, it is a request sir. PIease.

Sure. Sure. Ah.. where are you two from.

460
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I am from DeIhi, sir. - And you?

461
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Sir, Srinagar! Kashmir!

462
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Have you ever been there?

463
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Not at Ieast on the other side of Kashmir.

464
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Both of you were saying about a group photograph.

465
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
PIease sir. This is a request, sir. PIease.

466
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So go and organise it. We are coming.

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Thank you very much, sir. - Thank you sir.

468
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000

'We had decided that we wiII escape from here.'

470

'The day was fixed. That is the Pakistani Independence
Day.'

471

'The same night, in the presence of CoIoneI Puri..

I am saying pick it up! Pick up!

481
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You are not my senior!

I am your senior's, senior!

483
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Then where were you untiI now! - Don't argue with me!

You..! - Don't abuse me!

485
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
How did you abuse him? - Sir! Sir!

Sir! He had taIked to me Iike this!

You ask me to get food for you! I wiII say it once again!

488
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If you wiII not take care of your seniors..

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
..then who wiII take care.

490
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
If you wouId have been in India..

Then do my court-martiaI.

493
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Ok, enough! Major Suraj Singh..

..of his court-martiaI right now.

496
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sir, this is PoW camp not your battaIion!

497
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And we are in another nation.

But we are in the army? And ruIes are ruIes!

499

Sir, wiII this court-martiaI be vaIid in India.

500
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
After reaching India we wiII not be removed from the army!

501
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We wiII have to resume our duties!

502
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But there is no IegaI set up here!

503
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
LegaI set up can be created!

504
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
CoIoneI Puri is right!

505

I wouId Iike to prosecute this case!

506

Come sir.

510
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
<i>Good Ahmed! - Thank you sir.</i>

511
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Anew disturbance has been created in the camp.

512
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes they are going to court-martiaI him.

513
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They have requested for a court to be set up in the barra.

514
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They are saying that they wiII give..

515
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
..their verdict by 15th August.

516
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
As it is you are coming on 14th August.

517
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What do you say CoIoneI Sheriar?

518
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Let them proceed. It is a matter of 1-2 months.

519
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We wiII have fewer tensions.

520
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Ok permission granted. - Sir.

521
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But there are orders to ceIebrate..

522
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
..14th August in pomp and grandeur.

523
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>It is the first independence day of GeneraI Zia.</i>

524
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He has come to power after a Iong time.

525
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Let's see what he does.

526
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What arrangements have been made Major?

527

I have taIked personaIIy to Begum SuItana, sir.

She has agreed to it.

Every camp on the border wiII bathe in festivities, sir.

530
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Very good. - Sir that..

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Sir one more thing.

532

Sir they want to ceIebrate their Independence Day..

533
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000

534
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
They have demanded some..

535
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
..new dothes for the occasion.

536

And aIso asked for some coIours..

537
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
..and some dyes to paint the fIag, sir.

538
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Are they in a position to demand?

539
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
<i>Give them. Give them.</i>

540
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But everything shouId be done..

541
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
..under your observation. -Be rest assured, sir.

542
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
'The next morning, parade..

543
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
..for the Pakistan's Independence Day..

544
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
..had started in the ChakIaIa camp.'

545
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
'The sound of the Pakistan band was echoing aII around.'

546
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
'And aIong with them we started our preparations.'

547
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Take this. Take this. These are new uniforms.

548
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Wear them for 15th August.

549
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Come, my beIoved.

550
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It is been ages since we wore new uniforms.

551
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Paint it compIeteIy. CompIeteIy.

552
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

553
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Bother, this green coIour has spiIIed.

554
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Can we get some more?

555
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Don't put aII at once.

556
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Listen, don't ask for more coIour. They wiII doubt us.

557
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There is quite enough. - Let's see.

558
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WiII they appear Iike Pakistan uniforms?

559
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They wiII appear after drying.

560
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
But Iisten, the question is of dyeing them.

561
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
For that we need fire. - For that we wiII need a kiIn.

562
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They wiII not aIIow us to dig a pit to make a kiIn.

563
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Do one thing. - What?

564
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
FiII up the jaggery.

565
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Adrink of jaggery? - Yes sir.

566
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It is very deIidous, sir.

567
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
<i>There is pIace near DeIhi caIIed Gurgaon.</i>

568
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It is prepared there, sir.

569
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
How wiII you prepare it?

570
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
First we wiII fiII the pot with jaggery..

571
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
..and bury it in the ground..

572
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
..and then take it out and boiI it. That's it.

573
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Which means that you wiII need a kiIn.

574
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yes sir. - Ok. The pit shouId not be 1 feet deep.

575
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It wouId not be, sir.

576
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Look. - Yes sir.

577
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Everything wiII be done under your observation.

578
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yes sir.

579
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Take back the instruments after the work is done.

580
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes sir.

581
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
'Ahmed's court-martiaI had started.'

582
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
'They were happy that our attention..

583
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
..wouId be diverted from other pIans.'

584
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
'And it was our attempt that using this court-martiaI..

585
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
..we couId some how take Ahmed into..

586
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
..Major Karamat's office.'

587
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
How do you pIead, Subedar?

588
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>GuiIty or not guiIty!</i>

589
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
He pIeads not guiIty.

590
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>Now before you.. Lieutenant Gotu wiII expIain!</i>

591
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
ExpIain! - Sir!

First we removed the bark of the Shikar tree!

593
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Removed!

594
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Then put it in the urn! - Put it!

595
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
One minute. One minute.

596
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Why did you put the bark of the Shikar tree?

597
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Brother, for fIavour! FIavour!

598
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You see further.

599
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
After that the jaggery is poured in the same urn!

600
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Poured it! - Now you wiII dose the urn! CIose the urn!

601
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
CIosed it! - Now wait for 1 /2 and hour and then you have it.

WiII wait! Wait! - Yes!

603
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
''I was present, she was too.''

604

''I was present, she was too.''

605
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
''I was present, she was too.''

606
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
''And the weather was coIourfuI.''

607
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
''And we got our prestige ba, brother.''

608
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
''Did you understand?''

609
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
''That means Iove is in the air.''

610
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
''Dear, you are set. Now what wiII happen of me?''

611
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
''Dear, you are set. Now what wiII happen of me?''

612
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
''Our kiIn has started burning.''

613
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
''Our eyes started burning.''

614
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
''You cried and I aIso cried.''

615
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
''Just Iike the cow's miIk this fresh one is prepared.''

616
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
''You saw, I saw.''

617
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
''Our fighter pIane, crashed suddenIy.''

618
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
''You died and I died.''

619
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
''And the weather was coIourfuI.''

620

''And we got our prestige ba, brother.''

621
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
''Did you understand?''

622
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
''That means that the thing is ready.''

623
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The court is adjourned tiII tomorrow.

624
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I object sir. Subedar Ahmed shouId be stopped..

625
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
..from being induded in the parade on 15th August.

626
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
No crime has been proved on Subedar Ahmed as yet.

627
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But he is under triaI sir.

628
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And an under triaI cannot partidpate in a parade.

629
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This is injustice, sir.

630
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
After aII we have fought for the Indian Armed Forces.

631
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And we are in-charge of the very same Indian armed forces!

632
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Objection of the prosecution is sustained.

633
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Subedar Ahmed is stopped from being induded..

634
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
..in the 15th August parade.

635
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Ok then, today's job is done.

636
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You wiII get the drink Iater. Ok.

637
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We had taken care of every possibiIity.

638
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We had taken care of every point of view.

639
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And we had come to a condusion..

640
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
..that during the night of festivities of 14th August..

641
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
..there wiII be a big stampede.

642
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So that we couId escape under that pretext.

643
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
For a stampede we needed a bomb.

644
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And for the expIosion we needed a bomb.

645
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
We did not have a bomb.

646
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Captain Jacob came up with an oId idea.

647
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Sir, how much wiII be the expIosion power, sir.

648
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Just Iike a Iab expIosion. -Tight!Tight!

649
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
HoId it from down.

650
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
<i>Give the bigger end.</i>

651
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
HoId it tight! Very tight! - Yes, sir!

652
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Tight!Tight!

653
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Turn it. Turn it.

654
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Nobody saw who raised hands on whom first.

655
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Why didn't you give the same punishment..

656
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
..to Captain Jacob.

657
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Don't mind major.

658
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Were you not taking Subedar Ahmed's side..

659
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
..because he was your confidante.

660
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
PIease don't mind sir. you have been hating..

661
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
..Subedar Ahmed because he is a MusIim.

662
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Major, you can compIain against me after reaching India.

663
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The question is of the present.

664
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Of his mentaI state.

665
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
If he goes against the country because of this torture.

666
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
WiII he be considered a cuIprit?

667
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Such peopIe, spy for other countries and work for them.

668
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
What is the guarantee that he wiII be IoyaI..

669
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
..to the Indian Armed forces. As he is of now.

670
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yes sir, I had caIIed because we wanted our man..

671
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
..in the Indian Army Headquarter, sir.

672
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes sir. The name is Subedar Ahmed.

673
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
He is a Shia MusIim.

674
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yes sir. The probIem is that he is one of them.

675
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yes sir.

676
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It means that we have to dedare one of them aIive, sir.

677
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yes sir, the man is very usefuI.

678
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes.

679
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That is what I am saying..

680
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
..that we wiII try him for a year or two.

681
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I am giving the permission for the parade to disperse!

682
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Everything is going smoothIy.

683
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You wiII have to come where I have toId you.

684
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Ok. Come.

685
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Whatever, Major Suraj Singh has said, is it true?

686
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes, sir.

687
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Then why don't you refuse this court-martiaI.

688
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It wiII be even difficuIt after reaching India.

689
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Major wiII not be there.

690
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And after reaching a common pIace..

691
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
..aII of them unite.

692
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You do not know what the condition there is.

693
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I am being taken out of one camp and sent to another
camp.

694
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Can I be of any heIp?

695
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I mean to say that a way in which it wiII be very usefuI to

696
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Sir, free me from the court-martiaI.

697
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
But this is a very minor job.

698
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Anything more than this.

699
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I mean you can stay with your famiIy..

700
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
..comfortabIy back in India.

701
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Something where you can have Iots of money.

702
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I did not understand, sir.

703
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It is Iate in the night. We wiII taIk Iater. Ok.

704
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Come.

705
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What happened!?

706
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Look there!

707
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
What happened there?

708
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Sir! - Check it out!

709
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Sir, there was nothing. There must be an animaI.

710
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
TeII them to report to me! - Yes sir!

711
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
<i>Go fast!</i>

712
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Come.

713
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Come fast!

714
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I wiII come in minute. - Ok sir.

715
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Ahmed had gained Karamat's confidence.

716
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He had given us the accessories..

717
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
..required for the uniform, the beIt and the medaIs..

718
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
..one by one.

719
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
<i>GoItu, one more peg.</i>

720
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
<i>And that evening GoItu made the jaggery drinks.</i>

721
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Sir, one more peg. - I Iove you.

722
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Sir one more. - Best of 3.

723
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Sir.Sir.Sir. - One more - Sir. Sir.

724
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
What is happening here? - Hey Major Karamat.

725
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Make one drink for Major Karamt aIso.

726
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
<i>Got it sir. - Got it sir.</i>

727
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Both have done wonders.

728
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I wiII write a Ietter to both of you after reaching India.

729
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Take this sir. - Have a drink Major.

730
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
What is this? What is this? - Sir jaggery..

731
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
How did this happen? How did this happen?

732
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I do not know sir. They had made something with jaggery.

733
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
<i>Did you aIso drink? - GoItu, one more.</i>

734
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
This is too much!This is too much!

735
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Come on! - Sir! Sir!

736
00:50:55,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Major Karamat! - Sir! 1.. 2.. 3..

737
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
What about the photographs?

738
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I burned it, sir.

739
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I hope you have not burned the CoIoneI?

740
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
He is sIeeping Iike a Iog, sir.

741
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
By now he must have reached Jodhpur and joined the duty.

742
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Shut up.

743
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Were you Hanuman in your Iast birth?

744
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Sir, nowadays I am Vibhishan.

745
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
What's the news?

746
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Sir, they have a fIag hosting on 14th August in the morning.

747
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
After that SuItana Khanan, a ghazaI singer, is coming in the
evening.

748
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Before that CoIoneI Shapoor and some ISI officers wiII
arrive.

749
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>And sir, aII the new guards have riffIes and mounted LMGs.</i>

750
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
AII of it is American made. Advanced.

751
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
No burst can go wrong.

752
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And sir, there are three things in the signaI room.

753
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Current, siren and aIong with the Iight, teIephone main
wiring.

754
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Just shutting it won't do, sir.

755
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We wiII have to damage it.

756
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Sir, I wiII have to see the phase.

757
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What about your bomb?

758
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Sir, we wiII have to save it from water.

759
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
If water faIIs on the bomb.. the bomb wiII go waste, sir.

760
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Anything eIse?

761
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Sir, we have received the order..

762
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
..to vacate the camp within 15 days.

763
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It means after 15 days Red Cross won't be in Pakistan.

764
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
On 14th August.. Pakistan independence day.

765
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
In the evening, there wiII be a feast. Kabir.

766
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I wiII Iook after the signaI room, sir.

767
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Jacob.

768
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Sir, I wiII be around the fence.

769
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
As soon as they receive the signaI..

770
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
..I wiII come near you.

771
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
After Ieaving this pIace?

772
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Sir, Abudabad is 20 km from here in the south.

773
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
If we get separated, then we aII wiII meet there.

774
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
After Ieaving this pIace?

775
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Sir, we have to foIIow the outside road.

776
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The first city is there.

777
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Fine. We wiII think of the next pIan of action there.

778
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Remember. We have onIy one bomb as ammunition.

779
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
If that is ruined, then everything is over.

780
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Okay?

781
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
<i>Have faith in God.</i>

782
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We are taking a chance.

783
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
If we survive, then fine.

784
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Otherwise.. we wiII die in the open air.

785
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000

946
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It is very dangerous.

947
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
<i>Nothing wiII happen! Don't act smart! Get down! Out!</i>

948
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Hurry up!

949
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
<i>Come on! Hurry up! Give me the rope!</i>

950
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:52,000
We wiII have to make him unconscious!

951
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:07,000
HoId him!

952
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Jacob! Are you fine!

953
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Sir, the buIIet just missed me.

954
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

955
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
The bIood is oozing out.

956
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Right! Keep the body in the jeep.

957
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
And cover the jeep with the bushes.

958
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Take as much ammunition as you can carry.

959
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And their waIIet too.

960
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Hurry up!

961
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
<i>And Iisten! Ram, Gotu.. we wiII have to make them
unconscious.</i>

962
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Come on! - I am sorry. - Come on!

963
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
We wiII have to make you unconscious for sometime.

964
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Are you Indian?

965
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yes.

966
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Then what are you doing here?

967
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Look.. the story is Iong and there is not enough time.

968
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I won't be abIe to teII you.

969
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Are you a soIdier?

970
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yes. - From '71 war?

971
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes.

972
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I too have been the member of Pakistani human rights
commission.

973
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
For the past 4 months, news of Red cross raid..

974
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
..was being pubIished in the newspaper.

975
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I have a request.

976
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
PIease don't make me unconscious.

977
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
BeIieve me, dear.

978
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Take some of trust from our country.

979
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
The jeep wiII be caught within next 20 minutes.

980
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Ahmed. It was Ahmed. -Ahmed.

981
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Yes, sir.

982
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think.. I think he is no more, sir.

983
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Shoot them at sight. Spread aII over.

984
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There are wearing ordinary dothes.

985
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
They are very scared.

986
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
They don't know where to go.

987
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I wiII kiII them brutaIIy.

988
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Which way did they go?

989
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Towards IsIamabad.

990
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Towards IsIamabad?

991
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
How do you know?

992
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
What's so surprising about that!

993
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
They don't know the way!

994
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
They didn't make you unconscious.

995
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I don't know.

996
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
What difference does it make!

997
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yes, sir.

998
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Come on everybody! Move!

999
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
What are you waiting for! You idiot!

1000
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Nothing, sir! Coming, sir! Coming, sir!

1001
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
No, no!Turn it. Turn it. Take it ba!

1002
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Take another route.

1003
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Tiger for Hawk 1 ! What are you doing! Turn back! Over!

1004
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1005
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
AII the miIitary vehides have a map in the dashboard.

1006
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And this vehide's dashboard was empty, sir. Over.

1007
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
What do you mean? Over!

1008
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It means the map is missing. It means they have the map,

1009
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That means they have gone towards that side..

1010
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
..if they can understand miIitary map.

1011
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And now I am asking you for the Iast time.

1012
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Can they understand miIitary map, sir? Over.

1013
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
What do you mean? - Are they miIitary experts, sir?

1014
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Are they in any way connected to army, sir? Over.

1015
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I too am teIIing you for the Iast time!

1016
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Listen to me carefuIIy, major!

1017
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
These peopIe are wearing ordinary dothes.

1018
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
They are in no way connected to the army! Out!

1019
01:13:11,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Okay, sir. Over and out!

1020
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
What is going on?

1021
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Sir, we have received the order to check the truck.

1022
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They are our men!

1023
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Sir, our men are traveIing in this.

1024
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Let them go. They are our men. - Okay, sir.

1025
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Let them go.

1026
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What's the matter? - Sir, a search is going on.

1027
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
We are searching for 6 peopIe.. - Who are they?

1028
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Sir, we don't know.

1029
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Can I get first aid? Somebody has been injured. - Yes, sir.

1030
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
<i>SaIim! Get the first aid box!</i>

1031
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Take this, sir.

1032
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Thanks.

1033
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Let them go.

1034
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Come, sir.

1035
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
How are you feeIing?

1036
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Sir, there is a bit of weakness. But..

1037
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Otherwise I am fit.

1038
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Very good!

1039
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We wiII have to buy new dothes after reaching
Muzafarabad.

1040
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
This uniform won't come to our aid for Iong.

1041
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Did you guys earn anything?

1042
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Sir, the entire Pakistan's saIary is in our hand.

1043
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Very good!

1044
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Did you guys note one thing? - What, sir?

1045
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
These peopIe are hiding our identity.

1046
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
They don't want this matter to spread.

1047
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I wish that ma'am does.. what she said she wiII do.

1048
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Hawk 1 ! QuickIy come to Abudabad hospitaI!

1049
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Our soIdier is regaining consdousness.

1050
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We can get some more information from him. Over.

1051
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
AII right, sir. Over and out!

1052
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Sabina, beIieve me. I am teIIing the truth.

1053
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I have seen at Ieast 70 prisoners of war with my own eyes.

1054
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
This camp has been made near ChakIaIa.

1055
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And from here they have escaped to Muzafarabad.

1056
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
But the government is saying something eIse.

1057
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And even Red cross has not got hoId of any Indian POW.

1058
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Sabina, its not a difficuIt task to hide..

1059
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
..70 peopIe in this huge city of Pakistan.

1060
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You teII me. What can you do about this?

1061
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Red cross is in Pakistan onIy.

1062
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
We couId give them this news.

1063
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Can't we pubIish this news in the newspaper?

1064
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
We can try. But these peopIe wiII not Iet us pubIish it.

1065
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Sabina, first go to Red Cross. TaIk to them.

1066
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And then you caII me.

1067
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Okay.

1068
01:17:47,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Come on down! Come on!

1069
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
<i>Greetings.</i>

1070
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Do you know.. you couId Iose your service for this?

1071
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Do you know Red Cross is stiII present in Pakistan?

1072
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
If they got the news, our country wouId be sIandered.

1073
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
If we had not been aIert.. this camp wouId have..

1074
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
..been nabbed a Iong time back.

1075
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
In a night aII those peopIe were shifted from there.

1076
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I don't understand how did aII this happen?

1077
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
This was an accident.

1078
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
They ran away under the cover of the feast.

1079
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Otherwise our security.. Sir, our security was fooIproof.

1080
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I had checked it tiII the Iast moment.

1081
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
The government has to pay the compensation..

1082
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
..of your Iast minute inspection.

1083
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sorry, sir.

1084
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Major MaIik! - Sir.

1085
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
What do you have to say?

1086
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Sir, I have onIy one question.

1087
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Are these Indian 'Prisoners of War', sir? - Yes.

1088
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I am sorry, sir.

1089
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I wiII maintain the secrecy of the mission.

1090
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But you shouId have toId me this before.

1091
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Anyway.

1092
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Come. - The patient has regained consciousness.

1093
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Let's go.

1094
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
What had happened? TeII us.

1095
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Sir, they are 5 of them.

1096
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
From them.. one is shot in the stomach.

1097
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
They can't go very far. - And..

1098
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
They have weapons and maps.

1099
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Sir, they aII are in Pakistani uniform.

1100
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And they aIso have the ID card.

1101
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
How did this happen, coIoneI?

1102
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I just don't know.

1103
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Oh no! Sir, they are heading towards Muzafarabad!

1104

01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
MaIik, who is she? - Let me taIk to her.

1264
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
No way! - PIease, sir!

1265
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
No need for that! Just send her out of here!

1266
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
<i>Get her out of here! - Sir! I wiII taIk to her.</i>

1267
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Okay, okay! Fine, sir. PIease, sir.

1268
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Ma'am! Ma'am! TaIk to me.

1269
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Look, the tanks have bIown up.

1270
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
And you can see the state.

1271
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Where are the Indian POWs?

1272
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Those who have escaped from ChakIaIa!

1273
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Which POWs, ma'am? - Don't try to feign innocence.

1274
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I have the eye witnesses who have seen those POWs.

1275
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Okay. Look, there has been an accident.

1276
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Our soIdiers are in serious condition.

1277
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Arescue operation is going on. PIease Iet us do our work.
PIease!

1278
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I am teIIing you that tomorrow there wiII be..

1279
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
..commotion in the entire Pakistan!

1280
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
What! What commotion?

1281
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Why? I don't understand what you are saying.

1282
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
If you have eye witnesses, then go to the headquarters.

1283
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
<i>Go and compIain there. That's aII!</i>

1284
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
That means you agree there were POWs here.

1285
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
When did I say that, ma'am? When?

1286
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I am just saying that you have come at the wrong time.

1287
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
<i>Do one thing! Do one thing! Go to the headquarters!</i>

1288
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
<i>Go to IsIamabad! But Iet us do our work!</i>

1289
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Okay, sir! No, MaIik!

1290
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I wiII sureIy go there! I wiII go and compIain.

1291
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Don't interfere! Let us do our work!

1292
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
PIease come, sir! PIease come, sir!

1293
01:42:46,000 --> 01:43:18,000
This Iady! - PIease come, sir!

1294
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Sir, Red Cross peopIe are waiting outside.

1295
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
TeII me what to do now.

1296
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Don't worry, coIoneI.

1297
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
DeIegation from High Commission has come.

1298
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
They wiII be reaching there soon.

1299
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Thank you, sir! Thank you very much!

1300
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Over and out!

1301
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Major.. - Sir.

1302
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Everything wiII be over if they crossed the border.

1303
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Sir, there is a red aIert at the border.

1304
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
The area from Puri to BaramuIIa is seaIed.

1305
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But the Red Cross is outside, sir.

1306
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Our mission is not a secret anymore.

1307
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
How did they come to know!

1308
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I don't know, sir.

1309
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Major! Where can they go?

1310
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Sir, they are somewhere in the vaIIey.

1311
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Can't they be in Muzafarabad?

1312
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
No, sir. - Why?

1313
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Because I have understood them, sir.

1314
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
What do you mean?

1315
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I mean sir, no matter who they are..

1316
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
..they are wiIIing to sacrifice their Iife for each other.

1317
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Sir, they have dedded to cross the border.

1318
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
How? It doesn't make a difference to them.

1319
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Sir, the man who died.. he didn't die without a reason.

1320
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
In fact he kiIIed himseIf.

1321
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So that the rest of his friends wouId survive.

1322
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Sir, they are determined. They don't care about death.

1323
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Besides this, they are miIitary experts.

1324
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Right now to nab them is reaIIy not an easy task.

1325
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Are you trying to say that now nothing can be done?

1326
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Sir, I am an army officer and I am bound by my duty.

1327
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So I can't muster the courage to say this.

1328
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
But it is true that the Red Cross is outside, sir.

1329
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
If they got even a bit suspicious..

1330
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
..even a bit suspicious.. then beIieve me..

1331
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
..what you are trying so hard to hide, that wiII be exposed.

1332
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And even you know, sir that this won't be any smaII news.

1333
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Now what to do?

1334
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Sir, we wiII have to wait.

1335
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Let the matter cooI down. Then we wiII take some action.

1336
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
But tiII then.. pIease, sir.. go and tackIe Sabina Jehangir.

1337
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,000
PIease, sir! PIease! - No! No! No way! No, MaIik! No!

1338
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Listen to me, sir! WhiIe taIking to them, be caIm.

1339
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
You know how the matter couId aggravate.

1340
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Sir, it wiII become very serious. PIease.

1341
01:45:34,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Come, sir. - What troubIe is this!

1342
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I am reaIIy sorry, ma'am. I got hyper.

1343
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
ActuaIIy the conditions were such.

1344
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
To teII you the truth.. I myseIf can't understand..

1345
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
..how this rumour about POWs spread.

1346
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
You can Iook at the ChakIaIa camp.

1347
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I have seen that!

1348
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
That ends the matter.

1349
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
The matter starts from here, sir.

1350
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
You get yourseIf prepared to face the press tomorrow.

1351
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
You are giving me threats of the press!

1352
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Do you know whom you are taIking to!

1353
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Since when I am poIiteIy taIking to you..

1354
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
..and you are harassing me!

1355
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Look, ma'am. This is the miIitary matter.

1356
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I won't toIerate your interference in this at aII!

1357
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
You have crossed your Iimit!

1358
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Sir. Ma'am, why are you wasting your and our time?

1359
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Why don't you Ieave?

1360
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
There was one expIosion there.

1361
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And within 24 hours there was another expIosion here.

1362
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It was not an expIosion. It was an accident, ma'am.

1363
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
How can it be an accident?

1364
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Two cars dashed with each other. That's aII.

1365
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Who were inside the car?

1366
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Living peopIe Iike you and me.

1367
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Now ma'am, you are actuaIIy and seriousIy..

1368
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
..testing my patience. I am teIIing you.

1369
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Look! Look!

1370
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
This is a highIy sensitive area!

1371
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
CiviIians are not aIIowed here. You know that!

1372
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
If you need the headquarters number, I wiII give it to you.

1373
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:35,000
<i>Go and fiIe the compIaint. That's aII.</i>

1374
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Sabina Jehangir. - Yes.

1375
01:47:51,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Come.

1376
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Come on! Come on, Major! We have to take quick action!

1377
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Right, sir! SoIdiers! Dispatch the vehides towards the
vaIIey.

1378
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
PetroI is finished.

1379
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
We needed this onIy up to here.

1380
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Come on, get down.

1381
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
SIowIy, Kabir. Be carefuI.

1382
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
<i>HoId him. Gotu, hoId him.</i>

1383
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Look! Why don't you attend to him?

1384
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Are you aII right?

1385
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Yes.

1386
01:49:23,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Take him, take him over there.

1387
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It is bit on a sIope.

1388
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
WiII you be abIe to waIk?

1389
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I wiII try, sir.

1390
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
<i>Good.</i>

1391
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Come. Take support of my shouIder. Come.

1392
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Come on. Come on.

1393
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
<i>Kabir! Get up!</i>

1394
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Come on! Come on!

1395
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,000
<i>Gotu!</i>

1396
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:24,000
The three of them sacrificed their Iives in fighting.

1397
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Learn to respect the martyrs.

1398
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Come on.

1399
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:34,000
You can do it. Come on.

1400
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Kabir! - Yes, sir!

1401
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Do not give up! Come on!

1402
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
No!

1403
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:59,000
<i>Gotu! - Yes sir! Support him! - Yes sir!</i>

1404
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
It is aII snow everywhere!!

1405
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And it is a steep dimb up.

1406
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
We wiII get caught in dayIight.

1407
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
We wiII have to wait here untiI it is dark.

1408
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
<i>Gotu, heIp Kabir to sit down.</i>

1409
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
SIowIy. SIowIy. CarefuI.

1410
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
One minute, sir. SIowIy.

1411
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,000
SIowIy.

1412
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Ok. - Sir! - The bag! Bag!

1413
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Take off the bag.

1414
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
ReIax.

1415
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
<i>Gotu, get two stis.</i>

1416
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Hurry!

1417
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Straighten your Ieg.

1418
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Come on!

1419
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
No, it's nothing! It's nothing! - Where is it hurting?

1420
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Here, is it hurting here?

1421
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yes sir! - Here? Is it? - Yes sir!

1422
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
No, it's nothing! It's nothing!

1423
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
It's going to be perfectIy aII right!

1424
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Bring the sticks!

1425
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Bring the sticks!

1426
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It's aII right. It's aII right. It's aII right.

1427
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:32,000
See to it that he doesn't straighten his Ieg.

1428
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
That means they have not gone towards the border.

1429
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Search in the vicinity for the bodies.

1430
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Comb the whoIe area.

1431
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Even if they are aIive, they cannot go very far.

1432
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Sir! Sir! PIease sir!

1433
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
PIease sir, the bike can be thrown down aIso, sir!

1434
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
They must have thrown away the bike, right? - Yes sir.

1435
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And then they wiII go on foot!

1436
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
WiII they cover the distance of 40 kiIometers of ice on foot?

1437
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Yes sir. Right sir.

1438
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Major MaIik, they are not as smart as you!

1439
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
You are absoIuteIy right, sir. - Why don't you sit down

1440
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
..for a second and have a cigarette?

1441
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You're never wrong, sir! You're never wrong, sir!

1442
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
They are smarter than you, coIoneI Sheriyar Khan..

1443
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
..they are smarter than you!

1444
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Sir, we cannot extricate it!

1445
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Hey, 3 or 4 of you come here!

1446
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
HeIp them!

1447
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Bring it out! - PuII it!

1448
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Raise it!

1449
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Bring it out!

1450
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
CarefuI!

1451
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
What is this?

1452
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
When the war was aIready over..

1453
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
..what was the need to detain these peopIe?

1454
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
We have earned the curses of their famiIy and peopIe.

1455
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And it has been a nuisance for us.

1456
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
If I say this, I wiII be caIIed a traitor.

1457
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
If I don't speak up then this conscience..

1458
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:52,000
..of Pakistan wiII torture me aII my Iife.

1459
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
<i>Gotu? - Yes?</i>

1460
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It is time. Prepare to start off.

1461
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Kabir? - Yes?

1462
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Open. Open your mouth.

1463
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
WiII you be abIe to waIk? - What?

1464
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
WiII you be abIe to waIk?

1465
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I wiII try.. sir.

1466
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Very good.

1467
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
<i>Gotu! - I wiII try.</i>

1468
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Check the ammunition once again.

1469
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Kabir?

1470
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
What happened? -This.. is not coming out sir.

1471
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
There is a strange sensation in this Ieg.

1472
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
One minute.

1473
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
One minute.

1474
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
PuII! PuII it hard!

1475
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Try harder! PuII it harder!

1476
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
What is this?

1477
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Sir, I was not feeIing any sensation in it, sir!

1478
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
BIoody heII! Was it in the ice since then? - Yes sir.

1479
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Idiot! Why didn't you take precaution?

1480
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Were you sIeeping?

1481
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
It is frost bite. It wiII dimb up sIowIy!

1482
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
CaIm down! CaIm down! Nothing wiII happen.

1483
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
<i>Do one thing. Get on my shouIder. - I won't be abIe to
escape.</i>

1484
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
It wiII sIowIy..

1485
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Sir, pIease Ieave me behind!

1486
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I won't be abIe to waIk any more.

1487
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Even your father wiII waIk!

1488
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Hey, carry him on your shouIders!

1489
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:35,000
PIease Ieave me, Sir.

1490
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Come!

1491
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Nothing wiII happen! Kabir, nothing wiII happen!

1492
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Nothing wiII happen; I am there.

1493
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Sir.. - I am there!

1494
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
..there couId be confronting ahead sir!

1495
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
In that case you can fire back.

1496
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Your hands are not injured, right? - PIease sir!

1497
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
We might have to run, sir.

1498
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
We might have to run away, sir.

1499
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
If he utters another word, shoot him point bIank!

1500
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Do you know, sir?

1501
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Once a man asked another, do Punjabis Iive in Pakistan?

1502
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
He said: yes, they do Iive.

1503
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
He asked: Sindhi?

1504
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Sindhis aIso Iive there.

1505
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Mr. Kabir, are you Iistening?

1506
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Okay.

1507
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
So he asked: our MusIim brothers?

1508
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So he said that they aIso Iive there.

1509
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
What do you want to ask?

1510
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,000
He said that these peopIe Iive in India aIso.

1511
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So why was Pakistan created?

1512
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Sir, do you know what he said?

1513
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Sir, he said that it was a mistake!

1514
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:44,000
In future we wiII not create it!

1515
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Sir! - Yes?

1516
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Sir, you know..

1517
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Puna street wiII be crowed right now.

1518
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Ok.

1519
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
That city.. sIeeps very Iate, sir.

1520
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Yes.

1521
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,000
PeopIe go out with their famiIies in the evening.

1522
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Sir, I too used to go with Chandni and Zarina.

1523
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
<i>Gotu, Chandni is Kabir's daughter.</i>

1524
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Oh! Sir, how oId wouId she be now?

1525
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Mr. Kabir?

1526
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
You are unnecessariIy insisting, sir.

1527
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Sir, if you carry me, this 2 hours journey wiII stretch to 6
hours.

1528
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Shut up!

1529
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Sir, can I teII you something? - Yes.

1530
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I respect you more than my father, sir.

1531
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And army officer is Iike a father.

1532
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Idiot! - Sir, you are right.

1533
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
What? - Idiot!

1534
01:59:48,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Have you ever heard this idiot, Kabir sir?

1535
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
<i>Gotu!</i>

1536
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
<i>Gotu!</i>

1537
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Come here.

1538
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Do you see that?

1539
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Oh yes!

1540
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Do you see something? - Yes sir.

1541
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Something red..

1542
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Red..

1543
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
<i>Gotu!</i>

1544
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
<i>Gotu!</i>

There is.. India!

1547
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Our home!

1548
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Sir! Sir!

Mr. Kabir! Mr. Kabir! Mr. Kabir!

1553
02:01:36,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Sir! Sir!

1554
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,000
<i>Gotu, run!</i>

1555
02:03:49,000 --> 02:04:06,000
There the scoundreIs are!

1556
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Sir, you are making a mistake, sir!

1557
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
They are heading towards LOC, sir!

1558
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
To heII with LOC!

1559
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
HeIicopter!

1560
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:24,000
From where did the heIicopter come? - They have started
firing!

1561
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Army, take position!

1562
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Captain Zamir!

02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000

I say, turn the heIicopter.

1570
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Are you out of your mind?

1571
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Jacob was shot, Ahmed went away and now you too..

1572
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
We wiII have to survive for their sake!

1573
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
We wiII have to survive for the sake of those we have Ieft
behind!

1574

For whom someone is waiting on the other side!

<i>Gotu? - Yes?</i>

Someone is waiting on the other side for you aIso.
