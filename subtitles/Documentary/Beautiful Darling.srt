Episode 8

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,402
<i>Mi Nam.</i>

5
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,082
- Yes, this is it!
- Yes.

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,121
The feeling is just right. This will do.

7
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,641
It's totally different.

8
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,702
Manager Ma, is Go Mi Nam sick?

9
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:35,015
I don't know. Where did he go?

10
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:43,439
<i>Mi Nam.</i>

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,397
What's going on?
Did something happen before the recording?

12
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:48,573
What should we do?

13
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:50,494
You saw how Mi Nam's feelings burst out, right?

14
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:52,351
That's why I'm asking you!

15
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:56,648
I told him to sing your song
with an explosive feeling of love.

16
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,691
I think it has really exploded now.

17
00:00:58,692 --> 00:00:59,478
What?

18
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,431
I think her heart is exploding for Kang Shin Woo.

19
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:13,916
Go Mi Nam.

20
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>I thought it was strange that she came back with
Shin Woo after refusing to return for so long.</i>

21
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,238
<i>Why does she have to like him?
She should have just liked me.</i>

22
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,524
Hey, Tae Kyung, what do we do?

23
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:35,431
Where is she?

24
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,189
I'm sorry, Shin Woo hyung.

25
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:05,240
What's this?

26
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,249
Don't go.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,732
I think it's better to leave him alone.

28
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:17,001
Mi Nam?

29
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,379
He went somewhere to calm down.

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,220
I wanted to follow him,
but it looks like we should leave him alone.

31
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:26,157
He didn't say anything else to you?

32
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,980
He just said that he's having a hard time.

33
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,933
He must be stressed since it's his first recording.

34
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,966
Looks like he doesn't know anything.

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,471
Should I talk to Mi Nam? Tae Kyung!

36
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,706
Why are you asking me that?

37
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:52,788
We are on the same side.

38
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,517
I never thought I was on the same side
as you and Go Mi Nam.

39
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,151
You guys solve it yourselves.

40
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,454
Tch! Go Mi Nam's love exploded for Kang Shin Woo?

41
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,959
The absurdity is explosive!

42
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,219
<i>Mother Superior...</i>

43
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,940
<i>My feelings keeps flowing out.</i>

44
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:25,686
<i>I wish I could become invisible
so that no one could find out about my feelings.</i>

45
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,520
<i>If I slowly disappear,</i>

46
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,684
<i>No one will notice me, right?</i>

47
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,709
<i>Go Mi Nam.</i>

48
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:46,763
Jeremy. Can you see me?

49
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,062
Of course.

50
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,863
I've been looking at you for awhile.

51
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:58,282
So I didn't disappear
because Jeremy was watching...

52
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,618
You can't disappear...

53
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:11,879
Because we need to have a celebration
for your first recording.

54
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:18,417
Whoo!! Hello! Hello!

55
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:21,172
Go Mi Nam, you should say hello too!

56
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,755
Hello, everyone!

57
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:28,944
Jeremy, you really do like celebrations.

58
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,320
Celebrations are good things.

59
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,850
But you're not happy at all, right, Go Mi Nam?

60
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:37,037
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,159
Really?

62
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:41,671
Then I'll just let you cry a lot.

63
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:51,861
I really can't stop my tears.

64
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,159
It's really spicy, right?

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,921
This restaurant has ten levels of spiciness.

66
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:01,262
This is level eight. Level eight.

67
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,116
Should we challenge it until the end?

68
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,145
I accept the challenge!

69
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,953
I need to melt this with some ice cream.

70
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:13,970
We were really great.

71
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:17,985
If there were 12 levels,
I'm sure we would have succeeded too.

72
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,010
Of course.
We would have been able to eat it all.

73
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:23,670
Ah this is a cookie!

74
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,497
Go Mi Nam, since you've cried your eyes out,

75
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,165
I'll let you laugh this time.

76
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,572
Let's go.

77
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,793
Jeremy. This is really fun.

78
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:02,702
Right.

79
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:04,514
Hello everyone. I love you all!

80
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:07,058
Please look forward to our sixth album!

81
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:15,681
This bus is a precious secret that I found.

82
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm only telling you about it.

83
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:22,995
Like you said, there are really
not that many people here.

84
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:28,354
It takes this bus an hour
to make exactly one round.

85
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,924
Whenever I'm feeling down,
I ride on this for one round,

86
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,565
And my heart calms down.

87
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:39,095
Then will my heart calm down too?

88
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:43,494
Of course! My precious bus is magic.

89
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,048
Let's meet again in an hour.

90
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,155
Can my heart really calm down in an hour?

91
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:44,173
For this one hour, I like you, Go Mi Nam.

92
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,835
I'm glad you had some fun with Jeremy.

93
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:32,000
Everyone must have been
shocked when I ran out like that.

94
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:33,268
I'm very sorry.

95
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:36,014
It's all right.
You sang really well.

96
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:40,062
Your outburst during the recording was really good,

97
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,639
But you have to control your feelings.

98
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:50,059
If it's too much, it'll bring trouble.

99
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,416
So I couldn't control it well?

100
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:58,747
I was thinking about a way to control it.

101
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,300
You know about pressure points, right?

102
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,795
When you're really hungry,
press your ears here.

103
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:11,975
And when you need to go number 2...

104
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:15,274
When you really need to poo, push this part.

105
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,395
When you can't stay awake, push here.

106
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:25,134
Ah, I think I've heard about this.

107
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,474
Just like that, when you can't control your feelings...

108
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,362
Nose... Touch your nose like this.

109
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:37,991
Here?

110
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:39,627
That's right. That's right.

111
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,951
When you can't control your feelings,

112
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:45,660
Or you feel your heart beating fast
when you see someone,

113
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,692
Press this part hard.

114
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,848
But won't someone think
it's weird if they see this?

115
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,236
Even though it seems strange, it'll work.

116
00:09:55,237 --> 00:10:00,300
The harder it is to control,
the harder you should press.

117
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,620
It'll be better.

118
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,680
Press hard.

119
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:07,195
Thank you for taking care of these things for me.

120
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,273
Well, of course.

121
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,037
I'll remember it.

122
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:31,935
The innocent sister really believes my words...

123
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,259
I'm really sorry.

124
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:39,112
But at least if she does this,

125
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,264
The other party won't realize her feelings.

126
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:06,958
Go Mi Nam, come here.

127
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:13,717
I helped organize your situation.

128
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:17,919
What are you doing?

129
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,933
I'm just pushing a pressure point

130
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:24,193
Pressure point?

131
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,511
It's something I have to do.

132
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:29,184
Don't worry about me and just continue talking.

133
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,315
Are you messing with me?

134
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,264
Ah, you're trying to imitate the pig that chased me.

135
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,081
This guy that is like the rabbit
I hate now dares to imitate a pig?!

136
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,733
It's not like that.

137
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,501
I won't do it.

138
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,874
Don't move your hand.

139
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,343
Just listen like that.
I'll kill you if you put your hand down.

140
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,474
Listen carefully, piggy rabbit.

141
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,428
I'll tell you the path you should take from now on.

142
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,226
First, you should tell Shin Woo that you're a girl.

143
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:05,648
Huh? Why?

144
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,148
I heard you like Kang Shin Woo.

145
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:10,048
What?

146
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:13,154
Of course I thought it was absurd
when I first heard about it,

147
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:16,372
But thinking about it more,
I see how it could have happened.

148
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,608
Go Mi Nam.

149
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,562
I'll hand you over to Kang Shin Woo.

150
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,755
It's not like that. You've misunderstood.

151
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,578
Hand!

152
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,477
There are two possibilities when you tell Shin Woo.

153
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,460
First, he'll accept you.

154
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:39,180
Even though I feel sorry for Shin Woo,
it's good because you can be open about your feelings.

155
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,008
And it's good for me because I can get rid of you.

156
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,744
Second, he won't accept you.

157
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,754
<i>Even though this is only advantageous for me,</i>

158
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:49,925
If something like that happens,
you'll just have to beg and hold onto Shin Woo.

159
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:54,295
If you can be half as persistent as you were with me,
I'm sure you can hold onto him.

160
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:58,015
Hyung-nim. This is really a misunderstanding.
It's not like that at all.

161
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,209
No matter what, I'm advising you to tell Shin Woo.

162
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,125
Work hard, Go Mi Nam.

163
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:15,187
Even though he didn't find out,
he misunderstood.

164
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,502
This situation is not good for me.

165
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:23,934
What is it?

166
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:27,568
I was doing origami.

167
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,144
What are you making?

168
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:34,923
A plane.

169
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,784
Ah, I can't do it like this.

170
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,934
You're really clueless.

171
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,785
You have to fold it like this
so that no one can see what's inside.

172
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,449
Ah, I see.

173
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:59,014
Do you want me to tell you
a story of a really clueless girl?

174
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:04,601
This girl carried a really big secret and entered a group.

175
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,421
A really clueless girl?

176
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:10,411
Yes. How clueless was she?

177
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:14,252
As soon as she got in, a member
in the group found out about her.

178
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,166
But she didn't know and kept on with her activities.

179
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,885
Why does the member keep quiet?

180
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,394
At first he just wanted to watch for the fun of it.

181
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,398
That person was really bored.

182
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,812
<i>But as he watched on,
the girl was just so clueless.</i>

183
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,570
<i>It was funny, yet he pitied her.</i>

184
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,292
- Go Mi Nam.
- President.

185
00:14:58,293 --> 00:14:59,850
Let's go to the sauna.

186
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,787
My skin here is very sensitive.

187
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:07,515
- Then you should go to the sauna.
- I really don't want to go to the sauna.

188
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:11,933
We're all guys. What's the problem?
I know a really pretty massage lady.

189
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:15,834
A lady?

190
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:16,612
Yes.

191
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:19,787
President! Don't go to the sauna.
Let's just eat together.

192
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:22,845
Guys need to go to the sauna
to have heart-to-heart talks.

193
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,733
Then got eat with me, Mi Nam.

194
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:26,536
Eat?

195
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,112
I like eating!

196
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,749
<i>He was sucked in as he kept watching over her.</i>

197
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,384
Getting a massage is good.

198
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:34,325
<i>It was his first time keeping an eye on someone else.</i>

199
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,086
<i>And without realizing it,
he started helping that girl.</i>

200
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,791
Mi Nam, help me with this.

201
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,534
<i>Then the girl should be really thankful to him.</i>

202
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,140
<i>That girl doesn't know.
I told you she's really clueless, right?</i>

203
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:25,091
Then why won't he tell her?

204
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:28,358
It's for the sake of the group members and her safety.

205
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,192
So he has to keep quiet for now.

206
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:35,532
When the time comes,
that feeling will get through, right?

207
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:37,474
Accept this.

208
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,032
Thank you.

209
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:44,714
It's cold. You should go inside.

210
00:16:56,733 --> 00:17:00,332
Shin Woo hyung is a good person.
I can't tell him.

211
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,957
Even though it's hard, you have to endure,

212
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:08,499
And keep holding onto Hyung-nim.

213
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:13,458
I can't do my work because of that kid.

214
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,560
Her feelings burst for who?

215
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,811
She sang well.

216
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:25,783
So she likes him so much that she can't stop her tears?

217
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:29,599
So this was the trouble she caused?

218
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,597
I really can't let my guard down.

219
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,266
You rabbit-like guy

220
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,583
She's so ungrateful.

221
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:53,351
It's been a long time and she's not back yet.

222
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,709
Don't tell me she's already begging
Shin Woo after telling him?

223
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,482
Well, that's her specialty.

224
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,216
She could have decided quickly.

225
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,709
Is she there again?

226
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,688
She's not here either.

227
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,813
Don't tell me she really went over
to tell Shin Woo everything.

228
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:31,496
Where the hell is she?

229
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:38,034
<i>Hyung-nim.
Please don't hand me over to Shin Woo hyung.</i>

230
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:41,591
<i>I really won't cause you
any more problems in the future.</i>

231
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:06,863
Go Mi Nam, did you decide to only drag me down?

232
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:14,609
You know that you've brought me a lot of trouble, right?

233
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,224
If you're aware,
then don't take up that much space.

234
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,456
Just sleep on half of the blanket
so you won't cause me any problems.

235
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,025
Ah, so troublesome.

236
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,379
Mi Nam's song really came out well.

237
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,834
We just need to shoot a nice music video now,

238
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,201
And it'll be a hit.

239
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:19,965
It would be good if Hwang Tae Kyung
and Yoo He Yi come out in the music video.

240
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:26,330
Good idea. At last, you've come up with something I like!

241
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,144
Right?

242
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:30,316
The best hot couple as main characters of the music video.

243
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:32,731
That's like winning the jackpot.

244
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:35,602
The story of the music video...

245
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:41,433
It should be something spectacular with lots of action,
like blockbuster scenes.

246
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,079
Just like this...

247
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,880
A lonely killer meets a sexy killer.

248
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:51,007
<i>They're saving the world from an evil power.</i>

249
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,529
<i>They go to Paris, France,</i>

250
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:05,825
<i>Rome, Italy,</i>

251
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,202
<i>And the desert in Egypt.</i>

252
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,256
<i>No. No. No.</i>

253
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:19,093
We don't have that kind of budget.

254
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:23,245
And going overseas, shooting guns, and blowing
things up won't necessarily make it good.

255
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,903
It doesn't match the song's concept.

256
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:26,145
Something else.

257
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:27,579
President.

258
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:35,762
What about an erotic, adult, love version?
What do you think?

259
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,100
That doesn't sound too bad.

260
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,555
It gives people a sticky sweet feeling.

261
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,081
<i>Just like this.</i>

262
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:49,518
<i>That lonely killer and sexy killer,</i>

263
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:54,902
<i>Wrapped in passion, advance toward each other,</i>

264
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:00,012
<i>With burning feelings,</i>

265
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:03,095
<i>The two of them finally...</i>

266
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:06,544
<i>Approach each other,</i>

267
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:17,641
<i>And touch each other slowly with their hands...</i>

268
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,422
<i>Slowly...</i>

269
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:24,235
<i>Advancing... Gradually...</i>

270
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,760
<i>Sexily.</i>

271
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,376
No. No. No.

272
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,091
What kind of concept is that?

273
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:36,963
The singer and main characters
have very clean images.

274
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,328
We can't have any bed scenes.

275
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,944
What about a love story,

276
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,856
Without words.

277
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,777
We just have to shoot their youth,
cuteness, and passion.

278
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,200
- It's a hit.
- GO!

279
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,475
- Go.
- Okay. Jackpot!

280
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:55,997
It would have been good to have an explosion scene.

281
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:01,083
Mi Nam, you don't have to do any complicated acting.

282
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,581
Just look at Tae Kyung and Yoo He Yi.

283
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:07,291
Tae Kyung, you've shot this kind of thing a lot,
so please take care of Mi Nam.

284
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,322
I have to take care of him again?

285
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,230
Ah, this is getting tiring.

286
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:13,493
I'm sorry, Hyung-nim.

287
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:15,061
Please do well.

288
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:19,876
Because of the scandal,
Yoo He Yi's movie made a lot of money.

289
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,242
We should also...

290
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:27,204
Ah... I'm sorry for using your love for business.

291
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:29,814
No. Since it's already like this,

292
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,100
You should make a lot of money.

293
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,541
Right? That's right.

294
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:37,310
Yoo He Yi will be here once
she finishes her performance.

295
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,936
Don't just take care of your girlfriend.

296
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,593
Take care of Mi Nam too.

297
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,494
Do well!

298
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,527
Director Oh!

299
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:48,528
What girlfriend?

300
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,625
I won't disturb you two.

301
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,651
Please don't worry about me.

302
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,268
Go Mi Nam.

303
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,094
When Yoo He Yi is here, stick with me at all times.

304
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:01,183
No. I'll stay far away so that I don't disturb you.

305
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,841
Go Mi Nam, I'll decide where you stay.

306
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,438
Don't interrupt.

307
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,427
Then I'll stay this close.

308
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:12,154
Come closer.

309
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:15,833
Are you like gum? That's too close.

310
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,730
Come closer.

311
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:20,436
Stop.

312
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:25,243
We have to shoot all that's planned
before the sun sets, so listen carefully.

313
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,435
Yes, Hyung-nim.

314
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:29,766
He looks like Mi Nam.

315
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:33,876
Can I approach him?

316
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:38,464
Yes. I'm shooting.

317
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:44,606
Raise your head higher.

318
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,969
Chin higher.

319
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:47,710
Good.

320
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:52,673
Closer together.

321
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:57,721
Very good.

322
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:00,851
Good.

323
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:03,834
Be brighter!

324
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:04,962
Very good.

325
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:06,213
Okay.

326
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:12,530
- Where are you going?
- Shin Woo.

327
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:19,313
Excuse me. I'm looking for this woman.

328
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:24,890
I think she was with Hwang Tae Kyung
after the stage performance that you guys had.

329
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,276
Do you know who this woman is?

330
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,060
Performance day?
I think Tae Kyung hyung was with Go Mi Nam.

331
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:38,242
Go Mi Nam? That can't be right.

332
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:41,371
Yes, I'm sure he was with Go Mi Nam.

333
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:43,642
I don't know this woman.

334
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,507
Really?

335
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:50,965
Then I'll just have to meet Go Mi Nam and ask him.

336
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,219
Thank you.

337
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,270
<i>All right, everyone pay attention in class.</i>

338
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:05,179
<i>Only Tae Kyung stares out the window and thinks of He Yi.</i>

339
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:08,667
<i>And thinks some more...</i>

340
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:11,454
<i>More hazily...</i>

341
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,705
She's walking over.

342
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:21,472
Mi Nam, glance at Tae Kyung.

343
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:30,857
Student, there!

344
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,766
Pay attention in class!
Why are you looking back?

345
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:34,868
I'm sorry.

346
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,043
CUT!

347
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:01,162
Only the lighting technicians move.
The others stay put.

348
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,664
Don't move an inch!

349
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:08,168
What's wrong?

350
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,090
That guy keeps looking at you.

351
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,750
Who is he?

352
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:12,852
Who?

353
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:20,545
He's been acting weird.

354
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:23,014
Maybe you know him?

355
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:27,176
Maybe. I don't really know anyone.

356
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:36,787
He's my oppa's friend.

357
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:41,095
They were best friends in high school.

358
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:45,932
What should I do?

359
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:49,786
It'd be strange if I couldn't recognize my best friend.

360
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:55,352
Then just pretend to know him and say hi.

361
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:01,286
But I don't remember his name.

362
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,565
Hyung-nim...

363
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:13,911
You've been looking at me for awhile.

364
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:15,629
Looks like you're a fan.

365
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:18,495
But... I wasn't looking at you.

366
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:22,092
I'll sign an autograph for you.
What's your name?

367
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:23,664
It's all right.

368
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:28,375
What is your name?

369
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,139
Kim Dong Jun.

370
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,478
Kim Dong Jun?

371
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,237
Hey Dong Jun.

372
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,374
<i>Mi Nam!</i>

373
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,175
You did recognize me after all.

374
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,776
Of course. You're my best friend.

375
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,260
You jerk!

376
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:51,480
Hey! Do you know how bummed I was, thinking you
were ignoring me now that you're a celebrity?

377
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,688
Hey, that wouldn't happen.

378
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,973
<i>Dong Jun, calm down.</i>

379
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,959
How long has it been, Go Mi Nam?

380
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,619
It was your dream to be a singer,

381
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,523
And you really became one.

382
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,370
You're really cool, my friend.

383
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,373
You punk!

384
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,524
Go Mi Nam?

385
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,490
You have to get ready for filming.

386
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,484
<i>Hurry in.</i>

387
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:19,376
Yes, Hyung-nim.

388
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:21,104
Ah, right, you must be busy.

389
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,870
After all, you're the star.

390
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:30,713
Oh...

391
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,956
- What?
- Where's the scar you had here?

392
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:36,327
Huh?

393
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:40,782
You split your hand here after you fell
when we were riding bikes, remember?

394
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:42,733
<i>It was a pretty big scar.</i>

395
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:44,105
<i>But, it's gone now.</i>

396
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:47,060
Oh! Th-that, that...

397
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:52,059
There's no need to hide the surgery from your friend, is there?

398
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:57,453
Didn't you say you had work done
in several spots before your debut, Go Mi Nam?

399
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:59,587
Yes, I did.

400
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:03,194
Ahh. You must have done that
now that you're a celebrity.

401
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:07,769
Now that I look closely, your face looks thinner.

402
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,670
Yeah, I had some work done here and there. Don't keep staring.

403
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:15,396
It's okay. I totally understand.

404
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:20,452
<i>We're going to start shooting,
so everyone who needs to should use the restroom now!</i>

405
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:21,914
Hey, Mi Nam.

406
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:24,019
It's been a long time.
Wanna go take a leak together?

407
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,736
<i>Huh?</i>

408
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:25,778
C'mon!

409
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,241
<i>Hey, do you remember how we used to
bet on whose could reach the farthest?</i>

410
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,892
Should we give it a go today?

411
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:33,172
Uh... Hyung-nim!

412
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:38,524
<i>Let's take a leak.</i>

413
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:44,944
It's been a really long time
since we've peed together.

414
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:57,900
Kim Dong Jun?

415
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:01,904
<i>It seems like you're a fan of ours.</i>

416
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,232
Which song is your favorite?

417
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:08,179
I'm sorry. I don't really know A.N.JELL's songs.

418
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,068
Then,

419
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:12,445
You must know this song.

420
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:15,025
I will promise you

421
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:19,970
I will live with only you in my eyes.

422
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,194
Ahhh!

423
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,560
I will promise you...

424
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:29,341
- I will live holding you in my arms...
- Ah, I'm done.

425
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:30,545
Already?

426
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,113
Yeah, I'll be going out now.

427
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,695
Getting to sing in the bathroom
with a top star like you, Hyung-nim,

428
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,504
That was an honor.

429
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:50,199
If I had just taken off then,

430
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,272
Kang Shin Woo would probably be standing here singing.

431
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:05,007
So, here I can find Yoo He Yi,
Go Mi Nam, Hwang Tae Kyung...

432
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:08,101
All the people I need to prod.

433
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:10,302
Now!

434
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,146
We're filming the lunch hour.

435
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:15,797
Since no sound will be recorded for the music video,

436
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:19,624
Chatter naturally as you eat.

437
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:33,727
Hey, you must be playing a wealthy kid.

438
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:35,830
Your lunch looks really good.

439
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:42,633
Hyung-nim is playing a poor kid,
so he just has dried anchovies.

440
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,850
He wants some of the omelet,

441
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:48,470
But the situation won't allow it.

442
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:55,915
Seeing the omelet reminds me of your sister.

443
00:32:57,286 --> 00:33:02,010
You always gathered stuff she liked
from the other kids and took it to her class.

444
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,426
Mmm. I did, didn't I?

445
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:11,104
So, even though I don't like eggs,
I always asked mom to pack me omelets.

446
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:15,126
Because she'd be eating it.

447
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:18,897
You did?

448
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:21,894
Tch, I guess you liked her, huh?

449
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,409
It took me this long to say anything,

450
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:30,930
But I really liked your sister.

451
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,525
I couldn't say anything because it was a friend's sister,

452
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,147
But your sister...

453
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,157
Was my first love.

454
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:45,688
Tch, now I've seen everything.

455
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,241
I really never knew.

456
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:54,671
<i>Actually, I'm leaving for the army tomorrow.</i>

457
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:58,494
And I was thinking about your sister a lot.

458
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,634
Seeing you makes me feel like I saw her.

459
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:06,892
Really?

460
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:14,084
Go Mi Nam?

461
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,857
You're a guy. Isn't it bad thing to look like your sister?

462
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:22,046
Uh, yeah, you're right, Hyung-nim.

463
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,367
Wow, you've totally got it!

464
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:37,273
<i>She's smiling.</i>

465
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:39,000
<i>She's totally lost it.</i>

466
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:46,855
Go Mi Nam?

467
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,845
You'd better restrain yourself.

468
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:52,169
It looked like sparks were gonna fly
when you guys were rubbing your heads together.

469
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,154
He's his closest friend. What can I do?

470
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:57,339
<i>Hey, Mi Nam!</i>

471
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:01,234
Hyung-nim, please distract Dong Jun
so I can go to the bathroom.

472
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:03,521
Mi Nam!

473
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:06,463
Kim Dong Jun.

474
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:08,148
Ah, Hyung-nim.

475
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,078
Have one of these.

476
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,238
I hear you're living together.

477
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:21,438
I bet Mi Nam's a lot of trouble.

478
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:24,092
Mmm, he's a lot of trouble. A ton.

479
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:31,082
By any chance, does Mi Nam's sister come and visit?

480
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:37,038
Well, I've seen his sister.

481
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:40,859
Ahh, she's really pretty, isn't she?

482
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:46,938
Why don't you ask Go Mi Nam if you can see her
before you go to serve in the army?

483
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,934
That's okay. I'll see her after I serve.

484
00:35:52,432 --> 00:35:53,194
After?

485
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:55,098
I'm studying to be a pharmacist.

486
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,001
After I graduate, I'm going back to
my hometown to open a pharmacy.

487
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,150
And I'll make sure I find her then.

488
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:03,473
And what will you do when you find her?

489
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:08,777
My dream is to quickly get married and live a cozy life, running my pharmacy.

490
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:15,183
Ahh, can you keep it a secret from Mi Nam?

491
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,491
Go Mi Nam,

492
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:26,162
After you leave, it looks like
you'll be a pharmacist's wife.

493
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:43,392
Hello.

494
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:45,264
Hello.

495
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,944
Hello.

496
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:49,514
<i>Yoo He Yi!</i>

497
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:51,550
<i>Looks like you're late.</i>

498
00:36:51,553 --> 00:36:52,973
I have to get to dress rehearsal.

499
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,448
Ah, because your scandal with Hwang Tae Kyung,

500
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,044
Your movie was well-promoted, wasn't it?

501
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:03,863
Don't imply that we created
a scandal to promote the movie.

502
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,578
And the music video will be such a hit with you in it.

503
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,730
Hwang Tae Kyung must be thrilled.

504
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:12,913
Our relationship is not a business deal.

505
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:14,034
It's real.

506
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,581
Ahh, is that so?

507
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:20,688
Um, you remember this picture, don't you?

508
00:37:21,612 --> 00:37:25,766
At the time, we weren't sure how things were going,
so I couldn't say anything.

509
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,850
I'm sorry I said it wasn't me.

510
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:31,571
Aye... What are you lying for?

511
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,789
Excuse me?

512
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,414
You weren't with Hwang Tae Kyung, were you?

513
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,406
This isn't you, is it?

514
00:37:40,703 --> 00:37:43,048
You're making things quite difficult.

515
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:50,230
I heard Hwang Tae Kyung was
with Go Mi Nam during that time.

516
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:55,634
Then, I guess I can go ask Go Mi Nam
whether this is you or not.

517
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:57,369
Please, go ahead.

518
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,530
Now, then...

519
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,941
What has he sniffed out?

520
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:04,485
I'd better go talk to Hwang Tae Kyung.

521
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:10,512
After all, it wasn't Yoo He Yi.

522
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:15,528
Go Mi Nam will have already have matched up his story.

523
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,028
So how should I pierce through that?

524
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,637
<i>Now, now!</i>

525
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:25,015
<i>Have a conversation like you're good friends.</i>

526
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:27,127
<i>Ready, action!</i>

527
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,051
Go Mi Nam.

528
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:34,196
I didn't recognize you as a future pharmacist's wife.

529
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm not a pharmacist's wife.

530
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:36,658
Stop it.

531
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:42,089
Later on, why don't you send me vitamins
and supplements occasionally?

532
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,513
Considering the mishaps you got me into,
shouldn't you do at least that much?

533
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:51,973
Hyung-nim, we're supposed to act like
we're close friends in this scene.

534
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,055
You can give me a hard time later.

535
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,603
So you have the nerve now to give me warnings?

536
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,581
Even if you quit A.N.JELL,

537
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:03,034
You'll be a pharmacist's wife in the future,

538
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,033
So I guess you're not afraid of anything?

539
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:05,954
<i>Mi Nam!</i>

540
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:08,876
<i>Play like good friend and throw some leaves.</i>

541
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:13,833
Ha ha, Hyung-nim, cut it out.

542
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,016
Ha ha ha.

543
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,574
Ah, ah! Really!

544
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:26,691
Hey, hey...

545
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,614
That mood, it's good.

546
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:38,660
Like you're close friends. Like close friends.

547
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,462
<i>Cut!</i>

548
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:09,687
<i>Very nice!</i>

549
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:13,460
That last piggy nose was especially a nice touch.

550
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,856
Now, next scene!

551
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:25,223
Go Mi Nam,

552
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:27,244
Why are you doing that again?

553
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,978
I just thought it would be a funny to ad lib.

554
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:34,438
Thought it would be funny? Ha! Funny, my foot.

555
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,736
Just try that again, you little rabbit pig.

556
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:37,937
<i>Try it. Try it again.</i>

557
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:40,209
<i>Ah! Yoo He Yi is here.</i>

558
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,440
Right.

559
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:58,788
I heard the two of you put on a great act.

560
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,817
Oppa and Mi Nam, you guys are so good and natural.

561
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:06,585
Compared to your outstanding acting, we're just posers.

562
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:09,663
Oh, that's a compliment about my acting, isn't it, Oppa?

563
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:12,723
You've really gotten dusty. Is it because of the leaves?

564
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:26,153
I'm bad at acting and feel like my limbs are shriveling up, so let's cool the act.

565
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:28,009
Why? You were acting pretty well just now.

566
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,276
Laugh like you were earlier.

567
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:32,044
If your acting is good, I'll give you a prize.

568
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,517
That wasn't acting earlier.

569
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,314
So then you were laughing because of her?

570
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,070
Fine. Go ahead, laugh and have a good time.

571
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:46,463
I won't tell you what Reporter Kim suspects.

572
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:51,334
<i>Wow. That looks good.</i>

573
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:52,540
<i>Auntie, have you tried that?</i>

574
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:53,949
How can I eat that?

575
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,042
- Such a fresh-looking thing.
- Totally, fresh.

576
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:01,327
It's good!

577
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:02,523
It is good.

578
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:07,460
Hey, hey, now we need to get down to business.

579
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,234
Here. I thought you might want these,

580
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,780
So I brought a few things.

581
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,250
Now, let's see some excitement.

582
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:15,556
Pick, pick, pick.

583
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,394
This.

584
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:22,519
Oh. It's Jeremy's.

585
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:25,944
Jeremy oppa must have washed his face with this today.

586
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:26,792
What about this?

587
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:28,304
That's Shin Woo's.

588
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:30,522
Oh, it's Shin Woo oppa's razor!

589
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:32,928
I wish I could be his whiskers.

590
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:38,704
You don't have anything from Tae Kyung oppa?

591
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:41,399
Hey, Leader is like a phantom.

592
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,235
I touch his stuff and he'll know right away.

593
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:45,569
The supply stream would be cut off.

594
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,049
Instead, I'll give you some top secret info.

595
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:53,620
In my Mi Nam's music video, Leader...

596
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,350
Will be sporting a school uniform.

597
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:57,452
- A school uniform?
- Yeah.

598
00:42:57,453 --> 00:43:00,581
- Tae Kyung Oppa will be wearing a uniform like us?
- Yeah.

599
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:04,228
I bet he'll look so good!

600
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:07,557
Do you guys like them that much?

601
00:43:07,746 --> 00:43:09,249
The way I see them,

602
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,783
Those scrawny, soft, wimpy guys don't seem like much.

603
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:14,769
Soft and wimpy?

604
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,729
Nothing much? Ahjumma!

605
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,557
Ahjumma,

606
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:20,282
Don't you know they're legends?

607
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,495
Legends?

608
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:23,464
The A.N.JELL legends!

609
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:28,374
If you heard Kang Shin Woo's story,

610
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:31,279
You wouldn't be able to say "wimpy".

611
00:43:37,712 --> 00:43:39,316
<i>Look for more on him.</i>

612
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:03,357
<i>Aye, what the hell is this?</i>

613
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:09,654
<i>Get him!</i>

614
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:39,825
<i>Under Busan's Nampodong Overpass,</i>

615
00:44:39,826 --> 00:44:42,167
<i>Seventeen to one... Complete victory.</i>

616
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,598
<i>That's our Shin Woo oppa.</i>

617
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:49,423
That gentle little Mister Kang... fights?

618
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,434
Aye...

619
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:54,108
And if you heard Jeremy's legend,

620
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:57,356
You wouldn't be able to say "nothing much".

621
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,831
Jeremy!

622
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:15,861
<i>You've heard that Jeremy's grandfather
was a phenomenon in Scotland, haven't you?</i>

623
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:21,365
<i>Britain's 23rd in line for the throne,
Princess Amy, was Jeremy oppa's fiancée.</i>

624
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:40,490
So you're saying that little snail
gave up his princess to come to Korea and sing?

625
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:42,430
Aye...

626
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:47,030
From Princess Amy's point of view, it's sad,

627
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:49,818
But to us it's a blessing!

628
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:52,904
Aigoo, aigoo, you sure can tell the stories.

629
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:55,637
Then what's Leader's legend?

630
00:46:03,184 --> 00:46:07,112
There is an incredible mystery
around Tae Kyung oppa's birth.

631
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:12,603
They say his mother is a really famous
and beautiful woman.

632
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,011
But who she is, nobody knows except
Tae Kyung and his father.

633
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:21,279
Really?

634
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:22,020
Yes.

635
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,838
His birthday is even a mystery.

636
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:29,109
The day that his birthday is celebrated

637
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,351
Is just one that is told to the public,

638
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:34,697
But I hear it's not his real birthday.

639
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:38,172
Only those two people know his real birthday.

640
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:45,635
Yes, Father.

641
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:48,931
I didn't even realize it was my birthday.

642
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,171
Anyhow, there's another day that people celebrate it...

643
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:52,986
Today has no meaning to me.

644
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:55,104
<i>Still, I sent a gift.</i>

645
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:58,976
<i>I sent it so it would arrive today,
so you should be getting it.</i>

646
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:01,122
Did the Seattle performance go well?

647
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:04,599
And you and Joanna are doing well?

648
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:08,555
Give her my best.

649
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,603
Yes.

650
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:16,086
Couldn't he have just let it pass?

651
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,190
Why remember it every year
and make me think about it?

652
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:27,030
Aish, where did Hwang Tae Kyung go now?

653
00:47:27,823 --> 00:47:29,494
Is he with Go Mi Nam?

654
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:38,311
What's he doing?

655
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,728
With yet another guy...

656
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:45,076
Is she pretending to be a guy
so she can hang out with guys?

657
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,908
I'll be sure and wear these sneakers
as I go off to serve in the army.

658
00:47:57,402 --> 00:47:58,199
Here.

659
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:00,869
<i>Mi Nam.</i>

660
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:03,700
Have you seen Tae Kyung oppa?

661
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:06,732
Weren't the two of you filming together?

662
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:09,909
He took off right after we finished and I can't find him.

663
00:48:10,082 --> 00:48:11,852
And this is?

664
00:48:12,713 --> 00:48:14,764
I'm a high school friend of Mi Nam.

665
00:48:15,112 --> 00:48:17,987
Hey, I'm talking to a lot of famous
people today because of you.

666
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:19,113
Thanks, bud.

667
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:21,179
High school friend?

668
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:25,991
Mi Nam must be pretty different than he was in high school.

669
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:28,638
He's just like he was back then.

670
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:31,401
Ah, is that so?

671
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:33,175
Well, then...

672
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,701
Tch, what a pair.

673
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:41,283
Sending reporter Kim over would be pretty fun, I think.

674
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:45,447
Shall we see Go Mi Nam scared out of her wits?

675
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:46,188
Wow.

676
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,200
Thanks a lot, Mi Nam, really.

677
00:48:50,483 --> 00:48:52,862
What do you mean thanks? You're my friend.

678
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,809
Smell it.

679
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,462
And I'll smell yours.

680
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,086
Hey, hey!

681
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:02,147
<i>Huh?</i>

682
00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:09,124
Mi Nam,

683
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,002
Are these really your shoes?

684
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,410
Yes, why?

685
00:49:15,426 --> 00:49:16,742
It's nothing...

686
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,660
<i>Go Mi Nam?</i>

687
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,317
Dong Jun, take care,

688
00:49:26,077 --> 00:49:28,399
And when you get out, contact Go Mi Nam.

689
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:45,087
Mi Nam and I had the same shoe size.

690
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:48,776
Is there surgery to make your feet smaller?

691
00:49:53,928 --> 00:49:55,093
<i>Excuse me!</i>

692
00:49:58,058 --> 00:50:02,948
Yoo He Yi tells me you're Go Mi Nam's high school friend.

693
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:04,996
Is that correct?

694
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:12,008
So did you get a guarantee for that
pharmacist's wife position?

695
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,463
Don't tease me.

696
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:16,120
He's really a close friend of my brother's.

697
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,864
And you said your farewells?

698
00:50:17,878 --> 00:50:21,588
Yes, but his final expression didn't look so good.

699
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:23,996
I wonder if it was because he was sad.

700
00:50:23,997 --> 00:50:26,224
I even signed his shoe.

701
00:50:26,225 --> 00:50:30,873
Why not exchange shoes to seal your promise?

702
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:33,448
Shoes.

703
00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:40,262
Mi Nam,

704
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,328
Are these really your shoes?

705
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:46,783
The shoe size... is different.

706
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:51,549
My brother and I have really different sized feet.

707
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:06,694
It's a reporter.

708
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,643
Dong Jun has probably figured out I'm not my brother.

709
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:17,590
Go Mi Nam?

710
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:41,942
Mi Nam is my closest friend.

711
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:44,791
He's a good kid,

712
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:49,948
And a really cool... guy.

713
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:15,495
Since I'm going into the army tomorrow,
I won't be seeing any other people.

714
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:18,968
And you know I don't have loose lips, right?

715
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,406
I'll go then.

716
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,330
Take care, Mi Nam.

717
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:28,173
Goodbye, Dong Jun.

718
00:52:41,204 --> 00:52:45,694
I... really liked your sister.

719
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:52,165
Bye! Thanks!

720
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:06,960
That, that... She may really become a pharmacist's wife.

721
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:10,157
<i>Hwang Tae Kyung.</i>

722
00:53:13,955 --> 00:53:15,678
You brought your car, right?

723
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,722
I didn't bring mine. Give me a ride.

724
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:18,932
I came in the van.

725
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:19,725
I don't have a car.

726
00:53:19,747 --> 00:53:22,156
Really? Then take me in my car.

727
00:53:23,197 --> 00:53:25,960
Aren't you embarrassed,
changing your story in one breath?

728
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:27,575
You already know I'm like this.

729
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:29,347
So what do I need to be embarrassed about?

730
00:53:29,348 --> 00:53:33,068
As long as people who don't know
continue not to know, it doesn't matter.

731
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:35,795
I guess you're threatening, bullying,
true nature isn't entirely dishonest.

732
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,227
On that point, you're quite impressive.

733
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:39,410
I'm pretty impressive on another point.

734
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:43,477
It seemed like Reporter Kim was trailing
Go Mi Nam earlier, so I diverted him.

735
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:45,512
That's a threat, isn't it?

736
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,327
Think whatever you like.

737
00:53:47,649 --> 00:53:51,225
When people are looking, open
the door for me and drive for me.

738
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:56,583
If I ask you to carry my bag,
you won't, will you?

739
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:12,310
Hey, you think it's heavy?

740
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:14,280
<i>Can't you just carry it once?</i>

741
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:22,022
I can't bother Hyung-nim.

742
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,644
Mi Nam, we're taking off now.

743
00:54:56,072 --> 00:54:57,320
Did the filming go well?

744
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:58,609
Shin Woo hyung.

745
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:02,667
Kang Shin Woo sure is nice to Go Mi Nam.

746
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:05,383
He doesn't know she's a girl, does he?

747
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,180
If he found out, he'd probably feel pretty lousy.

748
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,181
I guess that's why she doesn't want Shin Woo to know.

749
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:16,162
Tae Kyung is leaving separately?

750
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:19,142
You didn't have to come. I can take the van.

751
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:23,623
Well, since I came all the way out here,
let's take my car.

752
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,719
Hwang Tae Kyung,

753
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,145
Aren't you hungry?

754
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:28,073
I'm not.

755
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:29,913
I'm hungry.

756
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,640
I have to have spaghetti.

757
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,578
If you go a little further,
there's this spaghetti place I like.

758
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:39,159
I want to eat their spaghetti, so stop there.

759
00:55:48,276 --> 00:55:49,329
Who's this?

760
00:55:52,872 --> 00:55:54,071
What are you calling about?

761
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,607
Let's meet today.

762
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:59,896
After all, I made a mistake at the restaurant that last time.

763
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,618
I won't forget today,
and I'll prepare properly,

764
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:04,216
So let's talk over a meal.

765
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:05,645
<i>Meet me there.</i>

766
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:15,174
Just like her to dictate a meeting
on her own schedule.

767
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:16,236
Who is it?

768
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:18,845
Where is the spaghetti place?

769
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:21,934
What? Over there. You can go in right here.

770
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:36,424
Hey!

771
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:41,765
I brought you like you asked.
Enjoy your spaghetti.

772
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:42,587
Hey!

773
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:43,521
Where are you going?!

774
00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:44,214
Hey!

775
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:48,039
Oppa, thanks for giving me a ride!

776
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,944
Bye!

777
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:54,727
Auntie,

778
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,408
How can you open Hyung-nim's package
from the states like this?

779
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:00,199
It was no big deal.

780
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:04,230
It's going to be opened anyway, whether by him or me...
Oh, I gotta go pee...

781
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,513
How am I going to tape this up so he can't tell?

782
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,644
<i>It's the record you wanted so much.</i>

783
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:27,686
<i>Happy birthday, from your father.</i>

784
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,000
Birthday?

785
00:57:31,984 --> 00:57:33,934
Is today his birthday?

786
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:46,258
Still, it's been ten years since
she called me on my birthday.

787
00:57:47,912 --> 00:57:50,709
<i>It's really been a long time
since I've released a record.</i>

788
00:57:50,713 --> 00:57:51,994
<i>- Is that true?
- Yes.</i>

789
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:53,263
<i>Congratulations.</i>

790
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:56,159
<i>- I'll need a lot of your help this time.
- Of course.</i>

791
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,185
Rather, you'll be helping us out.

792
00:57:59,565 --> 00:58:00,501
He's here.

793
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:06,152
Young Mr. Hwang Tae Kyung, you've come?

794
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:07,893
<i>I'm Reporter Choi from the Asia Times.</i>

795
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:10,474
I interviewed you before. Do you remember?

796
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,824
<i>We heard you were doing a remake of Mo Hwa Ran's song,</i>

797
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,014
<i>And we asked for an interview right away.</i>

798
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,232
<i>Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.</i>

799
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,667
Please have a seat. Let's talk while we eat.

800
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,174
You can't eat shrimp, right?

801
00:58:27,182 --> 00:58:29,258
<i>I was careful this time.</i>

802
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:33,216
Watching out for his food preferences and aversions...

803
00:58:33,332 --> 00:58:36,275
It seems that you two have a very close relationship.

804
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:42,648
I'm sorry. I have a personal matter and can't stay.

805
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:45,399
I'm sorry.

806
00:58:57,869 --> 00:58:59,402
It's good I saved it.

807
00:58:59,547 --> 00:59:02,902
I bet he'll like it as a birthday present.

808
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:04,172
Since he's a fan.

809
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:09,300
<i>Tae Kyung hyung is a fan of yours.</i>

810
00:59:09,301 --> 00:59:10,098
He is?

811
00:59:11,196 --> 00:59:12,092
My fan?

812
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:17,882
I've seen a bunch of your old movies
and records in his room.

813
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,841
Jeremy.

814
00:59:26,822 --> 00:59:28,731
Aren't we having a party today?

815
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,080
Huh? For what?

816
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:33,268
It's Tae Kyung hyung-nim's birthday.

817
00:59:34,892 --> 00:59:36,863
But today's not his birthday.

818
00:59:37,668 --> 00:59:40,928
We had a birthday party in the spring in May.

819
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:42,977
That's strange.

820
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:44,396
It said birthday.

821
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:47,934
I'll ask Hyung-nim when he comes in.

822
00:59:48,673 --> 00:59:51,707
Tae Kyung said he wasn't coming back tonight.

823
00:59:51,972 --> 00:59:56,686
He just told me on the phone that he was
going to work all night at the studio.

824
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,126
<i>Jolie.</i>

825
01:00:01,574 --> 01:00:04,964
Then why did his father send him a birthday gift?

826
01:00:17,203 --> 01:00:19,819
How dare you humiliate me like that.

827
01:00:20,403 --> 01:00:23,746
You were so angry about it that
you came all the way over here?

828
01:00:25,385 --> 01:00:29,714
I guess you're no longer afraid
that people will find out.

829
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:32,897
Right, I'm not afraid any longer.

830
01:00:34,781 --> 01:00:36,718
What do I have to lose?

831
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:41,913
Frankly, I'm considering revealing that you're my son.

832
01:00:44,268 --> 01:00:46,748
Then people will notice us more.

833
01:00:52,006 --> 01:00:55,288
What, are you afraid now?

834
01:01:08,494 --> 01:01:10,015
Where is he?

835
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:16,727
I don't want to this song I'm re-releasing to be overlooked.

836
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:20,063
<i>I want the world to take notice and listen to it.</i>

837
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:23,187
To that end, I need you.

838
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:29,510
Did you love him that much,
the writer of that song?

839
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,942
That love is the reason you abandoned me, isn't it?

840
01:01:38,746 --> 01:01:40,692
Don't mock me like that.

841
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:44,581
That was the most precious thing to me.

842
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:48,894
It was the most horrific thing to me.

843
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,773
Please go.

844
01:01:54,074 --> 01:01:56,061
But I gave birth to you!

845
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:06,198
Because of you, because I gave birth
to you, I lost what was precious to me.

846
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:12,503
Okay, you must have thought
it was horrific because I left you.

847
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,058
But when I lost him because of you,

848
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:21,383
it was horrific for me too.

849
01:02:26,965 --> 01:02:28,838
Since I gave birth to you,

850
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:35,285
At least help me to keep that love as a memory.

851
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:46,629
If you're going to claim some credit
for giving birth to me,

852
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,021
At least...

853
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:53,505
At the very least, you should have
remembered when that was.

854
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,624
Was it today?
