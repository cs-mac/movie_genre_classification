1
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,358  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:480 Y2:540
(Boy) Exiting time knot, sir.
(Man) We're... alive.

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,237  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:512 Y2:534
We made it.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,437  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:480 Y2:534
By Grabthar's hammer,
we live to tell the tale.

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,630  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:511 Y2:541
(Computer) 'Systems functional.'

5
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,711  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:512 Y2:541
All systems working, Commander.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,156  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:512 Y2:541
I don't like it. It was too easy.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,392  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:512 Y2:541
Wait! Oh, no. They're everywhere!

8
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,040  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Time knots are opening everywhere!
- A trap!

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,395  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:512 Y2:538
We're surrounded, Commander.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,112  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:480 Y2:541
It's a core meltdown, sir.
It can't be stopped.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,113  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Surrender may be our only option.
- No! Never give up!

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,031  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:512 Y2:534
Never surrender!

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,395  X1:253 X2:461 Y1:512 Y2:538
Your orders, sir?

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,315  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:512 Y2:534
Sir? Your orders?

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,518  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:541
Activate the Omega 13.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,519  X1:294 X2:427 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Applause)

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,239  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Man) Well? Huh?

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,993  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:512 Y2:541
Well, there you are.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,036  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Cheering)

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,391  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:480 Y2:541
Yeah! Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,948  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:511 Y2:541
You are the first people to see

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,511  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:480 Y2:541
the lost Galaxy Quest
episode 92 two-parter...

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,398  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:512 Y2:534
since it was aired in 1982!

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,789  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:512 Y2:541
Huh? Yeah! All right.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,792  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:541
Now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,758  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:512 Y2:541
The intrepid crew...

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,276  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:511 Y2:534
of the NSEA Protector! Yeah!

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,556  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:511 Y2:540
(Man) Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,995  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:511 Y2:538
White scarf, black buttons,

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,798  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:512 Y2:534
white shoes.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,678  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:480 Y2:534
Man, where is he?
An hour and a half late?

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,228  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:479 Y2:534
- An hour and a half.
- This is unreal.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,993  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:480 Y2:541
They're gonna start
eating each other.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,277  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:480 Y2:541
Did you hear?
He booked an appearance without us.

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,554  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:541
You're kidding?

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,638  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:512 Y2:534
Oh. Uh... um...

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,112  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:512 Y2:534
How did I come to this?

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,269  X1:297 X2:423 Y1:512 Y2:541
Not again.

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,113  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:480 Y2:534
- I played Richard III.
- Five curtain calls.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,272  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:480 Y2:538
Five curtain calls.
I was an actor once, now look at me!

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,399  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:541
I can't go out there, and I won't
say that stupid line one more time!

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,397  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:513 Y2:538
I can't, I won't.

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,277  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:512 Y2:541
At least you had a part.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,635  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:512 Y2:541
You had a character people loved.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,429  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:541
My TV Guide interview
was six paragraphs about my boobs

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,351  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:511 Y2:541
and how they fit into my suit.

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,477  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:480 Y2:534
No one even asked me
what I DO on the show.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,478  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:512 Y2:534
You had the...

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,516  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:511 Y2:538
Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,717  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:480 Y2:534
- I repeated the computer, Fred.
- Whew!

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,717  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:512 Y2:534
Your commander is on deck!

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,119  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:512 Y2:534
Ha ha!

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,873  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:512 Y2:541
Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,713  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:480 Y2:541
Am I late
for Alexander's panic attack?

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,597  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:512 Y2:541
Apparently not.

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,557  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:512 Y2:541
You should get that looked at.

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,437  X1:258 X2:463 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Chuckles) Yeah.

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,233  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:541
(MC outside)
Let's see a few more clips.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,710  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:512 Y2:534
OK. What did I do? Hmm?

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,869  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:512 Y2:534
What?

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,837  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Chanting) We want the crew!

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,559  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:511 Y2:540
(MC)... same affection for the crew

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,790  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:511 Y2:534
as the crew had for each other.

64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,670  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:480 Y2:541
These weren't just adventurers
exploring space. These were friends.

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,433  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Unbelievable.
- You are so full of it!

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,274  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:057 Y2:111
These guys put a little set
in their basement. I'm there an hour.

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,351  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:512 Y2:541
It's nothing, Gwen.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,032  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:512 Y2:541
They wanted the Commander.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,998  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:480 Y2:538
- There he goes.
- Alexander, wait! Grab him!

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,270  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Chanting) We want the crew!

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,830  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:512 Y2:541
OK! Yeah! Here we go!

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,309  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:056 Y2:111
- Come on, old friend.
- Old friend?!

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,358  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:057 Y2:118
You stole my lines -
cut me out of episode two!

74
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,910  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:541
(MC) Tawny Madison,
my personal favourite,

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,275  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:513 Y2:534
Gwen DeMarco!

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,112  X1:323 X2:392 Y1:512 Y2:534
Yeah!

'Lt's getting hotter, Commander.'

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,755  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:512 Y2:540
(MC) That's what I'm talkin' about!

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,595  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:056 Y2:118
Let's hear a warm welcome for
crack gunner Laredo... Tommy Webber!

80
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,275  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:480 Y2:534
- You will go out there!
- I won't.

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,989  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:480 Y2:541
- And nothing you say will make me.
- The show must go on.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,832  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:512 Y2:540
(MC)... Freddie Kwan!

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,556  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:513 Y2:541
Damn you.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,998  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:058 Y2:118
Damn you. I won't say
that stupid line one more time.

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,311  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:512 Y2:540
(MC) Tev'Meck... Alexander Dane!

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,595  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yeah! All right!

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,034  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:512 Y2:541
(MC) Yeah! All right!

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,877  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:512 Y2:541
That guy can act.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,635  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:511 Y2:541
And finally, my... fellow Questerians,

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,435  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:538

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,954  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:512 Y2:541

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,950  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:540

101
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,635  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:480 Y2:541
Damn the resonance cannons,
full speed ahead! Huh?

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,028  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:480 Y2:541

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,918  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:480 Y2:534

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,151  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:481 Y2:541
Excuse me,

106
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,913  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:480 Y2:541

do you? It's the sunglasses.

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,480  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:512 Y2:541
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,439  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:480 Y2:534
Got killed by a lava monster
before the first commercial.

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,116  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:480 Y2:541
Listen, uh... maybe I could sit in
and, uh, sign some autographs?

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,113  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:480 Y2:541
By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons
of Warvan, I shall avenge you!

113
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,596  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:541
By Grabthar's...

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,673  X1:328 X2:392 Y1:513 Y2:534
Next.

115
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,718  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:480 Y2:538
Had I moved an inch
the beast would have killed me,

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,756  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:512 Y2:541
but my crew was in danger.

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,990  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:512 Y2:541
How did you know what to do?

118
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,550  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:480 Y2:538
Come on! Without my crew,
I'm not a commander, huh?

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,757  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:541
And we all remember
what happened on Enok Vll.

120
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,796  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Laughter)

121
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,555  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:541
You've gotta admit,
they really do love him.

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,393  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:511 Y2:534
Almost as much as he loves himself.

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,674  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:512 Y2:541
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!

124
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,311  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:479 Y2:541
I was wondering if you could help
settle a dispute my crew and I have.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,631  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:479 Y2:538
Um, if you remember,
uh, in "Quasar Dilemma..."

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,473  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:511 Y2:538
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,075  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:512 Y2:534
What about the relevant conundrum?

128
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,072  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:511 Y2:541
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos V"

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,153  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:479 Y2:541
I got the feeling that you
and the Commander had a thing.

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,719  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:512 Y2:541
Did you?

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,633  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:480 Y2:541
No. The Commander and I
never had a thing.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,439  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:512 Y2:541
Well, that's her story.

133
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,832  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:513 Y2:534
Excuse me.

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,912  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:513 Y2:534
Gwen.

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,709  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:513 Y2:534
Gwen!

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,592  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:513 Y2:534
Gwen!

137
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,517  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Commander.
- Excuse me.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,876  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:480 Y2:541
I must speak to you.
It is of supreme importance.

139
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,509  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:480 Y2:541
We are Thermians
and... we... need your help.

140
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,910  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:480 Y2:541
Oh, oh, oh.
Is this about that gig tomorrow?

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,788  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:480 Y2:534
Hammer it out with my agent,
and make sure there's a limo.

142
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,839  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:479 Y2:541
Last time I did one of these gigs,
they shoved me in a Toyota.

143
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,275  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:512 Y2:538
Remember, mum's the word.

144
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,073  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Certainly, but um...
- Mum.

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,839  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:512 Y2:540
(All) Mum. Mum. Mu-um.

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,471  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:511 Y2:541
(Photographer) And... Beautiful!

147
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,356  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:480 Y2:541
Crewman Madison,
the mist of this strange planet

148
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,159  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:479 Y2:541
is filling my head
with such thoughts.

149
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,118  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:512 Y2:541
It was cute when I didn't know you.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,271  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Laughter)

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,512  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:479 Y2:538
What a freak show, man.
Oh, this is hilarious.

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,434  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:479 Y2:541
Bunch of losers! Beggin'
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.

153
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,035  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:480 Y2:541
These guys haven't had
a real acting job for 20 years.

154
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,671  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:479 Y2:541
Nesmith gets off on those retards
thinking he's a space commander!

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,430  X1:139 X2:581 Y1:479 Y2:541
And his friends can't stand him!
Did you hear them ragging on him?

156
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,274  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:480 Y2:534
He has no idea he's a laughing stock,
even to his buddies.

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,316  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:480 Y2:534
- He's pathetic!
- Come on.

158
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,355  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:480 Y2:541
- The Galaxy Quest Dancers are on.
- Whoo! Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.

159
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,192  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hey, Commander, uh,

160
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,159  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:480 Y2:541
so in "The Quasar Dilemma"
you used the auxiliary deck B...

161
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:480 Y2:541
Get this...
Deck B for gamma override.

162
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,718  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:480 Y2:541
But the online
blueprints indicate...

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,429  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:541
that deck B is independent
of the guidance matrix.

164
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,590  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:512 Y2:534
So where is the error in that?

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,116  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:480 Y2:538
It's just a television show.
That's all, OK?

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,432  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:480 Y2:541
Right, but... We were wondering
if the quantum flux...

167
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,197  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:479 Y2:541
There is no quantum flux. There's no
auxiliary. There's no goddam ship!

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,032  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:512 Y2:541
You got it?

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,636  X1:284 X2:438 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Murmuring)

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,755  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:480 Y2:534
I mean it, Alex. I've never seen him
lose it like that. Not to a fan.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,831  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:512 Y2:541
I mean, it was just weird.

172
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,152  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:511 Y2:541
Gwen, I have said it for years.

173
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,151  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:512 Y2:541
He's mentally unstable.

174
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,800  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Sighs) I... l'm worried.

175
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,478  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:512 Y2:541
It just was not like him.

176
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,317  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Fighting on TV)

177
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,196  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Changes channels)

178
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,557  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:512 Y2:541
'As long as there is injustice,

179
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,393  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:480 Y2:538
'whenever a Targathian baby

187
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,715  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Can I help you?
- Sir, this is terrible protocol.

188
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,634  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
- You shouldn't come here, man.
- I beg you to hear our plea.

189
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,393  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:534
We are Thermians
from the Klatu Nebula.

190
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,632  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
Our people are being slaughtered
by Sarris of Fatu-Krey.

191
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,396  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:480 Y2:534
We have met in negotiation. However,
our efforts have been disastrous.

192
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,837  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:480 Y2:541
Please, Commander.
You are our last hope.

- What?

195
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,914  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:512 Y2:538
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,073  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:480 Y2:541
Um, it's the thing

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,520  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:512 Y2:541
Ha. Maybe I should get some pants on.

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,436  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:512 Y2:534

- Commander,

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,711  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:541
I must say that
standing here in your presence...

201
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,873  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:480 Y2:541
is the greatest honour we
could ever have hoped to achieve.

202
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,394  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:512 Y2:541
That's... I really appreciate that.

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,392  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:480 Y2:534
Would you look
for another shoe like this?

senior requisition officer.

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,199  X1:142 X2:578 Y1:480 Y2:538
- Weapons, documents, personnel.
- Um, a Coca-Cola?

208
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,636  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:512 Y2:538
Sir, I am Teb.

209
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,829  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:541
I would like to explain
our history in greater detail.

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,195  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hey, how ya doin'?

211
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,353  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:479 Y2:541
In the years following the Great
Nebula Burst, our people were one...

212
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,590  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:512 Y2:541
What's your name?

213
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,355  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Doesn't she talk?

214
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,829  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Shrieks)

215
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,039  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:512 Y2:541
Okey dokey.

216
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,830  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:541
You know, guys, I had a late night
with a Kreemorian fangor beast

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,708  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:480 Y2:541
so... l'm gonna just
shut my eyes for a bit.

218
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,839  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:480 Y2:541
Go on. You know? I'm listening
to everything you say, OK?

219
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,078  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:480 Y2:541
Following the Great Nebula Burst
our people were one people.

220
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,870  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:480 Y2:534
But then came the Zactor Migration,
and then the Melosian Shift

221
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,919  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:479 Y2:541
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land.

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,551  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:541
Fighting among Treeb sects
and Largoths... ah, the foolishness!

223
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,235  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:480 Y2:534
And it was in this time
of dissension that Sarris...

224
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,716  X1:316 X2:405 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Barks)

225
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,755  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Commander. Commander?
- Hmm.

226
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,868  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:541
I'm sorry, sir, but your presence
is requested on the command deck.

227
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,878  X1:333 X2:385 Y1:513 Y2:534
Mm.

228
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,511  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:480 Y2:541
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline.
We are approaching his ship now.

229
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,875  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:512 Y2:541
He wants an answer to his proposal.

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,594  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:479 Y2:541
I got most of it.
Sarris is the bad guy?

231
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,194  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yes, sir. He's a very bad man indeed.

232
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,396  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:512 Y2:538
He has tortured our scientists,

233
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,916  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:479 Y2:541
captured our females
for his own demented purposes...

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,231  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:541
Yeah. Do you have pages
or should I just wing this?

235
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,550  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:512 Y2:541
I am not sure I understand you.

236
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,835  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Welcome to Protector Two.
- Hi.

237
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,111  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:479 Y2:541
- Would you like your uniform?
- I'll skip that,

238
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,839  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:480 Y2:534
I got this gig in Van Nuys
in 15 minutes.

239
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,993  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:480 Y2:538
- As you wish.
- Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.

240
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,473  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:541
General, the Thermians
have appointed a new commander

241
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,835  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:512 Y2:541
to handle the negotiations.

242
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,911  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:512 Y2:534
What?

243
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,239  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:480 Y2:541
This is great. Usually it's
just cardboard walls in the garage.

244
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,154  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
Sir, we apologise
for operating in low-power mode

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,915  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:534
but we are experiencing
a... reflective flex field.

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,357  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:480 Y2:541
You know what I could use?
A cup holder and a couple of Advil.

247
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,635  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:512 Y2:541
Approaching, sir. Command to slow?

248
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,188  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:512 Y2:534
Set it on screensaver two.

249
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,154  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Chuckles) We, you know... gotta...

250
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,755  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Groans) Oh, I'm sorry
to break up the mood here.

251
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,593  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:534
Um, slow it down to mark two,
Lieutenant.

252
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,631  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:511 Y2:540
(Sarris) 'I see fear.

253
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,439  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:480 Y2:534
- 'That is expected.'
- Mm-hm.

254
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,672  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:480 Y2:541
- 'Ahh, they bring a new commander.'
- It's good.

255
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,196  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:541
- 'Here are my demands.'
- Scary. It looks... real.

256
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,874  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:511 Y2:534
'And if I do not hear what I like

257
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,193  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:480 Y2:541
'then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine! '

258
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,669  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:480 Y2:538
- 'First... '
- Ahh, backwash.

259
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,955  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:512 Y2:541
'I require the Omega 13.

260
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,589  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:480 Y2:534
'Second, I will require
a technician... '

261
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,673  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:479 Y2:541
Okey dokey! Let's fire
blue particle cannons full,

262
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,557  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:511 Y2:541
red particle cannons full,

263
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,349  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:479 Y2:534
gannet magnets, left and right
and let 'em run all chutes.

264
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,671  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:480 Y2:538
And while you're at it,
toss that at 'em, killer!

265
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,394  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:480 Y2:534
That should
take care of lobster head.

266
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,993  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Nervous chuckle)

267
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,276  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:512 Y2:541
Commander, where are you going?

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,231  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:481 Y2:534
- Home.
- You... mean Earth?

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,151  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:512 Y2:538
Yeah, back to Earth, kids.

270
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,038  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:480 Y2:541
But the negotiations,
y-you fired on him.

271
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,395  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yeah. What's your planet called?

272
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,630  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Thermia.
- Long live Thermia.

273
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,358  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:511 Y2:534
What if Sarris survives?

274
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,193  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:480 Y2:541
- I doubt it.
- He has a very powerful ship.

275
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,192  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:479 Y2:541
If you got any more problems,
give me a call.

276
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,838  X1:336 X2:381 Y1:513 Y2:534
Ow!

277
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,075  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:480 Y2:541
- An interstellar vox.
- A what? Hey.

278
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,598  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:480 Y2:541
How can we thank you, Commander?
You... You have saved our people.

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,437  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:480 Y2:541
Yeah. OK. You know, you kids
have been great. You really have.

280
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,590  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:512 Y2:541
This thing is real lookin'.

281
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,433  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:512 Y2:540
Yoo-hoo. Hello? (Chuckles)

282
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,193  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hey! Where's my limo?

283
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,277  X1:329 X2:390 Y1:512 Y2:534
Huh?

284
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,796  X1:276 X2:446 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Heavy clunk)

285
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,990  X1:283 X2:436 Y1:480 Y2:534
- (Slurping)
- Oh!

286
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,076  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:511 Y2:541
(Muffled groans)

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,275  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Machinery whines)

288
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,635  X1:299 X2:422 Y1:513 Y2:540
(Screams)

289
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,668  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:479 Y2:534
(Gwen, on PA) Take it from us,
we've been all over the universe.

290
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,753  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Fred) But we've never seen
space-age values like these, at...

291
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,991  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:512 Y2:541
Tech Value Electronic Superstore!

292
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,478  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:512 Y2:541
By Grabthar's hammer...

293
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,876  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:541
what a savings.

294
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,349  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:480 Y2:534
All right! Yeah,
let's hear it for the NSEA Protector.

295
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,353  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:480 Y2:541
...vacuum laser...
- No, you've got it all wrong.

296
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,991  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Brandon, are you OK?
- Oh, Commander! My apologies.

297
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,629  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:480 Y2:541
Evidently, we had
a miscommunication regarding...

298
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,917  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:512 Y2:541
the voyage - you didn't show up.

299
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,797  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Panting)

300
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,031  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Boy) He... He did it again.

301
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,350  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:480 Y2:541
Do you know what time it is? Why do
you even bother to show up at all?

302
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,671  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:512 Y2:541
No, no, not now. Guys, I was there.

303
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,716  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:512 Y2:541
I was up there.

304
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,315  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:541
Remember those people dressed
like aliens? They were aliens.

305
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,790  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:480 Y2:541
Termites or Dalmatians.
I can't remember cos I was hungover.

306
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,032  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:480 Y2:541
What they'd built was extraordinary.
It was a huge spaceship.

307
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,795  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:479 Y2:534
I got to fight this guy named Sarris
and I kicked his ass!

308
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,393  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:480 Y2:541
I know what you think. But I can
prove it. They gave me this.

309
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,357  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:481 Y2:541
No, no, no, no. But can you
talk to people in space on those?

310
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,635  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:512 Y2:538
Protector, this is the Commander!

311
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,553  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:480 Y2:541
- For God's sake.
- That's it. Time to go!

312
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,599  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:534
This isn't mine.
That kid. Where's that kid?

313
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,877  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:480 Y2:534
Commander, we come with news.
Sarris lives.

314
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,269  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:480 Y2:534
- He was able to escape.
- Tell them.

315
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,432  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:480 Y2:541
However, he wishes
to negotiate a surrender.

316
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,195  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
We humbly implore you
to come and negotiate the terms.

317
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,430  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:512 Y2:534
Huh? You want me back?

318
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,559  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:480 Y2:541
Is this amazing? They want me back
and I want you guys to come!

319
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,949  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:512 Y2:541
Think about it. Let's go. Yes!

320
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,156  X1:224 X2:490 Y1:512 Y2:541
You're... you're goin'?

321
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,276  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:512 Y2:541
Alexander... l'm not kidding.

322
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,669  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:480 Y2:541
This isn't a prank.
I'm not kidding.

323
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,558  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:480 Y2:538
Guys, listen.
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.

324
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,349  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:480 Y2:541
Stop. You know me, I'm a lot
of things, but am I crazy?

325
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,795  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:512 Y2:541
It's one thing to treat us this way.

326
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,678  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:480 Y2:541
It's another thing
to do it to your fans.

327
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,673  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:479 Y2:534
She's not a fan!
This is... This is a Termite!

328
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,069  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:512 Y2:541
You should've just let me hit him.

329
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,994  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:480 Y2:541
Boy, I didn't know
you could get that loaded.

330
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,117  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:480 Y2:541
I think we should've
just taken the gig.

331
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,634  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:534
Who knows
the next time he'll ask us?

332
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,117  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:480 Y2:541
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really
think he was talking about a job?

333
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,911  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:512 Y2:541
Did Jason come through here?

334
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,753  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yeah, he... he's in there. Hey, guys.

335
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,276  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:512 Y2:541
Ah. We are coming, too.

336
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,148  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:480 Y2:541
- You wish to go to the ship?
- Yes, we wish to go to the ship.

337
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,198  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:480 Y2:534
You see, we work together,
or not at all.

338
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,035  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:479 Y2:541
Wonderful. The Commander had me
continue in case you decided to.

339
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,432  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:479 Y2:538
- Request four interstellar...
- Oh! Me, too.

340
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,835  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:511 Y2:541
Five pods for immediate departure.

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,230  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Deep humming)

342
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,920  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:513 Y2:541
Guys. Guys?

343
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,879  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:479 Y2:541
I look forward to meeting you
when you arrive at the ship.

344
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,518  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:512 Y2:534
End transmission.

345
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,188  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Slurping)
- Oh, my God.

346
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,878  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:481 Y2:541
- (Zap)
- Anybody got any change?

347
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,233  X1:338 X2:379 Y1:512 Y2:534
Oh!

348
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,072  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Distant shrieking)

349
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,750  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Shrieking)

350
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,190  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:512 Y2:541
(lnstruments whirring)

351
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,355  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:479 Y2:541
Our most sincere apologies. We forgot
about our appearance generators.

352
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,998  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:513 Y2:541
You guys came!

353
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,877  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:512 Y2:541
Who wants the grand tour?

354
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,709  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Screaming stops)
- Anybody else?

355
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,156  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:511 Y2:541
That was a hell of a thing.

356
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,433  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:534
- What's wrong with them?
- I don't know. Come on.

357
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,709  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:479 Y2:541
That's right, shake it off.
It gets better.

358
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,354  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Try some gum. It helps.
- Where are we?

359
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,150  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:480 Y2:541
The 23rd quadrant
of the gamma sector. I'll show you.

360
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,277  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:479 Y2:538
- My friends!
- This is Mathesar, their leader.

361
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,515  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:479 Y2:541
On behalf of my people I thank you
from the deepest place in our hearts.

362
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,114  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:512 Y2:541
Mathesar, this is, uh, my crew.

363
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,592  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:513 Y2:534
Dr Lazarus.

364
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,672  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:534
(Crew whispering)
Dr Lazarus. Dr Lazarus.

365
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,238  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:512 Y2:534
Lieutenant Madison.

366
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,788  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Whispering) Lieutenant Madison.

367
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,917  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:512 Y2:541
Young Laredo, how you've grown.

368
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,672  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:512 Y2:541
(All) Young Laredo.

369
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,758  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:512 Y2:541
Tech Sergeant Chen.

370
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,513  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Crew whispering) Tech Sergeant Chen.

371
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,359  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:512 Y2:541
C-Crew man number si... Guy.

372
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,396  X1:302 X2:420 Y1:512 Y2:541
(All) Guy.

373
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,677  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:512 Y2:534
You... know us?

374
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,876  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:512 Y2:540
(All chuckle)

375
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,111  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:541
I don't believe
anyone on my planet does not.

376
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,193  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:480 Y2:541
Since receiving transmission
of your historical documents

377
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,795  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:480 Y2:541
we have studied
all of your missions and strategies.

378
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,552  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:512 Y2:534
You watch the show?

379
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,237  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Lieutenant, historical documents.
- Historical documents from out here?

380
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,232  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:480 Y2:541
Yes. Our society
had fallen into disarray.

381
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,828  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:512 Y2:541
Our goals and values were scattered.

382
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,835  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:480 Y2:541
But we have modelled every aspect
of our society from your example,

383
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,876  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:512 Y2:534
and it has saved us.

384
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,397  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:480 Y2:541
Your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity.

385
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,436  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:512 Y2:541
All you see has been taken

386
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,229  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:479 Y2:534
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents.

387
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,794  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:512 Y2:541
Is this a... a spaceship?

388
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,873  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:511 Y2:541
No, this is a starport for the ship.

389
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,315  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:512 Y2:541
Would you guys like to see the ship?

390
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,677  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Door whooshes)

391
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,356  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Clunking and whirring)

392
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,755  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Alexander) Oh, my God!

393
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,075  X1:310 X2:412 Y1:512 Y2:534
It's real.

394
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,191  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Mathesar) The generator room.

395
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,153  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:511 Y2:541
The beryllium sphere, of course.

396
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,198  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:511 Y2:541
The medical quarters are to the left.

397
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,831  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:480 Y2:541
We went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system...

398
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,232  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:480 Y2:538
- Jason, what have you got us into?
- Wow, the floors are so clean.

399
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,517  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:480 Y2:541
We're just negotiating a surrender.
No big deal.

400
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,559  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:479 Y2:541
...and the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely.

401
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,031  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:480 Y2:541
No big deal? Are you crazy?
We have to get out of here.

402
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,795  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:481 Y2:538
- Come on, guys.
- We're actors, not astronauts.

403
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,635  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:480 Y2:541
You guys wanna go home, we'll go
home - pay our bills, feed our fish,

404
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,872  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:479 Y2:534
fall asleep in front of the TV
and miss out on all this.

405
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,560  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:481 Y2:541
Come on.
Do you guys wanna do that? Anybody?

406
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,399  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gwen, look where we are.
We're in space.

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,632  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:480 Y2:534
Alexander, this is the role
of a lifetime. You wanna leave?

408
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,759  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Mathesar) We have prepared
many of your esoteric dishes.

409
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,116  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:480 Y2:534
Your Monte Cristo sandwich
is a favourite here.

410
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,151  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:512 Y2:534
The main barracks.

411
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,511  X1:292 X2:429 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Drum roll)

412
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,236  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:513 Y2:534
At ease.

413
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,436  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:480 Y2:534
It's like throwing gasoline
on a flame.

414
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,957  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:512 Y2:534
What?

415
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,152  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:541
I'm just jazzed
about being on the show, man.

416
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,752  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:479 Y2:541
(Mathesar) If you would
take your positions.

417
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,472  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Gwen) Our what?

418
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,879  X1:326 X2:392 Y1:513 Y2:541
Guys.

419
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,956  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:540
(All) Oh. Hmm.

420
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,391  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Tommy) Look, this thingy.

421
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,873  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:512 Y2:534
I remember... I had it all worked out.

422
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,838  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:511 Y2:534
This is forward. This is back.

423
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,797  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Humming)

424
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,112  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:541
Commander, some the crew want
to be present at this historic event.

425
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,518  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sure. Bring 'em in.

426
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,955  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Shrieks)

427
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,192  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Chuckles) No pressure, huh?
I'm glad I ain't the Commander.

428
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,995  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:512 Y2:538
Laredo, take us out.

429
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,957  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:481 Y2:540
- Excuse me?
- (Chuckles)

430
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,352  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:541
They designed those
controls after watching you.

431
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,955  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Take her out. (Clears throat)
- Right, right.

432
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,031  X1:338 X2:379 Y1:513 Y2:534
OK.

433
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,633  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:512 Y2:541
Right.

434
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,877  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:512 Y2:541
Right. Take her out.

435
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,715  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Clunking and humming)

436
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,950  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Engines rumble)

437
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,356  X1:313 X2:409 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Beeps)

438
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,556  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Engine hum rises)

439
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,797  X1:338 X2:379 Y1:513 Y2:534
OK.

440
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,598  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:512 Y2:541
Move more to the right.

441
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,797  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:480 Y2:534
Would you sit your ass down? Move!
You wanna drive?

442
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,791  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Metal scraping)

443
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,150  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Chuckles nervously)

444
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,076  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Metal scraping)

445
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,116  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Scraping stops)

446
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,709  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Cheering)

447
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,395  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Jason) Oh. Mmm.

448
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,915  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:512 Y2:541
How is your steak, Commander?

449
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,635  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:480 Y2:534
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

450
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,317  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:479 Y2:541
We programmed the food synthesiser
based on the menu of your birthplace.

451
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,073  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Jason) I don't care,
it tastes great.

452
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,197  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:480 Y2:534
Are your Kep-mok bloodticks,
Dr Lazarus?

453
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,635  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:512 Y2:540
Just like Mother used to make.

454
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,639  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Alexander) So... tell me, Mathesar,

455
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,234  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:512 Y2:541
this Sarris person we're meeting.

456
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,595  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:480 Y2:541
What does he want?
- (Gagging)

457
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,150  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:541
He heard about the device...
the Omega 13.

458
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,913  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:512 Y2:538
Um, what is it? What does it do?

459
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,230  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:534
We don't know.

460
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,914  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:480 Y2:541
We were hoping
you could enlighten us.

461
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,036  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Nervous chuckle)

462
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,316  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh. The Omega 13 device.

463
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,632  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:479 Y2:534
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

464
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,716  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:512 Y2:541
Why not just turn it on and see?

465
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,631  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Shrieks)
- (Laughs)

466
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,793  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:480 Y2:541
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

467
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,032  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:479 Y2:534
If we were mistaken, the device
would cause a chain reaction...

468
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,510  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:480 Y2:534
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

469
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,395  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:479 Y2:534
Has Sarris seen any of the...
historical records?

470
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,357  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:512 Y2:538
No, thank God, he has not.

471
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,195  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:480 Y2:541
Oh. So how does he know
about the Omega 13 device?

472
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,432  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:479 Y2:541
Our former commander
was not... strong.

473
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,953  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:512 Y2:534
Former commander?

474
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,513  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:512 Y2:541
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.

475
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,796  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:480 Y2:541
The tape was smuggled
off of Sarris' ship.

476
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,314  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:511 Y2:541
Originally, one of us tried to lead.

477
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,960  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Sarris) 'ls that all?

478
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,397  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:479 Y2:541
'After three days of this,
you still require... incentive? '

479
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,119  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Shrieking)
- (Electricity buzzing)

480
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,671  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:480 Y2:538
(Thermian) 'I have told you
all I know. Please, let me die.'

481
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,072  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:479 Y2:541
(Sarris) 'When I grow weary of
the noises you make you shall... die.'

482
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,151  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Electricity crackles)

483
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,913  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:480 Y2:534
Guys, hold on. You can't leave.
Give me time to think.

484
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,834  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
- He wants to think(!)
- There's nothing to think about!

485
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,912  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:480 Y2:541
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm expendable.

486
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,788  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:480 Y2:541
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove it's serious.

487
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,714  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Commander?
- Prepare the pods for my crew.

488
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,318  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:480 Y2:541
Sir, we can't. Sarris will detonate
any objects leaving the ship.

489
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,550  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:480 Y2:538
- Sarris?
- Yes, sir. He's here.

490
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,712  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:480 Y2:534
Your presence is required
on the command deck.

491
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,116  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:512 Y2:541
There's nobody here.

492
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,998  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:512 Y2:541
My people are talented scientists,

493
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,789  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:480 Y2:534
but our tactical simulations
have been disastrous.

494
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,713  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:480 Y2:541
I have raised Sarris
on zeta frequency.

495
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,156  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Mathesar...
- 'We meet again, Commander.'

496
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,590  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hello, Sarris. How you doin'?

497
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,910  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Better than my lieutenant.

498
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,793  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:479 Y2:534
'He failed to activate
the neutron armour

499
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,509  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:534
'as quickly as I'd hoped
on our last encounter.'

500
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,030  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:480 Y2:541
Well, I'm real sorry
about what happened before.

501
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,874  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:480 Y2:541
The whole thing was just a...
a misunderstanding.

502
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,909  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:480 Y2:541
'Deliver the device to me,
or I will destroy your ship! '

503
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,719  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:512 Y2:538
You know, um, we'd like do that,

504
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,759  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:479 Y2:534
but frankly, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

505
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,354  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:534
'You have 10 seconds! '

506
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Jason) I don't... 10 seconds?

507
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,709  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:541
You know... OK. Gosh darn it,
I give up. It's yours.

508
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,679  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:480 Y2:541
Give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, OK?

509
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,751  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:512 Y2:541
Gwen. (Clicks tongue)

510
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,356  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:480 Y2:541
Don't panic. I've dealt with this guy
before. He's as stupid as he is ugly.

511
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,512  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:481 Y2:538
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

512
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,955  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:512 Y2:541
We're gonna send everything at him.

513
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,678  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:481 Y2:538
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen!

514
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,672  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:480 Y2:541
Push these
and send everything at him, OK?

515
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,197  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:481 Y2:541
- OK.
- All right, Gwen, put me back on.

516
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,556  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:480 Y2:541
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you ARE back on.

517
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,997  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:480 Y2:541
'Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander! '

518
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,596  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:512 Y2:541
I gave you the..."kill" gesture.

519
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,515  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:480 Y2:541
No, you gave me the "we're dead"
signal. I was agreeing with you.

520
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,556  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Guy) Hey, you guys.

521
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,950  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:512 Y2:541
There's a red, uh, thingy...

522
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,191  X1:139 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:534
- movin' towards the green thingy.
- What?

523
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,909  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:480 Y2:541
Red thingy
moving towards the green thingy...

524
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,197  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:480 Y2:541
I think... I think
we're the green thingy.

525
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,511  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:479 Y2:534
'A little present for you,
Commander.'

526
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,158  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:512 Y2:541
Move this ship! Go!

527
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,476  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:513 Y2:540

528
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,555  X1:291 X2:430 Y1:512 Y2:541

one thing and do another.

618
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,156  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:480 Y2:541
It is a concept we are learning
at some great cost.

619
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,519  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:479 Y2:534

have traits in common with Sarris...

00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,593  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:480 Y2:541
Though I am Thermian, I have
lived my life by your philosophy,

634
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,557  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:511 Y2:541
by the code of the Mak'tar.

635
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,952  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Oh, good, that's very nice.
- By Grabthar's hammer, Dr L...

636
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,510  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Don't! I'm not kidding.
- Sorry, sir, I was only...

637
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,477  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:512 Y2:540
Just don't.

638
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,397  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:512 Y2:538
Yes, sir.

639
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,109  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:512 Y2:541
Never give up, never surrender.

640
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,316  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:481 Y2:541
Dr Lazarus?
Here is your surface mapper.

641
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,755  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:512 Y2:541
I have programmed the co-ordinates

642
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,713  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:479 Y2:541
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density.

643
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,472  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:512 Y2:538
Good luck, sir.

644
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,753  X1:311 X2:404 Y1:512 Y2:534
Thanks.

645
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,074  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:512 Y2:541
You're doing good, Tommy.

646
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,875  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:512 Y2:541
I changed my mind. I wanna go back.

647
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,191  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:479 Y2:541
After the fuss you made
about getting left behind?

648
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,590  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:541
But I thought I was the crewman
that stays on the ship

649
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,671  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:512 Y2:541
and something up there kills me.

650
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,594  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:479 Y2:541
But what if I'm the guy who's
killed by a monster when we land?

651
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,117  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:480 Y2:541
- You won't die on the planet, Guy.
- I'm not? Then what's my last name?

652
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,317  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:512 Y2:538
It's, uh, uh... I don't know.

653
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,436  X1:146 X2:574 Y1:512 Y2:541
Nobody knows! Do you know why?

654
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,149  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:480 Y2:541
Because my character
isn't important enough.

655
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,959  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:480 Y2:534
Because I'm gonna die
five minutes in.

656
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,996  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:512 Y2:541
Guy, you have a last name.

657
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,157  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:481 Y2:534
- Do I?! Do I?!
- Yes!

658
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,471  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:480 Y2:541
For all you know,
I'm just crewman number six.

659
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,394  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:513 Y2:541
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

660
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,072  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:512 Y2:541
Are we there yet?

661
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,395  X1:263 X2:458 Y1:481 Y2:541
(Guy) Mommy!
(Jason) Tommy!

662
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,830  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:480 Y2:540
(Gwen) Look out! Oh, no!
(Alexander) Pull out!

663
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,837  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Fred) Oh, yeah!

664
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,309  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, boy! Yeah!

665
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,990  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Guy) Don't open that!
It's an alien planet!

666
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,150  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:512 Y2:534
Is there air? You don't know!

667
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,437  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:513 Y2:534
Seems OK.

668
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,151  X1:286 X2:434 Y1:513 Y2:541
Here we go.

669
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,390  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Jason) Which way, Alexander?

670
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,637  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Beeping)

671
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,113  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:512 Y2:541
This way!

672
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,557  X1:300 X2:415 Y1:512 Y2:534
Wait. No.

673
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,998  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:480 Y2:541
- That way.
- You were holding it upside down.

674
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,232  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Shut up.
- I actually thought you were smart.

675
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,356  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:512 Y2:538
You could do better, Laredo?

676
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,910  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:479 Y2:541
(Tommy) Stop that Laredo stuff.
(Guy) We're screwed.

677
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,753  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:481 Y2:534
(Jason) Come on,
use some self-control.

678
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,032  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:479 Y2:541
(Gwen) That's funny from a guy
who slept with every slave girl

679
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,156  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:512 Y2:541
AND moon princess on the show.

680
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,959  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:479 Y2:541
(Jason) If you'd
been more supportive...

681
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,198  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Alexander) Wow. Must be
some sort of mining facility.

682
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,872  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:534
Where are the miners?

683
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,315  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:512 Y2:541
Something bad happened here.

684
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,476  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:512 Y2:541
Will you relax?

685
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,472  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:480 Y2:541
There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.

686
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,719  X1:314 X2:407 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Gasps)

687
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,233  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Alien chattering)

688
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,791  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:512 Y2:534
Look at that.

689
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,030  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:512 Y2:541
Would you look at that?

690
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,871  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:512 Y2:541
They look like little children.

691
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,075  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:512 Y2:541
Could they be the miners?

692
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,998  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sure, they're like, three years old.

693
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,956  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:512 Y2:538
Miners, not minors!

694
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,355  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:480 Y2:534
- You lost me.
- I don't like this.

695
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,591  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:480 Y2:541
- I don't like this at all.
- They are so cute.

696
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,559  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:480 Y2:541
Sure, they're cute now,
but in a second, they'll get mean.

697
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,349  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:480 Y2:534
They're gonna get ugly somehow,
then there'll be a million more.

698
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,989  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:480 Y2:534
(Gasping) Look.
There's a little hurt one.

699
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,076  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Whimpers)

700
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,353  X1:336 X2:380 Y1:513 Y2:534
Aw.

701
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,716  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Whimpering continues)

702
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,070  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:512 Y2:534
Hi. Hi there.

703
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,038  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Ah!
- Shh!

704
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,873  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:512 Y2:541
Did you guys ever WATCH the show?

705
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,236  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:480 Y2:534
See? They're gonna help
the little hurt one.

706
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,437  X1:282 X2:440 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Whispering)

707
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,515  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:511 Y2:541
I'm so sick of being right.

708
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,708  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:481 Y2:541
Let's go,
before those things kill Guy.

709
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,598  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:480 Y2:541
We're not going
without a beryllium sphere.

710
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,433  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:480 Y2:541
I need a diversion
to clear the compound.

711
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,511  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:512 Y2:541
Then, we'll go get a sphere.

712
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,717  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:479 Y2:541
Tommy, if you see them come back
give a signal.

713
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,112  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:479 Y2:541
- Why is this so familiar?
- "Assault on Voltareck", episode 81.

714
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,476  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Episode 81?
- The one with the hologram.

715
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,472  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:480 Y2:541
How the hell
does Fred project a hologram?

716
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,472  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Is it episode 81?
- It's just a rough plan.

717
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,633  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:479 Y2:541
- What difference does it make?
- Cos I died in episode 81!

718
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,792  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Shh! Episode 51, right?
- This is ludicrous.

719
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,476  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:479 Y2:538
Why are you listening to this fellow?
This is a costume, not a uniform.

720
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,314  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:480 Y2:534
He's no more equipped to lead us
than him. No offence.

721
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,039  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:512 Y2:541
Look, they're gone.

722
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,793  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

723
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,599  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:512 Y2:541
Nobody was watching?!

724
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,433  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gwen, Fred, Alex and I
will get a sphere.

725
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,790  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:512 Y2:541
Fleegman, Tommy, you're lookout.

726
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,952  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:480 Y2:534
- You see anything, give us a signal.
- What kind?

727
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,998  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:479 Y2:538
- Any kind of signal.
- OK, I'll do this.

728
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,672  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:513 Y2:534
Coo! Coo!

729
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,514  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:479 Y2:538
What are you, an infant?!
Look, we have these.

730
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,831  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:512 Y2:541
That... Sorry.

731
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,194  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:513 Y2:541
Let's go.

732
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,077  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Grunting)

733
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,435  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Does the rolling help?
- Uh-huh, it helps.

734
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,028  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Where's your gun?
- It helps.

735
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,510  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Oh.
- What?

736
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,034  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:480 Y2:534
Ha ha, never give up,
never surrender.

737
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,838  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Others) Oh, shut up.

738
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,277  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:534
Caw, caw! Jason! They're coming!
There's thousands of 'em!

739
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,238  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:513 Y2:540
Run, Jason! Run! Run!

740
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,394  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:480 Y2:541
They're everywhere,
they're everywhere!

741
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,913  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:512 Y2:541
Everywhere!

742
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,514  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:512 Y2:541
Come on, let's go!

743
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,036  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (All shouting)
- Hurry!

744
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,588  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Guy) They're everywhere! Come on!

745
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,593  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:534
(Jason) Don't look back.
Do not look back!

746
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,557  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Guy) We're not gonna make it!

747
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,552  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Guy) I knew it, I knew it!
I knew this was gonna kill me!

748
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,473  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Jason) Come on! Push!
Let's go, Tommy!

749
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,596  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:511 Y2:541
It's gonna take a few seconds.

750
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,318  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:512 Y2:541
I got it, I got it!

751
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,834  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Go ahead.
- There's no time. Get in!

752
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,514  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:480 Y2:541
You've got to be the hero,
haven't you?

753
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,512  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:479 Y2:541
Heaven forbid
anybody else gets the spotlight!

754
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,835  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:513 Y2:540
Jason! Jason, come on!

755
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,390  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:481 Y2:541
(Gwen) Hurry!
(Jason) Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!

756
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,432  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:512 Y2:541
No, no, no! Jason, please!

757
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,876  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Tommy, stop the pod!
- I can't, it's on autopilot!

758
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,791  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:480 Y2:540
(Guy) Leave him!
(Gwen) No!

759
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,231  X1:284 X2:437 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Screeching)

760
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,271  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, right!

761
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,272  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:479 Y2:541
Of course,
it's always about you, isn't it?

762
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,796  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Snorting)

763
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,395  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:512 Y2:541
Ugh! Oh! Oh! Ugh!

764
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,550  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:480 Y2:534
- (Growls)
- Oh...

765
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,631  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Aliens chanting)

766
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,508  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gorignak! Gorignak!
Gorignak! Gorignak!

767
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,917  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:512 Y2:541
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?

768
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,031  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Yeah, Gwen, you got me.'

769
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,475  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Thank God. Are you OK?
- 'Yeah.'

770
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,552  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gorignak's staring me
in the face right now.

771
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,996  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:480 Y2:534
'But you know what?
I think I can take him.'

772
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,638  X1:308 X2:413 Y1:512 Y2:540
(All) Oh.

773
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,598  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:481 Y2:541
Jason, we're gonna use
the digital conveyor.

774
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,875  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:534
- The digital conveyor?
- 'Yes.'

775
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,919  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:480 Y2:541
You're gonna have me diced and
sent up there in a million pieces?

776
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,639  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Right.
- 'Well, you know what?

777
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,553  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:512 Y2:541
'I'll take my chances with Gorignak.'

778
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,077  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Gwen) 'We're getting you out.
It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb? '

779
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,628  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:480 Y2:541
It has never been
successfully tested.

780
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,678  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:480 Y2:541
- 'What did he say? '
- Hold, please.

781
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,599  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:480 Y2:541
Theoretically
it is fully operational.

782
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,752  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:541
But it was built
for your... anatomy, not ours.

783
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,400  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:541
But Tech Sergeant Chen
can operate it.

784
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,439  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:480 Y2:534
It was designed watching him
in the historical documents.

785
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,557  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:481 Y2:541
I-I-I mean, I can't.
I-I can supervise...

786
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,278  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:512 Y2:541
We're gonna test it.

787
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,397  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:480 Y2:541
- On what?
- How about that pig lizard?

788
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,758  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:480 Y2:541
- 'I'm doing OK with the pig lizard.'
- Please, Fred? And hurry.

789
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,910  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Nervous laugh)

790
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,070  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:480 Y2:534
I'm sorry. It's very exciting
to watch the master.

791
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,277  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:480 Y2:534
The conveyor is more...
hm... art than science.

792
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,839  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:512 Y2:540
Stand back, Jason.

793
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,755  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Aliens chanting)
Gorignak, Gorignak, Gorignak...

794
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,398  X1:309 X2:412 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Growls)

795
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,035  X1:329 X2:393 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Zap)

796
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,519  X1:338 X2:379 Y1:512 Y2:534
Oh!

797
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,469  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Screams and groans)

798
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,232  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:480 Y2:534
- 'What was that? '
- Uh...

799
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,754  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Nothing.
- 'I heard squealing.'

800
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,276  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:479 Y2:534
- Everything's fine.
- But the animal is inside out.

801
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,193  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:512 Y2:534
I heard that. It turned inside out?

802
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,591  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:512 Y2:541
And it exploded.

803
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,753  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:480 Y2:541
Did I just hear that the animal
turned inside out and exploded?

804
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,592  X1:314 X2:406 Y1:512 Y2:534
'Hello? '

805
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,551  X1:280 X2:440 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hold, please.

806
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,551  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Hey, wait a minute, guys... '

807
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,359  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:541
Why are they
still yelling "Gorignak"?

808
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,795  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:512 Y2:538
Teb, hit the translation circuit.

809
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,793  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Aliens chanting)
'Gorignak... Rock.'

810
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,997  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:512 Y2:538
Rock, rock, rock, rock!

811
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,718  X1:308 X2:414 Y1:512 Y2:540
(All) Oh!

812
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,157  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:480 Y2:541
Jason, I don't think
the pig lizard was Gorignak.

813
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,993  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:512 Y2:541
What the hell you talkin' about?

814
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,352  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:512 Y2:538
Oh, darn.

815
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,277  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Sighs) Oh.

816
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,952  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Digitise me! '

817
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,871  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:481 Y2:541
- Come on.
- 'Digitise me! '

818
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,793  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:481 Y2:541
- Not me.
- They based it on your movements.

819
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,912  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:480 Y2:541
Am I the only one
who saw that thing inside out?

820
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,675  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:480 Y2:541
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen.
Kwan's not even my real name.

821
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,756  X1:187 X2:527 Y1:512 Y2:541
Jason, you'll have to kill it.

822
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,594  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:480 Y2:541
Kill it?
Well, I'm open to any suggestions.

823
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,750  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:511 Y2:541
Go for the eyes, like episode 22!

824
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,798  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:512 Y2:541
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.

825
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,757  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:511 Y2:541
Go for its vulnerable spots!

826
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,718  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:512 Y2:541
It's a rock. It doesn't have any!

827
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,837  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:480 Y2:541
I know - construct a weapon.
Look around you.

828
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,270  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:479 Y2:534
- Can you form a rudimentary lathe?
- A lathe?!

829
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,796  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:479 Y2:541
Get him off!
Alexander, you're my advisor. Advise!

830
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,590  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:479 Y2:534
Well, just figure out what it wants.
What is its motivation?

831
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,116  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:480 Y2:534
It's a rock monster.
It doesn't have motivation.

832
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,476  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:480 Y2:534
See? You were never serious
about the craft.

833
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,991  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:480 Y2:541
Oh! Fred, can you hear me?!
Fred, are you there? (Screams)

834
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,230  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:480 Y2:538
- Kinda.
- 'You can do it, Fred! '

835
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,790  X1:208 X2:514 Y1:480 Y2:541
Oh, no, no, no. Jason,
I'll just... just mess it up.

836
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,795  X1:139 X2:581 Y1:479 Y2:534
- You did it for years on the show!
- That was the show. I'm not him.

837
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,553  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:479 Y2:534
You never forgot a line
or missed a mark!

838
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,993  X1:338 X2:379 Y1:512 Y2:534
Oh!

839
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,752  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:512 Y2:541
That's not me any more.

840
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,991  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:480 Y2:541
It is you, Fred.
You just stopped trying.

841
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,873  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:480 Y2:541
You can do this.
You're gonna save my life.

842
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,679  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:481 Y2:538
- I am?
- 'No doubt about it, Fred.

843
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,913  X1:325 X2:394 Y1:512 Y2:534
'Fred!

844
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,309  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Fred, can you hear me? '

845
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,719  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:512 Y2:534
'Fred! '

846
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,791  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:512 Y2:534
Fred? I don't wanna die down here.

847
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,392  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:512 Y2:541
Digitise me, Fred!

848
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,278  X1:329 X2:393 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Zap)

849
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,752  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:512 Y2:538
Oh, wow.

850
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,070  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Tech Sergeant Chen.
- Yeah!

851
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,673  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Gwen and Jason kiss)

852
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,869  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:511 Y2:541
You managed to get your shirt off.

853
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,389  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:480 Y2:538
- I did it.
- Welcome back, Fred.

854
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,950  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:480 Y2:541
All right,
is the beryllium sphere installed?

855
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,715  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:479 Y2:541
- Yes, we are back to full power.
- Engines and pods?

856
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,030  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Fully operational.
- Perfect!

857
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,238  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:479 Y2:541
You can drop us off and you guys
can be home before supper.

858
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,515  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:512 Y2:541
No, we have no reason to go back.

859
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,875  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:511 Y2:541
Sure you do. Family, friends...

860
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,951  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:511 Y2:534
We are all that is left.

861
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,795  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:480 Y2:534
- I didn't know that.
- I have raised the command deck.

862
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,956  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:480 Y2:541
Mathesar, meet us
up on the command deck.

863
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,429  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:512 Y2:534
Mathesar.

864
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,028  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:512 Y2:536
Mathesar! Quellek!

865
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,398  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:512 Y2:541
Why can't we reach them?

866
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,879  X1:290 X2:431 Y1:513 Y2:541
(Footsteps)

867
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,358  X1:309 X2:412 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Growls)

868
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,752  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Mathesar) Commander.
Thank God, you're alive.

869
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,197  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:511 Y2:541
Now you will face justice, Sarris.

870
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:47,274  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:480 Y2:541
At every turn, you demonstrate
the necessity for your extermination!

871
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,316  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:512 Y2:534
Leave him alone.

872
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,714  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:479 Y2:534
You wish to save the life
of this man?

873
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,910  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:512 Y2:534
Yeah. Yes.

874
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,589  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:480 Y2:541
Then tell me - what does it do,
this Omega 13?

875
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,830  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:512 Y2:534
I don't know what it does.

876
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,316  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:512 Y2:538
I said, I don't know!

877
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,913  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Is it a bomb?
- I don't know.

878
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,833  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:480 Y2:534
- A booby trap?
- I don't know!

879
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,434  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

880
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,235  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:511 Y2:541
Do you think I'm a fool?!

881
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,677  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:480 Y2:541
That the Commander does not know
every bolt and weld in his ship?!

882
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,910  X1:308 X2:413 Y1:513 Y2:540
(Groans)

883
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,912  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:512 Y2:541
Prepare a tear harness...

884
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,877  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:511 Y2:534
for the female.

885
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,080  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:513 Y2:540
(Jason) No! Gwen, no!

886
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,276  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:511 Y2:541
You brute! Let go of me!

887
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,638  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Groaning) I'm not the Commander.
- What did you say?

888
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,678  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:512 Y2:538
I said, I'm not the Commander.

889
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,752  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:480 Y2:534
Leave them.
There's no reason to hurt them.

890
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,229  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:480 Y2:541
- They don't know anything.
- Explain.

891
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,758  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:480 Y2:534
Gwen, show him
the historical documents.

892
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,189  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Sighs) Computer,

893
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,319  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:480 Y2:541
show the historical documents
of the Galaxy Quest missions.

894
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,960  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Galaxy Quest theme)

895
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,276  X1:297 X2:424 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Chuckles)

896
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,356  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:511 Y2:534
Wonderful.

897
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,239  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:479 Y2:534
You have all done far greater damage
than I ever could have.

898
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,356  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:513 Y2:534
Bravo!

899
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,994  X1:264 X2:458 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Laughs) Bravo.

900
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,514  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:512 Y2:534
This is a moment I will treasure.

901
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,795  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:512 Y2:541
Explain to him...

902
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,758  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:512 Y2:541
who you all really are.

903
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,996  X1:303 X2:413 Y1:512 Y2:534
Tell him!

904
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,357  X1:312 X2:408 Y1:512 Y2:541
Explain!

905
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,551  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:512 Y2:538
Mathesar, the...

906
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,677  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:480 Y2:541
There's no such person
as Captain Taggert.

907
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,754  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:480 Y2:534
My name is Jason Nesmith.
I am... an actor.

908
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,956  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:512 Y2:534
We're all actors.

909
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,589  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:512 Y2:534
He doesn't understand.

910
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,719  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:512 Y2:541
Explain, as you would a child.

911
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,354  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:541
We, uh... we pretended.

912
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,033  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:512 Y2:534
We lied.

913
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,319  X1:311 X2:411 Y1:513 Y2:540
(Moans)

914
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,188  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:480 Y2:541
Yes! You understand that,
don't you, Mathesar?

915
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,875  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:480 Y2:534
Mathesar,
I... l'm not a commander. I...

916
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,669  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:480 Y2:541
There's no National Space
Exploration Administration.

917
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,593  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:512 Y2:541
We don't have a ship.

918
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,398  X1:269 X2:451 Y1:512 Y2:534
But there it is.

919
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,871  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:512 Y2:541
That ship is that big.

920
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,997  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:512 Y2:541
But inside, I see many rooms.

921
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,789  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:480 Y2:534
You've seen plywood sets
that look like the inside.

922
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,159  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:541
Our beryllium sphere
is-is wire with plaster around it.

923
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,356  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:512 Y2:540
And our... (Chuckles)

924
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,351  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:512 Y2:541
Our digital conveyor is...

925
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,511  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:512 Y2:541
Christmas tree lights.

926
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,989  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:511 Y2:534
It's a decoration. It's all fake.

927
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,231  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:512 Y2:540
Just like me.

928
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,798  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Whispers) But why?

929
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,036  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:511 Y2:541
It's difficult to explain.

930
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,516  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:512 Y2:541
On our planet, we...

931
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:51,239  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:512 Y2:541
we pretend to... to entertain and...

932
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,630  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:512 Y2:541
Mathesar, I am so sorry.

933
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,359  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:512 Y2:541
God, I am so sorry.

934
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,919  X1:301 X2:421 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Gagging)

935
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,230  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Sarris) So now you know.

936
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,474  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:480 Y2:534
Lieutenant Lathe, hardwire
the reactor core to overload.

937
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,473  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:534
I would like to blow
this troublesome vehicle to dust.

938
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,233  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sarris, what about my people?

939
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,471  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:479 Y2:538
Yes, far too simple a death
for them, isn't it?

940
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,758  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:534
Lathe, open an oxygen seal
on level C.

941
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,037  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:511 Y2:534
Let the air in a bit for our friends.

942
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,036  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:511 Y2:534
Son of a... Uh!

943
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,320  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:512 Y2:534
Release them...

944
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,277  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:512 Y2:541
into space.

945
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,959  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Computer) 'Core overload.
Emergency shutdown overridden.

946
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,953  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:480 Y2:534
'Core implosion

948
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,479  X1:333 X2:387 Y1:513 Y2:541
Hey!

949
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,036  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Alexander) Where's
the happy ending, Jason?

950
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,873  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:512 Y2:541
"Never give up, never surrender."

951
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,074  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:480 Y2:541
Maybe it's about time you just backed
off, you fin-headed monstrosity.

952
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,479  X1:272 X2:450 Y1:513 Y2:540
(Gwen) Jason?

953
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,073  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:512 Y2:534
You what?

954
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,199  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:541
You're starting to act
like you did in episode 17,

955
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,396  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:512 Y2:541
you scene-stealing hack.

956
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,955  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, right!

957
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,353  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:479 Y2:534
Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was
it worth it? You've murdered us all!

958
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,637  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Shut up.
- Hundreds to die because of you!

959
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,029  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:480 Y2:540
- Shut up!
- (Sarris) Get in there.

960
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,511  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:480 Y2:541
Just because you wanna play
at being commander, you lunatic.

961
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,716  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:512 Y2:541
Then I'll see you in hell.

962
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,070  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:512 Y2:540
Look out, Jason!

963
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,590  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:512 Y2:541
Get his gun! Get the gun!

964
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,630  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Guy) Take that!

965
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,511  X1:287 X2:435 Y1:512 Y2:541

966
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,914  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sorry... The door's a little sticky.

967
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,798  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:480 Y2:534
I'll get someone up here
with a can of WD-30.

968
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,757  X1:295 X2:426 Y1:512 Y2:541
(All laugh)

969
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,556  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Don't pull your punches.
- Scene-stealing hack?

970
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,393  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Raving egomaniac?
- Where's that from?

971
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,118  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:513 Y2:541
Hey, guys...

972
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,918  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:512 Y2:534
Iook.

973
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,515  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:511 Y2:541
(Gwen) They're suffocating.

This is what we gotta do.

982
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,556  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gwen, you and I
will shut the core down manually.

983
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,235  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:534
Fred, take Guy and Laliari.
Save those Thermians.

984
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,517  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:480 Y2:541
Alexander, wedge a door open
in case they can't.

985
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,670  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:512 Y2:538
Wait, what about me? What do I do?

986
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,718  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:480 Y2:541
You're gonna practise driving.
Let's go!

987
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,398  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:512 Y2:541
Practise driving.

988
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,073  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:480 Y2:534
(Gwen) So we get to shut down
a neutron reactor?

989
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,718  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:512 Y2:541
I hate to break it to you,

990
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,156  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:480 Y2:538
but I don't know
how to shut down a neutron reactor,

991
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,756  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:480 Y2:541
and unless you took a course, I'm
pretty sure you don't know, either.

992
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,912  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:480 Y2:534
No, I don't,

993
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,675  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:512 Y2:541
Brandon, honey, the garbage.

994
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,035  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, Mother, I'm quite busy.

995
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,350  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:512 Y2:541

996
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,274  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:480 Y2:541
Just 10 more minutes, OK, Ma?
I promise.

01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,794  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:480 Y2:540

1007
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,716  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:512 Y2:534
Brandon.

1008
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,075  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:511 Y2:541
I remember you from the convention.

1009
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,789  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:541
You asked all those
technical questions about the ship

1010
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,996  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:512 Y2:541
and I was a little short with you.

1011
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,072  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:480 Y2:534
Yes, yes, I know, Commander,
and I wanna...

1012
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,119  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:541
I wanted to tell you that
I-I thought about what you said...

1013
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,397  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:480 Y2:541
- It's OK. Listen.
- But I want you to know...

1014
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,755  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:512 Y2:541
I'm not a complete brain case.

1015
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,150  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:480 Y2:541

that it's just a TV show.

1016
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,552  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:480 Y2:540

I knew it! I knew it!

1019
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,396  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:480 Y2:541
The crew and I are in trouble
and we need your help.

1025
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,274  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:480 Y2:541
I avoided capture

1042
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,588  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:512 Y2:541
and his crew have escaped custody.

1043
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,636  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:480 Y2:541

1044
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,599  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:480 Y2:541

01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,752  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:479 Y2:541
Brandon, I see five ducts in here.
Which way?

1048
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,834  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:479 Y2:541
The second to your left, and just
continue straight for 50 metres.

1049
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,992  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:512 Y2:541
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?

1050
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,753  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:512 Y2:541

1051
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,433  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:512 Y2:534
Whoa!

1052
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,635  X1:340 X2:380 Y1:512 Y2:534
Uh!

1053
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,679  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:479 Y2:534
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You OK?

1054
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,556  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:512 Y2:541

01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:00,119  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:480 Y2:541
'Commander, what I'd give
to see what you're seeing.'

1058
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,714  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:480 Y2:541
- What?
- You're deep in the Omega 13!

1059
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,155  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:512 Y2:541
'Oh, it must be spectacular.'

1060
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,874  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:512 Y2:534
It doesn't look like much to me.

1061
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,871  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:511 Y2:541
There's just these few walls

1062
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,555  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:479 Y2:541
and this dumb spinning fan
that's in every single...

1063
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,873  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:480 Y2:541
(Jason) Brandon,
what does the Omega 13 device do?

1064
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,191  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:480 Y2:541
'Many believe
that it is a matter-collapser.'

1065
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,319  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:479 Y2:541
A bomb capable of destroying
everything in 13 seconds.

1066
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,918  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:479 Y2:541
'But myself and others are convinced
that it is a matter rearranger,

1067
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,560  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:512 Y2:541
'a 13-second time jump to the past.'

1068
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:50,156  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:480 Y2:541
Why 13 seconds? That's really
not enough time to do anything.

1069
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,750  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Time to redeem a single mistake.
- What?

1070
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,435  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:479 Y2:541
We gotta turn off that valve.
Their oxygen's almost gone.

1071
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,150  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:541
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create
a distraction. I've got this.

1072
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,959  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:480 Y2:541
I might be able
to hold him long enough.

1073
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,396  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:480 Y2:541
- That's suicide.
- I'm a glorified extra, Fred.

1074
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,109  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:480 Y2:534
I'm a dead man anyway.
I'd rather die a hero than a coward.

1075
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,193  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:481 Y2:541
Guy, Guy,
maybe you're the plucky comic relief.

1076
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,077  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:512 Y2:534
You ever think about that?

1077
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,112  X1:314 X2:406 Y1:512 Y2:541
Plucky?

1078
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,556  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:480 Y2:541
Besides, I just had
this really interesting idea.

1079
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,551  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:512 Y2:541
Are you stoned?

1080
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,632  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:480 Y2:541
Gotta get them open
and give them some time.

1081
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,393  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sir, perhaps together...

1082
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,711  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:479 Y2:534
the Mak'tar chant of strength,
Larak tarath.

1083
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,678  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Larak tarath, larak tarath.
- Larak tarath.

1084
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,713  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:480 Y2:538
(Both) Larak tarath,
larak tarath, larak tarath!

1085
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,279  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:512 Y2:540
(Air hisses)

1086
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,594  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:512 Y2:538
Brandon, we're across. Now what?

1087
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,559  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:479 Y2:541
Take a left and then just
straight on through the chompers.

1088
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,312  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:512 Y2:541
"The chompers"?

1089
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,631  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Well, screw that.
- How do we get through this?!

1090
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,998  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Hollister, what's the sequence?
- OK, the sequence is...

1091
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,719  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:511 Y2:534
two-two-four-two...

1092
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,279  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:512 Y2:534
What is this?

1093
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,150  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:479 Y2:541
There's no useful purpose for a bunch
of chompy things in a hallway!

1094
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,391  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:480 Y2:541
We shouldn't have to do this.
Why is it here?!

1095
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,597  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Cos it's on the TV show!
- Well, forget it!

1096
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,070  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:480 Y2:541
I am not doing it!
This episode was badly written!

1097
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,199  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:479 Y2:541
- When the first crusher hits you...
- It just did!

1098
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,396  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:481 Y2:534
- OK, go now.
- Go!

1099
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,993  X1:270 X2:451 Y1:512 Y2:540

1110
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,789  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:480 Y2:534
Whoever wrote this episode
should DIE!

1111
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,270  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:512 Y2:541
This should be interesting.

1112
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,271  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:512 Y2:541

1116
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,315  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:480 Y2:541
It's the simple things
you treasure.

1117
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,711  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:512 Y2:541
That's great.

1118
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,150  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:512 Y2:541
Now... we better get...

1119
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,277  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:513 Y2:541
Hey, get a room, guys.

1120
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,353  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:512 Y2:534
Whoa!

1121
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,397  X1:251 X2:471 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Guy) Hey, Fred...

1122
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,715  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:541
Hey, Fred, uh...

1123
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,039  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, that's not right. Oh!

1124
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,036  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:512 Y2:541
Sir, the pressure - it's normalising.

1125
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,437  X1:303 X2:413 Y1:512 Y2:541
All right!

1126
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,235  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:512 Y2:534
We are saved.

1127
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,675  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:512 Y2:534
He has saved us.

1128
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,309  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:512 Y2:541
Commander Taggert has saved us!

1130
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,076  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:511 Y2:541
It's just not fair.

1131
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,749  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:480 Y2:541
All right, Quellek,
let's get back to the Commander.

1132
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,956  X1:283 X2:439 Y1:512 Y2:540

1133
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,112  X1:275 X2:447 Y1:512 Y2:534
I'm... l'm shot.

01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,276  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:512 Y2:536
Quellek?

1136
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,871  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:512 Y2:534
It's not too bad.

1137
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,111  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:480 Y2:541
We'll get you to the medical quarters
and you'll be fine.

1138
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,112  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:480 Y2:541
It has been an honour
to serve with you.

1139
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,875  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:512 Y2:538
I have been blessed, sir. I-I...

1140
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,996  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:512 Y2:541
Don't speak, Quellek.

1141
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,474  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:511 Y2:541
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir,

1142
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,358  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:480 Y2:538
but even though
we had never before met,

1143
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,796  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:534
I always considered you
as a father to me.

1144
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,438  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:512 Y2:536

1146

1147
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,114  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:541
you shall be... avenged.

1149
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,994  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Brandon, how do we stop this?
- 'Push the blue button.'

1150
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,469  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Is that it?
- Why, what's wrong?

1151
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,393  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:480 Y2:541
I just thought
it'd be more complicated.

Brandon, it's not working.

01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,993  X1:306 X2:414 Y1:512 Y2:534

01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,432  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:480 Y2:541
Mother, I cannot stress enough
the severity

1156
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,996  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:479 Y2:541

1163
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,833  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:480 Y2:541
Oh, it always
stops at one on the show.

1164
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,956  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Laughs)
- What were you saying?

1165
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,153  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Sir!
- What?

1166
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,073  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:480 Y2:534
The detonation sequence
has been aborted.

1167
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,878  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:512 Y2:541
Impossible! Lmpossible!

1168
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,112  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:479 Y2:534
Lock a complement of implosion
missiles onto the Protector.

1169
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,959  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:512 Y2:541
Tear her apart!

1170
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,597  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:511 Y2:541
(Lasers firing)

1171
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,996  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:511 Y2:534
Whoa! He's finished.

1172
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,197  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:480 Y2:538
Alexander, listen to me.
It's OK, it's OK.

1173
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,953  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:534
The Thermians
can handle it from here.

1174
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,598  X1:287 X2:435 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Screaming)

1175
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,148  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:512 Y2:541
We need that armour back up!

1176
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,677  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:479 Y2:541
- Get me a forward view right now!
- Plasma armour engaged.

1177
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,150  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:480 Y2:541
- (Rumbling)
- Tommy, lose 'em in that minefield.

1178
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,834  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:479 Y2:534
- Minefield?
- Pedal to the metal!

1179
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,956  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Pedal to the metal!
- Let's go!

1180
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,874  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:512 Y2:541
Good going, Tommy. Great going.

1181
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,235  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:511 Y2:534
Thrust ahead... full!

1182
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,835  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:511 Y2:534
Into the field! Go!

1183
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,796  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:481 Y2:534
(Jason) Can you get us
closer to these mines?

1184
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,199  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:512 Y2:534
Closer?

1185
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,032  X1:294 X2:427 Y1:512 Y2:541
I could try.

1186
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,112  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:512 Y2:538
General, I've lost them.

1187
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,512  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:479 Y2:541
The magnetism of the minefield
is disrupting our instruments.

1188
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,672  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:512 Y2:541
Wait! I see something.

1189
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,917  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yes. Yes! There they are.

1190
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,594  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:480 Y2:538
- Get back on their tail.
- I can't, sir.

1191
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,275  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:480 Y2:541
- What? Why not?
- Because they're coming right at us.

1192
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,555  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:512 Y2:534
Fire at will.

1193
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,793  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:480 Y2:534
Whoo! We're getting hammered, Jason!
Return fire?

1194
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,553  X1:135 X2:585 Y1:512 Y2:541
No! Divert all energy to the armour!

1195
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,710  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:512 Y2:534
'How adorable!

1196
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,678  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:480 Y2:541
'The actors
are going to play war with me.'

1197
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,356  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:480 Y2:534
- Sarris is accelerating toward us.
- Accelerate to mark four.

1198
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,916  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:512 Y2:541
Let me remind you, sonny,

1199
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,395  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:512 Y2:541
I am a general.

1200
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,358  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:511 Y2:541
If you are counting on me to blink,

1201
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,989  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:480 Y2:541
then you are making
a deadly mistake.

1202
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,435  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:512 Y2:541
Let me tell you something, Sarris.

1203
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,433  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:480 Y2:541
It doesn't take a great actor
to recognise a bad one.

1204
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,192  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:512 Y2:541
You're sweating!

1205
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,510  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:512 Y2:541
Armour almost gone, Jason!

1206
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:40,390  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:479 Y2:541
You fool! You failed to realise
that with your armour gone,

1207
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,996  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:480 Y2:541
my ship will tear through yours
like tissue paper.

1208
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,915  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:479 Y2:541
And what you fail to realise
is my ship is dragging mines.

1209
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,833  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:512 Y2:538
Oh, no! Turn, turn!

1210
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,756  X1:299 X2:415 Y1:513 Y2:534
Yes! Yes!

1211
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,512  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:512 Y2:541
Yes! (Laughing)

1212
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,069  X1:299 X2:415 Y1:513 Y2:534
Yes! Yes!

1213
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,390  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:512 Y2:541

1214
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,638  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:512 Y2:534

1215
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,234  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:512 Y2:541
Oh, my God, you're alive.

1216
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,313  X1:289 X2:428 Y1:512 Y2:534
Come here.

1217
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,358  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:512 Y2:541
The ship was a model as big as this.

1218
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,514  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:512 Y2:541
A very clever deception indeed.

1219
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,556  X1:295 X2:426 Y1:512 Y2:541

1220
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,597  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:511 Y2:534
Set a course for home?

1221
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,558  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:480 Y2:541
- Can you do that?
- Just point and click.

1222
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,518  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:480 Y2:541
- We'll go through a black hole.
- Objections?

1223
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,396  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:512 Y2:541
(Jason) All right, set her up.

1224
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,317  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:512 Y2:538
What's the matter, Mathesar?

1225
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,997  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:480 Y2:541
We were hoping
you could come with us.

1226
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,117  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:512 Y2:541
M-my people have no commander.

1227
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,713  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:480 Y2:541
Mathesar, I think your people...
have a great commander.

1228
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,878  X1:339 X2:379 Y1:512 Y2:534

01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,473  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:512 Y2:541
Tommy, take us into the black hole.

1231
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,069  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:481 Y2:541

01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:58,398  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:479 Y2:541

right now, Alexander... Fred?

1236
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,071  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:480 Y2:541
Shouldn't you be downstairs? Hey,
you could put an eye out with that.

1237
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,913  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:512 Y2:534

1238
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,594  X1:330 X2:386 Y1:512 Y2:541
Agh!

1239
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,796  X1:339 X2:380 Y1:513 Y2:534
No!

1242
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,152  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:512 Y2:541
Activate the Omega 13!

What are you doing?

1249
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,308  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:511 Y2:541

We need to separate, or we'll die.

We're separating.
