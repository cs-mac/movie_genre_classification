1
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,045
- You can't sleep here.
-Get away from me.

2
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,810
Why don't you go to an inn?

3
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,288
- Why do you think?
- Did you knock on doors? Ask people?

4
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,286
I asked. I asked everywhere.
Leave me alone.

5
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,771
You didn't ask there.

6
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,850
Knock on that door.

7
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,605
Who can that be?

8
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,647
- Do you have any food you can spare?
- Come in.

9
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,290
Look, I'm a convict.

10
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,686
My name is Jean Valjean.
I've served 19 years' hard labour.

11
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,411
They let me out four days ago.
I'm on parole.

12
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,484
I have to go all the way to Dijon
to report by Monday...

13
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,120
...or they send me back to prison.
My passport.

14
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,851
I can't lread,
but it says I'm dangerous.

15
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,486
You're welcome to eat with us
as my guest.

16
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm a convict. You saw my passport.

17
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,081
I know who you are.

18
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,008
You're gonna let me
inside your house?

19
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,763
What crime did you commit?

20
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,685
Maybe I killed someone.

21
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,201
How do you know
I'm not going to murder you?

22
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,528
What's that? A joke?

23
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,887
I suppose we'll have to
trust each other.

24
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,964
I didn't kill anyone. I'm a thief.

25
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,090
I stole food. I stole, but I paid for it.

26
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,811
Nineteen years in chains.

27
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,531
So they let me out
and give me a yellow passport.

28
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,967
What can I do
with a yellow passport?

29
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,603
I have to go to my parole officer in Dijon
and then what? Starve to death?

30
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,650
Nineteen years, and now
the real punishment begins!

31
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,250
Man can be unjust.

32
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,607
Man? Not God?

33
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,885
All right, whoever you are.
Thank you.

34
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,161
A meal and a bed to sleep in.
A real bed.

35
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,681
And in the morning,
I'll be a new man.

36
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,404
Is anybody there?

37
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,607
So we'll use wooden spoons. I don't
want to hear anything more about it.

38
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,326
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- You caught him.

39
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,289
But I had my eye on this man.

40
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,644
- Oh, thank God.
- I'm very angry with you, Jean Valjean.

41
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,521
- What happened to your eye?
- Didn't he tell you he was our guest?

42
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,323
Oh, yes. After we searched
his knapsack and found all this silver.

43
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,647
He claimed that you gave it to him.

44
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,369
Yes, of course I gave him
the silverware.

45
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,968
But why didn't you take the
Candlesticks? That was very foolish.

46
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,203
Madame Gilot,
fetch the silver Candlesticks.

47
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,331
They're worth at least 2,000 francs.
Why did you leave them? Hurry!

48
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,163
Monsieur Valjean has to get going.
He's lost a lot of time.

49
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,965
- Did you forget to take them?
- Are you saying he told us the truth?

50
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,687
Of course. Thank you for bringing
him back. I've very relieved.

51
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,531
Release him!

52
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,402
- You're really letting me go?
- Didn't you understand the bishop?

53
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,326
Madame Gilot,
offer these men some wine.

54
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,962
- They must be thirsty.
- Thank you.

55
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,648
And don't forget, don't ever forget...

56
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,371
...you've promised
to become a new man.

57
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,290
I promise. Why are you doing this?

58
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Jean Valjean, my brother,
you no longer belong to evil.

59
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,605
With this silver, I bought your soul.

60
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,202
I've ransomed you
from fear and hatred.

61
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,601
And now I give you back to God.

62
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,721
Good afternoon, captain.
I'm Javert, the new police inspector.

63
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,042
Here are my orders
from the Paris prefect.

64
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,444
Oh, yes. Hello, Inspector Javert.
I've been expecting you.

65
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,931
I'm Captain Beauvais.

66
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,562
- How was your journey?
- You haven't looked at my orders.

67
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,247
Oh, I'm sure they're all right.
Have you eaten, or would you--?

68
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,085
I'd like you to follow procedure.

69
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,286
Well...

70
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,286
...everything seems to be
in order, inspector.

71
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,125
You are now in charge
of the Vigau police.

72
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,408
In Paris, things are miserable.

73
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,162
Crime is rampant,
the streets are filthy.

74
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,002
- Conditions here are much better.
- Life in Vigau has never been better.

75
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,801
Shall I take you to our tile-and-brick
factory? Our biggest business.

76
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,440
- Very well.
- This way.

77
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,771
- Who owns the factory?
- The mayor.

78
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,050
He was just one of the workers. But
when it went bankrupt five years ago...

79
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,808
...incredible to think of now, he bought
the works for less than 500 francs.

80
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,846
On second thought, captain,
I should report to the mayor first.

81
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,128
- Yes.
- The mayor seems to be the force...

82
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,124
...behind everything.
Must be a man of genius.

83
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,649
He is extraordinary. But I should
warn you, he's also a little eccentric.

84
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,805
- Eccentric? In what way?
- Well, he's shy. Lives like a hermit.

85
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,770
Didn't even want to be mayor.
Tried to refuse.

86
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,968
But the town fathers insisted.

87
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,170
- Not ambitious, yet this successful?
- He's a mystery.

88
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,891
Some people think he's crazy,
but I like him.

89
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,642
- I like him and I feel sorry for him.
- You feel sorry for the mayor?

90
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,850
Because he's lonely. Here we are.

91
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,687
- He lives here?
- Strange, isn't it?

92
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,962
Little better than a worker's house.

93
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,684
Good afternoon, mayor.
The new inspector has arrived.

94
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,444
He wants to report.

95
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,768
That's all right. He doesn't have to.

96
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,561
Monsieur <i>Ie</i> maire, if you don't permit
the inspector to report...

97
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,929
...I think he will burst into tears.

98
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,970
Monsieur <i>Ie</i> maire,
I'm Inspector Javert.

99
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,643
I have the honour of reporting to
my post as your prefect of police.

100
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,803
I'm sorry. What's your name?

101
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,770
Inspector Javert.
You were expecting me.

102
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,888
- Paris should have--
- You have papers?

103
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,123
Yes. I apologise. I should have
presented them immediately.

104
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,851
Good. Thank you for coming.

105
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,684
Captain, make sure the inspector's
settled comfortably.

106
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,127
- Yes. Good day.
- Good day.

107
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,847
- The men and women work separately?
- Yes. Monsieur Ie maire...

108
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,800
...redesigned the factory
in order to keep the sexes apart.

109
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,760
- I told you he's eccentric.
- Not eccentric, captain, no.

110
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,330
He cares about honest working women
and wants to protect their virtue.

111
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,087
Very Proper, very wise.

112
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,923
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me, sir.

113
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,122
- I didn't mean to.
- You ruined another!

114
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,647
- They'll dock my wages--
- All right. Enough!

115
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,962
Get your things.
I'm going to move you.

116
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,521
- It was an unforgettable--
- Good riddance!

117
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,890
- But I'll forget it anyway!
- Let's go! Back to work!

118
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,765
Come on. Fun's over.

119
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,524
Come on. Back to work.

120
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,087
I'd feel safer if you had an escort.

121
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,005
Don't worry, I can look after myself.

122
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,481
I haven't much time.
I must leave right away.

123
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,849
I hope this urgency
does not imply distress.

124
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,209
May I ask why you are withdrawing
your entire fortune?

125
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,449
I trust you are aware
this institution is at your service.

126
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,407
Thank you. But this is
a business opportunity, no crisis.

127
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,928
<i>- I'll</i> be back tomorrow.
- I received disturbing information...

128
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,880
...about one of the girls.
I have reason to believe...

129
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,008
...she has a child
and is not married.

130
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,811
- What? Is she a whore?
- I don't hire--

131
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,042
I don't hire women
who sell themselves.

132
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,481
Of course you don't, I apologise.

133
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,928
It's just I don't want our ladies
to be exposed to corruption.

134
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,647
- I suggest dismissal.
- I trust your judgement.

135
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,882
Thank you.

136
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,287
Fantine, come with me, please.
Come on.

137
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,451
She's caught the tart.

138
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,683
Please don't let me go now, madame.
My little girl is sick.

139
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,205
You read it in that letter from the people
who take care of her. The military fever.

140
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,011
They need 40 francs for medicine
or she'll die.

141
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,607
Who are these people,
the Thenardiers?

142
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,161
- Are they relatives?
- No, not relatives.

143
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,642
You deliberately left your child
with strangers to conceal her?

144
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,167
You dismiss me for having a child,
then you--

145
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,682
Not for having a child,
for having a child out of wedlock...

146
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,285
...pretending to be honest.

147
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,204
I have to earn money to feed her.

148
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,648
How can I work and take care of her?
I have to lie.

149
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
You make it sound like
your lie is my fault.

150
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,923
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm upset.
I don't mean to argue, madame.

151
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,607
My Cosette is a sweet little girl,
an innocent little girl.

152
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,882
Don't punish her for my sin.

153
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,601
- I was stupid. I fell in love.
-"In love." That's always the excuse.

154
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,163
Yes, you're right. I'm a bad person.
But the Thenardiers are good people.

155
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,529
They have two daughters.
My Cosette can play with them.

156
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,411
She won't be so lonely.
She's better off with them.

157
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,882
Only I have to make money
to pay for her medicine.

158
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,328
Please. Just a month. I'll work hard.

159
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,289
The mayor cares about his workers.

160
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,049
He cannot have women of questionable
morals influencing the girls. I'm sorry.

161
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,167
- What's going on?
- Five sous for the chair.

162
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,924
Nice doing business with you.

163
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,243
- Are you skipping out?
- I sold it for extra money.

164
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,164
Well, you owe me a month's rent.

165
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,051
- Not till next week.
- Well, pay now or you're out.

166
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,610
Thirty francs. Come on,
you've got 50 in your hand.

167
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,683
Fifteen. Get you the rest next week.

168
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,970
- How? They fired you.
- Who told you I was fired?

169
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,964
This is still a small town.

170
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,771
- I have a job.
- Don't lie.

171
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,649
Start next week as a washerwoman.

172
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,565
Everybody knows your story.
You've got a bastard kid.

173
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,405
Nobody's gonna give you work.

174
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,890
Please take half. I'll get you the rest.

175
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,089
Don't look so worried.
Things aren't that bad.

176
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,400
You've still got a bed.

177
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,730
Yes. Good hair quality.

178
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,931
Ten francs.

179
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,486
Dear Reverend Mother.

180
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,767
The bishop of Digne,
may he rest in peace...

181
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,409
...often told me of your convent
and its good works.

182
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,771
In his memory,
I would like to give a--

183
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,604
Or is it "I Should like"?

184
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,322
"Should" is preferable.
And "endow" is less brutal than "give."

185
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,841
- I should like to endow--
- Monsieur!

186
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,324
There's been an accident.
One of the workers. Lafitte!

187
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,482
- Get me out! I can't breathe!
- Stand back. Let me through.

188
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,723
- Let him through.
- Help us. We need leverage.

189
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,087
- Come on, move!
- Gather round!

190
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,130
- Together. All together.
- Let's go, boys!

191
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,001
Get me out! It's breaking my rib!

192
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,004
- Get ready.
- Come on, pull. All together. Pull!

193
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,524
Boys, push. Push. Come on, push.

194
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,406
- Marla.
- Good evening.

195
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,201
- Where's Claudette tonight?
- Oh, monsieur.

196
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,404
- There are more than ever.
-Inspector, you startle me.

197
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,568
Yes, I counted four new girls.

198
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,566
You see, captain, when a town grows,
crime grows with it.

199
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,645
- Shall I get the men and make arrests?
- No. Did you check off the regulars?

200
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,529
Yes.

201
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,568
- And I've noted the new girls.
- Good work.

202
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,486
- Marla.
- Good evening.

203
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,804
- Is it 10:00? I didn't hear it ring.
- I'm early. I was restless.

204
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,731
- You heard about Lafitte and the cart?
- Nothing else.

205
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,524
Incredible feat.

206
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,808
Has the mayor
always been that strong?

207
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,806
Well, he's a big man,
but I didn't know he was that strong.

208
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,170
- Didn't he show it when he was young?
- I didn't know him when he was young.

209
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,722
Oh, that's right. He moved here.
Where's he from?

210
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,202
Well, he came here from Paris,
but that's not where he was born.

211
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,610
- You know, I think he told--
- Didn't you check his papers?

212
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,322
- I suppose I did. Don't remember.
- Perhaps you didn't.

213
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,687
Why should you?

214
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,802
How about her?

215
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,923
Who are you?

216
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,084
- Push off!
- Yeah, get off.

217
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,882
- Hi, dearie.
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

218
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,884
She's new.

219
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,330
Who is it?

220
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,088
I'm buying your horse and cart.

221
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,643
The doctor says your kneecap's broken.
You won't be able to do your old job.

222
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,162
I've written to the Sainte Marie Convent
in Paris.

223
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,767
The sisters need
a new caretaker and gardener.

224
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,484
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Sorry for what?

225
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,722
Monsieur, I used to--

226
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,201
I was angry at you.

227
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,769
Because when you came here,
you were a worker like me...

228
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,809
...and you grew rich...

229
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,601
-...while I had troubles.
- We've all had troubles, Lafitte.

230
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,923
And we all need help
from time to time. Rest.

231
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,249
And I'll let you know when
I have word from the convent.

232
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,929
"Thank you for...

233
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,880
...our new..."

234
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,050
C-A-R-E. Caretaker.

235
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,964
- That's it, caretaker.
- Excuse me.

236
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,409
-Inspector Javert is here to see you.
- Tell him to wait.

237
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,648
I have exciting news, monsieur
le maire. Paris is interested in my plan.

238
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,366
- What plan's that?
-It's in the letter, sir.

239
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,925
Why don't you tell me?
You said it's your plan.

240
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,605
I forgot. I apologise.

241
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,247
- Apologise? For what?
- I forgot you don't read.

242
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,402
Your clerk mentioned it.

243
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,251
Neglected your education
to make your fortune?

244
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,802
What is Paris interested in, inspector?
I'm all ears.

245
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,203
Because of Vigau's extraordinary
growth the past five years...

246
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,210
...I've proposed that
we make a detailed census.

247
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,206
Well, that would be interesting.
But how is it a police matter?

248
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,840
Modern law enforcement
demands modern methods...

249
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,401
...and that means information.

250
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,007
For example, how many people
have moved here in the last decade?

251
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,722
Where did they come from?
What's their background?

252
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,686
Is our criminal population home-grown
or are they outsiders?

253
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,969
Without information, we cannot know
how to control the dangerous elements.

254
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,846
- You might be making a mistake.
-It's a mistake? What mistake is that?

255
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,688
Sometimes people move to a new town
to start with a clean slate.

256
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,322
You might be doing more harm
than good by prying into their lives.

257
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,086
An honest man has nothing to fear
from the truth.

258
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:21,081
For example, Paris knows my father
was a thief and my mother a prostitute.

259
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,929
If my mother or father moved here, I'd
want everyone to know what they are.

260
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,085
- Even if they had reformed themselves?
- Reform is a discredited fantasy.

261
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,564
Modern science tells us that people are
by nature law breakers or law abiders.

262
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,003
A wolf can wear sheep's clothing,
but he's still a wolf.

263
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,889
I was just thinking, inspector,
that you have been unlucky.

264
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,004
Unlucky? I don't understand.

265
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,970
Unfortunately, you've been assigned
to a dull post.

266
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,646
You'd be happier in Paris,
where everyone...

267
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,326
...either by nature or experience,
is dishonest.

268
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,609
Indeed. Well, I'll see if I prefer Paris.

269
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,890
They've asked me to report to
the deputy prefect to explain my idea.

270
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,686
I'll be gone for four days.

271
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,565
We'll miss you. Good luck.

272
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,691
Thank you. And goodbye.

273
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,285
Inspector? One moment.

274
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,884
Please.

275
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,889
- Here's a farewell gift.
- You're offering me a gift?

276
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,407
Yes, inspector, my papers.

277
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,849
Baptismal certificate, passport...

278
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,163
...working papers
from the Marseille docks.

279
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,849
I want to get your census
off on the right foot.

280
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,370
Pleasant journey, inspector.

281
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,842
Move on. Have your papers ready.
It's Paris. We don't waste time.

282
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,083
- Inspector Javert. Let me through.
- Papers!

283
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,651
Inspector Javert, the prefect
was impressed by your proposal.

284
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,691
I expect him to approve a budget
for your census within the month.

285
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,446
Thank you, sir.
That's excellent news.

286
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,481
You are known in Paris now, Javert.
Your future is bright.

287
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,928
So I suggest you drop this request...

288
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,686
...for an investigation of the mayor.

289
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,402
Sir, I was a guard for a year
in the quarries of Toulon.

290
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,444
I saw Jean Valjean perform
the same feat of strength...

291
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,409
...as the mayor did with the cart.

292
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,609
The hard labour makes them
incredibly strong.

293
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,004
Once the connection was made in my
mind, no longer dazzled by his wealth...

294
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,088
...I've grown more certain every day.

295
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,165
Indeed, now I recognise his face
and voice so clearly, I'm amazed...

296
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,926
-...I didn't know him right away.
- I don't doubt--

297
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,491
Sir.

298
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,251
- I'm prepared to denounce him.
- Denounce him?

299
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,880
Without proof?

300
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,928
If I force a trial,
the evidence will be found.

301
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,651
He showed you papers
and they were in order.

302
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,882
I checked the baptism certificate.

303
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,602
It's a copy. Eleven years ago,
there was a fire at the parish.

304
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,810
The authentic records were destroyed.
His documents are based on that copy.

305
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,490
Your identification alone is not enough
to subject the mayor of Vigau to a trial.

306
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,201
File a report and I'll recommend
we investigate.

307
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,048
Sir, Jean Valjean is a thief. It makes
a mockery of our institutions...

308
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,851
...to have a corrupt and depraved man
in charge--

309
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,163
Javert. I said file a report.

310
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,368
I'll investigate on this end, discreetly.

311
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,644
But do not denounce him
without proof.

312
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,246
Be patient.

313
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,562
He's not going anywhere. Is he?

314
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,449
"Madame, the 10 francs a month
we agreed on is no longer enough.

315
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,206
Cosette grows bigger by the minute.

316
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,921
She enjoyed her sixth birthday party
and the new doll we bought her.

317
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,845
We love her so we won't charge
for her present...

318
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,846
...but she needs a new coat and shoes.
We can't afford to pay for them.

319
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,924
And she eats more than
both our daughters put together.

320
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,448
Beginning right away,
you must send 20 francs a month...

321
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,284
...or come and fetch her.

322
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,490
Sincerely, Thenardier."

323
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,449
- So, what's your answer?
- I can't move.

324
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,365
I don't have money
to pay in advance for a room.

325
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,684
Am I a charity?
You haven't paid me in four months.

326
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,530
- I paid you.
- I have bills too...

327
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,163
...and I can't spread my legs. It's not
good business to rent to a whore.

328
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,891
What about your necklace?
That's worth something.

329
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,371
No, not this.

330
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,842
-It's for my daughter.
- You better come up with something.

331
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,923
I want 10 francs or you're out.

332
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,404
No.

333
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,764
This time I want cash.

334
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,962
Good evening, monsieur.

335
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,329
My God, you're hideous.
Well, how much?

336
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,527
A franc.

337
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,523
- You're joking.
- Fifty sous.

338
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,005
Fifty sous? Fifty sous?
To screw a corpse?

339
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,282
- Hasn't got a drop of blood in her veins!
- Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.

340
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,647
- How about a sou?
- Stop it!

341
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,486
I have a sou. I have a sou
to spend on you.

342
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,890
But first, let's give your tits
a bit of colour!

343
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,681
Something to drink!

344
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,923
Something to drink!

345
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,090
Down you go, tart.

346
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,921
She's attacking him.

347
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,681
Sir, this is a disturbance. May I?

348
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,207
I'll take care of this.

349
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,642
That's enough!

350
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,610
It's not my fault. They started it--

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,527
- Go home! And be quick about it.
- Come on, let's go.

352
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,208
- Captain.
- You asked me to tell you...

353
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,082
...if he went too far. Well,
I've kept my mouth shut long enough.

354
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,011
Have her taken to the prison.
You get six months.

355
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,683
Six months? What about Cosette?
What'll happen to her?

356
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,961
Who is Cosette?

357
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,529
My daughter. If I don't send
them money, they'll turn her out!

358
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,364
Is your daughter here in Vigau?

359
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,967
- No, sir, she lives with--
- Then she's not my concern.

360
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,044
Inspector. Inspector.
Inspector, please listen to my side.

361
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,002
I know I hit the gentleman.
I know I was wrong.

362
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,004
But do they have the right
to put snow down my dress...

363
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,051
...especially when it's the only one
I have and I need it for work?

364
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,491
I'm sorry. I don't mean to argue.

365
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,883
It won't happen again.

366
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,688
Inspector, please.
Please be merciful.

367
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,129
All right, I've listened to your side.
You're still getting six months.

368
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,360
- Not even eternal fire will change that.
- One moment, inspector.

369
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,723
It was you. You did this to me.
You fired me.

370
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,968
- You slut! Come here.
- Get over here.

371
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,404
Let her go.

372
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,691
- What?
- Let me explain, inspector.

373
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,366
I was crossing the square
when you arrested her.

374
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,848
People said it was the fault
of the men who attacked her.

375
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,844
In fact, they should be under arrest.

376
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,731
Now that you've heard this,
I want you to release her.

377
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,851
He said I can go.
He is the mayor, isn't he?

378
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,725
Well, I'll be going, then.
I won't be any bother to anyone.

379
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,565
- Sergeant, who said she could go?
- I did.

380
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,681
I am the final judicial authority
here in Vigau, and I say she's innocent.

381
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,002
- She spat on you.
- She was upset.

382
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,004
She insulted you.
In front of my men, she defiled you.

383
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,050
- That's my concern, inspector.
- No, sir, you are wrong.

384
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,331
You personify order, morality,
government. The whole of society.

385
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,048
You don't have the right to forgive. You
haven't the authority to destroy justice.

386
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,001
I do have the authority. Under Articles
9 and 11, I can order her release.

387
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,606
Sergeant, she is free to go.

388
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,207
I cannot allow that, monsieur.
I was there. She attacked a man.

389
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,249
The decision is mine. She's free.

390
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,404
- She won't go free while I am in charge.
- In that case...

391
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,042
...under Article 66, you are relieved
of command until tomorrow.

392
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,531
You are dismissed, inspector.
Leave! Now!

393
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,811
You're free to go.

394
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,809
Water.

395
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,243
Water!

396
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,127
I doubt she'll survive.
She talks continually about Cosette.

397
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,691
- Who's that?
- Her daughter.

398
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,645
She needs all the will
to fight the infection.

399
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,320
Perhaps if the girl were here...

400
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,927
- I understand. Thank you, doctor.
- You'll need nurses.

401
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,527
I can't arrange for them till morning.
What about tonight?

402
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,486
I'll take care of her tonight.

403
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,931
Keep her body warm
and her head cool. Good night.

404
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,162
Why did the gossip bother you?
You didn't have to fire me.

405
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,008
Your clothes are damp.
We have to get you some dry--

406
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,803
It's all right. There'll be no charge.
You deserve it.

407
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,082
But I don't understand
why you're being so kind.

408
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,609
I was preoccupied. I didn't know.

409
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,327
If you had come straight to me,
none of this...

410
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,522
You need to rest.

411
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,881
- You don't want a kiss?
- I want you to rest.

412
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,366
And don't worry.
I'll bring your daughter to you.

413
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,923
- Are you going to the Thenardiers?
- No, I can't.

414
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,647
I'll send the money
to bring Cosette here.

415
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,446
- She can't live with me.
- Of course she can. She will.

416
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,648
She'll attend the school...

417
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,764
...and you won't have
any more worries.

418
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,567
When you're better,
I'll find work for you.

419
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,001
But you don't understand.

420
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,767
I'm a whore,
and Cosette has no father.

421
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,084
She has the Lord. He is her father.

422
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,211
And you are his creation.

423
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,891
In his eyes you have never been
anything but an innocent...

424
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,288
...and beautiful woman.

425
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,128
Monsieur.

426
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,847
- You look better every day.
- Liar.

427
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,370
- Please.
- Thank you.

428
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,201
Fantine, look.

429
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,922
- Is that Thenardier's handwriting?
- Yes.

430
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,731
- Is something wrong?
- Read it.

431
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,405
I don't know how.
Would you read it to me?

432
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,088
- Well, I'm learning myself.
- We're a fine pair.

433
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,768
My clerk tells me this man can't bring
Cosette because you owe him money.

434
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,447
- I don't. I paid him.
- I've sent him money as well. It's a lie.

435
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,246
He could have brought Cosette
and been paid.

436
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,802
<i>- I'll</i> go get her.
- No, no, no. Stay where you are.

437
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,566
It's all right. There's no need.

438
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,089
He thinks you've come into money.
He's become a little greedy, that's all.

439
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,489
I've sent him what he's asked for
and extra to bring Cosette.

440
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,246
She should be here in a few days.

441
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,602
- How wonderful to see her.
- You must eat, my dear.

442
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,004
<i>- I'll</i> let you have your lunch.
- What about you? Don't you eat?

443
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,164
"Our little lark, our darling Cosette...

444
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,449
...is eager to be with her mother,
but she has a cough.

445
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,968
'Like my mummy's,'
the sweet angel said.

446
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,646
The physician advises
she's not well enough to travel now.

447
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,643
I'll bring her when she's stronger.

448
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,931
Meanwhile the medicine is expensive
and the doctors' bills are criminal.

449
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,005
- Fantine owes us another 50 francs--"
- All right. I've had enough.

450
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,289
- You want to dictate a reply?
- No.

451
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,966
Instead, write this note
for Fantine to sign:

452
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:43,163
Monsieur Thenardier. You will
hand Cosette over to the bearer.

453
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,487
Regards.

454
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,087
I'll be leaving right away.

455
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,000
- Javert.
- I need to see you immediately.

456
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,725
Alone.

457
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,609
Thank you, Pierre.

458
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,281
I'm in a hurry, inspector.

459
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,008
Monsieur, a serious...

460
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,164
A grave violation of the public trust
has been committed.

461
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,802
An inferior has shown a complete
lack of respect for the law.

462
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,930
- He must be exposed and punished.
- Who is the offender?

463
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,282
I am.

464
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,047
I slandered you, monsieur. I'm here
to ask that you demand my dismissal.

465
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,931
Inspector Javert,
what are you talking about?

466
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,165
You may say I can resign. Resignation
is honourable and I don't deserve it.

467
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,645
I must be punished.
You treated me unjustly over the--

468
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,007
About the woman.

469
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,482
This time you must treat me justly.
You must dismiss me.

470
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,086
God's sakes, Javert. For what?

471
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,567
I denounced you to
the Paris prefect of police.

472
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,888
I swore that you were a convict.

473
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,840
- You said I was what?
- A convict.

474
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,567
I had no proof.

475
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,928
Only a memory of this man,
Jean Valjean...

476
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,050
...whom I guarded 20 years ago
in prison.

477
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,766
I denounced you
without a shred of evidence.

478
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,048
- You denounced me?
- Yes.

479
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,844
I was a fool.

480
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,722
They told me I was wrong, you couldn't
be Jean Valjean, and they were right.

481
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,930
I've just returned from Arras,
where I saw the real Jean Valjean.

482
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,287
- The real Valjean?
- Yes.

483
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,011
Two weeks ago, a man
who called himself Carnot...

484
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,403
...was arrested outside Arras
for poaching apples.

485
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,923
At the prison, a convict
took one look at him and said:

486
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,085
"I know this man. We were in prison
in Toulon 20 years ago.

487
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,641
He's Jean Valjean."

488
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,609
I didn't believe it.

489
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,730
I went there to see for myself.

490
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,564
Well, there's no question.

491
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,804
Carnot is Valjean.

492
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,802
I apologise, monsieur.
I look at you now...

493
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,804
...and it's obvious
you're not a convict.

494
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,650
So now you don't think
I'm a convict?

495
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,883
Of course I don't. I've seen Valjean
with my own eyes.

496
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,408
Must have been out of my mind
to think you could be a criminal.

497
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,451
- This man, he admits to being Valjean?
- Of course not.

498
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,326
He pretends to be a half-wit
who can't understand the charges.

499
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,641
Valjean has broken parole.

500
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,724
That calls for life imprisonment.

501
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,488
- When is the trial?
- Tomorrow.

502
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,926
Tomorrow.

503
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,524
- How long will it take?
- No more than an afternoon.

504
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,251
- Tomorrow.
- The evidence is overwhelming.

505
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,651
I returned so that you could dismiss
me and press charges for slander.

506
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,847
I must consider.

507
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,361
I was just on my way home.
Walk with me, Javert.

508
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,206
You are a stern man,
but you're honourable.

509
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,682
- I want you to remain prefect.
- That's impossible.

510
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,490
You've exaggerated your of fence.

511
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,571
I've not exaggerated, monsieur.
I resented you.

512
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,643
I chafed at your authority.

513
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,451
And out of revenge, I slandered you.

514
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,810
If a subordinate of mine had done
that, I would have broken him.

515
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,249
You must punish me, monsieur,
or my life will have been meaningless.

516
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,086
Then blame me, Javert.

517
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,241
- You, monsieur <i>Ie maire?</i>
- I order you to forgive yourself.

518
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,289
Blame me for that mercy.

519
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,922
You will remain prefect.
Those are my orders.

520
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,966
Will you go get her today?

521
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,209
Yes. Tonight.

522
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,400
Is something wrong?

523
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,086
I'm going to do my best.

524
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,528
I'm going to get better for my girl.

525
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,647
But if he chooses to take me,
will you look after Cosette?

526
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,121
- I know I have no right--
- You and Cosette...

527
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,124
...will always be safe with me.

528
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,527
I swear it.

529
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,569
- Is this the courthouse?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,404
Thank you.

531
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,003
- May I go in?
- I can't let you in. It's full.

532
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,646
It's full? There are no seats?

533
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,126
Jammed. We've got two great cases.

534
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,331
- So I can't get in?
- No. Not a chance.

535
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,249
Unless... Unless monsieur
is a public official.

536
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,927
There is a seat reserved for them
right beside the judge.

537
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,764
Best seat in the house.

538
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,683
I am the mayor of Vigau.

539
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,729
Gentlemen, you'll be so kind
to remain seated...

540
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,249
...while my lords, the judges,
re-examine the prisoner's records.

541
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,801
The prisoner to remain standing
at the bar.

542
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,246
- It is an honour, monsieur le maire.
-Welcome, sir.

543
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,323
Thank you.

544
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,120
- Continue the examination.
- You pretend to be simple...

545
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,489
...so I give you a simple question
to answer.

546
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,729
Are you or are you not
the convict Jean Valjean?

547
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,011
In the first place...
What's the first place?

548
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,128
Answer the question.

549
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,724
You're wicked. That's what I was going
to say. Only I forgot your name.

550
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,804
I'm a man who...
Oh, what's the word for it?

551
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,291
I'm one of those
who doesn't eat every day. I'm...

552
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,489
I'm hungry. That's the word.

553
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,290
You've already been found
guilty of poaching.

554
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,567
- Answer the prosecutor's question.
- Did he ask a question?

555
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,648
Are you or are you not Jean Valjean?

556
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,403
Well, you say I was born
in Faverolles.

557
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,531
That's very clever, telling me where
I come from. It's more than I know.

558
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,729
My parents were tramps.

559
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,564
<i>Monsieur le président...</i>

560
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,770
...in view of the shrewdly contrived
denials of the accused, who is trying...

561
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,922
...to pass himself off as an idiot...

562
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,603
-...I call the witness Brevet to the stand.
- So ordered.

563
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,250
Brevet. I remind you...

564
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,165
...that what you say
may destroy a man's life.

565
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,324
You must be absolutely certain
of your testimony.

566
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,010
My memory is good.

567
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,009
- The best thing I have.
- The accused will rise.

568
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,845
- Do you recognise this man?
- Yeah.

569
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,049
I was the first to recognise him.
I ought to get credit--

570
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,404
- Never mind who was first. Who is he?
- That's Jean Valjean.

571
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,526
We served 19 years together
in prison.

572
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,128
He looks older of course.
Looks stupider too.

573
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,443
- That's probably age.
-Monsieur le président, I call...

574
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,729
-...the convict Lombard to the stand.
- You may step down.

575
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,486
The accused should remain standing.

576
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,808
I repeat my warning: A man's life
can be destroyed by your answer.

577
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,281
Do you recognise the accused?

578
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,282
I can't help but recognise him.

579
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,890
We did five years on one chain.

580
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,202
What's the matter with you, eh?

581
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,922
No hello, eh? Did you miss me, eh?

582
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,570
Hello.

583
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,730
I call Bertin to the stand.

584
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,241
I warn you as well:
Your answer can ruin a man.

585
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,971
Do you recognise the accused?

586
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,450
Yeah. He's Jean Valjean.

587
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,285
<i>Monsieur le président...</i>

588
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,487
...may I address the court?

589
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,282
Yes, sir. Yes, certainly,
monsieur <i>Ie</i> maire.

590
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,887
Brevet, Lombard, Bertin.

591
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,088
Look at me.

592
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,280
Do you recognise me?

593
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,324
I recognise you, Brevet.

594
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,570
You were an informer in Toulon.
I see you're still a snitch.

595
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,485
- Valjean.
- Hello, Brevet.

596
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,446
And you, Lombard.
Don't look at my fancy clothes.

597
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,604
Don't look at my scraped chin.
Look at my eyes.

598
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,249
You called yourself godless, right?

599
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,689
You got a scar on your shoulder. I gave
it to you the night you tried to kill me.

600
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,730
- When I pinned you over the stove.
- It is you.

601
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,321
Show the court your scar.

602
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,811
Bertin, the hollow of your left arm.

603
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,282
There's a date tattooed,
1789, the year of the revolution.

604
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,329
Show them.

605
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,722
I know these men, monsieur
<i>le</i> président. And they know me.

606
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,927
I am the man you want.

607
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,646
I am Jean Valjean.

608
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,162
-It's him!
- Oh, my God!

609
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,404
Monsieur <i>Ie</i> maire,
I know you to be a kind man...

610
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,767
- A kind--? A kind man?
-...but this?

611
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,571
In prison, I was as ignorant,
mean and devious...

612
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,001
...as these men here, but not kind.

613
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:35,611
I wish I could keep my mouth shut and
let this poor wretch suffer for me, but...

614
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,648
Continue with the investigation.

615
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,088
You will find further proof
that I am Valjean.

616
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,523
I need you in the office right away.

617
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,005
- Monsieur, you're back.
- I don't have the child yet.

618
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,450
<i>- I'll</i> leave in an hour. How is she?
- Her cough's worse.

619
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,285
There's more blood now. She's...

620
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,206
I think she's just holding on
to see her daughter.

621
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,086
- Wait.
- I have an urgent message for Javert.

622
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,481
- I'll take it.
- To be delivered by hand.

623
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,891
This is a special warrant from Arras.

624
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,362
I knew it.

625
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,488
I knew it!

626
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,924
- Monsieur, you're back.
- Fantine, if something were--

627
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,242
I was just dreaming.

628
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,961
- About you and me and Cosette.
- Don't excite yourself.

629
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,523
We were at her confirmation...

630
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,002
...and she looked so beautiful.

631
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,041
- Fantine, if something were--
- But then she didn't know me.

632
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,885
And I was crying.

633
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,366
I have to tell you.

634
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,481
- I know I'm not going to live long.
- I won't be able to--

635
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,444
Would you give this to her?

636
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,011
I saved it for her.

637
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,488
Yes.

638
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,047
- Could you give it to her, please?
<i>- I'll</i> give it to her.

639
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,081
She can come and stay with you,
can't she?

640
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,130
You will raise her, won't you?

641
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,564
- Yes, I'll raise her.
- Promise me, monsieur.

642
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,042
I promise.

643
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,965
He lies well, doesn't he?

644
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,087
He's had a lot of practice.
A lifetime of lies.

645
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,603
- Save me.
-It's all right. He's not here for you.

646
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,001
He's not here for you.

647
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,483
He isn't mayor anymore.

648
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,211
- Let's talk in private.
- Speak up. Don't mumble.

649
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,044
- I need a favour.
- Speak up.

650
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,249
- Give me two days to fetch her child.
- Are you joking?

651
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,485
<i>- I'll</i> pay you anything you want.
- Do you think I'm that stupid? You do.

652
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,008
You must have laughed when
you forgave me. Generous, kind mayor.

653
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,731
No. No, you can't fetch things
for your whore.

654
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,009
You're going where you belong.
This bitch is going to jail.

655
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,323
You'll never see your daughter.
You're going to prison.

656
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,606
He can't save you.

657
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,240
- Javert.
- Scum of the earth.

658
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,329
Get up!

659
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,321
It's a pleasure to see you
again, Valjean.

660
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,366
You killed her.

661
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,208
Where will you go, Valjean?
You don't have papers.

662
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,403
I'll find you.

663
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,448
She repented, didn't she?
She made her peace with God?

664
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,688
Yes, monsieur.

665
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,644
Are you a convict? Is that true?

666
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,406
Yes.

667
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,524
- Where's the inspector?
-Inside.

668
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,881
Did you kill him?

669
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,682
That's a pity.

670
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,446
You'd better hit me hard enough
to make a lump.

671
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,082
- Where is he?
- He left half an hour ago.

672
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,884
- On foot?
- On a wagon.

673
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,844
- Which way?
- The southern road.

674
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,690
- Commandeer the mail coach.
- Yes.

675
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,050
- Not you, Beauvais. You two, go.
- Ask anybody. Everybody saw him leave.

676
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,690
How much money has he taken?

677
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,531
- He didn't take any.
- Show me the book.

678
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,251
I don't understand.
He transferred ownership.

679
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,731
To all the employees.

680
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,851
Shares have been apportioned by
seniority. He took nothing for himself.

681
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,689
Quickly.

682
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,411
Faster! Faster!
Come on, drive them there!

683
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,764
- Morning, monsieur <i>Ie</i> maire.
- Good morning.

684
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,964
What are you doing? Don't slow down.
Give me the reins.

685
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,649
Come on!

686
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,606
Yes. Yes.

687
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,885
We're going too fast, sir!

688
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,086
Look out!

689
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,563
You're... You're under arrest.

690
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,889
The whore, who did she write to?
The address, give it to me.

691
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,483
There you are, you little slut.
What took you so long?

692
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,442
-It's heavy.
- Don't let me hear you complaining.

693
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,840
You don't bring a sou.

694
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,721
The least you can do is clean
the rooms. I feed your greedy mouth.

695
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,249
Do I get thanks? No, I get
smart answers. Now get to work.

696
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,801
I want those stockings finished
or no supper.

697
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,287
You have to earn your keep.

698
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,807
What do you want?

699
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,642
- A room, please.
- A room costs 20 sous.

700
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,040
I'll pay in advance.

701
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,847
Very well, monsieur.

702
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,050
My dear, my sweet, my precious,
you've forgotten. Haven't you?

703
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,964
I've forgotten.

704
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,851
I do that. I forget things.
What have I forgotten?

705
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,923
We've rented the regular room.

706
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,768
We've only got the wedding chamber
left. I'm sorry, but that costs 40 sous.

707
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,606
- You want a meal?
- Bread and cheese.

708
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,525
Is that all? There's rabbit stew.

709
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,883
- What's she knitting?
- Who?

710
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,202
She's making stockings
for my daughters.

711
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,762
- She's not your daughter?
- Not that creature. No.

712
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,288
Why? Does she interest you?

713
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,281
Perhaps.

714
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,762
- What's her name?
- Cosette.

715
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,163
- What are they worth?
- The girl?

716
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,244
- The stockings.
- Oh, the stockings.

717
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,851
I don't know.

718
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,209
- You can buy the stockings.
- Probably 30 sous.

719
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,521
I'll buy them.

720
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,729
I'm paying for her time.
I want her to play.

721
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,804
Of course, understand
I meant 30 sous for each stocking.

722
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,447
Cosette, get up. Come on.
Get out of there.

723
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,127
Cosette! Get out. Get out of there!

724
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,089
Get out!

725
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,081
You're working for me now.
You can rest or you can play.

726
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,361
What would you like?

727
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,486
Madame, is it true?
Am I allowed to play?

728
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,804
You heard, didn't you? Yes, you must
play. Go on, hurry up, start playing.

729
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,367
Perhaps monsieur would like Cosette
to play on his lap.

730
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,724
I'm heading to Paris.
ls there a mail carriage I can take?

731
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,285
It's gone already.

732
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,887
Next coach to Paris arrives at dawn.

733
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,365
- You like our Cosette?
- I want to take her with me.

734
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,761
Monsieur, I have to tell you the truth.

735
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,002
- I adore that child.
- You adore her?

736
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,084
Yes, it's true. I'm not rich.

737
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,204
I've had to pay over 400 francs
for her medicine.

738
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,330
But I'm a stupid man.
I have no sense...

739
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,007
...just a heart. A big heart.

740
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,642
- You paid over 400 francs?
- Five hundred.

741
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,043
Five hundred. All right.
I want to leave right away.

742
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,569
I'm sorry, monsieur, but her mother
gave her to us to protect.

743
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,007
- I can't let a stranger take her.
- How much?

744
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,006
This isn't a question of money.
What right do you have to the girl?

745
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,128
- You don't want money?
- Of course not.

746
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:33,167
Even if you were to offer 1000 francs,
even 1,200, I couldn't give her to you.

747
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,564
It's true, I owe 1,500 francs...

748
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,964
...and my whole life would be solved
if only I had 1,500 francs, but...

749
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,882
No, I can't think about money.
It's a question of law.

750
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:48,163
All that matters is
who has the right to the child.

751
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,526
That's a relief.

752
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,800
Here's a letter from Cosette's mother
authorising me to take her.

753
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,484
Cosette, quick.

754
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,083
- Do we have to walk all the way to Paris?
- Yes. Are you tired?

755
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,765
No, monsieur. I'm all right.

756
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,730
Cosette, best not to
call me "monsieur."

757
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,044
- People will think we're strangers.
- Then what shall I call you, monsieur?

758
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,409
Well, "papa." What about "papa"?

759
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,928
But you're not my father, monsieur,
are you?

760
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,168
Want me to carry you?

761
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,611
- I can reach the branches.
- You're the tallest lady in France.

762
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,604
- I'm the queen of France.
- That's right...

763
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,967
...you're the queen of France.

764
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,248
You're the queen, Cosette.

765
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,007
You're the queen.

766
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,442
Have your papers out and ready
to be inspected when it's your turn.

767
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,971
Wake up. This is Paris.

768
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,011
Form an orderly queue.
Have your papers ready!

769
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,891
- Keep in line back there!
- Have your papers out...

770
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,930
...and ready for inspection!

771
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,450
Let these carriages through!

772
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,801
We must get to here.

773
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,164
Have your papers out
and ready for inspection.

774
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,607
Cosette, listen.

775
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,043
Wait here. Wait here.
I won't be long. All right?

776
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,771
Have your papers out
and ready for inspection!

777
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,247
Don't leave me!

778
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,931
Wait your turn!

779
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,448
You have to be quiet.
I'm just having a look at the wall.

780
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,364
I'm not leaving you.

781
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,888
- Are we gonna climb that wall?
- Yes.

782
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,883
All right?

783
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,967
- Come on, move along, then!
- Papa!

784
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,925
But you told me to call you Papa.

785
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,327
You, where are your documents?

786
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,684
- No luck yet.
- He's on foot.

787
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,406
The little girl would slow him down.

788
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,845
Well, Javert...

789
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,970
...you said he was Valjean,
and we ignored you.

790
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,851
Rather than apologise,
I want you to know...

791
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,800
...that I've asked the prefect
to transfer you to Paris...

792
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,645
...to work as my deputy.

793
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,607
- Monsieur, I'm honoured. Thank you.
- Have your papers out!

794
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:05,482
Meanwhile, these men are
at your disposal to find Valjean.

795
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,326
Have your papers out!

796
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:17,968
All right, Cosette, give me your doll.
Now, climb on my back.

797
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,489
Go on. Here, put your foot here.
Go on.

798
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,449
That's it. Big jump.

799
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,331
That's a girl. All right?

800
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,800
You, where are your documents?

801
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,883
- Papa, I'm frightened.
- Don't look down.

802
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,925
Of course he won't.

803
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,441
Pardon me, Javert. He won't what?

804
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,171
Have your papers ready!

805
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,170
I want three of you
to walk around the wall.

806
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,369
Look for a gap where someone
could jump onto a roof. Go!

807
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,808
- I don't understand.
- He has no proper papers, sir.

808
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,849
He won't come through here.

809
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,601
- Watch here.
- Yes, sir.

810
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,048
Stay down. Stay down.

811
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,689
We'll have to cross here.

812
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,971
Shut up!
Do you wanna get us killed?

813
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,886
Cosette, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right.

814
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,442
I'm sorry. But we have to be quiet.
We can't make a noise.

815
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,968
This is the only place
we can get over.

816
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,488
Listen to me. We have to jump.

817
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,651
Valjean!

818
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,202
Come on. Take my hand.

819
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,169
- What's on the other side of this wall?
-It's a convent.

820
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,762
Javert, I am not going to wake up
a building full of nuns...

821
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,804
-...and search their beds.
-It's for their protection.

822
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,965
This is a strict order. The nuns aren't
permitted to look or speak to a man.

823
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,646
It's a school for girls.
They must be protected.

824
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,247
The girls are daughters of the
aristocracy, whose parents would...

825
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,450
-...have you guillotined if you're wrong.
- Sir, I know he's in there.

826
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,125
What?

827
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,927
Who are you?

828
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,930
Now I'm trapped
under the cart, Lafitte.

829
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,523
If you would collect all the nuns,
sisters and schoolgirls...

830
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,048
...in the chapel, my men
could search everywhere else.

831
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,283
We are not afraid of men.
We are here to adore Christ.

832
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,365
- I can't protect you from here.
- A search of our school or convent...

833
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,410
...is impossible. I'm sorry, inspector.

834
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,004
I've told the mother superior you're
my brother. You'll be the new gardener.

835
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,646
Good, thank you. And tomorrow...

836
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,521
...can you arrange for her
to go to school here? I can pay.

837
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,489
Who is she?

838
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,444
She's an orphan.

839
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,086
She'll be with me now.

840
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,964
- Pity.
- What?

841
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,602
I was thinking of next year
when it'll be Cosette's turn.

842
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,762
Is it a pity to be devoted to Christ?

843
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,281
A beautiful nun is a tragic waste.

844
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,766
Well, even though Cosette
will be stuck here...

845
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,887
...at least you can see the world.
Or Paris, anyway.

846
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,042
Aren't you curious?

847
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,249
You haven't been outside now
in how many years?

848
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,164
The world never changes, Lafitte.

849
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,609
It is changing.
You should have a look for yourself.

850
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,331
You'll be surprised.

851
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,686
- What are you looking at?
- Just watching the people go by.

852
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,328
- I don't want to take my vows.
- You promised the mother superior.

853
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,130
I want to leave. Please.

854
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,886
- But we're safe here.
- Safe from what, Papa?

855
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,044
We have everything we need.
I can work here, be near you.

856
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,647
- We have a good life here.
- Please, Papa.

857
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,044
I'll think about it.

858
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,691
We're very grateful
for everything you've done...

859
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,561
...but my daughter's happiness
is what's most important to me.

860
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,327
Naturally I'm disappointed
Cosette has changed her mind.

861
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,406
- But I too want to see her happy.
- Thank you.

862
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,564
We shall leave as soon as
I can find a suitable home.

863
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,770
I was wondering--
I don't know anyone in Paris.

864
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,010
--If you could help me find a house
in a decent area.

865
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,243
But, Lafitte, how could you
afford such a house?

866
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,451
Before we came here, I had money.

867
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,248
Family money that I saved
to help provide for us.

868
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,371
Well, I hope you're certain that
you've made the right decision.

869
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,602
I am.

870
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,083
Look,Papa.

871
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,289
- I shan't be long.
<i>- I'll</i> wait here.

872
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,728
- All right. Don't leave the cab.
<i>- I'll</i> stay put, Papa.

873
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,562
I'll be back soon.

874
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,567
Ma'am, you got any money?
Spare some money?

875
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:48,091
--Can't provide for your family.
Strike for a decent wage. Why not?

876
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,288
Because it's against the law to strike.

877
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:55,446
The king has declared that everything
is a crime. Writing is a crime.

878
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,491
Two weeks ago, the police destroyed
Egalite', the workers' newspaper.

879
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,122
- They smashed the press.
- The man making a speech...

880
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,085
...he's the leader of the ABC Society...

881
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,763
...the largest and most dangerous
of the student groups.

882
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,891
They want the king out.
They want suffrage without limitation.

883
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,482
I don't care what they want.
I want to know who they are.

884
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,371
- Speaking out is a crime.
- Marius Pontmercy.

885
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,730
- Rents a room above the Cafe Musain.
- Being poor is the worst crime of all.

886
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,805
And if you commit these crimes,
you are condemned for life.

887
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,691
- Concentrate on him.
- Our government has no mercy...

888
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,251
...no pity, no forgiveness.

889
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,051
- And it has no work for us!
- And there's no work.

890
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:41,683
And because there is no work,
our children are starving. Tell me...

891
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,844
...why are we powerless
to save the people we love?

892
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,286
You know. Tell me why.

893
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,488
- The king lied!
- The king betrayed us.

894
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,369
We were promised the vote.

895
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,488
- Do we have the vote?
- No!

896
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,291
Where is the Republic
our fathers died for?

897
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,408
- Where?
- Here.

898
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,124
It's here, my brothers.
It lives here in our heads.

899
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:11,807
But most of all, best of all,
it lives in our hearts.

900
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,362
In our hearts, we are the Republic!

901
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,849
We are the Republic!
We are the Republic!

902
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,125
Where have you been?
I told you not to leave the cab.

903
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,084
I was just going out for some air.

904
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,730
- Who's that?
- I don't know. He was making a speech.

905
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,201
Come, we're going home.

906
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,925
Thank you.

907
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,967
Thank you.

908
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,047
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

909
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,765
You again. I looked this time.
You weren't at Mass.

910
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,810
- I was, Father.
- Go on, get out of the line.

911
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,123
- They won't let us in.
- He's all right. Let him through.

912
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,766
- We made extra today.
- How are you, Gavroche?

913
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,764
Thank you. No one is as kind
and as beautiful as you.

914
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,447
You're such a convincing liar.
I fear for your mortal soul.

915
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,683
- Who are your little friends?
- These are my babies.

916
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,002
I found them wandering the streets.

917
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,685
Don't I make a good father?

918
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:53,807
You'd make a better father, Gavroche,
with a real coat. Wait a minute.

919
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,081
My friend wants to know if you'll
take a walk in the park with him.

920
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,051
Here you are. Bring your babies back
tomorrow and I'll give them jackets.

921
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,049
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

922
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,847
- He never leaves her alone.
- He's not a father, he's a jailer.

923
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,886
Go. Go on, here they come.
Go. Go, go, go.

924
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,849
Come on, boys. Hurry up.

925
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,604
- Let's go home.
- May we go for a walk?

926
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,125
It's so sunny and mild.

927
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,164
I'm tired. Would you read to me
in the garden?

928
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,800
Why don't you go lie down?
I'll go for a walk.

929
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,770
- Alone?
<i>- I'll</i> have to walk alone some day.

930
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,445
- Some day, not today.
- I know.

931
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,365
- Why don't you sit and relax...?
- Stop playing games.

932
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,841
- I'm not playing games.
- Are you disobeying?

933
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,526
I'm your father. Get in!

934
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,607
It's Thursday. Madame Toussaint
made your favourite dessert.

935
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,286
What do you say, Cosette?

936
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,050
Strangers can be dangerous.

937
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,966
- Will that be all?
- Yes. Thank you, Toussaint.

938
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,605
You're not, you know.

939
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,922
- Pardon?
- You're not my father.

940
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,283
You never said you were until
you became angry and behaved...

941
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:32,001
...so strangely today.
That was the first time you said it.

942
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,084
- The very first time.
- Yes, you're right.

943
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:39,928
Well, are you my father?

944
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,811
Cosette, I promised your mother
I would take care of you.

945
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,122
I know you think I worry too much...

946
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,726
-...but strangers can be danger--
- All right.

947
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,360
- What?
- I don't want to hear that speech again.

948
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,722
There's something shameful.
It must be me.

949
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,928
- My child, no.
- Or you.

950
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,686
You're the shameful secret.
Or maybe both of us.

951
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,649
It doesn't matter. I can't go out.

952
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,723
- I can't talk to people.
- Stop this.

953
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,565
I think you're lying. I know the secret.

954
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,405
The secret is you want me
with you night and day...

955
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,087
...because you're lonely and
you want me to be alone forever.

956
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,401
Cosette.

957
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,121
Cosette.

958
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,326
You're right. I'm not a father. I don't--

959
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,967
I just want to protect you, that's all.

960
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,570
The world isn't a safe place,
believe me.

961
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,883
You're the only person I have...

962
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,121
...and this is the only way
I know how to do it. I'm sorry.

963
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,161
It's all right.

964
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,642
- Come, have your meal.
- I won't be long.

965
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,644
Fine. Toussaint will save it.

966
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,283
- Hello.
- Hello.

967
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,047
- What's your name?
- Marius.

968
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,967
- And yours?
- I'm Cosette.

969
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,202
Cosette.

970
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,082
- I have something for you.
- Thank you.

971
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,929
Cosette!

972
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:06,248
- I can warm up your soup.
- I'm coming, Toussaint.

973
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,645
I'll be here.

974
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,802
Tomorrow night. Outside.

975
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,841
See you tomorrow.

976
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,207
Any guns?

977
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,283
- Maybe this is moving too fast.
- Revolution should be rushed.

978
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,363
Progress doesn't have time to waste.

979
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,126
This is pathetic.
Two weeks and what have we got?

980
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,044
Barely enough guns for ourselves.

981
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,443
Then we'll tear up the streets
and we throw stones.

982
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,366
Oh, come on, Marius, throw stones?
They won't attack us with sticks!

983
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,283
- Well?
- They have two kegs of gunpowder...

984
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,011
...stored in the back.
Guns are another story.

985
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,288
- Is there a plan?
- No one can agree on...

986
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,643
...how to make a move.
They argue about whether the people...

987
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,486
-...are ready. Truth is, they're scared.
- These puppies seem harmless.

988
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,768
We should move you to another group.

989
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,607
- Thank you.
- What about this Marius? Anything?

990
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,129
He's in love. He has to go to the food
tent to get a glimpse of his beloved.

991
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,327
Who is the father?

992
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,327
I know you like me to be thorough,
so I checked. He's behind the charity.

993
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,929
I didn't find out much,
only his name. Lafitte.

994
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,290
- Do you know him?
- I don't think so.

995
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,490
Aren't we going for our walk?

996
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,128
Not tonight. I want to finish my book.

997
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,126
But we missed it last night and you've
been in. You need your exercise.

998
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,080
- I'm too tired.
- Are you all right?

999
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:10,086
Yes, of course. I have my book
and Toussaint is here.

1000
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,368
Goodnight, my dear.

1001
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,009
Your letter was beautiful.

1002
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,843
It was really beautiful.

1003
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:08,691
- Tell me everything.
- Everything? About what?

1004
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,566
- About you.
- There's nothing.

1005
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,444
There's nothing to tell.

1006
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,121
I'm a very simple girl.

1007
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,363
I live a very simple life.

1008
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,048
I grew up in a convent...

1009
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,965
...with lots of other girls, of course.

1010
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,521
My father lived there too.
My father's a very good man.

1011
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,480
I grew up in his love.
His love was my home.

1012
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,880
You know what I mean?

1013
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,611
And then I met you.

1014
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,850
And you, what about you?
You're a genius, aren't you?

1015
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,281
A genius?

1016
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:51,445
A poor student. No brighter
or smarter than anyone else.

1017
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,889
Your speech was wonderful.
I didn't breathe while you talked.

1018
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,771
I was afraid I'd miss a word.

1019
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,207
This week was the same as last?
Every night?

1020
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,888
Inspector, they're in love.
It's perfectly nauseating.

1021
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,289
She sneaks out the door
and they're together till dawn.

1022
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,402
They even stay out there
when it rains.

1023
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,323
I haven't caught a gun supplier,
I've caught pneumonia.

1024
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,326
- And the father knows nothing?
- This too to me is not a surprise.

1025
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,365
I admit the whole experience
has disillusioned me.

1026
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,321
I certainly don't plan on having any
children, especially not a daughter.

1027
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,124
Can I be reassigned?

1028
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,243
Perhaps I could infiltrate...

1029
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,210
...some nice anarchists
with a roof over their heads?

1030
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:11,569
Yes. Yes, I'll handle this.
You're relieved.

1031
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:15,042
Take two days off and report to me.
You'll be reassigned.

1032
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,410
Thank you. Just out of curiosity,
sir, what are you going to do?

1033
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,643
From what you've said,
Lafitte is respectable and well-off.

1034
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,802
- Yes.
- A little soft-hearted perhaps...

1035
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,691
...but a churchgoer, a loving father?

1036
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,729
The neighbourhood
speaks well of him.

1037
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,962
Then he deserves to know
his daughter...

1038
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,964
...has been seduced
by a dangerous radical.

1039
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,009
- Monsieur.
- Toussaint...

1040
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:49,721
...leave your cooking. Come sit
in the garden. It's a glorious day.

1041
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,531
- There's someone here to see you.
- Who is it?

1042
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,489
-Ins...
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

1043
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:58,690
Inspector Javert. From the police.

1044
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:21,246
- Could you w...
- I'll wait.

1045
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:28,525
- Who was that?
- That w...

1046
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,244
- Yes?
- Was a gardener.

1047
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,529
- But why? Why say you're away?
- There's no time to explain.

1048
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,968
Tell him I've gone away for a week.

1049
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,884
If he asks about your past...

1050
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,850
...say you have a headache
and excuse yourself.

1051
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,525
All right? No details.

1052
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,569
- You're frightened.
- No. No, no, no.

1053
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,768
Please, just go.

1054
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,888
Try not to be nervous.
He'll sense it.

1055
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,401
Stay calm and composed.

1056
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,370
My father instructed Toussaint to say
he's out when he's on one of his trips...

1057
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:08,366
...so that no one will know we're
two women here by ourselves.

1058
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:13,321
Isn't it ridiculous that he worried
about it with you, a police inspector?

1059
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,760
When will he return?

1060
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,605
Oh, a week? Hard to say.

1061
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,731
<i>- I'll</i> leave him a note. Have an envelope?
- Right here.

1062
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:42,410
Lafitte. I knew a Lafitte.
Where did your people come from?

1063
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,883
- Here. Paris.
-Paris?

1064
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,170
Probably no relation.

1065
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,928
This is for your father's eyes alone...

1066
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,482
...and I'd appreciate it if you
gave him the letter yourself.

1067
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:17,168
What a horrible man.
How do you know him?

1068
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,163
What does this mean?

1069
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,006
"Your daughter has been seduced
by a dangerous radical...

1070
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:25,731
...named Marius Pontmercy.

1071
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,489
- She betrays you every night."
- I don't know.

1072
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,849
Don't lie to me! Have you
given yourself to this person?

1073
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,002
Is it true?
Do you see him every night?

1074
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,881
Go ahead, hit me! Is that why I should
tell you, because you'll hit me?

1075
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,884
- Tell me the truth.
- How dare you ask for the truth...

1076
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,849
...when you only tell me lies?

1077
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,004
Why does a policeman
frighten you out of your wits?

1078
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:51,404
Who is he? Who are you?

1079
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,528
You don't understand.

1080
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,685
You've ruined me. You've ruined us.

1081
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,560
You're right. I don't understand.

1082
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,247
How can I when you
won't tell me the truth?

1083
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,927
What is it? Who are you?

1084
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,491
All right, I'm not going to lie.

1085
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,048
It's true, I love Marius.
I'm not ashamed.

1086
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:21,681
I only have a corner of a bench
to be with him...

1087
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,320
...but that corner is mine.

1088
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,488
It's my life.

1089
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,844
Is that what's going to ruin us?

1090
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,121
Please tell me what this
is all about, Papa.

1091
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,328
Please.

1092
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,484
Please tell me. What is it?

1093
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,521
Please. Please.

1094
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,967
What is it?

1095
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,209
L----

1096
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,444
I am a convict.

1097
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,206
A convict?

1098
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,769
When I was young, just your age...

1099
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,603
...I was very poor. I was starving.

1100
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,283
One day I stood in front of a window.

1101
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,966
A window full of bread.

1102
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,050
There was just glass...

1103
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,922
...between me and
not being hungry anymore.

1104
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,206
It was so easy.

1105
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,289
So I broke it and took what I wanted.

1106
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,520
And then they caught me...

1107
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:41,645
...and put me in chains
for almost 20 years.

1108
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:47,445
They did things to me.

1109
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,369
I can't tell you about it.

1110
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,844
And I did things there in jail.

1111
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,401
Terrible things.

1112
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,366
I became an animal.

1113
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,044
They took my dignity.

1114
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,565
They took everything from me.

1115
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,205
Inspector, where do you
want me tomorrow?

1116
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,601
Should I go back to the Café Musain?

1117
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,364
Not right away.

1118
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,689
Mingle with the crowd at the square,
see where it takes you.

1119
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,887
All right.

1120
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,167
Lafitte, did you find out anything
about his background?

1121
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,762
He's from Vigau, born and raised.

1122
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,641
Lafitte and his daughter Cosette
lived there until 10 years ago.

1123
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,929
Cosette? You didn't tell me
her name was Cosette.

1124
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:47,485
You didn't ask.

1125
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,605
- Not up here, sir.
- The place is empty, sir.

1126
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,840
No one and nothing.
Clean as a whistle.

1127
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,127
He moves fast.

1128
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,081
Yes, he does.

1129
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,766
But there's a way to find him.

1130
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,407
- Marius. Have you seen my babies?
- Not now.

1131
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,803
Not tonight.
We have to plan tomorrow's action.

1132
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,122
We are not having an action.
A revolution.

1133
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,325
We can't tolerate this. We can't allow
the king to bury Lamarque as his hero.

1134
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:27,088
- I promise. One hour. One hour.
- No. Marius, this is not a game.

1135
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:30,130
- Tomorrow you have to mean it.
- I mean it.

1136
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,328
We'll plan our tactics
when I get back.

1137
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,166
When those bastards try to bury
Lamarque, we'll bury them instead.

1138
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,288
You hurry back. After tomorrow...

1139
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,046
...you can make love to her
as a free man.

1140
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,168
Maybe.

1141
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:46,568
Cosette!

1142
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,091
Cosette!

1143
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,569
Cosette!

1144
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,610
"Go to 18 Rue de L'Ouest."

1145
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,086
Why? Why?

1146
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,131
- He has to leave. I have to go with him.
- What's wrong, Cosette?

1147
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,001
- His life is at stake.
- His life? How?

1148
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,845
It's a secret, Marius,
I can't give it away.

1149
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,890
I was an orphan. He saved me.
He gave me everything.

1150
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,567
- I can't leave him right now.
- That means I'll never see you again.

1151
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,650
I know what we can do.
We'll talk to him. He'll agree.

1152
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,246
- You can come with us to England.
- England?

1153
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,051
Cosette, are you crazy?

1154
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:19,091
Tomorrow we're going to fight.
We're going to restore the Republic.

1155
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:24,451
I can't run away now. Why do you have
to go to England? Why now? Why?

1156
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:28,161
- He needs me, Marius. He needs me.
- Why do you have to go now?

1157
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,767
He took care of me,
and now he needs me.

1158
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,647
I understand.

1159
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,244
I understand.

1160
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,926
Don't be sad, Marius. Please.

1161
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,731
Don't be sad, Marius.

1162
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:02,810
When? When? When do you leave?

1163
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,161
Tomorrow no one can leave Paris
because of Lamarque's funeral.

1164
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,961
He's not sure.
He said we might leave the next day.

1165
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,967
I'll be here tomorrow night.

1166
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,527
Promise me. Promise me
you'll meet me here.

1167
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,327
It's obvious
we have them outnumbered.

1168
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,528
There are 24,000 troops in the city...

1169
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,849
...and they can be reinforced
by another 30,000 in two days.

1170
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,571
So the question is,
where to deploy them?

1171
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:58,362
My informers say the critical moment is
when the procession passes the square.

1172
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,722
That's where they'll start the fighting.

1173
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:06,563
Well, we won't fight them
for every inch. We'll surround them.

1174
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,805
<i>Long live the Republic! Long live...</i>

1175
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,803
It's frightening, Papa.

1176
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,928
Why are they so angry about this?

1177
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,765
Lamarque was a hero
who fought for the Republic.

1178
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:20,606
Why is the king giving Lamarque
a state funeral?

1179
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,411
He's trying to claim Lamarque
as his own hero.

1180
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:26,325
It's a lie, it's the final insult.

1181
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,528
That's why they're angry.

1182
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,291
<i>Long live the Republic!</i>

1183
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,610
Long live the Republic!

1184
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,484
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live...

1185
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,246
Long live Lamarque!

1186
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,404
Long live the Republic!

1187
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,206
- Long live the Republic!
- Long live the Republic!

1188
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,125
Long live the Republic!

1189
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,610
- Lamarque is ours!
- Come on!

1190
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,082
Let's bury Lamarque!

1191
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:55,848
Lamarque is our hero!
Come on, everybody, pull!

1192
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,043
Come on!

1193
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,323
Long live the Republic!

1194
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,364
To the barricades!

1195
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,603
Get down!

1196
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,125
Move up!

1197
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,847
Your information is as good as gold...

1198
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,765
...but the idiots
in the municipal guard...

1199
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,163
...ignored your advice
about the arsenal.

1200
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,525
Javert, why are you dressed
like that?

1201
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,763
Because I'm on the trail of someone
who is very dangerous.

1202
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:24,045
It will be an important arrest. Possibly
the most important of my career.

1203
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,567
Indeed? Who is it?

1204
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,722
I'd rather not say until I've got him.

1205
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,647
At the very least,
show me where you're going.

1206
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,446
Past the perimeter. Here.

1207
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,041
There are dozens of barricades.

1208
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:41,524
Anything could happen.
We have no control in this area.

1209
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,446
It's under control, sir.

1210
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,166
As soon as it's dark, we'll go through
the barrier. Hundreds are fleeing.

1211
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:58,001
Police don't care who leaves. More
concerned about people coming in...

1212
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,170
...so it's a perfect opportunity.
Cosette, please!

1213
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,529
How bad is the fighting?

1214
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,002
I didn't go anywhere near it.
I went the other way.

1215
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:12,361
- What are they saying?
- No one really knows what's happening.

1216
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:16,206
The streets are full of barricades.
Everyone says something different.

1217
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:19,682
Whatever the truth is,
a lot of people will die tonight.

1218
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,605
Is it too dangerous for us
to wait till the morning?

1219
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,687
He's not in the barricades?

1220
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,088
I promised I'd wait.

1221
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,681
Even if he can't come, I have to wait.

1222
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:46,363
- It hurts this much?
- I'm sorry.

1223
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,364
I've known him only a few weeks,
that's what you think.

1224
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:54,845
I'm only a silly girl, he's little more than
a stranger. But that's not how I feel.

1225
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,808
I understand, my dear.

1226
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,125
Your papers.

1227
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,889
Right.

1228
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,050
Marius. Not tonight.

1229
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,206
One hour.

1230
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:02,566
I'll be gone one hour.

1231
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,802
- I found my boys.
- Well done, Gavroche.

1232
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,003
Marius.

1233
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:39,011
The law is here
to protect you, Cosette...

1234
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,925
...from criminals like this scum.

1235
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:48,289
Is Valjean here? Is he alone?

1236
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:50,169
I'll never tell you anything.

1237
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,527
Do you know who and what
you're protecting?

1238
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:55,248
Didn't he tell you
he's a common thief?

1239
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,007
- I know exactly who he is.
- Oh, yes? Did he tell you who you are?

1240
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,640
Did he tell you
you're a bastard child?

1241
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,366
Did he tell you
your mother was a whore?

1242
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,805
- You're breaking the law.
- Untie me.

1243
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,122
There'll be no turning back.

1244
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,209
Who are you?

1245
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,607
Who are you?

1246
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:28,845
I'm Chief Inspector Javert. If you
surrender, things will go better for you.

1247
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,482
Surrender? I'm taking you
to face the people's justice.

1248
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,482
At the barricades?

1249
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:42,926
You fool. Don't you know
your revolution has no chance?

1250
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:47,165
If we die, you die with us.

1251
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,241
Goodbye, Marius.

1252
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,571
I love you, Cosette.

1253
01:51:57,880 --> 01:51:59,962
Go on!

1254
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,650
He came to say goodbye.

1255
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,646
He loves me, Papa.

1256
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,367
He loves me.

1257
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:31,045
Take her to our old house.

1258
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,929
It's going to be all right.
I promise you.

1259
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,327
Fire at will!

1260
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,128
So here we are.

1261
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,088
I was right.

1262
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,046
You know him?

1263
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:56,967
When we have a spare bullet,
we're going to kill him.

1264
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,563
What are you doing here?
Where is Cosette?

1265
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:21,042
Waiting for you in the house
where you fell in love.

1266
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,645
- Go to her. Go to her.
- I can't. Not now.

1267
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,491
- Not now.
- She's your future.

1268
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,120
If we can't win,
then none of us have a future.

1269
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,362
You have love.

1270
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:36,169
That's the only future God gives us.

1271
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,529
Go.

1272
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,282
Gavroche, get back!

1273
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:45,846
- Gavroche!
- I need bullets.

1274
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,287
- Gavroche!
- Get back here!

1275
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,724
Come back!

1276
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,245
- Gavroche!
- Get back here!

1277
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,209
Gavroche! Come back!

1278
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,650
Come back!

1279
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,207
Papa!

1280
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,041
'Papa!
'Papa.

1281
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:23,566
Let's do it now.

1282
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,686
- You proud of your work?
- You're next.

1283
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,402
Let me do it.

1284
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:38,524
You kill him in the alley.

1285
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,923
We don't want his blood
in here with ours.

1286
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:58,485
A knife. That's right.
It suits you better.

1287
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:00,728
Why? Why couldn't you
leave me alone?

1288
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,249
- I'm nothing. I'm no one!
- Yes, but you've managed to beat me.

1289
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:08,131
I'm not trying to beat you.
I want to live in peace!

1290
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,850
Then hurry up and do it.

1291
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,560
Your friends need you.

1292
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:33,484
That way. Through the gate.
You'll be safe.

1293
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,167
- You plan to shoot me in the back.
- I'm letting you go, Javert.

1294
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,884
You'd better hurry.

1295
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,088
They won't be merciful.

1296
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,488
Go on.

1297
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:48,647
You should kill me.

1298
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,127
I won't stop.

1299
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:54,442
Understand?

1300
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,651
I won't let you go.

1301
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,321
You should end this.

1302
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:06,969
Kill me.

1303
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:18,971
You're dead, Javert.

1304
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:33,490
- Get back!
- Everybody, get back!

1305
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,811
- Yes, sir!
- On the back! Back!

1306
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,325
Take them in two!

1307
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:06,010
Have at them, lads!

1308
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:12,126
Surrender!

1309
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,882
Surrender or be shot!

1310
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,370
- Well done! Men, search the building!
- Yes, sir!

1311
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,761
Stand. Stand.

1312
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,208
- Look on the other side of the street!
- Sir!

1313
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:26,885
Follow me!

1314
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,524
You men in there,
check that doorway!

1315
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,484
Come on. Do it. Jump.

1316
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,003
Long live the Republic!

1317
01:58:58,160 --> 01:59:01,482
- Long live the Republic!
- This way, lads. Be quick about it.

1318
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:06,681
Long live the Republic!

1319
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,810
- Aim!
- Long live the Republic!

1320
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,564
Long live the Republic!

1321
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,801
Fire!

1322
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,691
- You two, look on the roof.
- Sir.

1323
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,209
Get some lanterns. Hurry.

1324
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,005
- This way.
- He's smarter than that.

1325
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:01,925
He'll go downhill to the river.
Come on.

1326
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:23,805
It's all right. It's all right.

1327
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,690
It's all right.

1328
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,645
Now, come on, help me.

1329
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,881
You must help me.

1330
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,127
Push.

1331
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:43,483
Push!

1332
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,411
Pull. Pull!

1333
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,481
Is he alive?

1334
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:55,323
Careful.

1335
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,848
Careful.

1336
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:04,367
- He needs a doctor.
- To make him healthy...

1337
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,806
...for the firing squad?

1338
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,925
You know there'll be an amnesty
in a few days. It's me you want.

1339
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,003
- Yes.
- Arrest me.

1340
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,969
Let him go.

1341
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:20,125
- Is that all you care about?
- You've caught me.

1342
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,601
That's what you care about.

1343
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:33,890
Let him take the boy where he wants.
Then bring him back hereto me.

1344
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,321
- Marius. Marius.
- He'll live.

1345
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:11,000
- Toussaint, find a doctor.
- Yes, monsieur.

1346
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,605
Marius.

1347
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,922
Take some money.
Promise him more.

1348
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,401
- Yes, monsieur.
- Go, go!

1349
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,523
I promised I would give you this.

1350
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,686
It was your mother's.

1351
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,647
She was a good woman.

1352
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:58,326
I loved her, Cosette.

1353
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,927
- No.
- I've told you everything.

1354
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:08,327
- Take care of him. Live a happy life.
- No!

1355
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:13,687
I made an arrangement, my dear.
I have to go.

1356
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,726
- Promise me you'll be happy.
- No. Not like this, Papa, not like this.

1357
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:21,407
This is right, my dear.
I stole something, I did.

1358
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,803
I stole happiness with you.
I don't mind paying.

1359
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,281
- Go to him. He is your life now.
- Please.

1360
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,845
No.

1361
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,362
Bring him here.

1362
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,527
That is an important memo
for the prefect.

1363
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,047
It explains what I've done
with the prisoner.

1364
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,443
- Make sure he sees it before breakfast.
- Sir.

1365
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,890
I'm glad I had time to myself.

1366
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:55,808
I needed to think about
what you deserve.

1367
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:58,563
You're a difficult problem.

1368
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,763
Move to the edge.

1369
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,606
- Why aren't you taking me in?
- You're my prisoner. Do what I tell you!

1370
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,009
You don't understand
the importance of the law.

1371
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:14,482
I've given you an order. Obey it.

1372
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,286
Why didn't you kill me?

1373
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:29,846
I don't have the right to kill you.

1374
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,606
But you hate me.

1375
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,569
I don't hate you.

1376
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:39,090
I don't feel anything.

1377
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:42,289
You don't want to go back
to the quarries, do you?

1378
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,206
Then for once, we agree.

1379
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:00,925
I'm going to spare you
from a life in prison, Jean Valjean.

1380
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:06,564
It's a pity the rules don't allow me
to be merciful.

1381
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:20,603
I've tried to live my life
without breaking a single rule.

1382
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:28,809
You're free.
