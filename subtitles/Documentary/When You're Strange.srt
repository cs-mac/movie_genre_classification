1
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, I am, I'm just a love man.

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let me tell you somethin'

3
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Which one of you, girls, want me to hold you?

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Which one of you, girls, want me to kiss you?

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Which one of you, girls, want me to take you out?

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go on, I got you, gonna knock you all night, 'cause, baby, I'm a love man...

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is Jim Ladd of KLOS.

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special bulletin.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rock music fans all over the world are in mourning today.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
was found dead in his Paris apartment this morning.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
French authorities attribute the cause of death to a heart attack.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Morrison was 27 years old.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Goodbye, Jim.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We'll miss you...

16
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jim Morrison was buried today in Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The coffin was sealed,

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and only his girlfriend, Pamela Courson

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and The Doors' manager were in attendance.

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
With his passing, the future of The Doors remains uncertain.

21
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm Jim Ladd on 95.5 KLOS,

22
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and I'll be here all night

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
as we pay tribute to one of America's most original and influential...

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The sixties begin with a shot.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The civil rights movement intensifies.

26
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The war in Vietnam gets bigger and bloodier.

27
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
"President Johnson, meanwhile, let it be known

28
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that the FBI is closely watching all anti-war activities".

29
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The youth movement catches fire,

30
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
making everyone over 30 a cultural enemy.

31
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The days of Ricky Nelson and "Leave It To Beaver" are over.

32
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
"I have nothing against kissing.

33
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But these friends of yours, Penny,

34
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They want to kiss you all night!"

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The establishment resists,

36
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
but a genuine counter-culture is growing.

37
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
For some, psychedelics like LSD open the doors of perception.

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The Gate Is Straight,

39
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Deep And Wide,

40
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Break On Through To The Other Side...

41
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A massive cultural earthquake is splitting the country wide open.

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And out of the crack steps a band called The Doors.

43
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
­ Name?- Robby Krieger.

44
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
- Age? - 22 years old.

45
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
- Occupation? - Guitar.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
- Name? - John Densmore.

47
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
- Age? - 23.

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
- Occupation? - Percussionist.

49
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
- Name?- Raymond Daniel Manzarek.

50
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
- Age? - Born 2/12/39.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
- Occupation? - Musician, organist.

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
- Name?- Uh... Jim.

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
- Occupation? - Um...

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jim Morrison is the oldest son of a decorated navy officer.

55
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
At 16, he's already reading Nietzsche, Rimbaud and William Blake.

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He's also obsessed with Elvis Presley.

57
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One teacher sends home a note scolding him as "self-centered".

58
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He goes to three colleges before attending the film school at UCLA.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
One of his friends there is Ray Manzarek,

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
who's also playing keyboards in his brother's surf band,

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Rick and The Ravens.

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Ray started with classical piano,

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but quickly turned on to jazz and Chicago blues.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jim, too, had an affinity for the blues.

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They shared a common interest in cinema.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They were also dropping acid several times a month.

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Jim makes one film at UCLA.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It earns him a D.

69
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He skips his graduatio

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and tells Ray he's moving to New York City.

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But a few months later,

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ray runs into Jim at the beach in Venice.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's been living on someone's roof

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and writing songs for a rock concert he hears in his head.

75
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ray asks him to sing one.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jim hesitates.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Then he sings Moonlight Drive.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's Swim To The Moon, Uh-Huh,

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's Climb Through The Tide...

80
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ray is impressed by the poetry of his lyrics.

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They decide to start a band.

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Jim's already chosen a name from a poem by William Blake.

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
"If the doors of perception were cleansed,

84
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
everything would appear to man as it is:

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
infinite".

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Jim moves in with Ray and his girlfriend, Dorothy Fujikawa.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ray invites someone from his meditation class

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to come jam with them.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
John Densmore brings his friend, Robby Krieger.

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Jim loves his bottleneck slide so much,

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
he wants to use it on every song.

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Robby and John like his lyrics more than his voice,

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but something about their lead singer pulls them in.

94
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In the summer of 1965, The Doors are born.

95
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Jim had never sung before.

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Robby had only been playing electric guitar for 6 months.

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
His original training was on acoustic - Spanish flamenco.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He'd played in one rock band with Densmore,

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
when they were both in high school.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
John had morphed from a high school marching band

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to a certified jazz freak into Coltrane and Mingus.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ray rents a house,

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and the band rehearses there all summer.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Jim says they need more songs

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and tells everyone to write one over the weekend.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Only Robby does his homework.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The first song he writes is called Light My Fire.

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Know That It Will Be Untrue,

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Know That I Would Be A Liar

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If I Was To Say To You

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Girl, We Couldn't Get Much Higher.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Come On, Baby, Light My Fire.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Try To Set The Night On Fire.

114
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Time To Hesitate Is Through,

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No Time To Wallow In The Mire.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Try Now, We Can Only Lose

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And Our Love Become A Funeral Pyre.

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come On, Baby, Light My Fire.

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The Doors get their first gig at a dive in LA called The London Fog.

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Still unsure of himself, Jim turns his back to the audience,

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
facing the band, like he does in rehearsal.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The talent booker for The Whisky A Go Go comes in one night.

123
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She falls for Morrison

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and convinces her boss to hire The Doors

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
as The Whisky's house band.

126
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In late 1966, they're opening for The Turtles,

127
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Buffalo Springfield and Van Morrison.

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Word spreads, especially about the lead singer.

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Jack Holzman, founder of Elektra Records,

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
is so impressed, he offers them a 3-album deal.

131
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The next night, Jim doesn't show up at The Whisky.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
John and Ray head over to the motel he's crashing at

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and find him out of his mind on acid.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
When they get him back to The Whisky,

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Jim wants to play The End,

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
a song he wrote about breaking up with his high-school girlfriend.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The Killer Awoke Before Dawn,

138
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He Put His Boots On.

139
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He Took A Face From The Ancient Gallery And He

140
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He Walked On Down The Hallway, Baby!

141
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Came To A Door

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And He Looked Inside.

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No one in the band knows where he's going.

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Father?

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes, Son?

146
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I Wanna Kill You.

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Mother...

148
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I Want To...

149
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Fuck You All Night, Baby!

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fuck You, Mama, All Night Long!

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You Wait, Mama!

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Gonna Love You, Baby, All Night, Yeah!

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The Whisky's owner calls Jim a "sick bastard"

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and fires them.

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A few weeks later,

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The Doors record their first album in five days.

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Holzman brings in veteran producer Paul Rothchild.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The equipment he uses is state-of-the-art -

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
a 4-track recorder.

160
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He lays down John's drums on one track.

161
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Ray's organ and Robby's guitar take up the second.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The third goes to Jim's vocal,

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
leaving the fourth for all overdubs.

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Light My Fire and The End are over seven minutes long.

165
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Both are recorded in two takes.

166
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
At Jim's insistence,

167
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
all songs are credited simply to The Doors.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
To promote the album,

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Holzman buys a billboard on The Sunset Strip.

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No one has done this before.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Break On Through is their first single.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It stalls at number 106.

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Holzman shifts quickly to Light My Fire.

174
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Rothchild cuts the instrumentals, and the song hits the AM airwaves.

175
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In July of 1967,

176
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the first song Robby Krieger ever wrote climbs to number one in the country.

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ray and Dorothy hear it on their car radio and start screaming.

178
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The first royalty checks give The Doors $ 50,000 apiece.

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Morrison's family is oblivious

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
until a friend of his younger brother comes over with the album.

181
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He thought the guy on the cover looked a little like Jim.

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The family is further surprised

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
when they see how Jim has described them in his bio.

184
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Holzman sends The Doors to New York City.

185
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They're an immediate hit.

186
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Andy Warhol becomes infatuated, particularly with Morrison.

187
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Then, like The Beatles and Rolling Stones before them,

188
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
they perform live on The Ed Sullivan Show.

189
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
- Now The Doors!

190
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Here they are with their newest hit record,

191
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Light My Fire!

192
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Time To Hesitate Is Through,

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No Time To Wallow In The Mire.

194
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Try Now, We Can Only Lose

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And Our Live Become A Funeral Pyre.

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Come On, Baby, Light My Fire.

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Try To Set The Night On... Fire!

198
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Sullivan asks The Doors to take out the word "higher"

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
because of its drug implications.

200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They agree.

201
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
During the performance,

202
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Jim sings the song exactly as written.

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Girl, We Couldn't Get Much Higher.

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Come On, Baby, Light My Fire.

205
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Try To Set The Night On Fire!

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Try To Set The Night On... Fire!

207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's been barely a year

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
since their shy young singer couldn't even face his audience.

209
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Now, the metamorphosis is complete.

210
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
- Need A Match?

211
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
"As I look back over my life,

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm struck by the postcards,

213
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
ruined snapshots,

214
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
faded posters of a time I can't recall".

215
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
French officials deny any evidence of drug overdose,

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
but a cloud of mystery hangs over Morrison's death.

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Some claim he's still alive and that his death was just a hoax,

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
perhaps planned by Morrison himself.

219
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Numerous sightings of the singer have already been reported.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No, the mood I get from most of itNis a kind of a heavy...

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Kind of a sort of gloomy feeling, you know.

222
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Like of someone not quite at home

223
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Or, you know, or not quite... Not quite relaxed, and...

224
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You know, aware of a lot of things

225
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
but not quite sure about anything, you know?

226
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
People Are Strange

227
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
When You're A Stranger.

228
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Faces Look Ugly

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When You're Alone.

230
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Women Seem Wicked

231
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When You're Unwanted.

232
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Streets Are Uneven

233
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When You're Down.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When You're Strange,

235
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Faces Come Out Of The Rain.

236
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
When You're Strange,

237
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No One Remembers Your Name

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When You're Strange,

239
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When You're... Strange.

240
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The fact is, the music is strange.

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It is music for the different, the uninvited.

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It carries the listener into the shadowy realm of dream.

243
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Part of the strangeness comes from their lack of a bass player.

244
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This leaves Densmore to hold the beat.

245
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But his jazz sensibility keeps it both tight and unpredictable.

246
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Krieger's flamenco influences bring another layer of mystery.

247
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He never uses a pick,

248
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
playing rhythm and lead with his fingernails.

249
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But the sound needs a bottom.

250
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Manzarek discovers an electric piano bass

251
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and plays the bass line with his left hand.

252
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He uses his right for chords and his Bach-tinged blues runs.

253
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The organ carries a hint of the carnival -

254
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
both childlike and darkly disturbing.

255
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's no accident their second album, Strange Days,

256
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
features circus performers on its cover.

257
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But if the band has a surreal fairground air,

258
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
it is Morrison who is the frenzied trapeze artist.

259
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Love Me Two Times, Baby, Love Me Twice Today.

260
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Love Me Two Times, Girl, I'm Goin' Away.

261
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Love Me Two Times, Girl,

262
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
One For Tomorrow, One Just For Today.

263
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Love Me Two Times, I'm Goin' Away.

264
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
To Ray, he's like an ancient shaman,

265
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
leading his followers into worlds they'd never dare enter alone.

266
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I Could Not Speak.

267
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Love Me One Time,

268
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, My Knees Got Weak.

269
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Love Me Two Times, Girl,

270
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Last Me All Through The Week.

271
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Love Me Two Times, I'm Goin' Away.

272
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Morrison is both innocent and profane.

273
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He's a rock and roll poet,

274
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
dangerous and highly intelligent.

275
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No one has had this exact combination before.

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No matter how high he flies,

277
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
his bandmates are always there

278
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
to catch him and guide him back to earth.

279
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Their first hit of fame is sudden and intense.

280
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
- I even like them more than The Beatles!

281
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
- The Doors, they are so much better!

282
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
- Do you think you're a political group?

283
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- We're, um...

284
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Foremost, we're, um... Musicians and writers.

285
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
- No, you can't take a lit cigarette. Sorry.

286
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
- I'll see how I feel after a beer.

287
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
- You want people to like you?

288
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
- Well, I'd like them to listen.

289
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'd like them to... Give the music a chance, and...

290
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Just to listen.

291
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
- The music can't help

292
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
but reflecting things that are happening around you.

293
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
- I think for your own sake,

294
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
while all the police are out there containing the kids,

295
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
you ought to get in the car and split. I really do.

296
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Unless he wants to get...

297
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it's up to him.

298
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's up to him, unless he wants to...

299
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Have them grab at his body.

300
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
- If he doesn't want it, I'll take it.

301
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
- And Bill and Todd will take the leftovers.

302
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
- Aloha!

303
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
- I've noticed that when people are joking,

304
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
they're usually dead serious.

305
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And when they're dead serious, it's usually pretty funny.

306
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
- You should say that at a concert.

307
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
- Is your band like The Monkees?

308
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
- The Monkees?

309
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
- I said like The Monkees.

310
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
- All of our music is really so

311
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
symbolic rather than direct to the point, you know...

312
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
- Everybody's always talking about

313
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
rock and roll and jazz finally blending, you know...

314
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I don't think that can really happen, but...

315
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If it's supposed to, I think we're it.

316
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
- OK, this time, can you look to me, please?

317
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
- I want to touch The Doors!

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
- Hey, quit knocking on the door. Hey!

319
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
- Can you get Jim out?

320
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Come on, just take one picture.

321
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
- We paid to be here!

322
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Most of the attention goes to Jim.

323
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
If it bothers Robby, Ray or John,

324
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
they don't outwardly show it.

325
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But Jim relishes the attention.

326
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He seems to have been born instantly ready for fame.

327
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Everything he does seems either brilliant

328
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
or brilliantly calculated for effect.

329
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
- I think, you know, these days,

330
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
especially in The States, you have to be

331
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
a politician or an assassin

332
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
or something to really be a superstar.

333
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Without a personal manager or publicist,

334
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Jim takes control of his own image.

335
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
He picks out all his clothes,

336
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
from the conch belts to the leather pants

337
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
seemingly designed to accentuate his crotch.

338
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
- Hi! Hi, Jim!

339
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
- We're gotta go to the... dressing room, right?

340
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
- All right, man.

341
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
- OK, we're going to go to the dressing room now.

342
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
- Wait a while, don't get out yet.

343
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He understood exactly how to make it all work for him,

344
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and perhaps to protect himself,

345
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
he made it seem like he couldn't care less.

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
In 1968, The Who opened for The Doors at The Singer Bowl on Long Island.

347
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
- Don't go in, we need you.

348
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
- How much are these?

349
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
- $ 1.

350
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
- Can I look at it first to see what I want?

351
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I've got one.

352
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
How much are those?

353
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
- $ 1. - $ 1?

354
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's hard to tell if he's simply mingling with his fans

355
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
or if he's drawing something crucial from them,

356
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
as if he needs their attention to survive.

357
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
- Make sure that The Doors know

358
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that New York collectively welcomes them at The Singer Bowl.

359
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The Doors! The Doors!

360
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The Singer Bowl crowd is already worked up.

361
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Morrison stokes them further.

362
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
No One Here Gets Out Alive Now.

363
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You Get Yours, Mama, I'll Get Mine.

364
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Gonna Make It, Baby... Come On!

365
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Someone throws a chair.

366
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
- Everybody feel all right?

367
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
- The show is over, kids, so go on home.

368
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes, please, go home.

369
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
- Give him a hand and help him if she's too heavy. Stay where you are.

370
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
- No, she's...She was just an innocent bystander.

371
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
- That became a victim.

372
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
- And someone whacked her with a chair.

373
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
- Why'd they whack her with a chair? - I don't know.

374
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
- Are you sure it was a chair? - I don't know what it was.

375
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Someone hit me, I fell, and I wound up here.

376
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
- Where did they get a chair? There weren't any chairs.

377
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
- I don't know.

378
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Earlier in the concert, Jeff Silverman is taking pictures in the front row.

379
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
He sees Jim look directly at a young girl and grab his crotch.

380
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Her boyfriend picks up a chair.

381
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
According to Silverman, it was the first chair to be thrown.

382
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
- It's already coagulating. I think you're going to be OK.

383
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I am The Lizard King! I can do anything!

384
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Morrison's poem, The Celebration Of The Lizard,

385
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
was to take up one whole side of The Doors' next album,

386
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
but Paul Rothchild chooses not to include it.

387
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Jim's behavior is becoming unpredictable,

388
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and Rothchild is under pressure to get another record out

389
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
while the band is hot.

390
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He fills out the side with unused songs from their first album.

391
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Despite the raw intensity of new songs like Five To One and Unknown Soldier

392
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
critics dismiss the record.

393
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But fans judge it differently.

394
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Both the album and Morrison's Hello, I Love You hit number one.

395
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
- Something like that.

396
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
- Don't overblow, Jim. You got a long way to go.

397
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
- Why not?

398
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In 1968, The Doors begin recording The Soft Parade.

399
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Paul Rothchild produces, with Bruce Botnick as his engineer.

400
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Jim has begun coming into the studio drunk or high.

401
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Robby writes half the songs on Soft Parade,

402
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and for the first time he and Jim separate their writing credits.

403
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
- Well, you know what Robby's trying to do, that sound.

404
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
- Yeah, I know that.

405
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
- Stupidest ending I've ever heard on any song.

406
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
- What's stupid, the ending?

407
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
- Yeah. Yeah, just...

408
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
- How's that again?

409
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
- Robby does two, John one, I do two, and then you come in.

410
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
- That sounds good, Robby. Here we go. One time, everybody, please.

411
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Wild Child Full Of Grace,

412
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Saver Of The Human Race

413
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Your Cool Face...

414
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Natural Child, Terrible Child

415
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Not Your Mother's Or YourNFather's Child, You're

416
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Our Child Screaming Wild...

417
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Do you know the warm progress under the stars?

418
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Do you know we exist?

419
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom?

420
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Have you been born yet, and are you alive?

421
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The youth movement keeps growing.

422
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
- So like I was telling you, honey,

423
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
before these cameramen came along,

424
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
death in our time...

425
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
- Yes, yes?

426
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
- Oh, man, I don't know.

427
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And by 1968, the country was radically changed.

428
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
- And I pledge, if you give me your help,

429
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
if you give me your hand,

430
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
that I will work with you,

431
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and we will have a new America!

432
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Thank you very much!

433
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ray originally thought LSD was the key to enlightenment.

434
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But a series of bad trips sends him in a different direction.

435
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
He turned to meditation, along with Robby and John,

436
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
attempting to find his bliss elsewhere.

437
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Morrison keeps tripping for a while...

438
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
When The Music's Over.

439
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
When The Music's Over, Yeah-Yeah.

440
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
When The Music's Over,

441
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Turn Out The Light,

442
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Turn Out The Light...

443
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Well, The Music Is Your Special Friend.

444
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Dance On Fire As It Intends.

445
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Music Is Your Only Friend

446
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Until The End,

447
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Until The... End!

448
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Jim still has doubts about his voice.

449
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He's had no musicial training and he can't read a note.

450
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Sinatra has replaced Elvis as his favorite singer.

451
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He describes his own voice as a scream or "a sick croon".

452
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Cancel My Subscription To The Resurrection,

453
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Send My Credentials To The House Of Detention.

454
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I've Got Some Friends Inside...

455
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Morrison takes a hard turn from psychedelics to booze.

456
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Soft Parade takes 11 months to record.

457
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is partly due to Rothchild's insistence on perfection.

458
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
He makes the band do hundreds of takes.

459
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But no one talks about the elephant in the room.

460
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Densmore develops headaches and breaks out in rashes from the tension.

461
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
One day, John walks out of the studio, saying he can't take it anymore.

462
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The next morning, he shows up,

463
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and the band continues recording without a word.

464
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Gonna Win, Yeah, We're Takin' Over. Come On!

465
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Sometimes the drinking helps Morrison.

466
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Sometimes it doesn't.

467
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The band becomes adept at keeping him alive onstage.

468
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
His first onstage arrest had come early, in New Haven, Connecticut.

469
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Before the concert, Jim is making out with a girl in a shower stall backstage.

470
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
A cop walks in on them.

471
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Not recognizing Jim, he orders them out.

472
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Jim tells him to go fuck himself.

473
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The cop maces him.

474
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Minutes before the show, Jim is in agony.

475
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
His eyes are still bloodshot and streaming with tears.

476
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
In the middle of the first song,

477
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
he stops and tells the audience what's just happened to him.

478
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Jim keeps calling the cop

479
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
"A little blue man in a little blue suit with a little blue cap".

480
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
When the police move in,

481
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Jim offers them a chance to "say their thing".

482
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They choose not to.

483
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Jim is arrested for breach of peace and immoral exhibition.

484
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Two cops punch him in the face and kick him when he falls.

485
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This starts the reputation of The Doors as a dirty and dangerous band.

486
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It also marks a change between The Doors and their audience.

487
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
They're coming now to watch Morrison go crazy.

488
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
There is a growing sense

489
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
that the fans are not there to hear the music,

490
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
but to witness a spectacle.

491
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It is becoming harder and harder

492
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
to distinguish between himself and the person who appears onstage.

493
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But the train keeps picking up speed, and no one wants off.

494
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
In April 1968, The Village Voice chooses Morrison as vocalist of the year.

495
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The Doors win best band,

496
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and Ray Manzarek is best musician after Eric Clapton and Ravi Shankar.

497
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The Soft Parade goes gold, making 4 gold albums in a row.

498
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Touch Me, written by Krieger,

499
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
gives the band their third top-10 single.

500
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Come On, Come On, Come On, Come On, Now,

501
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Touch Me, Baby.

502
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Can't You See That I Am Not Afraid?

503
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
What Was That Promise That You Made?

504
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Why Won't You Tell Me What She Said?

505
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
What Was That Promise That You Made?

506
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm Gonna Love You Till The Heaven Stop The Rain.

507
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm Gonna Love You Till The Stars Fall From The Sky...

508
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
By late December 1968

509
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The Doors are being hailed as America's Rolling Stones.

510
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And just at that moment, Jim announces he's quitting.

511
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The band is stunned.

512
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Without Jim, there is no Doors.

513
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
- We need you to stay in the game.

514
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
- Well, the thing is, I don't think I like the game.

515
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
His girlfriend, Pam Courson,

516
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
encourages him to forget music and concentrate on his poetry.

517
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Jim's already self-published two notebooks of his poems,

518
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
both dedicated to her.

519
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
His poetry is symbolic and pure.

520
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It frees him from the requirements of rock stardom.

521
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
- Yeah, posing for a picture, can you imagine?

522
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You know, and really looking in the camera and really posing?

523
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's insane! I must have been out of my mind!

524
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But getting out is not as easy as it seems.

525
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Ray convinces him to give it 6 more months.

526
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But as his drinking increases,

527
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Ray sees it give birth to Morrison's alter ego,

528
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
whom he names Jimbo.

529
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Everyone dreads his appearance.

530
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Out of concern for his health and the future of the band,

531
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
they finally confront him directly.

532
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Jim listens politely.

533
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
He stays sober for about a week.

534
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Then Jimbo returns.

535
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The band hires a series of professional drinkers

536
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
to keep tabs on Morrison.

537
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
They can't keep up with him.

538
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
- You got any groovy possy in this joint?

539
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Any LSD? Any LSD?

540
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
At a party in LA, he ends up with his face in Janis Joplin's lap.

541
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
She breaks down in tears, and then cracks a whiskey bottle over his head.

542
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Pam gets tired of Jim's drunken infidelities.

543
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
She convinces him to see a psychiatrist.

544
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Jim goes to one session.

545
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
He's moving further away from his family.

546
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
When his mother comes to watch The Doors in Washington, DC,

547
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Jim does not see her.

548
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
He hasn't spoken to his father since 1966,

549
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
when he got a letter from him

550
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
with the advice "to give up any idea of singing

551
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
or any connection with a musical group

552
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
because of what I consider a complete lack of talent in this direction".

553
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
At the height of his son's fame,

554
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Admiral Morrison is commanding

555
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
a division of aircraft carriers off the coast of Vietnam.

556
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
In his world, survival depends on obedience.

557
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
To Jim, obedience is suicide.

558
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
- Would anybody like to see my genitals?

559
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't think there should be a president, man.

560
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I think it should be a total democracy!

561
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But I'll tell you this, man, I'll tell you this.

562
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I don't know what's going to happen, man,

563
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
but I want to have my kicks before the whole shit house goes up in flames.

564
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All Right? All Right!

565
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
In September 1968, The Doors tour Europe.

566
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
They're a big hit, even after Jim swallows a chunk of hash in Amsterdam

567
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and collapses unconscious on stage.

568
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The band plays the gig without him, with Ray doing all the singing.

569
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Afterwards, Jim stays in London with Pam,

570
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
hanging out with poet Michael McClure.

571
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The three of them go off on a drinking binge.

572
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
When Jim resurfaces,

573
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
he discovers The Doors have licensed Light My Fire

574
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
for use in a car commercial.

575
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Robby, Ray and John explain they've tried to find him for days.

576
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
They thought the commercial was unique and felt Jim would agree.

577
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But Jim does not agree.

578
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The car commercial and $ 75,000 evaporate.

579
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The alcohol takes a personal toll.

580
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
In the beginning, as Ray pulls the band together,

581
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
he and Jim are very close.

582
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Jim had always welcomed Robby,

583
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
offering advice like giving each lyric a double meaning.

584
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
His drinking drives a wedge between them.

585
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
John and Jim used to drive around,

586
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
fantasizing about being in a famous rock and roll band.

587
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
The alcohol pushes them apart as well.

588
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They all see Jim struggle, but have no idea how to help him.

589
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And now, The Doors start playing larger arenas.

590
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The first is The Hollywood Bowl in 1968.

591
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Jim seems a little off.

592
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
John thinks he's dropped acid right before the show.

593
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Robby feels Jim was distracted by Mick Jagger

594
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
sitting in the front row with Pam on his lap.

595
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They sell out Madison Square Garden and The LA Forum,

596
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and in early 1969, their manager, Bill Siddons,

597
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
books their first extensive US tour.

598
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
They'll hit 19 cities.

599
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Their first gig is in Miami.

600
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The band arrives early, minus Morrison.

601
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
He's had a fight with Pam and missed his plane.

602
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
He misses another flight hanging out in the airport bar

603
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and shows up 20 minutes late.

604
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
- Ladies and gentlemen, The Doors!

605
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The mood inside the converted airplane hangar is already tense.

606
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The promoter has pulled out all the seats so he could sell another 2000 tickets.

607
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
As the band takes the stage, Jim seems preoccupied.

608
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The week before, The Living Theatre had performed in Los Angeles.

609
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Their manifesto is radically political -

610
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
change can only come from a rejection of all rules.

611
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Jim goes to every performance.

612
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
He once called The Doors "erotic politicians",

613
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
but he confesses to the group's director

614
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
that though he has the ear of a generation,

615
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
he feels he's never had anything to say.

616
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He chooses this moment to change that.

617
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah! Now listen here!

618
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I ain't talking about no revolution!

619
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And I'm not talking about no demonstration!

620
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I'm talking about having a good time!

621
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm talking about love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.

622
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Grab your fucking friend and love him. Come on!

623
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Hey, listen, I'm lonely.

624
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I need some love, you all. Come on!

625
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I need some good-time loving, sweetheart.

626
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Love me. Come on!

627
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Someone throws a gallon of orange paint at the band.

628
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You're All A Bunch Of Fucking Idiots!

629
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You're All A Bunch Of Slaves,

630
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Letting People Tell You What You're Gonna Do!

631
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
How Long Are You Gonna Let Them Push You Around?

632
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Maybe You Love It!

633
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Maybe You Love Getting Your Face Stuck In The Shit! Come On!

634
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
What Are You Gonna Do About It?

635
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
There's a rush at the stage.

636
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Now, Listen,

637
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Anybody That Wants To Come Up Here And Join Us

638
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And Do Some Dancing, Have Some Fun, Just Get On Up Here. Come On!

639
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
A friend of Jim's walks out and hands him a lamb.

640
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'd Fuck Her, But She's Too Young.

641
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
A woman pours a bottle of champagne over Morrison.

642
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
He takes off his wet shirt, urging everyone to join him.

643
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Shirts, pants, bras and underwear sail through the air.

644
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
But there's only one song they wanna hear.

645
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
- Light My Fire! Light My Fire!

646
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Morrison gets angry.

647
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
"You Came To See Something Else, Didn't You?"

648
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
"All Right, Here's My Cock!".

649
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Now, we're not going to leave until we all get our rocks off.

650
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Ray yells out for someone to stop him.

651
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
- Go on, someone's going to get hurt.

652
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
The stage starts to collapse.

653
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Robby and John jump off.

654
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Manzarek keeps playing.

655
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Jim is thrown into the audience by a security guard.

656
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Less than an hour after it started, the concert is over.

657
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The Doors play fragments of only 4 songs.

658
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The next day, the entire band flies to Jamaica for a vacation.

659
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Unknown to them, something strange is happening back in Miami.

660
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
- The Doors are out to make their own scene.

661
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It was a bad scene, and...

662
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Like I say, it was completely unwarranted,

663
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
uncalled for, on all parts.

664
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It didn't seem like actual entertainment

665
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
that we've expected to see.

666
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Seemed like very many people were under the influence of drugs.

667
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
We have to do something about this. This is real disgusting.

668
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
My children, when I grow up and I have children,

669
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
do I want them in an environment like this?

670
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I mean, is this progress, or are we decaying in a way?

671
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
We have taken out two warrants for Jim Morrison.

672
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
One of them is for indecent exposure.

673
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
The other is for the use of obscene languages

674
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
during his performance at Dinner Key Saturday night.

675
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
We have been delayed on issuing these warrants

676
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
because we were waiting, hoping to get pictures

677
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that were taken during the performance.

678
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Jim's hit with one felony and three misdemeanors,

679
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
but it's the felony charge that is the most disturbing.

680
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It claims that Jim did lewdly and lasciviously

681
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
"expose his penis, place his hands upon his penis and shake it,

682
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and did simulate the acts of masturbation upon himself

683
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and oral copulation upon another".

684
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Although many pictures were taken during the concert,

685
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
none show Morrison exposing himself.

686
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But for proof of oral copulation,

687
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the prosecution offers this photo as evidence.

688
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The charges take The Doors by surprise.

689
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Over a hundred cops had been at the concert.

690
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
None had attempted to stop Morrison.

691
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
To John, the only thing they were guilty of was a lousy show.

692
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
- I especially thank my fellow citizens who join me...

693
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
But a wave of conservatism is sweeping the country.

694
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
- For over five months, our community has been subjected...

695
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Decency rallies are held, specifically targeting The Doors.

696
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
- The people of Dade County have said "Enough, enough, enough!".

697
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Even the rock and roll press turns against them.

698
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
...to break its contract and cancel two concerts of The Doors.

699
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Radio stations stop playing The Doors' music.

700
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
...performances would be obnoxious.

701
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And one by one, every remaining city

702
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
on The Doors' first major tour gets canceled.

703
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Finally, on April 4 of 1969 Jim Morrison surrenders to the FBI.

704
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The trial starts in August.

705
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Ray, Robby and John testify in Jim's defense.

706
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
All of them deny seeing Jim expose himself.

707
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
- Jim, you're facing 3 1/2 years in state prison for the Miami incident.

708
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The scope of this trial goes way beyond rock and roll.

709
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It's really about the first amendment.

710
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
- What we're testing down there is the...

711
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Issue of artistic freedom of expression.

712
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But the prosecutor, Terrence McWilliams, seems preoccupied with sex.

713
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
He keeps returning to the oral copulation charge.

714
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Jim explains he was down on his knees

715
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
simply to admire Robby's intricate finger work.

716
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
McWilliams scoffs, saying Jim must have seen Robby

717
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
perform this solo hundreds of times.

718
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Jim replies, "Well, Robby gets better and better all the time".

719
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Although a comedy of errors, trial is no joke.

720
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
On October 30 of 1969,

721
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Morrison is found guilty of profanity and indecent exposure.

722
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
- Jim, you have anything to say?

723
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Judge Murray Goodman sentences Jim

724
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
to four months of hard labor in the Dade county jail.

725
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
The Doors' attorney quickly files an appeal,

726
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
but the uncertainty of its outcome

727
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
throws The Doors into an uneasy state of limbo.

728
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Morrison takes it the hardest.

729
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's more than just fear of spending time in a deep-southern jail.

730
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It's as if he's suddenly realized he's not invincible.

731
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Like Morrison, the country's innocence is being tested as well.

732
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
A spasm of violence ripples throughout the decade,

733
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and it continues to be reflected in The Doors' music.

734
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Morrison believes violence is an American tradition.

735
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Its citizens are addicted to it and enchanted by it.

736
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The Doors had passed on Woodstock,

737
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
so in 1970, while still waiting on their Miami appeal,

738
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
they fly to a small island off the coast of England.

739
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The concert at The Isle of Wight

740
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
is intended to be a fusion of spirit

741
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and the world's best rock musicians,

742
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but fans feel the concert should be free.

743
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Police and promoters disagree.

744
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
This Is The End, Beautiful Friend.

745
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
This Is The End, My Only Friend.

746
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Of Our Elaborate Plans,

747
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Of Everything That Stands.

748
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'll  ever Look Into YourNEyes Again.

749
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Can You Picture What We'll Be?

750
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So Limitless And Free,

751
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Desperately In Need

752
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
For Some Stranger's Hand

753
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
In A Desperate Land.

754
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
My thanks to all of you,

755
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and now it's on to Chicago,

756
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and let's win there! Thank you!

757
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Come Ride With Me

758
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
cross The Sea

759
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Endlessly.

760
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Woke Up This Morning, Got The Crossroads On My Mind.

761
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well, I Woke Up This Morning, Got The Crossroads On My Mind.

762
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Take A Walk With Me, Everything Will Work Out Fine.

763
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Well, I Woke Up This Morning, Got The H-Bomb On My Mind.

764
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Take A Walk With Me And Everything Will Be All Right.

765
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
All Right! Ride That Train! Yeah!

766
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
By late 1970, the dream that had stirred an entire generation officially ends.

767
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Charles Manson's use of LSD

768
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
had not led him to enlightenment,

769
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
but into madness.

770
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And a new president removes all hope for change.

771
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Jim's deeply affected by the deaths of Hendrix and Joplin.

772
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
He jokes to friends: "They're looking at number three".

773
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Michael McClure helps change his mood.

774
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
With his support,

775
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Simon and Schuster publishes the first collection of Jim's poems.

776
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The book becomes one of Morrison's proudest accomplishments.

777
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
"Nothing", he says, "is as eternal as poetry and song".

778
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
As the country enters the new decade, The Doors start over.

779
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Morrison Hotel had been another step away from the mainstream.

780
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It took them back to their roots - the blues.

781
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It went gold in 2 days.

782
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Despite the disaster of Miami,

783
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Jack Holzman encourages them to make another album.

784
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But some things stay the same.

785
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Jim shows up late and drunk, only now, he's added cocaine to the mix.

786
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The band is alternately bored and furious at Jim.

787
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Rothchild falls asleep at the console.

788
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
He tries to motivate the band by accusing them of playing cocktail music.

789
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Rothchild finally realizes it's time for him to leave.

790
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
His parting words to The Doors,

791
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
"The only way you'll survive is if you make this record yourselves".

792
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Shocked by his departure, The Doors turn to Bruce Botnick.

793
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Botnick urges the band to just play.

794
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
To John, it's like they're back in the garage,

795
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
back to the four of them just playing music.

796
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's John's idea to slow down the middle of LA Woman.

797
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Jim comes up with a phrase he wants to repeat over and over.

798
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
After they record it, Jim scribbles something on a piece of paper

799
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and shows it to the group.

800
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Mr. Mojo Risin'

801
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
They record quickly, doing several songs a day.

802
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
To help keep Morrison interested,

803
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Botnick brings in Jerry Scheff, Elvis' bass player.

804
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
The band wants Love Her Madly to be the first single,

805
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
but Robby resists, calling his own song too commercial for The Doors.

806
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
His choice is Riders On The Storm.

807
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Riders On The Storm.

808
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Into This House We're Born,

809
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Into This World We're Thrown.

810
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Like A Dog Without A Bone, An Actor Out On Loan.

811
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Riders On The Storm.

812
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
There's A Killer On The Road,

813
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
His Brain Is Squirming Like A Toad.

814
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Take A Long Holiday,

815
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Let Your Children Play.

816
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
If You Give This Man A Ride,

817
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Sweet Memory Will Die.

818
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Killer On The Road.

819
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
It takes just over a week to record the entire album.

820
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Once again, all songs are credited to The Doors.

821
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
On December 8, 1970,

822
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Jim Morrison celebrates his birthday by recording his own poetry.

823
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
- He Was No Private, For He Could Not Be Sold.

824
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
He Was Only A Man,

825
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And His Dedication Extended To The Last Degree.

826
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Poor, Pretentious Soldier, Come Home.

827
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
He's 27.

828
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Friends can't believe the change in only 2 years.

829
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The poetry session snaps him out of a depression,

830
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and he agrees to perform live with The Doors again.

831
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
On December 12th, they play New Orleans, introducing the new songs from LA Woman.

832
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
For a moment, the old Morrison appears.

833
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Then he sits down on stage and doesn't get up.

834
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
It is here Ray says he sees all of Jim's psychic energy leave his body.

835
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
A few days later, Pam Courson returns to LA from a vacation in Paris.

836
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
She discovers Jim sleeping with a woman

837
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
who claims they were married in a pagan witch ceremony.

838
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But the witch flies back to New York, and Jim goes back to Pam.

839
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
She still envisions a life for the two of them

840
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
that starts with Jim leaving The Doors.

841
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
He'll stay home and write poetry

842
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
while she runs an exclusive clothing boutique.

843
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Just after the band finishes mixing LA Woman,

844
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Jim announces he and Pam are moving to Paris.

845
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
He'll relax for a while.

846
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
He'll quit drinking.

847
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
He'll concentrate on his poetry.

848
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Ray asks when he's coming back.

849
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Jim just shrugs.

850
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
On April 17, 1971,

851
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
with the Miami conviction still hanging over him,

852
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Jim flies to Paris.

853
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
For a while, things go according to plan.

854
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Jim does concentrate on his poetry.

855
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
He shaves his beard.

856
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
He wanders the streets alone,

857
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
visiting the cemetery at Pere Lachaise,

858
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
where Chopin, Oscar Wilde and Edith Piaf are buried.

859
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
He develops a persistent cough.

860
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Back home, Elektra releases LA Woman.

861
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Critics call it "The Doors' comeback album".

862
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
When his cough worsens, Pam takes him to the doctor,

863
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
who strongly urges Morrison to quit drinking.

864
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
As he roams the city,

865
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
he carries his notebooks in a white plastic shopping bag.

866
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
They're filled with fragments of song lyrics and poetry.

867
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
But the solitude of the writing

868
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
offers little of the kick he knows so well.

869
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
One day, Jim makes a phone call home.

870
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
John Densmore is surprised to hear from him.

871
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Jim says he's thinking of coming home to make another album with The Doors,

872
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
but John can tell his voice is slurred.

873
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And one night, after hours of heavy drinking,

874
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Jim says he doesn't feel well.

875
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
He takes a bath.

876
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
After calling out to Pam, "Are you still there?",

877
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
he dies in the bathtub.

878
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Before You Slip Into Unconsciousness, I'd

879
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Like To Have Another Kiss,

880
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Another Flashing Chance At Bliss,

881
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Another Kiss.

882
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
The Days Are Bright And Filled With Pain,

883
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Enclose Me In Your Gentle Rain.

884
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The Time You Ran Was Too Insane.

885
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
We'll Meet Again.

886
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
The Vietnam war finally ends.

887
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
The youth movement fades away, not to reappear.

888
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
But that flash of protest, however brief, was real.

889
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
It forged the consciousness of a whole generation.

890
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Oh, Tell Me Where Your Freedom Lies.

891
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
The Streets Are Fields That Never Dies,

892
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Deliver Me From Reasons Why You'd Rather Cry,

893
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'd Rather Fly.

894
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
To some, Jim was a poet,

895
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
his soul trapped between heaven and hell.

896
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
To others, he was just another rock star who crashed and burned.

897
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But this much is true - you can't burn out if you're not on fire.

898
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
The Crystal Ship Is Being Filled,

899
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
A Thousand Girls, A Thousand Thrills...

900
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
He would take his father another 10 years to say,

901
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
"My son had a unique genius which he expressed without compromise".

902
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
When We Get Back, I'll Drop A Line...

903
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
The Doors were together for 54 months.

904
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
They've sold over 80 million albums worldwide.

905
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
They still sell a million albums a year.

906
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
As of this date, none of their songs has been used in a car commercial...

907
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
These subtitles have been combined, revised and translated to Russian

908
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
