1
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,950
Morning.

2
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,825
it is a commonplace observation

3
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,783
that remarkable events
often have ordinary beginnings.

4
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:58,367
Never was this more true
than of my talks with Dean Spanley,

5
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,867
which form the spine of our narrative.

6
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,825
- Morning.
- Morning.

7
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,783
Properly speaking,
they began on a Thursday,

8
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:11,408
the day on which i visit my father,
Mr Horatio Fisk.

9
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,575
This habit - one might even say ritual -

10
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:20,117
commenced after the death of my younger
brother Harrington in the Boer War

11
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,658
and the subsequent demise
of my dear mama,

12
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:28,742
occasioned by her grief
at this unsupportable loss.

13
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:46,492
I'm coming, I'm coming.

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,158
Morning, Mrs Brimley.

15
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,533
- How are you today?.
- As you see me.

16
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:56,825
Could complain,
but what'd be the use of that?.

17
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,908
Yes, indeed.

18
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:07,533
And himself?.

19
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:11,242
Oh, he's working himself up
into a head of steam.

20
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,575
You know how he gets.

21
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:18,158
Sent back the paper, he did,
to have it properly ironed.

22
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,158
I'm just finishing the obituaries,
so you can take it in to him.

23
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,867
I thought he didn't read the obituaries.

24
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,158
No more he does, but he wants them
ironed just the same.

25
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:33,075
Says he doesn't read them

26
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,033
because he's afraid he'II come across
his own name one day. I ask you!

27
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:59,617
Do you believe in the transmigration
of souls, Mrs Brimley?.

28
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,700
I don't believe in Ietting foreigners in,
if that's what you mean.

29
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:09,367
No, um... reincarnation,
not immigration.

30
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,283
Um, the belief that the immortal soul
has many earthly homes.

31
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,908
Well, I haven't given it much thought,
I haven't.

32
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:27,283
After AIbert died
I went to one of them mediums,

33
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,283
but she couldn't get hold of him.

34
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,283
I wasn't surprised, mind you.
He never said much when he were alive.

35
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,200
I couldn't imagine him piping up
once he were dead.

36
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,742
Mind you don't crease that, now.

37
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,117
He won't know what day it is,
not having seen the paper.

38
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,700
- Oh, young Fisk. It must be Thursday.
- It is indeed.

39
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:48,908
Very handy, a Thursday. Keeps
Wednesday and Friday from colliding.

40
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,075
You're here, then.

41
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,825
You should have
the garden seen to, Father.

42
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:08,158
- That was your mother's job.
- Nevertheless...

43
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,908
Nevertheless. What does
that expression mean, I ask you?.

44
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,450
Nevertheless.

45
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:18,283
Might as well be clearing your throat,
for all the sense it makes.

46
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:25,992
Well, it's a fine day, Father.
Have you anything particular in mind?.

47
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,158
I can see how fine the day is.

48
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:32,367
As for particular in mind, everything
is particular when you get down to it.

49
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,325
What I meant was, do you have any plans?.

50
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:43,242
Are there any concerts or exhibitions,
diversions you wish to attend?.

51
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,492
There's nothing about the war.

52
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,825
We're not presently at war,
as far as I know.

53
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,783
Diversions, you say.

54
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,950
That's all that's Ieft, you know,

55
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:55,075
before stepping
out of the anteroom of eternity.

56
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:01,908
There is a display of aboriginal weapons
from our wars of imperial conquest...

57
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:05,492
Such was the common procedure
of my relationship with my father.

58
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:11,533
i, carrying out my filial duty,
would arrive with the best of intentions.

59
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:16,700
He, indulging his practised
yet primitive paternal instincts,

60
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:18,825
would play a strange game of control.

61
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,200
As Thursday upon Thursday arrived,

62
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:28,575
i'd become more and more determined
to see this game dismantled.

63
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:33,533
A collection of Georgian shoe buckles.
Over 2, 000 items.

64
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:38,950
That was an era when a gentleman could
spend a fortune ornamenting his feet.

65
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,408
Did we win the Boer War?.

66
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,408
I believe we Iost more slowly
than the other side.

67
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,867
Garden never recovered from it.

68
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:59,450
You know, there is a Iecture
by one Swami Nala Prash

69
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,867
on the transmigration of souls.

70
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,117
Poppycock!

71
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,367
Think if we had souls they wouldn't
get in touch?. Of course they would.

72
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,908
Think your mother wouldn't be on to me
about that garden?. Of course she would.

73
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,825
Still, it seems the most Iikely
of the Iot, wouldn't you say?.

74
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:19,450
It's being held at the home
of the Nawab of Ranjiput.

75
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,200
- Isn't that the cricketing Indian chappie?.
- Yes, I believe so.

76
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,492
Oh, well. Let's take a Iook.

77
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:28,283
Heard tell he's turned the ballroom
into a cricket pitch.

78
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,867
Mad as badgers, these nawabs.

79
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,367
Oh, by the way,
I've invested in a chair vehicle.

80
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,533
Makes walking unnecessary.
You'II enjoy it.

81
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,742
Mrs Brimley! My chair!

82
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,617
- Watch your step, young Fisk.
- Thank you, Father.

83
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:55,200
- How is it going?.
- Very smoothly so far.

84
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:58,283
So it should. Latest model.

85
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,325
Guaranteed to Iast Ionger than the user.

86
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,367
- Not that that means very much.
- Nonsense, Father.

87
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,575
Damned machines!

88
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,242
Be the death of all of us, they will.

89
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:25,992
Progress, Father,
occasions certain inconveniences.

90
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:32,450
- Galsworthy, old son. How are you?.
- Very well, sir.

91
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,325
Hey-ho! Well done, chair.

92
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,783
Give you a hand with the buggy?.

93
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,117
- Grab hold.
- That's kind of you.

94
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,825
- Buggy, indeed!
- My pleasure, sir.

95
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:49,242
CIyde-built by the feel of it.

96
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,242
AIways a pleasure.

97
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,533
Thank you. Thank you.

98
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:22,575
Damn foolish game, cricket,
if you ask me. Too many rules.

99
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,533
- Howzat!
- Not out, I say.

100
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:41,075
- Not exactly a full house, is it?.
- This is where you need to go.

101
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:45,283
Want to be where we can see
the yellow of his eyes.

102
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:50,992
I declare, that's Spanley,
dean of St Justus.

103
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:54,325
Not that I ever go there,
so he may have been kicked out by now.

104
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:56,408
- Father, keep your voice down.
- What?.

105
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:57,992
Shh.

106
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,742
Dean Spanley, did you say?.

107
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:04,242
Not me. Chap with the dog collar.

108
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:08,033
What's a dean doing
at a sermon on reincarnation?.

109
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,700
- Exactly my thought.
- I think it shows open-mindedness.

110
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:15,617
Impending apostasy, more Iike.
Seen the error of his Christian ways.

111
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,658
- The name's Wrather, with a W.
- Fisk.

112
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:22,158
- What brings you here, Mr Fisk?.
- Ask young Fisk. His idea.

113
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:24,117
The Iesser of several evils.

114
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,283
Well, there you are.

115
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,450
I thought I got a thin edge onto my pad,

116
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,867
but when the umpire raises his finger,
you have to walk.

117
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,575
That's Iife... and cricket.

118
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,242
Well, then,
time to bring on Swami Prash.

119
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:47,033
Of what he will tell you
I have no particular opinion,

120
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,658
but I've always held him in high regard
as a cricketer.

121
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,825
Bowled decent Ieft-arm Ieg breaks
before he went holy.

122
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:58,950
Haven't seen him play since, but I've no doubt
he's still the sportsman he was. Hm.

123
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:11,908
i confess, the appearance of Swami Prash
came as something of a surprise,

124
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:14,492
even a disappointment.

125
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:18,658
For although i had no clear expectation
of what a holy man would look like,

126
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:22,325
i had imagined one with such a title
and discussing such a subject

127
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,783
to have been dressed more...
traditionally.

128
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:43,283
The question of
the transmigration of the soul,

129
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:49,450
perhaps more familiarly known to you
as reincarnation,

130
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,992
has been the structural underpinning

131
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:58,867
of Indian philosophical
and religious thought for millennia.

132
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,492
Only recently...

133
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:03,867
What ensued proved to be
as unilluminating a 50 minutes

134
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,117
as i can remember spending outside
the confines of parliamentary debate.

135
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,950
.. esoteric wisdom
come to the attention...

136
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:16,658
indeed, the most significant fact
i gleaned from the experience

137
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:23,617
was that with my eyes closed,
the lecturer could have been a Welshman.

138
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,242
A Iittle, if only a Iittle, closer.

139
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:35,700
I should be pleased now
to answer any questions you may have.

140
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:38,992
- Where am I?.
- Be quiet.

141
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,867
You are, my dear sir,

142
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,075
in the anteroom of eternity
with the rest of us sojourning souls.

143
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:49,450
- What?.
- Yes, madam?.

144
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:56,200
I was, er... we were, that is,
wondering if...

145
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,617
- Did he say the anteroom of eternity?.
- Shh.

146
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,325
- What?.
- Shh.

147
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:07,533
- If they...
- Pets, really. The souls of pets.

148
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:14,200
That is a most interesting question
and I thank you for asking it.

149
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:20,408
It is generally supposed
that the animal soul

150
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,617
must be of a different
and, by inference,

151
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,450
inferior nature to the human soul.

152
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:33,283
The soul is that part of the Godhead,
of AII That Is...

153
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:37,575
What you said before, sir,
about the anteroom of eternity...

154
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:41,075
Would you be kind enough to allow
the swami to finish his thought, sir?.

155
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,450
- Well, well.
- Shh.

156
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,617
- What?.
- Shh.

157
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:56,200
However, although all animals have
their specific awareness of the Godhead,

158
00:14:56,492 --> 00:15:05,367
the dog is, by virtue of his singular
relationship with all mankind, unique.

159
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,908
What about cats?.

160
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:12,117
The dog amplifies...

161
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,908
the cat diminishes...

162
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,242
man's estimation of himself.

163
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,325
Poppycock!

164
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:28,992
So I shall wish you gentlemen good day.

165
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:33,117
I can be found here most mornings
and of the occasional evening.

166
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,075
What exactly is a conveyancer?.

167
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,825
Well, nothing, exactly.
More a service of facilitation.

168
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:41,325
Assisting a thing
to be moved between parties.

169
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,742
So you're a middleman.

170
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:46,700
Well, sometimes in the middle
and sometimes at either end.

171
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:51,033
- Been a great pleasure, sir.
- You're easily pleased, is all I can say.

172
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,200
Mrs Travers, did I ever tell you that
I collect birds?. I'm a real cornucopian.

173
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:03,283
What's that?.

174
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,158
Only thing that made sense
in the whole damn farrago

175
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,700
was what the chap said about dogs
thinking you are better than you are.

176
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:17,867
Canine flattery is a survival mechanism,
according to Darwin.

177
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,492
The chap never had a dog,
is all I can say.

178
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:22,617
I thought he had a beagle.

179
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,867
I had a dog once. Wag.
One of the seven great dogs.

180
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,658
At any one time, you know,
there are only seven. Did you know that?.

181
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,908
I can't say I did.

182
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:37,992
Neither did that swami. Made me think
he didn't know much about dogs.

183
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:41,367
Let's go to my club, have a stiff one.

184
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,700
I thought you didn't go there any more.

185
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:47,367
That was in the past.
This is the present, young Fisk.

186
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,450
There's no time Iike the present,
as that swami called it.

187
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:55,783
- What was it?. The Eternal Now?.
- I don't know, sir. I wasn't Iistening.

188
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,700
- How are you, Marriot?.
- I'm well, sir. And yourself?.

189
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,742
Oh, one step nearer the grave.

190
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,533
How's that boy of yours?.
Tommy, isn't it?.

191
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:20,367
Yes, sir. Tommy, sir.

192
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:23,700
He... he's dead, sir.

193
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:27,283
The war, sir. The Boer War.

194
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:31,950
Oh, the Boers.
Lost one myself in that nonsense.

195
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:37,908
Haven't seen you for a while, sir.

196
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,075
Hasn't changed much.

197
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:49,908
CIubs aren't supposed to change, surely.
Part of their charm.

198
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,617
There's that chap again.
Is he following us?.

199
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,075
Where are you going?.

200
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,617
- Fisk.
- What?.

201
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,158
Horatio Fisk.

202
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:12,575
This is young Fisk. Surprised
we were to see you at the nawab's.

203
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,742
Oh, yes, yes.

204
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:19,283
So, what did you make
of all that mumble-jumble?.

205
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,283
The beliefs of others
are always of interest.

206
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:29,950
Really?. Tell me this, then.
Why don't they get in touch?.

207
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,408
Souls, I mean.
Never a word from beyond the grave.

208
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:39,367
You'd think one of them
would have given a shout.

209
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,283
Well, I imagine if the swami is correct

210
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,908
they're all too busy
being whoever they've become.

211
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,492
And what about him pinching my Iine?.

212
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:51,533
- What Iine was that?.
- The anteroom of eternity.

213
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:54,033
Well, I'd rather thought that
common usage.

214
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:57,825
Not at all.
Out of my own head that came.

215
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:00,075
Rather Iike having your pocket picked.

216
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:04,742
- What's that you're drinking?.
- Ah, this is Tokay.

217
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:09,867
Not an Imperial, I'm afraid,
but... good enough, for all that.

218
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:12,950
A bit syrupy for my taste.

219
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,825
Well, we'II Ieave you to it.

220
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,033
You must excuse my father.
He can be... rather impulsive.

221
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:26,242
Not at all.

222
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:32,075
Pardon me, Dean, but...

223
00:19:32,158 --> 00:19:36,450
am I to understand you give
some credence to these beliefs?.

224
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:43,742
- Only the closed mind is certain, sir.
- Oh, I agree.

225
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,617
I agree.

226
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,575
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you, sir.

227
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:07,533
Rum chap, Spanley.

228
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:10,533
Do you know him well enough
to form that opinion?.

229
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,950
One can tell. Not quite sound.

230
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:16,825
Dabbling in Eastern religion.
Drinking that Hungarian treacle.

231
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:20,158
Can I get you gentlemen a drink?.

232
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:25,950
I'd Iike a brandy and soda, Marriot,
with the emphasis on the brandy.

233
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,325
I'II have the Tokay.

234
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:34,033
Oh, I'm afraid that won't be possible, sir.
The Tokay's private stock.

235
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,492
The dean keeps a bottle
for his personal use.

236
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:39,450
Very hard to come by, I believe.

237
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,408
Damned unsociable of him.
Told you the fellow wasn't sound.

238
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:50,658
In that case I'II have a brandy and soda
as well. In the inverse ratio.

239
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,867
Yes, of course, sir.

240
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,575
If I... may say so, Mr Fisk,

241
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:03,783
I'm most sorry to hear of your Ioss.

242
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:08,700
- What?.
- Did you... Your boy, sir. In the war.

243
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:14,575
Wasn't my Ioss. He's the one got killed.

244
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,867
Sir.

245
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,158
That was, even for you, Father,
a singularly callous remark.

246
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,325
Nothing of the sort.

247
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:31,075
Here we sit about to be served
brandy and sodas.

248
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:34,825
What's our Ioss
compared to your brother's?.

249
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:43,658
Women with the vote is Iike a cow
with a gun - contrary to nature.

250
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,325
Walking home, listening to my father

251
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:51,700
assert a variety of things
in tones of unbrookable authority,

252
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:56,117
Dean Spanley's words returned to me
with renewed force".

253
00:21:57,492 --> 00:22:00,492
"Only the closed mind is certain. "

254
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,533
An excellent hotpot, M rs Brimley.

255
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:10,242
Well, it ought to be,

256
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:14,492
seeing as how I've made it for you
about five hundred times.

257
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,033
Thank you.

258
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,450
"It may well be supposed
that this turn of events

259
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,408
came as a most disagreeable surprise
to Mr Chuttleworth,

260
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:30,825
accustomed as he was
to having his every whim catered for."

261
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:34,658
i confess i had, until that moment,

262
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:37,242
always supposed certainty
to be rather a good thing.

263
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:40,408
Like money in the bank.

264
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:45,950
But something in the day's events
had occasioned in me a certain disquiet,

265
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,033
a sense that...

266
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,992
There may be more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

267
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,367
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

268
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,992
I'II be off, Mrs Brimley.

269
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,325
He's dozing in the study.

270
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:45,450
Oh, I'II have to wake him up,
otherwise he won't sleep tonight.

271
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,367
Does he ever mention my brother?.

272
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,783
Your father doesn't hold with grieving,
Mr Fisk, as you well know.

273
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,408
No, that's right.

274
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:09,408
No, you're right.

275
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,575
Thank you, Mrs Brimley.

276
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,825
- And thank you for the hotpot.
- Oh, don't you start, young man.

277
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:21,492
Hotpot, that's all
he'II Iet me cook for him.

278
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:25,533
Creature of habit, your father is. Knows
what he wants without having to think.

279
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,200
The certainty of a closed mind.

280
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:33,950
Well, I don't know about that.
But you do know where you are with him.

281
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,742
Where you was before. Nowhere.

282
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,450
- Bye-bye. I'II see you next Thursday.
- Like as not.

283
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:48,575
Creatures of habit. Oh!

284
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:59,242
i've heard it said
that one encounter is a happenstance,

285
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:05,200
two a coincidence
and three a significance.

286
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:08,825
Be that as it may,

287
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:14,825
that day i found myself, for the third
time, in the presence of Dean Spanley,

288
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:20,367
a man who, until that day,
i did not know existed.

289
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:24,742
Is it stuck up there?.

290
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:29,617
It rather appears so.
They never think of that when they go up,

291
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,825
which I consider a serious reflection
on their intelligence.

292
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:34,992
Probably chased by a dog.

293
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:39,867
Dean?. Dean Spanley?.

294
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,492
Hello. I met you earlier at your club.

295
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:48,450
I was introduced by my father. Mr Fisk.

296
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,200
Oh.

297
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:53,867
- And you were at the nawab's.
- Ah, yes.

298
00:26:55,992 --> 00:27:00,658
I am most eager to hear your further
views on the subject of reincarnation.

299
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:04,033
I assure you, sir, I have
no special knowledge on the matter.

300
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:07,325
Compared to my own,
I'm sure yours are encyclopaedic.

301
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:10,575
I was wondering if I might invite you
to dinner one evening.

302
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:14,825
I'm afraid that with my schedule
that would be rather difficult.

303
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:18,200
I would not presume
upon so short an acquaintance

304
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,867
were it not that I've recently come
into possession of a bottle of Tokay.

305
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,033
An Imperial Tokay.

306
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:29,575
- An Imperial Tokay?.
- Yes.

307
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:37,950
One must be on one's guard against
the common or garden variety. What year?.

308
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:43,367
- An '89, I believe.
- An '89, you say?.

309
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:47,533
Was... is that a good year?.

310
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:52,908
Oh, yes. How do you come to be
in possession of such a treasure?.

311
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:56,367
You must be very well connected, Mr...

312
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,950
Fisk. Henslowe Fisk.

313
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,992
Well... Well...

314
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,367
Perhaps I might manage... Thursday,
if that would be convenient?.

315
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:13,658
Most convenient.

316
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:15,992
Shall we say seven o'clock?.

317
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:20,200
- Very well. Until then.
- Good day, sir.

318
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,158
'89. Goodness me.

319
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,783
I wouldn't call it a Iie, puss.

320
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:37,117
More Iike a truth deferred.
Nothing worse.

321
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:45,658
it had not occurred to me
when i made my overture to the dean

322
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,575
that procuring his favourite tipple
would prove such a challenge.

323
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:51,742
Oi! Come back here!

324
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,450
Very hard to find
an Imperial Tokay, sir.

325
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,533
Of course there are what you might call
commercial counterfeits.

326
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:10,242
But the real thing,
that's another story altogether.

327
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:13,158
It's made solely
for the Hapsburg monarchy, you see.

328
00:29:13,242 --> 00:29:16,325
Takes a royal decree
to have one uncorked.

329
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:20,325
You would need to know
somebody with such connections.

330
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:22,492
I see.

331
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:29,908
Tell me this. If King Edward himself
were to come you and say".

332
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,242
"Find me one or two bottles of Tokay",
what would you say to him?.

333
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,200
Well, I would suggest,
most respectfully,

334
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:42,575
that he uses his family connections
in order to affect the conveyancing.

335
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:46,950
So he'd have a Iot more chance
of success than I would, sir.

336
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:50,617
Of course.

337
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,450
The point of the exercise,
drop every ball without a miss.

338
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:17,408
Care for a small wager?.

339
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:22,450
No, thank you. No, you seem more
than capable of performing such a feat.

340
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,492
So you'd Iike to acquire
a bottle of an '89 Tokay.

341
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,617
An Imperial.

342
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,367
This an adventure of the romantic sort
that you're embarking on?.

343
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,575
Certainly not.

344
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,117
It is said that the fair sex
responds avidly to Tokay.

345
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,075
Loosens the morals
and with it the corsets.

346
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:51,450
- How high are you willing to go?.
- Whatever it costs.

347
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,992
Within reason.

348
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:55,742
Ah, yes. Well, you see,
there's the rub, within reason.

349
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:59,700
- '89 Tokay not easy to come by.
- So I understand.

350
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,533
So what's your Iine, then?.

351
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:06,825
Oh, this and that.
A bit of art publishing.

352
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,742
Any money in it?.

353
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,658
A modest remuneration.
But the real reward is in the art itself.

354
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:17,992
Though I must admit there must be
rather more to be made in conveyancing.

355
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:22,242
It's not all mine.
I'm just a ground-floor tenant.

356
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,658
How on earth
did you come by all this stuff?.

357
00:31:29,742 --> 00:31:33,742
My Auntie Molly was a hoarder.
Caught it from her, I shouldn't wonder.

358
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,742
What do you do with it?.

359
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:38,325
Oh, you never know when someone wants
something you just happen to have.

360
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,617
Such as a bottle of Imperial Tokay.

361
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,783
Really?.

362
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,825
Good grief.

363
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,700
It's not an '89, I'm afraid.
Will a '91 do?.

364
00:31:53,783 --> 00:31:55,783
It'II have to.

365
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,825
I suppose I could say I was promised
an '89 and the man was mistaken.

366
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,450
What do you think?.

367
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:10,283
- How much is this?.
- Five guineas to you.

368
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:14,533
Five guineas?.
That's a bit bloody steep.

369
00:32:14,617 --> 00:32:18,492
These Iittle things were sent to try us,
as the man said of the pygmy judge.

370
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:25,325
Thursday?.

371
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:28,533
Are there not
six other perfectly adequate days,

372
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:32,158
each equipped with portions of time
suitable for such activities?.

373
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,742
Thursday is the only day
the dean is free.

374
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:37,408
Poppycock.
Deans have dinner every evening.

375
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:38,908
He has prior engagements.

376
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:42,158
Is my Thursday not a prior engagement,
young Fisk?.

377
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:49,825
What is going on?.

378
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,825
You're not getting married, I hope.

379
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:58,575
- No.
- Good.

380
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:04,950
If I had it to do over again...

381
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:09,867
Am I to understand from that remark
that you regret marrying Mother?.

382
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,367
Fine woman, AIice.

383
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:17,825
Very good in the garden.

384
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,658
No, it's the children.

385
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:28,325
Hostages to fortune is what they are.

386
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:31,742
But there is no point
to regretting things

387
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:34,575
that have gone to the trouble
of happening.

388
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:40,033
And that is your reason
for refusing to mourn Harrington?.

389
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:44,075
I warned your brother
that the war would be bad for his health,

390
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:46,200
but no, he knew better, the young fool.

391
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:49,200
Anyway, your mother mourned him
enough for both of us.

392
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,325
Perhaps if you'd shared
that burden with her

393
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:53,783
she might not have found her grief
so insupportable.

394
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,158
I have nothing more to say
on this subject.

395
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,075
PIease never mention it to me again.

396
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:09,492
CIose the door on your way out.

397
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:25,658
- Do you miss your husband, Mrs Brimley?.
- Miss him?.

398
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:31,242
Oh, well. He weren't hard to miss,
were AIbert.

399
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:35,033
Kept himself to himself.

400
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:39,158
Sat in that chair night after night,
never said a word.

401
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:44,283
Just nodded, sociable-Iike,
and spat in the fire every now and again.

402
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:47,367
That were AIbert's one bad habit.

403
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:54,575
I talk to the chair sometimes
and it's just Iike old times.

404
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:56,867
Except the chair don't spit.

405
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:10,492
Thinking about your brother
and your mum, are you?.

406
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,992
I just wish Father would...

407
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,658
Well, Mr Fisk was never one
for showing much.

408
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,117
Why, I remember that night
up at the Iake

409
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,742
when you and young Harry went out
on that cockleshell of a boat.

410
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:42,158
Yes. Wasn't one of his finest moments.

411
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:48,200
I'II Iet you get on, Mrs Brimley.

412
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,492
- Good night.
- And don't you worry about Thursday.

413
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:56,283
I'II feed him his hotpot
and he'II be right as rain.

414
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:59,242
You just enjoy yourself
with your friend.

415
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:35,533
But as Thursday evening arrived, i found
my enthusiasm for the event waning.

416
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:40,200
For in truth the whim that prompted me
to extend the invitation

417
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:42,367
had lost its piquancy

418
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,242
and the sobering cost of Wrather's Tokay

419
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:50,367
played its part in making the whole
venture seem somewhat dubious.

420
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:59,033
I'm afraid I was mistaken about the vintage.
The '89 was unavailable.

421
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:04,200
This is... this is a '91.
I do hope you're not too disappointed.

422
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,908
Not at all.

423
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:10,658
One would have to have
a jaded palate indeed

424
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:14,742
if the prospect
of a '91 KIeverheld-Manschliess

425
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:17,158
were a disappointment.

426
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:22,200
Properly decanted.

427
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,283
No sign of sediment.

428
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,367
Well done.

429
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,200
Thank you.

430
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,492
To think that such wine was once
only opened by decree of a Hapsburg

431
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:47,575
and now,
through the vicissitudes of history,

432
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:51,533
we Iesser beings
can command such an audience.

433
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,783
Your very good health.

434
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:08,658
i must confess my first taste of Tokay
was not an illuminating moment.

435
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:13,242
Rather, my father's dismissal of it
as being too syrupy

436
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,575
seemed remarkably close to the mark.

437
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:22,783
However, in the dean...
its champion was to hand.

438
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,825
Oh...

439
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:46,992
Tokay, of course, is unique among wines

440
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:51,200
in that the aroma
is of more significance than the flavour.

441
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:57,158
For us humans, alas, that is the pursuit
of the ineffable by the inadequate.

442
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,075
At such moments, one could wish

443
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:05,533
to possess the olfactory powers
of the canine.

444
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:15,742
It's often occurred to me
that to pull a dog away from a Iamppost

445
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:20,825
is akin to seizing a scholar in the
British Museum by the scruff of his neck

446
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:23,117
and dragging him away from his studies.

447
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:28,158
Yes.

448
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:43,867
What are you doing?.

449
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:48,408
One of those damned motor machines.

450
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:51,242
Dreadful things, don't you think?.

451
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:56,867
It must be clear to anyone of perception
that the invention of the internal -

452
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,158
one might even say infernal -
combustion engine

453
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:05,242
will prove to be a complete...
catastrophe for the species.

454
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:06,825
Quite so.

455
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,033
And have you noticed

456
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:13,908
that motor cars are exactly the right
height for them to take refuge under?.

457
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:20,825
Cats. The way they get under motor cars
and can't be got at.

458
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:24,408
Unless, of course,
you're a very small dog.

459
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,992
I see what you mean.

460
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:32,117
The trouble with cats is
they have no idea of the rules.

461
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,450
One chases them,
invariably they hide or run up trees.

462
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:41,533
Or perform that preposterous inflation
they're so fond of,

463
00:40:41,617 --> 00:40:44,283
raising their hair on end.

464
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:47,242
Well, I was never fooled by that ruse.

465
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:50,450
No?.

466
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,492
Well, perhaps once or twice
when I was very young,

467
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:57,825
but once I discovered what devious
and subversive creatures they are...

468
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:01,533
So you are inclined to agree
with the swami about them.

469
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:06,033
About cats and how they diminish
man's estimation of himself.

470
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:07,908
Oh, indeed.

471
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:14,242
- They have no awe of the masters.
- The masters?.

472
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:18,950
Yes. How one Ioved
to be in their company.

473
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:22,992
How one wanted to please them,
if only by obedience.

474
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:28,450
Let me give you a piece of advice.

475
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,950
When a door is opened, always
take the opportunity to Ieave the room.

476
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:34,075
There is nothing more annoying
to the master

477
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,783
than a dog whining and scratching
to get...

478
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:52,075
- Tokay?.
- No. No, thank you.

479
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,242
Two glasses are my Iimit.
One must know one's Iimit.

480
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:03,200
Otherwise there's no knowing
where things will end up.

481
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:10,200
i had no idea of the true nature
of what had occurred with the dean.

482
00:42:11,533 --> 00:42:15,408
it may have been madness.
But i found it intriguing.

483
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:19,492
So intriguing
that i finished the rest of the bottle.

484
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:25,325
".. pulling a scholar out of the British
Museum by the scruff of his neck."

485
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,200
It was as if his mind had slipped a cog.

486
00:42:30,283 --> 00:42:35,200
- Went barking mad, you mean?.
- No, he was completely rational.

487
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:42,283
If you can call
remembering you were a dog... rational.

488
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:47,700
- How much of the Tokay had he had?.
- Two glasses. Two.

489
00:42:47,783 --> 00:42:50,158
Sure it wasn't you that was snockered?.

490
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:52,700
So what do you think?.

491
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:58,950
That getting deans tiddly so they can
pretend to remember when they were a dog

492
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:01,950
is as harmless a way
of spending an evening as any other.

493
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,742
He was not tiddly, as you put it.

494
00:43:04,825 --> 00:43:07,908
He was... well, it was more Iike
an altered state of mind.

495
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:10,367
Being tiddly
isn't an altered state of mind?.

496
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,158
No, it was the Tokay.

497
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:16,325
Even when he inhaled it

498
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:23,492
he was transported to this other place.

499
00:43:24,908 --> 00:43:27,575
And you'd Iike to get him back
to this other place?.

500
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:31,575
Can you get me another bottle?.

501
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,908
Can you?.

502
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:40,950
I don't doubt that for a price
one could come to hand.

503
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:43,242
Can you get one for next Thursday?.

504
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:45,533
Have another shot.

505
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:03,825
Your Tokay, Dean.

506
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:08,783
Ah. What Iambency of hue, what colour.

507
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:15,783
It reminds me of the Iight
when the master came home. Hup!

508
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:18,200
- Never to the brim.
- Of course.

509
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:21,825
- One must Ieave room for the aroma.
- Yes, yes. The aroma.

510
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,950
Now, you were saying about the master.

511
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,367
Oh, yes. The master.

512
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,658
He would go away for very Iong times.

513
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:37,408
Other people were kind,
but it was not the same.

514
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:39,325
And what did you do?.

515
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:42,158
Why, I'd wait for him
until I knew he was coming home.

516
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:44,617
- You knew when he was returning?.
- Oh, yes.

517
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,158
How, might I ask?.

518
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:51,117
Well, before he was not coming back
and then he was.

519
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,450
That was the difference,
plain and simple.

520
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:56,742
- I see.
- Yes, seeing is part of it, it's true.

521
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:59,575
The proximity of the master
does affect the Iight.

522
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,742
The Iight grows brighter?.

523
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:05,367
- No, not brighter. Louder.
- The Iight grows Iouder?.

524
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:09,200
Well, certainly there was more of it.

525
00:45:09,283 --> 00:45:12,867
I remember waiting one day
when he was due to come back.

526
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,575
And the Iight that day got brighter
and brighter until one was quite dazzled.

527
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:19,867
I only know
when he did finally come back

528
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,492
I was so excited
I had several brandies to calm myself.

529
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:31,867
Dean, dogs do not drink brandy.

530
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:36,242
No more they do.

531
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:40,283
I would achieve the same effect
by running round in tight Iittle circles.

532
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:43,700
Drives the blood to the head
in a most exhilarating fashion.

533
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:57,075
And then I'd sit down,
have a good scratch.

534
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:01,158
Were you much bothered by fleas?.

535
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,700
When I say bothered, I don't mean...

536
00:46:03,783 --> 00:46:07,533
There's nothing wrong with a few fleas.
They help get one's grooming going.

537
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,158
Ah, yes.

538
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:17,867
Indeed, I doubt if one can be a dog
and not have fleas.

539
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,117
So these evenings have become
a regular feature, then?.

540
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,575
Yes. The dean has a wealth of knowledge
which I find quite fascinating.

541
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,200
Oh.

542
00:46:35,283 --> 00:46:37,658
- Lawrence! Come here!
- No!

543
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:39,408
Lawrence Swan, come back here!

544
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:44,408
- But only on a Thursday.
- Come back here at once! Lawrence!

545
00:46:44,492 --> 00:46:47,450
- That man tripped me up!
- Don't be ridiculous.

546
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,283
- He's given to imaginings.
- Uh-huh.

547
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:55,575
Pick yourself up. I told you before
about running away from me.

548
00:46:55,658 --> 00:46:57,367
If I call to you, you come back...

549
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,908
What on earth possessed you
to do such a thing?.

550
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:04,367
No business running off Iike that
when he was being summoned.

551
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,700
You talk as if
you were never yourself a child.

552
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:10,158
Indeed I was,
and damned glad when it was over.

553
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:12,658
Too much is made of childhood,
to my mind.

554
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:15,867
Golden days of fun and innocence?.
Poppycock.

555
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,033
The most miserable I've been
was as a child.

556
00:47:19,117 --> 00:47:22,700
Is that why you tripped up him up?.
To teach him childhood isn't a happy time?.

557
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:29,908
Do not presume to judge me, young Fisk.

558
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:33,992
I should first have to understand you,
Father. And that, I confess, I do not.

559
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:37,950
Perhaps you would have to become
a father first.

560
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:43,075
Your example disinclines me to that
particular comprehension, I'm afraid.

561
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,867
Push on!

562
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,325
Push on!

563
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,950
You don't think
the dean is having you on?.

564
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:10,908
What do you mean, having me on?.

565
00:48:10,992 --> 00:48:13,617
That he's spotted you
for the gullible sort

566
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,325
and a good source
for his favourite drink?.

567
00:48:16,408 --> 00:48:19,283
Why would he assume
that pretending to have been a dog

568
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:24,283
would not attract disbelief and ridicule
rather than invitations to dinner?.

569
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,533
He saw you at the nawab's
Iistening to the swami

570
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:29,075
about reincarnation and dogs
and all that nonsense

571
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:32,158
and he decided that you believed
in all that stuff.

572
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:36,575
I can't accept that.

573
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:39,658
It would be
most unlike someone of his gravitas.

574
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:41,700
Gravitas?.

575
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:44,908
Telling you about running round
in circles to create the effect of whisky?.

576
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,450
Brandy, actually.

577
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:50,283
And fleas are a good source of grooming?.
You could call that gravitas.

578
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,867
He doesn't know when he's saying
these things and when he isn't.

579
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,742
I'd have to be there
to see it for myself to believe it.

580
00:48:55,825 --> 00:48:59,367
- Your Moroccan is here.
- Excuse me. A delivery.

581
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:05,617
- Go easy on him, my darling.
- Be careful, he's a monkey.

582
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:12,158
Abdul, how are you?.
And how much do I owe our man?.

583
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:14,825
- You owe him nothing.
- You tell him he owes me a gin.

584
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:17,950
- With pleasure, Mr Wrather.
- Good day.

585
00:49:20,575 --> 00:49:22,617
Very nice article, this.

586
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,450
Fell off the back of an elephant.
Not interested, are you?.

587
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:28,992
- Don't have an elephant.
- Just say the word and I'II get you one.

588
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:35,325
- Look, about this Tokay....
- Yeah, right. Tokay.

589
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:43,658
How about if I do round one up,
you Iet me sit in on the next seance?.

590
00:49:43,742 --> 00:49:45,950
It's not a seance.

591
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:51,700
It's more Iike the parting of the veil
between one Iife and another.

592
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:56,075
AII right. The parting of the veil.
But I want to be there.

593
00:49:58,117 --> 00:50:00,200
AII right.

594
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:03,867
But you must promise,
truly and genuinely promise me,

595
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,283
that you will Iet me
do the questioning.

596
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:09,033
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Swear on something you hold sacred.

597
00:50:09,117 --> 00:50:11,450
- 50 guineas.
- What do you mean?.

598
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:15,242
I give you 50 guineas to hold and if I don't
meet your standard of decorum, I forfeit it.

599
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:18,658
Am I to understand
that there is nothing you hold sacred?.

600
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:21,825
I feel quite religious about 50 guineas,
I assure you.

601
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:28,367
I can only imagine
that I was not in my right mind

602
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,492
to have spoken to you in such a fashion

603
00:50:30,575 --> 00:50:35,033
and it grieves me to think that I may have
offended you by my Iack of respect.

604
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:40,450
I am stricken to think I have given you cause
to think me ungrateful.

605
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:45,825
Don't grovel, Iaddie. You remind me
of Wag when he'd been naughty.

606
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:50,158
What a whining and squirming
he went in for!

607
00:50:50,242 --> 00:50:53,242
Yes. Wag, eh?.

608
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:56,242
One of the seven great dogs.

609
00:50:56,325 --> 00:51:00,825
At any one time, you know,
there are only seven.

610
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:08,575
- What kind of dog was he?.
- A Welsh spaniel, in his prime.

611
00:51:10,783 --> 00:51:12,783
What happened to him?.

612
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:16,492
He went away one day
and never came back.

613
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,867
- Had he ever done that before?.
- Never.

614
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,533
I blame the bad company he fell in with.

615
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:27,617
This dog that used to come around.

616
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,408
Ugly brute, a mongrel.
Big scrawny thing, it was.

617
00:51:31,492 --> 00:51:34,325
Wag chased him off at first
but he came back

618
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:38,700
and Wag took off with him
just before I had to return to school.

619
00:51:38,783 --> 00:51:43,367
I wanted to stay at home till Wag came back,
but they wouldn't allow it.

620
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:50,242
I told them if I wasn't there,
then Wag might not know where to come to.

621
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:52,700
Must have been very difficult for you.

622
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,325
It wasn't difficult.

623
00:51:57,575 --> 00:51:59,700
It was unbearable.

624
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,533
i had heard this story before.

625
00:52:04,617 --> 00:52:09,075
But now it was as if
i was hearing it for the first time.

626
00:52:09,158 --> 00:52:11,658
As dubious as any connection
might have seemed,

627
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:15,783
my father's revelation
inspired greater significance

628
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,367
to my next encounter with the dean.

629
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,783
Who's this Iikely-Iooking Iad?.

630
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:32,033
That's my brother Harrington.
He was killed fighting the Boers.

631
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,033
Broke my mother's heart.

632
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:38,158
And your father, how did he take it?.

633
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:42,950
"If something goes to the trouble
of happening,

634
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,158
it may be considered inevitable"

635
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:47,158
was his comment, I believe.

636
00:52:47,242 --> 00:52:49,658
That's your stiff upper English for you.

637
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:53,950
There's a few shillings Ieft in this.
The cobwebs are worth a guinea.

638
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,367
No, please. Not the Iast inch.

639
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:59,075
The dean is most particular about that.

640
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:01,908
Fussy old hound.
What kind of dog did he say he was?.

641
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:05,825
He didn't. I must insist
you don't ask him such a question.

642
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:08,867
I'd have thought
that's the first question you would ask.

643
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,908
PIease just give me your word.

644
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:14,992
As you Iike, but there's no doubt I'II know
as soon as he gets started.

645
00:53:17,783 --> 00:53:19,450
Henslowe.

646
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,992
- Good evening, Dean. How are you?.
- Very well.

647
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:25,992
I fancy I would have been
a pointer, an Afghan...

648
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:28,450
- This is my friend Mr Wrather.
- Oh.

649
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:35,242
Mr Wrather is the agent
by which we manage to procure the Tokay.

650
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:39,867
- Mm.
- Good evening... Dean.

651
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,033
Yes.

652
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:50,992
Tonight's vintage is... a special one.

653
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:56,992
KIeinfeld-Hasslerbeck '82.
One of the great years.

654
00:53:57,075 --> 00:54:02,533
Indeed, I've not had the good fortune
to taste that particular vintage before.

655
00:54:02,617 --> 00:54:05,783
Well, every dog has his day,
as they say.

656
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:13,950
Well, what a privilege.

657
00:54:14,033 --> 00:54:15,992
Dean.

658
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:18,200
Of course
the Empire must be maintained,

659
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:23,867
but history shows us only too clearly
the dangers of overreach.

660
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,825
I myself considered the Indian Mutiny,
so-called,

661
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,492
a warning that perhaps
our presence on the subcontinent

662
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:37,617
was not the universal benevolence
that we believed.

663
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:48,158
- A glass of Tokay, Dean?.
- That would be most agreeable.

664
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:55,700
So, Dean, do you think it's true that
you can't teach an old dog new tricks?.

665
00:54:55,783 --> 00:54:59,783
- What Mr Wrather means is...
- Will we ever give India back to the Indians?.

666
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:03,742
Not in my Iifetime, I would venture.
We've become too dependent on it.

667
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:05,908
And I don't just mean economically,

668
00:55:05,992 --> 00:55:10,075
although we derive inordinate treasure
from its exploitation.

669
00:55:10,158 --> 00:55:15,533
No, we have become habituated
to the role of master...

670
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:17,783
and dog...

671
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:21,617
servant.

672
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,242
How elegant.

673
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,867
- My, my, my, my, my, my.
- Is it all you'd hoped for, Dean?.

674
00:55:40,992 --> 00:55:43,075
Oh.

675
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,533
Beyond hope, beyond imagining.

676
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:51,367
The actuality exceeds anticipation.

677
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,283
I am in your debt, sir.

678
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,908
And yours, Mr Wrather.

679
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,867
You were saying about...
our relationship with the Indians,

680
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,992
between the master and the servant?.

681
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:11,950
Not just servant, but Ioving servant.

682
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:18,033
It's most important to the English race
that we are Ioved by those that we rule.

683
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:20,283
With a dog-Iike devotion, would you say?.

684
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:26,825
What is it that's so important
about the master?.

685
00:56:29,658 --> 00:56:31,742
Yes, the Master.

686
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:38,117
The thing is, whenever he returned
from wherever he'd been,

687
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,367
no matter how Iong I'd been waiting,

688
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:44,867
the actuality
always exceeded the anticipation.

689
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,200
Causing you to run about in circles.

690
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,533
But, you know, for all his great wisdom,

691
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:56,325
there were certain things
the Master never understood.

692
00:56:56,408 --> 00:57:00,617
- Such as?.
- The moon... and ticks.

693
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,617
The Master always wanted to remove mine,

694
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,283
but my own motto was". Iive and Iet Iive.

695
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:09,492
I hate ticks.

696
00:57:12,325 --> 00:57:14,658
And the moon?.

697
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,283
Yes, the moon.

698
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:22,200
The Master wasn't nearly
suspicious enough of the moon.

699
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:28,783
I never trusted it.
Never the same two nights in a row.

700
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:33,950
Couldn't hear it. Couldn't smell it.

701
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,825
Well, you can take your own Iine
on that, and others do.

702
00:57:40,242 --> 00:57:42,658
I had a friend who never worried
about the moon, but then...

703
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:45,617
he didn't have a house to guard.

704
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,158
The moon had a way of Iooking at a house
that implied it wasn't guarded properly.

705
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:54,325
Well, my house was guarded properly,
thank you very much, and I told it so,

706
00:57:54,408 --> 00:57:56,950
every time it came around,
in no uncertain terms!

707
00:58:06,992 --> 00:58:10,825
- Were you very big?.
- Oh, yes.

708
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,950
How big?.

709
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:18,450
When I barked... I was enormous.

710
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:25,950
So... why do you think
it wasn't frightened?.

711
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:30,533
Well, frightened things
smell frightened.

712
00:58:30,617 --> 00:58:32,825
I've smelled many frightened things.

713
00:58:32,908 --> 00:58:36,450
Cats, elderly Iadies, children, rabbits.

714
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:40,158
They all smell of being frightened.
It's a wonderful smell.

715
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:47,117
You mean... old Iadies smell the same
as rabbits when they're frightened?.

716
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,325
No, their fear smells the same.
Otherwise there's no confusing them.

717
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:59,742
Yes, this, erm... this business of smell
is very interesting, isn't it?.

718
00:58:59,825 --> 00:59:02,117
Interesting.

719
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,242
If there's one thing
I could find fault with the Master,

720
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:07,450
it would be on that issue.

721
00:59:07,533 --> 00:59:12,783
I have known occasions when I was studying
a message Ieft for me by a friend

722
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:16,867
and he would drag me away by the collar
in the middle of the most fascinating passage.

723
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,200
Rather Iike dragging a scholar
away from a text at the British Museum.

724
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:23,783
That is a rather untoward analogy.

725
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:26,658
No, most apposite.

726
00:59:26,742 --> 00:59:31,492
I believe I have thought
exactly the same thing.

727
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:36,325
What sort of a dog were you, anyway?.

728
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,242
I beg your pardon?.

729
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:42,533
I mean in your day.

730
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:45,117
You know, before you took...

731
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,533
holy orders.

732
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,575
I recall no such activity, sir.

733
01:00:10,575 --> 01:00:12,867
Quite a session. Damn good value.

734
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:16,200
Listen, I've been thinking.
This is getting out of hand.

735
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,033
The man is clearly
suffering from delusions.

736
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,242
And as for the Tokay...

737
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:25,158
I sincerely hope
I never develop a taste for it.

738
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:28,367
It's hard to find
and devilishly expensive.

739
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,367
Ten guineas to hear a dean say
he believed he was once a dog!

740
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,533
I must be mad.

741
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:36,700
- Good as gold.
- Shh.

742
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:40,617
I don't want your money.
This has gone too far.

743
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,658
- But you can't stop now, young Fisk.
- Well, I see no point in continuing.

744
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:50,575
The man believes what he believes.
That's that.

745
01:00:57,408 --> 01:01:01,283
You're not one of these blokes
who gives up before he can Iose, are you?.

746
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,492
Are you?.

747
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:12,533
What if I was to procure
a bottle of the elixir for free?.

748
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,408
For free?.

749
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:27,575
This bloke owes me. He owes me more
than one favour too, I'II tell you that.

750
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:32,908
And if anyone's got a bottle or two,
His Nawabship will.

751
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:39,783
Tokay, you say?. An Imperial?.

752
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:42,950
- We're finding it hard to come by.
- I should jolly well think so.

753
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:46,617
Rather extravagant
being so keen on it, I'd say.

754
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,867
- You must be quite the connoisseur.
- It's not for him.

755
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,658
It's for Dean Spanley.

756
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:55,283
For Spanley?.
OId Wag Spanley Iikes Tokay?.

757
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:58,700
(Wrather) Very partial to a drop,
the dean.

758
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:03,783
Excuse me. Did you just
call Dean Spanley Wag?.

759
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:06,950
Walter Arthur Graham. Wag Spanley.

760
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:09,658
Before my time,
but my father knew him at Oxford.

761
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:15,200
But tell me, why are you so intent
on plying him with Tokay?.

762
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:21,158
Well, it has to do with...
one of the major tenets of your religion.

763
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,533
Bat and pad together
when playing forward?.

764
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:28,700
- Reincarnation, actually.
- Don't go in for it myself.

765
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:32,450
I mean, I'm not going to do
much better next time round, am I?.

766
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,617
This innings will do me nicely.

767
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,575
Reincarnation is all right for the masses.
Gives them something to Iook forward to.

768
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:41,533
About the Tokay, Iook in the cellar.
Galsworthy will show you.

769
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:43,575
There's all sorts down there.

770
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:46,325
Wouldn't be surprised
if you found the odd case of Tokay.

771
01:02:46,408 --> 01:02:48,825
Don't Iike it myself.

772
01:02:48,908 --> 01:02:53,325
Last time I drank it,
I dreamt I was a monkey.

773
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:58,033
Thought the funny bugger might have
a dozen hanging around.

774
01:02:58,117 --> 01:03:01,158
Should be more than enough there to get
the old boy back to when he was a pup.

775
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:06,325
My father used to have a dog
when he was a child. Name of Wag.

776
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,533
You know, I've been thinking.

777
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:11,367
Lady I know, in the thespian way,

778
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,742
thought we might give her
a bottle of the Imperial.

779
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:18,367
Lovely girl.
Lot of fun when she's tight.

780
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:24,950
I think for that to be significant,
you'd have to suppose two things,

781
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:27,075
neither of which are improbable.

782
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:32,325
One, that the dean's mum and dad knew that
he'd previously been your father's pooch,

783
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,117
and two, to commemorate the event,

784
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,117
decided to incorporate his doggy name
into his Christian name.

785
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,992
It may Iook Iike a boat but it doesn't float,
as my Aunt Molly used to say.

786
01:03:43,075 --> 01:03:46,575
And why would I want
to have dinner with a dean,

787
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:50,075
Iet alone one
who believes in reincarnation?.

788
01:03:50,158 --> 01:03:53,533
Because you're always complaining that
I neglect you on my evenings with Spanley.

789
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,700
I thought you'd Iike to come with us.

790
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:59,575
Wrather will be there. You remember him.

791
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:04,908
The conveyancer... from the Iecture.

792
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,367
Can't say as I do.

793
01:04:10,075 --> 01:04:14,950
It must be here, this gathering.
Certainly not at that rickety place of yours.

794
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:19,200
- Can Mrs Brimley cook for four?.
- She can make more of her hotpot.

795
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:22,825
Father, we are having
a Shevenitz-Donetschau '79.

796
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:26,325
And I do not think the hotpot,
sustaining though it may be,

797
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,867
is quite the precursor for a '79 Tokay.

798
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,783
Damn fuss over fermented grapes.

799
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,533
What is this all to do with?.

800
01:04:35,617 --> 01:04:38,825
The dean, the Tokay, this dinner?.

801
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:42,075
If I were to tell you, Father,
you would not believe me.

802
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:47,533
In that case, don't tell me.
I don't believe in enough things already.

803
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:51,700
Well, it won't be the hotpot,
that's all I can say. Ha!

804
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:54,242
I'm not serving hotpot to a dean.

805
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:56,367
I could do the navarin.

806
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,533
With the sorrel and cucumber soup
to start.

807
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:05,283
Or maybe Ieek and potato. What your
father calls the Vicious Swiss soup.

808
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,450
Either would be most welcome.

809
01:05:10,742 --> 01:05:14,450
Mrs Brimley, do you remember
my father's dog, Wag?.

810
01:05:14,533 --> 01:05:18,075
And for dessert... profiteroles.

811
01:05:18,158 --> 01:05:19,700
I think it was a spaniel.

812
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:23,908
My choux pastry is too good to be eaten,
if I say so myself.

813
01:05:26,242 --> 01:05:31,825
Wag?. No, not really.
I remember it run off, though.

814
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:35,242
What a to-do that was.
Like a death in the family.

815
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:38,033
Upset him ever so.

816
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:41,408
Why didn't he get another,
I asked him once. Know what he said?.

817
01:05:41,492 --> 01:05:45,200
That Wag was one of
the seven great dogs?.

818
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:48,908
- Oh. I see he talked to you about it.
- Mm-hm.

819
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:55,908
Maybe profiteroles would be too heavy
after the Iamb.

820
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:01,658
Raspberry and gooseberry fool.

821
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:07,533
Whatever you decide, Mrs Brimley,
I'm sure will be splendid.

822
01:06:11,575 --> 01:06:14,242
- A '79?.
- Yes, indeed.

823
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:17,575
Really, my dear Henslowe,
you are a man of remarkable resource.

824
01:06:17,658 --> 01:06:21,158
Oh, it's not I
who provided this trove, sir.

825
01:06:21,242 --> 01:06:24,450
My father, whom I believe
you have met before.

826
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,367
Yes, I believe I do recall.

827
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,700
I was rather hoping that he might join us
for our next evening together.

828
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,908
I see.

829
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,533
- And your friend.
- Wrather. Mr Wrather.

830
01:06:37,617 --> 01:06:39,700
Wrather, yes.

831
01:06:39,783 --> 01:06:43,992
I have the strangest feeling, you know,
after our Iast encounter,

832
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:46,325
that I know Mr Wrather.

833
01:06:46,408 --> 01:06:48,742
Perhaps from a previous Iife.

834
01:06:48,825 --> 01:06:53,283
- I was not always a dean, you know.
- No?.

835
01:06:53,367 --> 01:06:56,992
No. I was in accountancy at one time.

836
01:06:57,075 --> 01:07:01,617
A dismal business,
at Ieast in the regions where I toiled.

837
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:05,408
And you feel Iike
you met Mr Wrather then?.

838
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:07,992
Yes, it's possible.
Or perhaps it's his being a colonial.

839
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:14,575
One often feels one has met them before.

840
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:22,617
So... can I hope for your company
this Thursday?.

841
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:28,867
I do feel only your palate
can fully appreciate a '79.

842
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:33,783
A '79. What splendours.

843
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:36,158
A bottle of the '79.

844
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:38,325
Three bottles.

845
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,408
Best to Iet sleeping dogs Iie,

846
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:47,783
- if you know what I mean.
- Yes, I know what you mean.

847
01:07:47,867 --> 01:07:50,742
What if he recognises your father,
Iicks his hands?.

848
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:53,658
That could be damned embarrassing.

849
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:59,533
Pygmy judge, old man. Pygmy judge.

850
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:07,575
So there we were, on our holidays
in this cottage on the shore of Windermere.

851
01:08:07,658 --> 01:08:11,200
Wonderful spot to get some reading done

852
01:08:11,283 --> 01:08:15,158
and I was availing myself
of the tranquillity to do just that.

853
01:08:15,242 --> 01:08:18,450
This fellow here, young Fisk,
and his brother

854
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:20,867
were out on the Iake in a rowboat.

855
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:23,450
Storm came up.

856
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:26,825
One minute it's all
"I wandered Ionely as a cloud",

857
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:31,867
the next it's blowing hell's bells
and howling Iike a banshee.

858
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:36,658
Mrs Fisk, she comes in,
wringing her hands.

859
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:42,408
"Our boys," she cries at me,
"They're out on the Iake."

860
01:08:44,825 --> 01:08:47,408
You have no idea how taxing it is

861
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:51,033
to be dragged out of a book
in which you are thoroughly engaged.

862
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:54,867
"You must do something, Horatio,"
she said to me.

863
01:08:56,367 --> 01:09:02,783
"Our boys are in great danger.
Do something," she implored me.

864
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:09,367
So I got up, Iaying aside Balzac
with the greatest reluctance,

865
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:13,533
and went to the window,
opened the shutters.

866
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:17,742
Whitecaps as far as the eye could see.

867
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:20,700
I stared out into the maelstrom

868
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:26,992
and I raised my hands and called out
in my most stentorian tone".

869
01:09:29,283 --> 01:09:32,075
"Give up your dead!"

870
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,492
Which was a great comfort,
as you can imagine, to my mother.

871
01:09:35,575 --> 01:09:39,700
When one is helpless,
I see no point in pretending otherwise.

872
01:09:39,783 --> 01:09:45,033
How terrible that must have been
for your mother. And you too, sir.

873
01:09:45,117 --> 01:09:48,158
When something has gone
to the trouble of happening,

874
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:51,950
it is best to consider it inevitable,
in my opinion.

875
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:54,867
Learned that Iesson the hard way, I did.

876
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:57,033
Well, Iet us, erm...

877
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:03,950
Let us drink to the inevitable...
before it happens.

878
01:10:09,783 --> 01:10:13,450
Not a bad drop.
I'm beginning to get a hang of this stuff.

879
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:18,117
Too much Iike toilet water for my taste.

880
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,825
CIear away the rest, Mrs Brimley.

881
01:10:20,908 --> 01:10:23,825
She makes a very good hotpot,
I should tell you.

882
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,283
Well, Iet's take this
in the drawing room.

883
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:34,450
If you wouldn't mind, sir, I should prefer
to remain here to enjoy my Tokay.

884
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:36,992
Oh?. And why is that?.

885
01:10:37,075 --> 01:10:40,408
I cannot really say. I...

886
01:10:40,492 --> 01:10:46,200
Sometimes you get comfortable where
you are. You don't want to disturb yourself.

887
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:49,783
Poppycock. Port should be taken
in the drawing room.

888
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:53,033
Let the Iadies get on
with whatever it is they get on with.

889
01:10:53,117 --> 01:10:55,158
I'm no Iady.

890
01:10:55,242 --> 01:10:59,825
It's rather Iike being bathed when one has just
gotten comfortable in one's smell.

891
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:02,908
- What is the fellow on about?.
- Shh.

892
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:08,075
There was a patch of ground behind
the shed where the earth was always moist

893
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,325
and I Ioved to roll there
to get that particular aura around me.

894
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:17,825
It brought out the natural secretions

895
01:11:17,908 --> 01:11:22,492
so one could feel there was a glow
around oneself, Iike a halo.

896
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:30,742
And it was then, when one felt so complete,
that the Master would call me.

897
01:11:34,117 --> 01:11:38,700
Who, in God's name, called you what?.

898
01:11:38,783 --> 01:11:42,950
The Master. He called me Wag.

899
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,867
For reasons I never understood. Wag.

900
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:51,367
But that was
the greatness of the Master,

901
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:54,908
that he could make that one sound
convey so many meanings.

902
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:58,033
There was a "Wag" which meant a walk.

903
01:11:58,117 --> 01:12:02,867
There was a "Wag" which meant
"Go away from the table"

904
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:08,242
and there was a "Wag" which meant
"You are to be bathed."

905
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:12,200
And of all the "Wags"
that "Wag" was the most terrible.

906
01:12:12,283 --> 01:12:14,158
Why was that?.

907
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,242
Because, for all his great wisdom,

908
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:19,908
he never understood how embarrassing
it is to meet another dog

909
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:23,367
when one isn't wearing one's own smell.

910
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:26,158
But more importantly,
they did not know who you were,

911
01:12:26,242 --> 01:12:30,742
so you had to go through all that business
of circling and sniffing and growling.

912
01:12:32,492 --> 01:12:35,908
I was always being embarrassed in that way
with a particular friend of mine.

913
01:12:35,992 --> 01:12:39,450
So what did you do?.
Did you have to fight him?.

914
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:43,450
Oh, we fought a few times,
just to get acquainted. That I enjoyed.

915
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:46,700
My favourite grip was the ear.

916
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:51,450
You always hear how going for the throat
is the best approach,

917
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,658
but in my experience it's almost impossible
to get a throat grip,

918
01:12:54,742 --> 01:12:57,617
so I would always go for the ear.

919
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:02,450
But it does give the opportunity
for excellent complaint.

920
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:06,283
My friend had a very good complaint,

921
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:10,242
which I memorised and I would use
if I had to take a beating from the Master.

922
01:13:10,325 --> 01:13:12,450
- He beat you?.
- Only...

923
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:16,033
On certain occasions it was called for,
certainly.

924
01:13:16,117 --> 01:13:19,450
Then I would use this splendid complaint
which I'd Iearned from my friend.

925
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:22,950
So what was his name,
this friend of yours?.

926
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:28,533
His name?. I don't think I knew
the name his master called him.

927
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:32,200
Indeed, I'm not entirely sure
he had a master,

928
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:35,783
but his complaint was most satisfying.

929
01:13:37,992 --> 01:13:44,658
"Oh, rescue me. I'm a poor, unfortunate
creature, far from home and without a friend."

930
01:13:44,742 --> 01:13:46,367
"Help me, help me."

931
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:50,242
"I have fallen into terrible straits
and am about to be murdered."

932
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,908
Which, of course, was not the case.

933
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:58,617
This dog, the one without a master,
what sort of dog was he?.

934
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:05,575
Oh, the best of fellows. Adventurous
and carefree, fearless and bold.

935
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:10,492
But you said he was whining
and snivelling about being murdered.

936
01:14:10,575 --> 01:14:12,950
Oh, that was just his complaint.

937
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:15,200
How did you meet him,
this friend?.

938
01:14:17,033 --> 01:14:21,742
He would Ieave messages
on the cart that brought the milk.

939
01:14:46,075 --> 01:14:48,158
And i would reply.

940
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:52,533
And then one day, he came to our door.

941
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:56,075
Well, I told him to go away
or I would chase him

942
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,533
and I barked my most enormous bark
and made myself very huge.

943
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:03,200
But he wasn't afraid and said so.

944
01:15:04,242 --> 01:15:09,742
You weren't... how will I put it...
a female by any chance, were you?.

945
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:12,242
- Of course he wasn't.
- Not at all.

946
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:14,575
We were just good friends.

947
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:22,033
He'd Ied a very interesting Iife
and knew many more things than I did,

948
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:24,533
which he told me about
in considerable detail.

949
01:15:24,617 --> 01:15:28,200
- How did he tell you?.
- In the messages that he Ieft me.

950
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,575
And I would Ieave word of my doings,

951
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:34,075
which, I confess, were not comparable to his,

952
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:37,658
because all I'd ever done was
go for evening walks with the Master.

953
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,992
And while they were enjoyable outings,

954
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:45,950
they were but moon-cast shadows
compared to his adventures.

955
01:15:46,033 --> 01:15:49,158
Did you ever go
on an adventure with him?.

956
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:52,492
(Spanley) Indeed.
The greatest of my Iife.

957
01:15:53,617 --> 01:15:56,575
i remember the Master had to go away
and i couldn 't go with him.

958
01:15:56,658 --> 01:15:58,950
And i was going to follow him,

959
01:15:59,033 --> 01:16:03,950
but then my friend came
and he proposed we have an adventure.

960
01:16:11,283 --> 01:16:14,825
Since the Master was leaving,
i said yes.

961
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,908
And off we went.

962
01:16:26,992 --> 01:16:32,742
What a day that was to be a dog and
to be with one who knew how to be a dog.

963
01:16:32,825 --> 01:16:36,158
For I confess, happy though I was
to belong to the Master,

964
01:16:36,242 --> 01:16:42,742
until that day I had barely glimpsed
the glories of dogdom.

965
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:49,617
He introduced me
to the joys of chasing animals.

966
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,408
A matter in which
I was Iargely unversed,

967
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:56,617
having previously only had the opportunity
to chase a couple of cats.

968
01:16:57,783 --> 01:16:59,825
Cats are of no use for chasing

969
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,658
for, not knowing the rules,
they invariably climb up trees,

970
01:17:02,742 --> 01:17:05,367
a habit I find contemptible.

971
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:09,575
Horses, on the other hand,
understand the rules perfectly

972
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,283
and enter the business in good spirit.

973
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:33,283
But of all the creatures
that a dog can chase,

974
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:38,158
none exceed sheep for sheer pleasure.

975
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:49,450
Their fear drifts in clouds behind them
and you breathe it in as you run along,

976
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:52,283
so you become quite intoxicated by it.

977
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,200
it's as if one is not so much running
but flying on it.

978
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:03,700
Or perhaps swimming
might be more a exact description.

979
01:18:04,908 --> 01:18:09,242
Were it not for their master appearing,
we might have chased them all day.

980
01:18:12,575 --> 01:18:14,450
Be gone!

981
01:18:14,533 --> 01:18:16,492
My friend didn't care,

982
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,242
but I thought we might be seized
and prevented from further adventures,

983
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:23,075
so I persuaded him to Ieave.

984
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:25,908
So we went into the woods.

985
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:30,825
And there we had the good fortune
to come across... a rabbit.

986
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:39,325
It's not commonly known
that rabbit scent,

987
01:18:39,408 --> 01:18:43,158
particularly when it's frightened -
and this one was very frightened indeed -

988
01:18:43,242 --> 01:18:45,492
does not Iie along the ground,

989
01:18:45,575 --> 01:18:50,575
but rises in heaps
so you have to jump to inhale it.

990
01:18:52,617 --> 01:18:56,783
When we'd had our fill of its fear,
we turned to catching it,

991
01:18:56,867 --> 01:19:01,825
and in this endeavour my friend showed
what a splendid fellow he was,

992
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:04,867
for he drove
straight through the thicket,

993
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:07,992
paying no heed
to its many inconveniences,

994
01:19:08,075 --> 01:19:13,283
and sent the rabbit scuttling
to where I was stationed.

995
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:43,700
how much more satisfying
a recently alive rabbit tastes.

996
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:49,992
I'm afraid the masters fail
to appreciate fur, guts and bones

997
01:19:50,075 --> 01:19:52,492
for the delicacies that they are.

998
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:58,658
Then it was time to quench our thirst.

999
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:10,075
And then, as in all things
that befell us on that glorious day,

1000
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,242
we came across some water
that had gathered in a hollow.

1001
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,408
Then, after we drank our fill,

1002
01:20:19,492 --> 01:20:23,825
we rolled in it
to give ourselves a good glow

1003
01:20:23,908 --> 01:20:28,658
and then we went into the woods
to rest in the shade.

1004
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:34,200
- Perhaps we should take our...
- Father.

1005
01:20:34,283 --> 01:20:36,617
Be quiet and sit down, please.

1006
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,033
You went into the woods and...

1007
01:20:48,825 --> 01:20:50,908
And we slept.

1008
01:20:50,992 --> 01:20:54,492
That most sublime of states,

1009
01:20:54,575 --> 01:20:58,867
when a dream dreams you
rather than the other way round.

1010
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:24,158
And when we awoke, the moon was rising.

1011
01:21:24,242 --> 01:21:28,867
it was just on the other side of the woods,
so we set about surprising it.

1012
01:21:40,117 --> 01:21:43,950
And we came very close to catching it,
for it was slow to get up.

1013
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:47,450
But just when we were almost on it,

1014
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:51,367
my friend couldn't control himself
any Ionger and Iet out a cry.

1015
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:00,867
And had we been there
but a moment sooner,

1016
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:04,075
we surely would have seized it
and torn it apart Iike the rabbit.

1017
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:08,700
How it would have tasted, I cannot tell.

1018
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:14,492
So we told it what a great
cowardly, unsmelling thing it was

1019
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:19,450
and if we ever caught up with it,
it would surely regret it.

1020
01:22:24,575 --> 01:22:28,242
Then we turned around and went home.

1021
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:31,992
So you knew the way home?.

1022
01:22:32,075 --> 01:22:36,242
Oh, yes. Turn towards home and go there.

1023
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:42,867
But you had been out all day, running free.
How far from home were you?.

1024
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:49,033
Yes, we'd gone many overs, that is true.
How many, I couldn't tell.

1025
01:22:49,117 --> 01:22:50,992
Overs?.

1026
01:22:51,075 --> 01:22:56,742
Overs. Many overs. Over woods and
fields, streams and hills. Many overs.

1027
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:03,700
And you just... turned towards home?.

1028
01:23:05,242 --> 01:23:08,783
- How else would one do it?.
- Then why...

1029
01:23:08,867 --> 01:23:12,658
And I knew that I should be beaten

1030
01:23:12,742 --> 01:23:16,700
and I remembered my friend's complaint
that I would use

1031
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:20,158
and how delicious it would feel

1032
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:24,658
when the beating had stopped
and the insults had finished.

1033
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:30,742
Yes, the glow of having paid the price
for wrongdoing.

1034
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,992
And were you punished?.

1035
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,658
No, not on that occasion.

1036
01:23:40,992 --> 01:23:43,867
Why was that?. Do you know?.

1037
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:50,950
Because a very remarkable thing
happened on the way back...

1038
01:24:03,533 --> 01:24:06,617
which I cannot fully explain.

1039
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,367
One moment we were running along
side by side, heading for home, and the next...

1040
01:24:37,283 --> 01:24:39,950
we were not.

1041
01:24:45,825 --> 01:24:48,492
I cannot say what happened.

1042
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:52,200
Perhaps it was a dream
and I wakened from it.

1043
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,533
Was there any pain?.

1044
01:25:23,742 --> 01:25:27,825
Pain?. No, I cannot say there was.

1045
01:25:35,617 --> 01:25:38,158
All i can remember
is how clear the night was,

1046
01:25:38,242 --> 01:25:40,325
with the moon-cast shadows

1047
01:25:41,325 --> 01:25:45,242
and the earth rising underneath me,

1048
01:25:45,325 --> 01:25:48,325
and home in my heart
and the Master waiting.

1049
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:53,450
But no, no pain.

1050
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:34,117
I am most glad to hear it.

1051
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:43,075
If you will excuse me.

1052
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,700
Did I say something to upset you, sir?.

1053
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:50,950
No, no, no, not at all.

1054
01:26:54,117 --> 01:26:57,617
I am put in memory of my son Harrington.

1055
01:26:59,492 --> 01:27:01,617
That is all.

1056
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:17,158
Erm...

1057
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,575
Harrington was, erm...
killed in the Boer War...

1058
01:27:25,992 --> 01:27:28,242
returning from a patrol.

1059
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:30,367
That's all we know.

1060
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:35,825
The, erm... body was never recovered.

1061
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,200
Are you all right, Mr Fisk?.

1062
01:28:17,617 --> 01:28:19,992
He was shot.

1063
01:28:22,825 --> 01:28:25,033
Yes.

1064
01:28:31,408 --> 01:28:35,075
Oh. There, there.

1065
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:43,575
Better Iate than never, Mr Fisk.

1066
01:28:47,783 --> 01:28:49,658
Come with me.

1067
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,450
In you go, Mr Fisk.

1068
01:29:01,992 --> 01:29:04,075
Sit yourself down.

1069
01:29:10,783 --> 01:29:13,700
He does mither on, that dean of yours.

1070
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,325
I do hope whatever I said
did not upset him.

1071
01:29:35,408 --> 01:29:40,700
Excuse me. I was talking
to Mrs Brimley about the old days.

1072
01:29:40,783 --> 01:29:44,408
Thank you, Dean, for coming.
It was a memorable evening.

1073
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:46,283
No, thank you, sir.

1074
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:49,908
I fear the Tokay
rendered me somewhat unsociable.

1075
01:29:49,992 --> 01:29:53,700
It has a tendency
to make me withdraw into myself.

1076
01:29:53,783 --> 01:29:58,617
Not at all. You were all
that could be hoped for in a guest.

1077
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,325
You know your way home from here?.

1078
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:05,867
Just turn towards it
is the best way, I'm told.

1079
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:10,492
I'm going in the dean's direction.
I'II see that he gets there this time.

1080
01:30:10,575 --> 01:30:13,742
- Good of you to come, Mr Wrather.
- Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1081
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,992
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1082
01:30:28,533 --> 01:30:30,658
You know, Mr Wrather,

1083
01:30:30,742 --> 01:30:35,408
I have the most persistent notion
that we have met before.

1084
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:41,450
One often feels that about colonials,
Dean.

1085
01:30:41,533 --> 01:30:45,658
Yes, I have heard that said.
Nevertheless...

1086
01:30:45,742 --> 01:30:51,200
You're not in the market for a new rug,
are you?. I've this good friend in Marrakesh.

1087
01:30:51,283 --> 01:30:53,283
Marrakesh?.

1088
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:56,075
Colourful, exciting place,
if you know the right people.

1089
01:30:56,158 --> 01:31:00,617
- I know the right people.
- Something of an adventure, I imagine.

1090
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,408
He can put away the Tokay,
I'II say that for the dean.

1091
01:31:10,492 --> 01:31:13,908
I thought for a moment
we might have had to open the third bottle.

1092
01:31:13,992 --> 01:31:16,200
Oh, two was ample, I think.

1093
01:31:16,283 --> 01:31:19,367
He goes on a bit
when he's in his cups, though.

1094
01:31:21,575 --> 01:31:23,658
Thank you, Father.

1095
01:31:27,992 --> 01:31:31,992
One moment you are running along,
the next you are no more.

1096
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,200
Well...

1097
01:31:58,492 --> 01:32:02,783
- I will see you next Thursday.
- Or any day that suits.

1098
01:32:02,867 --> 01:32:05,950
Mustn't get too set in our ways.

1099
01:32:07,742 --> 01:32:09,825
Good night, Henslowe.

1100
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:14,200
Good night, Father.

1101
01:32:25,825 --> 01:32:28,033
God knows
what they were on about.

1102
01:32:28,117 --> 01:32:32,075
Something about rabbits tasting better
with their fur on.

1103
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:35,200
You won't catch me cooking them,
that's all I can tell you.

1104
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:43,408
Then, he comes in here.

1105
01:32:45,242 --> 01:32:47,575
First time in God knows how Iong.

1106
01:32:49,242 --> 01:32:53,742
And he stands...
Iooking at that photograph,

1107
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:57,408
sobbing his heart out.

1108
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:18,075
Morning, Mrs Brimley.

1109
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:20,950
- It's not Thursday, you know.
- No, I know.

1110
01:33:23,325 --> 01:33:27,700
- How's Father?.
- Well, I don't know, really.

1111
01:33:27,783 --> 01:33:30,117
Here, boy!

1112
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,533
Wasn't my idea, you know.

1113
01:33:32,617 --> 01:33:35,033
The day after that dinner,

1114
01:33:35,117 --> 01:33:39,033
he sent me round to see
that friend of yours, the one who was here.

1115
01:33:39,908 --> 01:33:42,992
- Mr Wrather?.
- Sent me round with a Ietter, he did.

1116
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:46,242
Next day he shows up with a dog.

1117
01:33:48,575 --> 01:33:52,783
- What kind of dog?.
- Oh, one of those, erm...

1118
01:33:52,867 --> 01:33:55,283
- Oh, Iike before.
- A spaniel?.

1119
01:33:55,367 --> 01:33:57,450
Must be one of the seven.

1120
01:33:57,533 --> 01:33:59,242
CIever boy!

1121
01:33:59,325 --> 01:34:02,325
One's quite enough
in this house, thank you very much.

1122
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:05,575
It's already chewed a cushion.

1123
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:07,992
He's in the garden.

1124
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:15,742
Imagine, Mr Fisk in the garden.
He'II be growing roses next.

1125
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,033
Twist!

1126
01:34:48,367 --> 01:34:51,242
That was the end of my talks
with Dean Spanley,

1127
01:34:52,908 --> 01:34:55,283
although my father
sometimes saw him at the club.

1128
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,242
Don 't know what they talked about,
if anything.

1129
01:35:01,575 --> 01:35:06,908
As for the question of reincarnation,
i resolved to wait and see,

1130
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:11,117
albeit with more anticipation
than hitherto.

1131
01:35:12,492 --> 01:35:15,658
And should i find myself
in the form of a dog,

1132
01:35:15,742 --> 01:35:17,825
i trust i will be so fortunate

1133
01:35:17,908 --> 01:35:23,408
as to belong to a master
as kind as my father.
