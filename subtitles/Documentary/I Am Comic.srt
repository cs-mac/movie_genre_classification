1
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:09,644
What was the most beneficial super power

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,320
for anyone who works at the stash?

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:13,561
- Be able to read minds.
- Read minds?

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,269
Yeah. Let's say, for instance,

5
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:17,077
some guy comes in with an action figure...

6
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:18,314
- Okay.
- Looking to sell it.

7
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,822
- Right.
- The negotiation is over.

8
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,032
Yeah, but that might not
be the price that you'll get.

9
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:25,839
So what? I don't have to
do-si-do anymore with the dude.

10
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:28,345
Don't you like that
little bit of back and forth?

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,551
No. I'd much rather be done with it.

12
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:33,858
What about you? What would
be the best power to have?

13
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,297
Invisibility.

14
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:37,502
Nobody would ever steal from here again.

15
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,853
So now, I'm paying you just
to stand at the front door

16
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:46,428
and be invisible for eight hours a day?

17
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:49,366
He performs the same task
as a fake security camera.

18
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:53,577
What about you? You got one?

19
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:56,050
I can't think of one that I would waste.

20
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:58,959
I can stay here.

21
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:36,444
Hello, and welcome to another episode

22
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,481
of Comic Book Men, the only show

23
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,954
that thought itself worthy
enough to lift Mjolnir,

24
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:42,657
but only got real Thor.

25
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:43,726
I'm Kevin Smith.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,162
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

27
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:46,964
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

28
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,335
I'm hungry for food, and
I'm hungry for answers, man.

29
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,005
What happened at the store this week?

30
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,344
The other day a guy
brought in a couple of items...

31
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,416
something that I remember
from my childhood.

32
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,489
- Hey, how you doing?
- What's cracking?

33
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:02,690
- What's going on, now?
- What's up, man?

34
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,259
Got a question for you.

35
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:06,698
Are you guys into any
of that John Kaiju stuff?

36
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,367
What do you mean, like Godzilla?

37
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:10,103
- Godzilla, stuff like that.
- We're into that.

38
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:13,345
- What do you got?
- Ready? Ready?

39
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,248
- Oh.
- Boom, check it.

40
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,717
- Ultraman, right?
- You got it.

41
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:24,596
I'm a big Ultraman fan.
It's kind of cult here

42
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,194
in the U.S., wouldn't you agree though?

43
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,594
Right, right. Well,
yeah. I was raised on it,

44
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:29,228
- my man, I was raised on it.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,597
I have never seen Asian people before,

46
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:32,399
until I started watching Ultraman.

47
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:34,232
So there you go, my man. There you go.

48
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,799
Goes around in a big circle, right?

49
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,535
Was it a big surprise
to you when you found out

50
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:39,204
they all couldn't turn into Ultramen?

51
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,436
Yeah, it was, you know.

52
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,938
I was a fan of Ultraman.

53
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,372
He was a protector of the asians.

54
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,973
I was a big fan. I don't recall

55
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,874
watching any episode
where he just declared,

56
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,308
"I'm only gonna protect Asian people."

57
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,541
Okay, well, I didn't
see that part, but I mean...

58
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,743
that part I made up
in my head and heart.

59
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,878
"Ha ha ha ha, let those
white people die, Ultraman."

60
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,449
Where'd you get these at?

61
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,951
A friend of mine was teaching

62
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:06,987
conversational English in Japan.

63
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,593
He knew I was an Ultraman
geek, so he kind of,

64
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,726
sort of worked around
the law to get them to me,

65
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,328
because they were not
allowed to be released

66
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,896
- out of the country.
- Really?

67
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,496
You're looking at some contraband.

68
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,499
So there you go.

69
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,172
Are you sure that there
wasn't something packed

70
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:24,906
- inside the Ultraman?
- No, no, no.

71
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,240
Come on, man.

72
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,742
I don't know how much I believe that.

73
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,312
I can't imagine that

74
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,447
there was some sort
of ban on, you know...

75
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,114
like midnight express.

76
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,481
He has, like, a bunch of
Ultramans around his waist.

77
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:40,616
Guns trained on him.

78
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,950
All right, what are
you wanting for them?

79
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,317
Like, a hunny apiece.

80
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,351
- A hundred apiece.
- Oh, oh, a hunny apiece?

81
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:47,853
A hunny apiece.

82
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:50,124
Oh, so your looking
to get 200 for these?

83
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,829
See, I really don't know that
much about the pricing of them,

84
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:55,335
but I do have someone in the store today

85
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,803
who actually, probably does.

86
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,472
Would you mind if I brought him over?

87
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,974
- Sure, why not.
- Hey, Robert?

88
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,343
- Yeah.
- Can you come here for one sec?

89
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,143
Sure thing, Walt.

90
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,479
More than just a pop
culturalist, Rob Bruce,

91
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:08,481
who we turn to for a lot of deeper looks

92
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,381
to some of the products
that come through the doors...

93
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:13,984
also world renowned as the kaiju expert.

94
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,350
Yeah, he's, like, the collector.

95
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,785
He just goes around collecting titles.

96
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:23,887
Sound battlers, wow.

97
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,386
This was actually produced

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,020
as a show called Ultraman
towards the future.

99
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:28,288
- In Australia.
- Right.

100
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:29,789
This was distributed in the U.S.

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,658
This was the last time
that actually Ultraman

102
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:32,960
was on the U.S. soil.

103
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:35,629
- Mm-hmm.
- So he's come in today.

104
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:38,131
He wants to sell them. He's
looking to get a hunny each.

105
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,403
- What's a hunny?
- A hundred, c-note, Benjamin...

106
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,576
is that a fair price

107
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,678
would that I'd be paying for these today?

108
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,547
Well, I... you know,
if they were boxed...

109
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:50,152
but the thing is, the reason
they didn't come in boxes,

110
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:52,688
my buddy had to smuggle
these bad boys through.

111
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:54,655
- Contraband, he's saying.
- Contraband.

112
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,524
I don't understand that.

113
00:04:56,558 --> 00:04:59,091
I think he just could've mailed
them and not worried about it.

114
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,186
How about 1990... 93, 94?

115
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:03,161
I've got a pretty big collection,

116
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:04,660
and a lot of it I bought in the '90s,

117
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,992
and I wasn't smuggling it out ofapan.

118
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:08,427
It's about to get heated up in here.

119
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,695
Well, my stuff is smuggled.

120
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:11,429
Getting back to $100 apiece...

121
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:14,195
I don't see that.

122
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,764
So, Robert, what is the
retail on these two pieces?

123
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,264
Probably $65 apiece,

124
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,599
which means if I was going to buy them,

125
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,368
I'd buy them for 25 bucks apiece.

126
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,735
Wow.

127
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,403
- But that's me.
- Kicked me in the nuts.

128
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,538
Didn't even lift your leg.

129
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:28,004
Oh, my lord.

130
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,338
- That's him.
- That's him.

131
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:30,840
- Yeah.
- We talking to you.

132
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,340
I mean, I'd be more
interested in this guy

133
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,675
than the Australia one.

134
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,945
The narrow... what are... what
are... what are you looking at?

135
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,112
The other thing to
concern yourself with...

136
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,513
oh, man, he's back.

137
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:42,215
It's bandai. It's not x-plus.

138
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:45,352
Now, if they were x-plus
figures, they'd be hot.

139
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,786
40?

140
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,690
60.

141
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,358
- 45.
- 55.

142
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:55,458
I'm gonna... I'm gonna stay at 45.

143
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,628
- Ten bucks?
- Ten bucks is ten bucks.

144
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:58,796
It's the difference between making

145
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,465
a profit and breaking even.

146
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,601
Keeping the lights on
and having them turned off.

147
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,736
I think you better watch
out. You're about to have

148
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,474
your lights turned out, it looks like.

149
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,406
Okay, all right, all right, I'll go 50.

150
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:12,173
And, you know it, just...
50 as long as he don't-

151
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,476
he walked out in one piece?

152
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,645
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,779
- 50 and no punch.
- Is that good?

154
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,347
50 and no punching?

155
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,682
He just saved you.

156
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:21,421
50 and no punching.

157
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,791
- We good?
- We're good, 50.

158
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,626
You owe us, rob.

159
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,697
I think I do.

160
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,164
Kevin, as promised, I'm here.

161
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,666
Brought something special to show you guys.

162
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,001
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

163
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:39,800
I don't mean this
in an... in a bad way,

164
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:42,400
but at times, I find myself challenged by,

165
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,601
like, hanging out with you guys.

166
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,534
But I think, like, if I had myself

167
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,967
to talk to and hang out with,

168
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,200
like, go to ball games,
go out to dinner with...

169
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,468
I think I'd be really, really happy.

170
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:52,935
Like, you're driving down the street.

171
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,403
You see a comic book shop, and you're like,

172
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,039
"ooh, let's stop
there," and he's like...

173
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,373
"should we stop?" And,
you know, like, my clone

174
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,308
- goes, "why'd you even ask?"
- Right.

175
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,077
We're not together all the time,

176
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:04,048
but we spend as much time
together as humanly possible.

177
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,150
So you guys don't bang
is what you're saying?

178
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,717
Well, that's...

179
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:08,950
- that's good to hear.
- Well, I mean, come on.

180
00:07:08,984 --> 00:07:10,684
I mean, we have so much in common.

181
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:12,319
Eventually it's gonna cross our minds.

182
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:15,456
Maybe he'd turn... he'd turn you.

183
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,592
If anybody could turn me, it's me.

184
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,270
Winter soldier.

185
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:30,707
- That's a one.
- Put plus one on there.

186
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,909
Earth 1.
- Put down plus three.

187
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,442
- Hey, guys.
- Kevin.

188
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,943
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

189
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,611
As promised, I'm here.

190
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,011
Brought something special to show you guys.

191
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,114
So one of the coolest things
that we've been doing lately

192
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,350
is hitting the con circuit.

193
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:45,850
And the coolest part's meeting

194
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:47,717
some of the big creators
that we'd buy our...

195
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,116
naturally, man, you're rubbing elbows.

196
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,650
You're right there with them.

197
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:51,984
And one of the guys
that we've been kind of

198
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,885
making friends with is Kevin eastman,

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,049
co-creator of the teenage
mutant Ninja Turtles.

200
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,283
Heroes on the half shell, man. Heavens.

201
00:07:58,317 --> 00:07:59,783
Last time we saw him at a con,

202
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,953
he mentioned that he
had, in his possession,

203
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,886
the first ever turtles sketch

204
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,286
- that he did.
- Really?

205
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,619
And he said if he was ever in the area,

206
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,020
he would show us,

207
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,788
and sure enough, he came in.

208
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,487
It's the turtles' 30th
anniversary this year,

209
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:14,855
and so we're doing a
lot of shows, celebrating

210
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,589
all the awesome thing
that the turtles have done.

211
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,421
30 years later, you're
still talking about turtles.

212
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,752
Did you ever think that your idea

213
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,819
would profit this long?

214
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:23,920
You know, not in a million years.

215
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,353
I mean, when Pete and I started out,

216
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,720
we grew up as huge fans of Jack Kirby.

217
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,256
That's all we ever wanted to do,

218
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,054
is write, and draw, and
tell our own stories,

219
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,523
and you know, we sent sampled
around to different publishers,

220
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:33,924
got all the rejection
letters that everybody gets,

221
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,892
and so instead of sending
it to anybody else,

222
00:08:35,926 --> 00:08:37,426
we said, "let's just publish it ourselves.

223
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,194
Let's do it as a real,
independent comic book."

224
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,463
And then we cleaned out all
$200 of Pete's bank account.

225
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,934
We borrowed $1,000 from an Uncle of mine,

226
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,634
and we had just enough
money to print 3,000 copies.

227
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,969
- Wow.
- It was the first press run.

228
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,437
It sounds like Kevin's story.

229
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,137
Maxed out ten credit cards

230
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,537
and made this little movie
he thought no one would see,

231
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,336
and here we are.

232
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,836
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

233
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,102
was not meant to become what it became.

234
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:00,436
It was kind of a play on what was going on

235
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,104
with Frank Miller's daredevil at the time,

236
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:03,939
if I remember correctly.

237
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:07,010
Eventually, it gets picked up,
turned into a cartoon series.

238
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,678
It's become video games.

239
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,112
It's become toys.

240
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,678
But it came from two dudes,

241
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:14,546
sitting around in Massachusetts,
not working for anybody,

242
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,114
but having fun with themselves,

243
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,781
just going, like, "wouldn't this be cool?"

244
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,650
It's a true American success story.

245
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,287
All right, man, but... so can
we see what's inside the case?

246
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,356
Yes. As promised, I wanted to
bring you guys a special treat,

247
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,890
and I actually found two things,

248
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:31,059
one I think you'd get
a real big kick out of.

249
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,965
This is the layouts for
the very first issue.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,366
- No way.
- Yeah.

251
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,801
So what we did was I
did all the basic notes

252
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:42,336
of the pacing on yellow, lined
paper, and then, before we

253
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,668
started on the actual version
layout, I did these layouts.

254
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,871
And this is, you know, how
broke we were in those days.

255
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:49,876
So this is page one, two, and three,

256
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:54,082
and then, on the back
is page four and five.

257
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,018
Did you know right from the start

258
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,687
the perfect animal would be a turtle?

259
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,390
The first big inspiration was Bruce Lee.

260
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,159
I was like, "what if
Bruce Lee was an animal?

261
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,896
What would be the dumbest
animal Bruce Lee would be?

262
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,500
And the natural joke

263
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,600
was a slow moving turtle
that could do martial arts.

264
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,504
I got to tell you, man,
this beats any fine art

265
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,938
I've ever seen in a museum.

266
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,373
- Thank you.
- I mean, this is like seeing,

267
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:14,908
like, an original, like,
Michelangelo, right?

268
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,745
Or the sketches before
he created the Mona Lisa,

269
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,915
- or something.
- Yeah.

270
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,617
- Is that what he did?
- No.

271
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,252
It was one of them.

272
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,456
It was Leonardo,
but he...

273
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:27,064
so you want to see where it all came from?

274
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,634
The very first doodle... this
is the one I showed Peter.

275
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,405
It was started as a pencil sketch,

276
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,411
and then I had to ink it in
just to clean it up a little bit.

277
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,615
The suspense is killing me.

278
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,388
This rarely leaves the vault.

279
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:42,858
I figured I'd show you
guys where it all started.

280
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,434
Oh. Here it is. This may be the most

281
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:49,371
accurate detailed swamp
thing figure ever produced.

282
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,578
This is a super rare, vintage piece.

283
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,148
Oh, my God, where'd you get it?

284
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:58,722
The teenage mutant
Ninja Turtles have been

285
00:10:58,757 --> 00:10:59,959
around now for decades.

286
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,583
There've been many incarnations.

287
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,317
Let's shoot around and go

288
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:05,385
favorite incarnation of turtles.

289
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,820
For me, I'm gonna say, hands
down, the black and white

290
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:09,088
original incarnation.

291
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,856
What about you, Walt?

292
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,692
This turtle doesn't get
enough props as he should,

293
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:15,862
'cause he's the first
turtle to wield the sword...

294
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,530
touche turtle from Hanna Barbara.

295
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:19,768
Oh, my... I don't
think anyone's ever made

296
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,036
that drawing comparison.

297
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,437
Holy crap, you're right, man.

298
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,407
He was the original turtle with a weapon.

299
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,275
Oh, good lord.

300
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,376
What about you, Ming?

301
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,944
Who can forget the first movie?

302
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:33,011
- Oh, big fan of it.
- It was a good balance too,

303
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,182
between the source material
and making it more mainstream.

304
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,882
Like, I remember being in the movie theater

305
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,217
and not feeling like,

306
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,519
"we're watching a kids' movie.

307
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,256
What about you, Bry?

308
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,023
It would have to be the
movie that I saw with you

309
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:50,394
since it's the only exposure
to turtles I ever had.

310
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,095
So the other day, we got a little

311
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,163
turtle power in the store.

312
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,864
Kevin eastman, co-creator of

313
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,498
the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

314
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:01,999
Last time we saw him at a con,

315
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,798
he mentioned that he
had, in his possession,

316
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,667
the first ever turtles sketch

317
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,236
- that he did.
- Really?

318
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,907
And he brought it by into the store.

319
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,509
That's a piece of comic book history

320
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,046
coming through the door, man.

321
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,416
30 years later, here I am,
still talking about turtles,

322
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,385
still going out and meeting the fans

323
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,720
and doing all that fun stuff,
so I figured I'd show you guys

324
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,887
- where it all started.
- No way.

325
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,323
You want to see the very first doodle?

326
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:28,263
This rarely leaves the vault.

327
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,737
Oh.

328
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,375
- Oh, my God.
- They've changed a bit.

329
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,910
A little bit.

330
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,512
Wow.

331
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:40,247
A lot of people ask me
what my favorite turtle is,

332
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,147
and you know, I love them
all. It'd be like choosing

333
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:43,548
a favorite child, you know what I mean?

334
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,350
But Michelangelo was the
first turtle ever drawn,

335
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,851
so is near and dear to me.

336
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,487
He's got the red cloth.

337
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:52,387
He's got the bulletproof glass.

338
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:54,522
- Some lucite casing inside?
- Yeah.

339
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,323
- That's pretty cool, man.
- Oh, yeah.

340
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,158
The original drawing of the turtle,

341
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:01,862
that, without it, there is no
teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

342
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,362
How many people do you
think try to shoot that sketch?

343
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,667
So you showed it to Pete, and
you're like, "what do you think?"

344
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,069
- "Check it out."
- Yeah.

345
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,437
- And what was his reaction?
- Just laughed.

346
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:12,673
He said, "that's the dumbest thing ever."

347
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:14,208
And of course,

348
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,443
then he had to do a
drawing to top mine, so...

349
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:18,210
and of course, I had to top his sketch,

350
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,211
and that's where I did the
pencil of all four of them,

351
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:22,012
and had it for 30 years,

352
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:24,282
and we do a lot of work with
a lot of different charities,

353
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:26,549
and so we figured with
the 30th anniversary,

354
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:28,184
it would be a great time
to sort of put it out there,

355
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,452
and see if there's someone

356
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,120
that would pay the amount of money

357
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,924
I want for it, $2 million.

358
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,793
And if they don't, then I'll just keep it,

359
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,395
but if they do, then we can
do a lot of good with it.

360
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,528
So this is your first stop
for the independent buyers?

361
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:42,401
What do we got? -
Yeah, I think I have...

362
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:43,603
500,000 each?

363
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:46,439
I'll hit the ATM.

364
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:48,107
- Wow, that's high.
- Yeah.

365
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,612
- There's only one in existence.
- True.

366
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,114
And it's the bridge to everything.

367
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:54,882
I mean, it's generated billions.

368
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,451
Well, guys, listen,

369
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,920
and chat about this
stuff, but I have to run.

370
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:04,586
Thank you so much.

371
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:06,187
Listen, a pleasure... an
absolute pleasure. Bryan...

372
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,788
- nice to meet you.
- Listen, thank you so much.

373
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,524
- Kevin, thank you so much.
- Take care of yourself.

374
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,594
Don't let these guys beat
you up too badly in here.

375
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,528
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- That's true. Thanks again.

376
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:14,864
See you soon.

377
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,643
All right, man, thanks.

378
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:24,912
- Have a great day.
- Hi.

379
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,183
Hey. I was hoping to check
out the swamp thing in the back.

380
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:29,320
Can you bring up the
swamp thing Matty collector

381
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,024
- out of the glass case, please?
- Yeah, no problem.

382
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,359
Thanks.

383
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,897
Here it is. Huh? Huh?

384
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,770
Wow, this is really
great. It's beautiful.

385
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,570
This may be the most accurate,

386
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,835
detailed swamp thing figure ever produced.

387
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,905
I mean, it's got everything from the roots

388
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,443
throughout his body, the mushrooms,

389
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:54,213
and the tubers, right
here, all along his back.

390
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:55,881
And those are important.
You'll definitely want those.

391
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:57,715
- Tell them about the tubers.
- Well, it was swamp thing's way

392
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,651
that he was able to consummate
his relationship with Abigail.

393
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,053
So she would take a bite out
of it and be able to experience

394
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:05,153
- everything that he experiences.
- Really?

395
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:06,989
So they could kind of
share a moment together.

396
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,991
It's kind of like... I guess
it was kind of like doing

397
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,326
ecstasy or something.

398
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,028
The first time I'm gonna say this,

399
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:14,064
but I think I'd eat a dude's tuber.

400
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,864
I love swamp thing, kids.

401
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,467
Like, that was the first comic book

402
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,404
I ever read where they
took a very dopey premise

403
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,472
and turned it into
absolute literature, man.

404
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,511
That's the stuff that made me
want to try writing comic books,

405
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,415
'cause they took it so seriously

406
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,018
and so earnestly. There was no winking.

407
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,155
They went deep inside
their heads and made them,

408
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:34,191
kind of, emotional
beings for the first time.

409
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,494
So those issues will
always mean the world to me.

410
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:38,062
Absolutely.

411
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,533
So what makes swamp thing
your favorite character?

412
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,268
My job is pretty dark.

413
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:43,271
Sometimes I just want to get
away and think of something

414
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:45,042
that's gonna take me kind of far away.

415
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,345
What do you do for a
living that's so dark?

416
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,084
I'm a mortician.

417
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:49,886
Wow. I mean, I know what it's like

418
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,591
to work with dead weight,

419
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,361
but not on that level.

420
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,363
Not on that level.

421
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:57,064
That's insane.

422
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,466
I found it strange that,
since she works as a mortician,

423
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,237
it would raise her spirits
to read swamp thing.

424
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,571
I could see doing anything other

425
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,306
than dealing with a dead body

426
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,907
would raise your spirits,
you know what I'm saying?

427
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,645
And reading a comic book
can be very life affirming.

428
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,644
Ming had such a dead eye
in his look the whole time,

429
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:15,112
she actually tried to
embalm him on the spot.

430
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,580
All right, well, will
you take swamp thing today?

431
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:21,748
Yeah. It's gonna go home with me.

432
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,316
- All set?
- Absolutely.

433
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,451
All right, let me put
him in his little head case,

434
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,719
and it'll be 99.95.

435
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,820
I was hoping to not
spend that much today.

436
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,287
- Really?
- I was hoping a little bit

437
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,555
more around 75.

438
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,624
I don't know if I
could do that much off.

439
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:39,764
I could do 90, you
know, take 10% off today.

440
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,969
Can you do 85?

441
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,437
Yeah, I can do 85.

442
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:44,771
- Great.
- You want to grab the box?

443
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,772
- Yeah, I'll grab the box.
- Okay.

444
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,506
All right.

445
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,775
How many, like, are these in
the world would you estimate?

446
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,412
- I'd say 15.
- 15.

447
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:52,249
This is considered, like, a holy grail

448
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,786
- of Star Wars collectibles.
- Oh, my God, holy grail.

449
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,920
If you guys could spend just 24 hours

450
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:07,156
at either Arnold's, meeting
The Fonz and the gang,

451
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,926
or at pop's, meeting Archie and the gang,

452
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,729
which one would you spend the 24 hours in?

453
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,800
I mean, I think you just said
the key word, there... The Fonz.

454
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,705
But you go to Arnold's,
you're nothing but set dressing.

455
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,441
But you go Archie... Riverdale,
you may actually have a chance

456
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,446
of, like, becoming one of part of the gang.

457
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,048
You could replace, like, moose maybe.

458
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,681
I mean, I'm sorry. Like, with Archie,

459
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,418
is he the coolest one
in Riverdale... Archie?

460
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,788
- Yeah.
- Oh, you could unseat him

461
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:33,523
in a second. Yeah, you're right.

462
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:35,257
- I'm going to Riverdale with you.
- You would clean up.

463
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,560
You would have Betty,
Veronica, and midge, and Ethel.

464
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,275
- Here you go, need a bag?
- No thanks, we're good.

465
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,945
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, guys.

466
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,448
I have a vintage,

467
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:58,380
1977 Star Wars movie banner

468
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,549
that was displayed in the theater

469
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,420
when the movie first premiered.

470
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,788
Wow, looks like a flying carpet.

471
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:07,588
This is a super rare, vintage piece.

472
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,894
This is considered, like,

473
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,431
a holy grail of Star Wars collectibles.

474
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,164
Oh, my God, where'd you get it?

475
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,800
My father was friends with
a guy who owned a movie theater

476
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,101
that premiered Star Wars in 1977.

477
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:28,571
So my father would drop me
off before he went to work,

478
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,309
I would stay there all day

479
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,178
and watch the movie over and over again,

480
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,646
and he'd pick me up on the way home.

481
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,316
And then, when the movie finished playing

482
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,185
- I actually got it for Christmas.
- Wait, wait, wait.

483
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,155
So how many times did you
see Star Wars that summer?

484
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:42,089
Oh, I can't... at least
1,000 times in my lifetime.

485
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,591
Okay, so how can you still
hold any affection for it

486
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,160
after seeing it that many times?

487
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,828
I love it, I still
love it. I still watch it.

488
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,529
That's clockwork
orange level of torture.

489
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,701
You could sit through it if I tell you.

490
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:55,506
Which movie have you seen
the most, over and over again?

491
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,377
I saw raiders of the lost ark 35 times

492
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,946
- in the movie theater.
- In the theater?

493
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:01,316
My mom would drop us
off at the movie theater

494
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,285
and I would jump five movies in a day,

495
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,887
and they'd come pick me
up at the end of the day,

496
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:08,826
and they were like, "you beat the system."

497
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,463
There's got to be 34 other
films out there I want to see.

498
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,299
Even a movie you didn't want to see,

499
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,738
just to break the monotony a little.

500
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:19,875
How many, like, are
these in the world right now

501
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,311
- would you estimate?
- I'd say 15.

502
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,979
I mean, in the world.

503
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:25,315
I've actually had it
appraised from Lucasfilm.

504
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,918
- Oh, all right.
- So you went to the top.

505
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:29,053
So you already know
what it's... what it's...

506
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,487
I know what its value is.

507
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,655
So what are you looking to get for it?

508
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:33,258
7,500.

509
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,094
- Really?
- Yep.

510
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:36,897
But that's what Lucas himself
has said, "this is probably"

511
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,000
- "what it's worth."
- Yep.

512
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,502
Well, it's definitely cool.

513
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:43,373
I could see the stash making a play for it.

514
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:44,941
What would you offer?

515
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,009
How about 3,250?

516
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:51,010
I'm thinking 55.

517
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,946
How 'bout 35?

518
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,715
Nah, I got to go a
little higher than that.

519
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,557
I think I'm probably
firm at 35, considering.

520
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:02,762
I don't think I could
part with it for that amount.

521
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,632
All right, man. I understand.

522
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,699
Get the man his noodle.

523
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,935
All right.

524
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,638
Definitely cool to see.

525
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:11,141
I mean, you know, I've
never seen anything like it.

526
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,874
All right, guys, well, let's see.

527
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,577
When the new movies come out,

528
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,079
if they're a hit, and
I'm sure they will be...

529
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:17,580
I think they're gonna be. You excited?

530
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:18,748
I'll be there.

531
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,384
How many times a day?

532
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,987
- Yeah.
- Seven days a week.

533
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,090
I've already asked
for the time off of work.

534
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,961
- Thank you.
- One thing is for certain.

535
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,666
There is a lot of star
wars merchandise out there.

536
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,597
Ugh! Like, you ever
see that movie, wall-e,

537
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,166
where the planet's just
covered with garbage?

538
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,473
If they zoomed in on it, it would be a lot

539
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:43,079
of Star Wars garbage.

540
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:45,083
And that's all we got
for you this week, man.

541
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:48,351
Just like that big old secret,
we gotta ooze out of here, man.

542
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:50,020
For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.

543
00:20:50,054 --> 00:20:51,588
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

544
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,157
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

545
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:56,028
Go, ninja. Go, ninja. Go. Good night.
