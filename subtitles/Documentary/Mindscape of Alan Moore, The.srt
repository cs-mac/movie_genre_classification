5
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,280
Hello?

6
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,760
No! No!

7
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,120
What's
going on in there?

8
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,040
John own memories are
intruding. He's
having a seizure.

9
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,080
Marjorie! Get in there! Now!

10
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>Senator Rockford has been identified</i>
<i>as the target...</i>

11
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,080
<i>of an FBI investigation,</i>
<i>involving embezzlement and</i>
<i>accusations of blackmail.</i>

12
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,960
Senator!

13
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,480
I wholeheartedly and
emphatically deny any and all
allegations leveled against me.

14
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,400
<i>His attorney has secured</i>
<i>the services of Mindscape...</i>

15
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
the world's top memory
detective agency...

16
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,800
<i>to gather information about his</i>
<i>past and help the FBI with</i>
<i>the investigation.</i>

17
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,120
<i>Memory detectives,</i>
<i>as they're commonly known...</i>

18
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,560
<i>have experienced a resurgence</i>
<i>in recent years...</i>

19
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,600
<i>thanks to the growing number of</i>
<i>cases solved using the remote</i>
<i>viewing technique.</i>

20
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
<i>In the early 70 s, the Defense</i>
<i>Intelligence Agency</i>

21
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,040
<i>began conducting top secret</i>
<i>experiments with people with</i>
<i>psychic abilities</i>

22
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,640
<i>to help gather intelligence</i>
<i>for modern warfare.</i>

23
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,920
<i>They came across a group of ESP's...</i>

24
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,240
<i>that had the ability to access</i>
<i>people's memories</i>

25
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,560
<i>and observe them as they were</i>
<i>experienced in the past</i>
<i>by the subjects.</i>

26
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,960
<i>The findings of memory</i>
<i>detectives do not yet carry</i>
<i>the same weight...</i>

27
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,440
<i>as DNA evidence in court...</i>

28
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,920
<i>but currently prove more</i>
<i>reliable than polygraph tests.</i>

29
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,000
<i>They say, remote viewing is nothing</i>
<i>more than an elaborate scam...</i>

30
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,360
<i>but the reality is, remote viewers</i>
<i>have been solving cases...</i>

31
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,280
<i>that have been cold for years.</i>

32
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,400
<i>Most recently, the murder of</i>
<i>child actress Kate Henderson...</i>

33
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
<i>was solved by memory</i>
<i>detective John Washington.</i>

34
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
Shit.

35
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Hello?

36
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
<i>CALLER Ah, hello!</i>
<i>Good Morning!</i>

37
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm calling about the
house for sale.

38
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
No... no... we're not selling
the house anymore, I'm sorry.

39
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,000
Well... the agency listing says
it's still active.

40
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,960
Yeah, I know it's still listed
at the agency, but we're not
selling it, okay?

41
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
Mr. Washington's own
traumatic memories...

42
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,560
<i>were blending in with his</i>
<i>clients memories...</i>

43
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
<i>which impaired his ability to</i>
<i>focus during sessions.</i>

44
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,920
And thank you.

45
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,040
<i>Now it seems, Senator Rockford</i>
<i>is betting his political</i>
<i>career on Mindscape...</i>

46
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,520
<i>the prime memory detective</i>
<i>agency in the world.</i>

47
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,840
<i>The rumors that the Mindscape</i>
<i>program is dangerous, are unfounded.</i>

48
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,200
John is here.

49
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,240
John... how are you?

50
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,600
I'm great.

51
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,200
You're still taking
the medication?

52
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
No, I'm done with all that.

53
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, you're lucky the
stroke was mild.

54
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,520
You could be relearning your
abc's right now.

55
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,280
That's true.

56
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,480
Yes?

57
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,360
Uh... I'm good.

58
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Nice.

59
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,480
You met anybody recently?

60
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,360
You know, John, maybe it's time
to get back in the running.

61
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,840
I'm not there yet.

62
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
It's been two years.

63
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,400
You should move on from what
happened to your wife.

64
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,360
And you know it
wasn't your fault.

65
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah, well...

66
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Oh, shit!
Shit! Sorry.

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Ah, don't worry about it.
Don't worry!

68
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,960
I'm so sorry. Don't
worry about it.

69
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,760
Here... sit down! Sorry.

71
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,080
I heard Senator Rockford on...
TV...

72
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,560
talking about the possibility
of hiring a memory detective.

73
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,800
Oh, yeah, yeah. Peter Lundgren
is already working on the case.

74
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,080
Rockford hired him. Lundgren?

75
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,160
C mon! I was better than him
on my worst day!

76
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,680
Yeah, but gifts like yours
need to be used.

77
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,160
You've been out of the
game for months.

78
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,440
And Lundgrens' success nowadays
is close to 100 percent.

79
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,560
What's the matter?

80
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
To be honest, I'm
running out of money.

81
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,480
You still have the beach house?

82
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
Yeah.

83
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,800
Go ahead. Sell it.

84
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,080
I'm not ready to sell it yet.

85
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,880
What I was wondering was
whether I could do
something for Mindscape.

86
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,400
As it happens, I, uh...

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,600
I might have something you're
right for, perfect actually.

88
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,760
Her name is Anna.

89
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh, you're kidding.

90
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,040
Forget about the name, right?

91
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,240
She used to be my patient
when she was little.

92
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,160
Very special girl...

93
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,240
she's a teenager now, but I
don't think a... a
doctor can help.

94
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
Maybe a viewer can.

95
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,760
Well, what's her problem?

96
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,280
She's on a hunger strike. All
you have to do is
get her to eat.

97
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,760
Just tell the parents to hide
the fashion magazines.

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,320
John...

99
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,240
You know, it could be a quick
one for you, if you didn't
wanna sell the beach house.

100
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,880
<i>Hi John, I'm so happy</i>
<i>you're back in the saddle.</i>

101
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,840
<i>Anna's still refusing to eat,</i>
<i>trying to pressure them...</i>

102
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,880
into letting her out
of the house.

103
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,800
She's very fragile, so
tread carefully.

104
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,200
<i>Try to find a trauma for her</i>
<i>therapist to work on... bye.</i>

105
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,280
Thank you so much for
working on Anna's case.

106
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm Michelle. John.

107
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,760
And this is Anna's stepfather,
Robert.

108
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,360
Sebastian speaks very
highly of you.

109
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,560
Even as a baby, Anna
was unusual.

110
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,680
She didn't smile when you
smiled at her, but she didn't
cry much, either.

111
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,640
I would say she was unusually
focused for a child,
always calm.

112
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,840
She looked at things as if she
already knew what they were.

113
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,560
Later, of course, we took her
to a specialist, and her IQ
score came back off the charts.

114
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
When was the last time she ate?

115
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
She stopped eating one week ago.

116
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,360
She's taking vitamins and
drinking water, but
nothing else.

117
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,480
In my opinion, she should be...
in a place that can provide
the proper care.

118
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,520
I'm sure Anna can get
better here.

119
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,280
Mr. Washington, ah... as I'm
sure you can appreciate...

120
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,800
this is a matter that requires
great discretion.

121
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,040
I will need you to sign a
non-disclosure contract...

122
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,960
that anything revealed in
Anna's memories can't be
disseminated beyond
Michelle and myself.

123
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
Of course.

124
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,760
Anna is so special, she's so
many talents, she's...

125
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
Gifted.

126
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,480
Yes, gifted.

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,280
I think there are
better words for it.

128
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Such as?

129
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,800
I would say haunted.

130
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,280
What happened to
Anna's real father?

131
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,040
He died... when I was pregnant.

132
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,960
Does Anna get along with Robert?

134
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Not well, lately... but he's
tried to do his best for her.

135
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,680
I see. This way.

136
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,520
Is there any specific reason
why Anna is refusing to eat?

137
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,840
She wants to go back to school,
but that's impossible.

138
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm sure Sebastian told you
about her cutting herself.

139
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,920
We've had to remove all sharp
objects from her room.

140
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
We need to protect her.

141
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,960
From what?

142
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,680
To protect her, from herself.

143
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,440
Sweetie. This is John...

144
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
the gentleman I told you was
coming to visit.

145
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,680
Aren't you late for your
AA meeting, Mom?

146
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,880
Can I have a seat? Can
I have a seat?

147
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,960
Do you mind? Do you mind?

148
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,000
We won't guess the next one for
sure, so go ahead, make
yourself comfortable.

149
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,360
That's quite the party
trick you have there.

150
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,400
What's the metronome for?

151
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,440
I like the rhythm when I draw.
It's soothing.

152
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Better?

153
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,040
Much.

154
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
Anna, you know what
catabolysis is?

155
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,240
If you don't eat, your
organs are gonna fail.

156
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,800
John, do you know what "prana"
is?

157
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,840
It's sanskrit, it
means vital life.

158
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,960
There are Yogis in India
who rarely eat.

159
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,320
They get all their energy or
"prana" from the air
and the sun.

160
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
Is that what you're doing?

161
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,400
Are you a doctor?

162
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,960
No, but I do have to ask
you some questions.

163
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,320
I would like you to tell me
what expression you see.

164
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,080
What am I getting in exchange
for making you earn some of
Robert's money?

165
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Well, you might get to know
yourself better.

166
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
What do you see?

167
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,680
Malice.

168
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm kidding.

169
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,760
He's expressing happiness,
maybe even affection.

170
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
What about this guy?

171
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
That guy's pissed off.

172
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,840
Uh-huh.

173
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,240
What about her?

174
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,920
I think her husband's out late,
and she's wondering
where he is.

175
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,600
She's worried he's with someone
else, but she's also glad to
have the down time...

176
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,680
'cause he's a loser.

177
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,840
Right.

178
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm gonna tell you a story...

179
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,320
and then I'm gonna ask you
a question. Okay?

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,000
There's this girl about your
age at her mother's funeral.

181
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,120
At the funeral, she sees this
guy she's never seen before.

182
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,960
She gets to meet him, briefly.

183
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,400
And she thinks he's amazing.
He's everything she's
ever wanted.

184
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,320
She falls in love with him,
right there and then.

185
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,560
But, in the crowds at the
funeral, she gets separated...

186
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,080
from him before she has a
chance to ask for his number.

187
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,280
And two days later... this
girl... kills her own sister.

188
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,720
What's her motive for
killing her sister?

189
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,280
Her motive is she wants to
meet the guy again.

190
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
Did I get it right?

191
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,280
Huh? Oh, there's no
right answer.

192
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,160
Depends on what
you're looking for.

193
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,880
Why is that?

194
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,960
You're testing me to see if I
think like a sociopath.

195
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,040
Sociopaths sometimes have
trouble reading
facial expressions.

196
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,200
With the second test, I gave
you the answer you were
looking for...

197
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,800
but, the fact is, that story
has a flawed set up.

198
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,640
The more logical outcome would
be for the girl to
kill her father.

199
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,120
Why?

200
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,200
If the girl didn't know the
man, it's unlikely her
sister would.

201
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,600
And it was her mother's funeral
where she met this guy...

202
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
so it would make more sense for
her to kill her father.

203
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960
There would be a higher
probability that the...

204
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,480
the mystery stud would attend
her father's funeral.

205
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,320
That's probably true.

206
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm not a sociopath, just smart
enough to think like one.

207
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,880
Can I see what you're drawing?

208
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,200
If you're not a doctor,
then what are you?

209
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,920
I take people to their memories.

210
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
She's monitored all the time?

211
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,760
24-7.

212
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,800
If you need anything while
you're here, you can ask me or
Ralph, we both watch Anna.

213
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm John.

214
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,160
Oh, I'm Judith...
this is my cell.

215
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
Call me, if you can't
make a session.

216
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,920
I will.

217
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,800
You were right about her,
she's smart.

218
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,040
Special kid, lots of problems.

219
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,640
What do you think are the
underlying issues?

220
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,160
Depression, bipolar disorder
with deep-seeded narcissism.

221
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm gonna need her full file to
know what memories to target.

222
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,360
Parents don't want
full disclosure.

223
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,800
What? Why? I signed
an agreement!

224
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,160
She's been in and out of
boarding schools, involved in
some incidents...

225
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,080
but you don't need to
get into that.

226
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,160
Just let her take the lead,
you know?

227
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,640
I mean... a few memories where
the parents screw up.

228
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,000
As you know, usually, the
dramatic experience of actually
going back into memories...

229
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,440
affects people, gives them
perspective on their
present lives...

230
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,600
to stop overeating, stop
smoking... whatever.

231
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,560
Make her eat. Simple case.

232
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,080
Will I know I'm in a memory?

233
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,120
It should feel like it's
happening for the first time...

234
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,360
but it'll be different from
the original event.

235
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,880
Because your unconscious mind
will know that you've
been there before.

236
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Also...

237
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,640
me being there makes
it different.

238
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,200
The equipment is useful to
record the session.

239
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,840
I will be watching you for
the whole time.

240
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,040
If anything happens, I can
bring you back, right away.
Okay?

241
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,760
Now, you may see me in the
distance, but you won't
know that it's me.

242
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,440
If I'm next to you, you won't
be able to see me at all...

243
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
unless I call you back.

244
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Understand?

245
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,640
Yes.

246
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Please put these in your ears.

247
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,840
They conceal a tone, hidden
in white noise.

248
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,520
It enables the brain to go
into a theta state.

249
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
Can we use my metronome.
As well?

250
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Uh... sure.

251
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,400
Where are we going?

252
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,080
Focus on your first memory.

253
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,160
The further back we can go,
the better.

254
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,120
Give me your hands.

255
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,360
Relax.

256
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,880
Think about that first memory.

257
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,200
At first, your memories will
jump around, but that's okay.

258
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
When you're ready...

259
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
close your eyes.

260
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,240
Let's begin...

261
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,480
now.

262
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,320
I like you being here with us...

263
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,520
We all know you like girls.

264
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,920
She's just a girl for god sakes!

265
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,360
We have a responsibility!

266
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,560
Let me out!

267
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,800
She needs to be in an
institution!

268
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,000
She's my daughter!

269
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,240
This old man, he played three.

270
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,280
He played
knick-knack on my knee.

271
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,480
With a knick-knack
paddy whack...

272
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,120
give a dog a bone...

273
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,960
this old man
came rolling home.

274
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,040
What game are you playing,
honey?

275
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,280
Can I play with you?

276
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,080
You have to be quiet.

277
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,760
What are you up to?

278
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,240
Mommy's not feeling well today.

279
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,400
You can't do that! You
can't just...

280
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,240
We have to think about Anna.
Anna is the focus of
the attention.

281
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Don't you think I'm
thinking about her?

282
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,520
We have a responsibility! We
are not the right people!

283
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,720
This is not the place for her,
Michelle!

284
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,680
Come with me, young lady! Dad!
Let me down!

285
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,040
I'll let you out when you
realize that spying on
people is wrong.

286
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,680
For god's sakes,
She's only a girl!

287
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,360
She's different, Michelle.

288
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,000
She's not like other children,
she needs to be in an
institution.

289
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,080
Well, why isn't it here, then?
Because I put it in here.

290
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,480
She's my daughter.

291
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,720
She tried to stab you, for
Christ's sakes!

292
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,120
Mom!

293
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,280
And coming back... now.

294
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
Ow.

295
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,880
Are you okay?

296
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
You were there?

297
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
I was right next to you.

298
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,080
Spooky.

299
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,840
Can we do more?

300
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Next time.

301
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,600
Self-involved, emotionally
stunted retards is what one
hopes for in parents.

302
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Did you see the letter opener?

303
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,840
I did.

304
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,360
Maybe my stepdad is the one you
should be testing for
personality disorders.

305
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Is he why you're on a
hunger strike?

306
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,160
So you married?

307
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,280
I was.

308
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,720
What was her name?

309
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
Same as yours.

310
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,680
I like her already.

311
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
Show me a picture.

312
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,600
I don't carry one anymore.

313
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
C'mon, John.

314
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,960
A guy like you always has a
picture in his wallet.

315
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll show you a picture...

316
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,000
if you agree to eat something.

317
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,720
You wanna see her?

318
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,760
It's up to you.

319
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,520
Robert desperately wants
to put me away.

320
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,040
And something like LSD in my
food would make me act crazy.

321
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,920
Well then, let's flip
out together.

322
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,000
If I start hallucinating,
you'll demand a drug test...

323
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
before they lock me away in a
padded room, right?

324
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,760
I swear.

325
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,400
C mon, let's eat!

326
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,800
She's pretty.

327
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,920
<i>Eat slowly so you don't</i>
<i>make yourself sick.</i>

328
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,720
Why do you wanna see this
antique letter opener?

329
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,200
I like to confirm memories,
just to be sure.

330
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,480
I cut her accidentally.

331
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,480
It's always haunted me.

332
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,040
Is your husband here? Mm-hm.

333
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,440
Can I talk to you both?

334
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,360
Why?

335
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,880
Anna just started to eat.

336
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
So, will I see
you at 7:00 to celebrate?

337
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,080
Okay, shall I pick you up then?

338
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,960
Sure, why not?

339
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
But only one drink.

340
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
So you like being a nurse?

341
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,440
I like helping people.

342
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,800
You take your job quite
seriously, huh?

343
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,360
Well, if you can't do what you
love, then at least make sure
you love what you do.

344
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,800
Isn't that what they say?

345
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,280
They do say that, that is
absolutely true.

346
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,520
I think you're doing a
great job with Anna.

347
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,720
Thank you for your confidence.

348
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,760
Sometimes I don't think I'm
gonna be able to help her.

349
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,280
Why?

350
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,040
My wife and I had a baby boy...

351
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,360
who died a few months
after he was born.

352
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,080
My wife kept wanting to go back
to the time when he was
still alive, and...

353
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,520
eventually the time came when...

354
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,560
she wasn't happy unless she
was in the memory.

355
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
She became obsessed.

356
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,280
So, I refused to take her to
the past anymore.

357
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:38,920
She... spiraled downward,
she... became depressed
and I lost her.

358
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,040
I couldn't help her.

359
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I tried to keep her in the
house, but you can't
lock someone up...

360
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,760
just because of your own fears.

361
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,080
I had a great time.

362
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
Me, too.

363
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,880
I hope I didn't talk too much.
Oh, you did...

364
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,600
but I liked it.

365
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,400
Thank you.

366
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,200
So, you're not even gonna try
to come up, so I can say no?

367
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,960
Uh...

368
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,000
I gotta go.

369
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
Safe home.

370
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,760
It's not
your fault, John!

371
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,640
It's not
your fault, John!

372
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm telling you, Sebastian, I
saw her last night.

373
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,760
That's impossible.

374
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,280
<i>She's under lock and key, never</i>
<i>allowed to leave her room.</i>

375
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,920
I know, but I... I
know what I saw.

376
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,880
<i>Do you, John?</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

377
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Everything's fine.

378
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,760
We may have one, because
there are blind spots.

379
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,560
What's happened?

380
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,960
Anna pushed Judith
down the stairs.

381
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,640
Judith is in the hospital with
multiple fractures.

382
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,560
Look at this.

383
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,360
Oh, my god!

384
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,640
There's no other angle at the
top of the stairs?

385
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,080
Blind spot.

386
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,680
On Monday, Anna will be
confined to an institution...

387
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,200
that can properly
address her needs.

388
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,080
Fortunately, as a family
friend, Judith will not be
pressing any charges.

389
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,040
I didn't do it, John.

390
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,560
Then why would Judith
say you did?

391
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,800
Judith always sneaks back
in late at night.

392
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,920
Mom's knocked-out on sleeping
pills, and that's when
they have sex.

393
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,040
Who? Robert and Judith?

394
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,480
He always sleeps with the
good looking help.

395
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
Just ask Jaime.

396
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,840
I mean, you saw what she was
doing with Robert in
the library.

397
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,320
I don't believe you.

398
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,400
When she first came here,
Judith had tried to make
friends with me.

399
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,160
And she was all like, "I have
no luck with men".

400
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,600
Well, my stepfather
moved right in.

401
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,720
You know, maybe... maybe they
had a fight, it got violent...

402
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
and now they're trying to cover
it up by blaming it on
the sick girl.

403
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,720
Or maybe Robert just
cold-bloodedly pushed her,
okay?

404
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,600
This is exactly the kind of
thing he's been hoping
for to lock me up.

405
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,840
Oh, c'mon, Anna.

406
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,440
Open your eyes, John!

407
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,600
My mother's family is one of
the richest in America.

408
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
And Robert's on an allowance.

409
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,360
If I die, the money goes to a
charitable trust and
he gets zilch.

410
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,120
But if I'm committed...

411
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,160
I get the money, but I
have no rights.

412
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Robert controls every penny.

413
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,200
And I'm sure Judith knows this.

414
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,680
Maybe he was afraid that she
was gonna tell you and that
you'd find out his
secret plans.

415
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,040
And I'm sure he told you, only
moments ago, that they send me
to an institution on Monday.

416
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,480
Am I right?

417
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,680
Please, John, you have to help
me prove that I'm innocent.

418
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,880
You're the only person
they're gonna trust.

419
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,040
I... I can't get send away to a
mental institution.

420
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,600
I won't survive that.

421
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,280
I know... I know I'm different,
not like other girls...

422
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,800
but doesn't mean I'm a murderer.

423
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,840
I don't even... I don't even
think of doing half the things
they're accusing me of!

424
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,480
Please, John!

425
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,720
Help me figure out what the
hell's going on with me.

426
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,920
I mean, you're all I have.

427
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
John.

428
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
How do you feel?

429
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,040
Pretty out of it.

430
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,840
Judith, did you see... Anna
push you down the stairs?

431
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,080
Are you here for Anna or for me?

432
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,480
I'm here for you.

433
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,960
But I need to know
what happened.

434
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,840
I know I went to bring
her some food.

435
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,480
I thought I locked the door.

436
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,400
Why don't you go to my memory?

437
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Ah... doesn't work like that.

438
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,640
How do you know it
wasn't Robert?

439
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,320
Robert?

440
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,120
Judith, I know.

441
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,760
Know what?

442
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,920
I know about you and Robert.

443
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,840
Did he hit on me?

444
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,840
Whatever, doesn't matter.

445
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,520
There's nothing going on
between me and Robert.

446
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,240
Look, I...

447
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,240
I hope you get better soon.

448
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,120
I can't believe that Anna
would hurt Judith.

449
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,200
Can you help my daughter, John?

450
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,160
I believe I can, Mrs. Greene.

451
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,040
I can take her to her traumatic
memories, help her
understand her behavior.

452
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,600
And I wanna find out the truth.

453
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,560
My husband wants to send her to
a professional care facility.

454
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,320
I don't want that, but he's
already paid the
registration fee...

455
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,240
and they're expecting
her in a week.

456
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,000
As soon as I see that file,
I'll know what I should
be looking for.

457
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,840
I'll have Sebastian's assistant
send it to you right away.

458
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,040
Sebastian has it?

459
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,720
<i>You'll see why the family</i>
<i>didn't want you to see the file.</i>

460
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>It's strong stuff, John.</i>

461
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,120
You said this was a simple case.

462
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>And it should have been, John.</i>

463
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,360
Maybe you're not ready
to come back.

464
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,960
Look... they're gonna put Anna
in an institution.

465
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,320
If you'd sent me the file
earlier, maybe I could have
prevented all this.

466
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,000
<i>Are you sure you want to</i>
<i>continue with the case?</i>

467
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm Anna's best hope right now.

468
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,560
I'll call you in a
couple of days.

469
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
<i>Do you know why you're here,</i>
<i>Anna?</i>

470
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,960
That's pretty obvious.

471
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,160
<i>For just one day, can we talk</i>
<i>about something other than me?</i>

472
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,360
<i>What made you try to</i>
<i>kill yourself?</i>

473
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,440
Red...

474
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,920
<i>it's such a dark, rich color.</i>

475
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,720
<i>Particular shade, it's</i>
<i>hard to come by.</i>

476
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,960
<i>Blood... it's red.</i>

477
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,520
It's kind of beautiful.

478
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,600
<i>Can you tell me about your</i>
<i>relationship with your parents?</i>

479
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,040
<i>My mother's trying harder, I suppose,</i>
<i>but it's still pretty pathetic.</i>

480
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,160
<i>Her heart's like... one of</i>
<i>those fancy ice sculptures</i>
<i>they have at parties.</i>

481
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,640
<i>Do you really want to know</i>
<i>the answer? Please.</i>

482
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,600
It's my parents who are
crazy... not me.

483
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,320
<i>Did you have feelings for your</i>
<i>teacher? Mr. Tatum?</i>

484
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,120
<i>That school was depressing.</i>
<i>He was nice.</i>

485
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,040
Did he take pictures of you?

486
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,360
<i>Would you mind if I take</i>
<i>a picture of you?</i>

487
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>Yes.</i>

488
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,600
<i>What kind of pictures?</i>

489
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,840
Artistic photos.

490
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,160
It was like a Jackson
Pollock painting...

491
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,800
where the blood sprayed
across the floor.

492
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,920
I can still see the exact
pattern when I close my eyes.

493
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,680
<i>Do you want to die, Anna?</i>

494
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,040
Don't we all die in the end?

495
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
It's kind of a freedom.

496
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
There are other ways to be free.

497
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,160
Not if you're not
allowed to have it.

498
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,680
Then what do you do?

499
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,440
Will you lift your chin a bit?

500
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,640
How do you feel when you draw?

501
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,640
Like the whole world disappears.

502
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,560
Like nothing else matters.

503
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,400
All right, finished.

504
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Can I see it?

505
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,280
Not yet.

506
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,600
Can I have your bag?

507
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,800
Promise me you'll look at it
when you get home?

508
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,520
I promise.

509
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,320
Are we even now?

510
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,600
Can we start the session?

511
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,840
Yeah, we can.

512
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
Mousey? It's
extremely dangerous.

513
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,600
My real name is Megan Scanlon.

514
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,880
Had sex with your teacher?

515
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,560
Who you raping ', bitch?

516
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,800
Hi, I'm Mousey.

517
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,080
Mousey? That's
really your name?

518
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,520
It's what the people
here call me.

519
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,040
My real name is Megan,
Megan Scanlon.

520
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,720
So Susan Merricks your roommate.

521
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,560
What's she really like?

522
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,240
I heard she was training for
the Olympics, had a
nervous breakdown...

523
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,000
beat up a
horse or something.

524
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,120
Oh, great! Frigid and
Mousey are here.

525
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,680
Look, just because I've been
assigned to watch over you...

526
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,880
doesn't mean you have to be in
the room all the time, Frigid.

527
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,240
Name's Anna.

528
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,960
Capital A, N, N, A.

529
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,360
Leave.

530
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,640
Now.

531
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,520
Or maybe the reason you won't
go is because you wanna
watch me changing.

532
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,880
Right, Frigid?

533
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,720
What are you doing? No! No! No!
Please don't!

534
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,680
No! No! No! Stop!

535
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,840
Cameras will be locked up, and
can only be signed out for
a day at a time.

536
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,000
The chemicals you will be using
could be harmful...

537
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,480
and any misuses, however
slight, will end your
art privileges.

538
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,400
Now, who here has experience
with the art of photography?

539
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,520
Anna.

540
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,720
Someone broke into the
principal's house and stole
all the alcohol.

541
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
Do you know who might
have done this?

542
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,400
House Mother, you're
talking to someone...

543
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,600
who takes the harmful effects
of alcohol very seriously.

544
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,120
Drinking is the Devil's
calling card.

545
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,680
Hey, Anna, look.

546
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,680
I'm so, so sorry about
the closet. I...

547
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,160
Oh, don't worry about it.

548
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,320
Some friends are coming over to
tea tomorrow. Do you
want to join us?

549
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,640
Can Megan come?

550
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,840
What, Mousey? She's
such a retard.

551
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,640
Yeah, she is.

552
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,360
Do you copy your roses from the
rose bushes out there?

553
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,760
Roses don't grow
during the winter.

554
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,040
Sometimes we remember things
the way we want to, rather than
the way they really were.

555
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,840
I didn't do anything to those
girls, if that's what
you're implying.

556
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,240
False memories can have a... a
rushed feeling to them...

557
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,120
a lack of detail.

558
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,280
The windows won't have views or
none of the clocks will work.

559
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,440
Well, if you ever find me, ah,
particularly attractive
in a memory...

560
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,760
it's probably because I'm
making it up, too.

561
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,480
I wouldn't picture myself
having a bad skin day if I
knew you'd be around.

562
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,200
Hey, I'm not kidding, okay?

563
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,480
I can accept we don't exactly
know what we're looking for...

564
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,400
but your memories
have to be real!

565
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,880
You have to be very careful!

566
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,760
Has something told you I've
been making them up?

567
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,400
Yeah, I saw a clock on the
wall, the hands weren't moving.

568
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,000
The one in the dorm hallway,
right?

569
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,720
Yeah.

570
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,160
That one never worked.

571
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,360
We used to call our gym
teacher, Mr. Pierce "The
Clock", because he didn't work,
either.

572
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,120
You never leave the house,
right?

573
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,320
Not anymore.

574
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,800
You've got 20 minutes.

575
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,000
Mr. Ortega?

576
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,360
So, what are you? Some
kind of therapist?

577
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,560
Do you know what a
memory detective is?

578
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,480
Somebody who takes rich
people's money.

579
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,280
Well, that's me.

580
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,000
Has Anna's family hired you to
find out if she has a soul?

581
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,360
I'm just here to find
out the truth.

582
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,760
That family is a nightmare.

583
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,400
You dig too deep, better
watch your step.

584
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,680
You're lucky you didn't get 20
years for seducing a minor.

585
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm not saying I wasn't at
fault, but that girl...

586
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:03,120
that girl was everywhere I
turned... flirting...

587
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,680
finding ways to get us alone.

588
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,840
I've lost everything.

589
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,680
My job, my fiance, my freedom...

590
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,600
my entire fucking life,
because of her.

591
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Anna's family throws money
around like confetti.

592
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,880
They can get to anybody.

593
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,920
Cops, district attorneys...

594
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,360
They've covered up all the bad
stuff Anna's done.

595
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,440
Then, had me thrown in here for
something I didn't do.

596
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,520
I'm sure that they even covered
it up when she tried to kill...

597
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,640
those three girls at school
that same year.

598
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,760
Anna blamed it all on
another girl, Mousey...

599
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,640
but no one could find
out who she was.

600
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,080
Not even Susan Merrick s family
was able to take Anna to court.

601
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,200
I'd love that family to finally
get what's coming to them.

602
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Susan Merrick?

603
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,280
My name is John Washington. Can
I ask you a few questions
about Anna Greene?

604
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,920
Are you a cop?

605
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,040
No, I'm not a cop, Ms. Merrick.

606
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,680
What? Has she died
or something?

607
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,760
No... not at all.

608
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,720
I just want to find out what
happened, what really happened
at the Whitten Academy.

609
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,280
You think Anna was responsible.

610
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,520
Of course, she was a
total psycho.

611
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,120
There were a lot of other girls
there with problems. Could
have been anyone.

612
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,320
I got on with everyone.

613
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,920
Did you have a girl named
Mousey at your school?

614
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,800
No... I don't think so.

615
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,360
Now, I'm sorry, but
I have to go.

616
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,320
Miss Merrick, I know what
you've been through.

617
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,040
I know it must have been
extremely painful.

618
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,200
I really need your help.

619
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,640
Do you have any specific memory
of Anna you think I
should know?

620
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,800
Yeah... sure I do.

621
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,880
Anna seriously has balls. She
was like "drinking is the
Devil's calling card".

622
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,640
It was awesome.

623
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,000
Hey, Anna, do you want a cup?

624
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,360
No, thanks.

625
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,840
You sure?

626
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,120
Yeah.

627
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,920
I like you being here with us.

628
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,560
And coming back... now.

629
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,600
You saw Mousey,
right? She did it.

630
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,080
So you didn't poison
those girls?

631
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,760
Of course, not.

632
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,640
Your prints were all
over the teapot.

633
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,960
Because I picked it up
once or twice.

634
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,200
And why would I wipe the poison
clean, but leave my
prints on the teapot?

635
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,440
Not to mention hiding the
poison under my bed.

636
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,040
Maybe you're too smart
for your own good.

637
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,960
If you'd wiped the pot, that
would point to you.

638
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,760
Maybe you just didn't have time
to hide the poison.

639
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,720
It was Megan, John.

640
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Why didn't you go to the cops?

641
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,280
What, and tell them that Megan
was obsessed and that she
smirked at me as I
was led away?

642
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,880
Why not?

643
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
You're forgetting what it's
like to be a teenager.

644
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,400
Adults telling you what to do,
having opinion about what you
say, before you even say it.

645
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,120
There's no Mousey, Anna. What?

646
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,200
What are you talking about?

647
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,720
There's no Megan at the school.

648
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,360
Oh, you don't believe me?
Do you blame me?

649
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,480
Megan transferred in during the
second semester and left right
after I got expelled.

650
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,840
You know, who the hell do
you think I am?

651
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,240
Please tell me, John!

652
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,920
What... what, you think I'm
some psychopath?

653
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,520
What? This is the second day in
a row you've called me a liar!

654
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,120
I want to know why you're
suddenly turning on me!

655
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,880
Here! My yearbook!

656
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,320
Asshole.

657
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,320
You won't mind if I hang on to
this for a couple of days?

658
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,960
Sleep with it under your
pillow, for all I care.

659
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,720
We don't have much time.

660
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,240
I want you to think about all
the key moments in your
life by tomorrow.

661
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,880
Can you do that for me?

662
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,120
Fine.

663
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,040
John...

664
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
John, Why don't you help me?

665
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,160
Why don't you wanna help me?

666
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,680
Mom!

667
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,480
This old man,
he played three.

668
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,240
He played
knick-knack on my knee.

669
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,160
With a knick-knack
paddy whack...

670
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,520
give a dog a bone, this old...

671
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,840
Who's there?

672
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,560
Anna?

673
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,320
Anna!

674
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,760
Hello?

675
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,600
Hey!

676
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,880
Wait!

677
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,360
Wait!

678
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,040
Is there somewhere I
can freshen up?

679
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,040
There's a bathroom just down
that corridor on your left.

680
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,560
Oh, thank you.

681
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,000
What are you doing in here?

682
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,480
Maybe I'm looking for the
guy from last night.

683
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,240
You know, Mr. Greene, it really
isn't necessary to
have me followed.

684
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,360
I had you extensively looked
into before you were hired.

685
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,880
I don't have anyone
following you now.

686
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,400
And now, if you'd be so kind,
your work in this
house is upstairs.

687
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,200
Very nice, Anna.

688
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,640
Not just yet.

689
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,680
Glad you're back from
zombie land.

690
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,160
You okay, want some water?

691
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,240
Aren't they great? Better than
what you had before.

692
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,960
How did you do that?

693
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,120
I just downloaded it.

694
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,320
No, how did you leave me
alone in the memory?

695
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,440
I don't know.

696
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,720
Suddenly I was back here, and
our hands were separated, but
you were still under.

697
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,080
I wasn't sure what to do.

698
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,880
You looked cute while you
were sleeping.

699
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,200
Anna, do you know what
transference is?

700
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,720
I do.

701
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,760
Then you'll know it's
perfectly natural to...

702
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,280
To what? Have strong feelings
for your therapist?

703
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,240
I just simply said I liked
watching you sleep.

704
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,320
Your teacher was a lot older
than you, he took advantage.

705
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,320
He was encouraging... that
place was so depressing.

706
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,240
What about the photos?

707
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,800
He said they were for art, and
at first they were artistic.

708
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,680
You okay? You don't
look too good.

709
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm having trouble
staying grounded.

710
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,480
Side-effects from the sessions?
Hallucinations?

711
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,800
Yeah... terrible headaches.

712
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,000
I can't sleep... nightmares.

713
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,560
Plus the guy they've hired
to follow me...

714
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,480
he's... he is everywhere I go.

715
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,960
Maybe events have made this
case far bigger than you were
ready for when you started.

716
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,960
Maybe we should ask
Lundgren to take over.

717
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,040
No! No way, no. I
can handle it.

718
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,640
Did you ever treat Anna
at their house?

719
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,920
No.

720
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,000
Did you ever have reason to
suspect abuse
within the family?

721
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,480
Nothing with the stepfather?

722
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,160
Highly unlikely. I mean, look,
Robert's a prominent guy.

723
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,360
I wouldn't go down that road
based on a hunch.

724
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,080
Tom Ortega told me Anna's
parents set him up for...

725
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,720
You went to see Tom Ortega?

726
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,400
That lowlife took dirty
pictures of Anna.

727
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,440
You should be focusing on the
sessions, not investigating
in the real world.

728
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,120
You need to be objective, John.

729
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,920
There is something going on
there behind the scenes...

730
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,520
I need to find out what it is.

731
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,720
You need to consider that this
job is too big and
too complex...

732
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,040
and that you are becoming too
personally involved.

733
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,920
Whatever it is, I'm gonna
find out the truth.

734
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,760
Do you know where
you want to go?

735
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,360
I went through all the photos
and one of them made me
feel something.

736
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,520
Don't tell me.

737
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,880
Don't corrupt the memory,
just go there.

738
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,880
When you're ready,
close your eyes.

739
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,720
Let's begin... now.

740
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,920
My parents brought him to me.
Who?

741
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,520
I don't remember his name.

742
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,800
This old man, he played three.

743
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,640
He played
knick-knack on my knee.

744
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,800
With a knick-knack paddy whack,
give a dog a bone.

745
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,800
This old man came rolling home.

746
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,400
What are you doing over there,
Anna?

747
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,760
Why don't you come here...
next to me.

748
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,920
Come here, sweetheart.

749
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,280
Don't be afraid.

750
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,960
I won't hurt you.

751
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,120
And coming back... now!

752
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,200
Anna?

753
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,800
Anna, can you hear me?

754
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,080
You're okay, you fainted.

755
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,280
What happened?

756
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,640
Can you get some water.
She's okay.

757
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,160
Yeah, sure.

758
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,560
Take this.

759
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,560
What is it?

760
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,720
It's a bit of one of your mom's
sedatives. It'll
help you sleep.

761
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,640
So, what happens now?

762
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,800
Now... you get better.

763
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,360
This is the key to the house my
parents lived in
when I was born.

764
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,160
I always felt safe there.

765
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,880
So many times in my life
people have been unkind.

766
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,600
I can't thank you enough, John.

767
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,360
Will you keep this with
you at all times?

768
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,360
If I know you have it, then at
least I know that there's
someone out there...

769
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,960
who's on my side.

770
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,120
I might not be going to
an institution...

771
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,880
but I still feel trapped.

772
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,400
Sure.

773
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,520
Hey! Hey!

774
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,320
John? What are you doing here?

775
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,040
You should have called, I've
got dinner guests.

776
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,800
Why Sebastian?

777
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,840
Christ! She was just a child.

778
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,000
What's going on? You've
been drinking?

779
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,840
These were in Anna's memories.

780
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,960
Have you been in my office?

781
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,920
I've seen you with her, in the
library, in one of
the memories.

782
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,160
Oh, I might have been there
once, I forgot!

783
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,000
What's this all about?

784
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,440
You said you never treated her
at the house, but
you were there!

785
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,760
Are you trying to say I did
something to her?

786
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,680
Think this through, John.

787
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,680
Why would I ask you to take on
a case, if I was guilty
of something?

788
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,800
Think about what it is you're
accusing me of...

789
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,560
then, think about who it is
you're accusing.

790
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,480
They wanted to hire
Peter Lundgren.

791
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,520
You brought me in, because I
was down, and I was weak...

792
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,480
and I was easy to manipulate.
Right?

793
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,840
And you wouldn't let me see
that file until you
absolutely had to.

794
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,920
You said they didn't want me to
see it, but you had it
the whole time!

795
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,040
I never told you I didn't
have the file!

796
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,080
I said the family
wanted privacy.

797
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,640
What about the other day? Ah?
You wanted me to drop the case.

798
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,160
I said that because...

799
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,640
Now... I know what you didn't
want me to find out.

800
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,040
I said that because I was
worried about you!

801
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,360
Oh, c'mon, John!

802
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,200
You've been drinking alone.
Having hallucinations for days!

803
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,440
You're ignoring me again,
Uncle Sebastian

804
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,960
Hi, sweetheart.

805
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,640
Sorry. John...

806
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,040
Don't you ever go near Anna
again! You hear me?

807
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,840
John!

808
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,400
Due to Anna's
early overt sexualization...

809
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,000
she has a need for control...

810
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,440
which manifests itself in a
variety of disorders.

811
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,920
She has... significant
difficulty...

812
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,560
in forming and maintaining
long-term
relationships with others.

813
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,800
Basically, she has developed a
protective shell...

814
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,240
Do you like it? which keeps
out the pain...

815
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,760
and keeps out everything else.
It's great.

816
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,240
She interacts with the world in
a completely different way
than the way we do.

817
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,320
Locking her up is the worst
possible thing you could do.

818
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,800
Thank you so much, Mr.
Washington.

819
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,760
Good luck.

820
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,200
<i>It's not your fault, John.</i>

821
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,920
<i>This person...</i>
<i>they lied about everything.</i>

822
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,520
<i>But just because the lies are</i>
<i>shocking and they attract a</i>
<i>lot of attention...</i>

823
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,120
it doesn't necessarily
make them true.

824
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,400
It was very important
for us to...

825
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,880
<i>to check the facts and to</i>
<i>question the facts...</i>

826
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,120
until it was evident that
I was innocent.

827
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,000
<i>And once we've proven my</i>
<i>innocence, we went back</i>
<i>to that proof...</i>

828
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,280
<i>over and over again, and looked</i>
<i>at it with a fresh set of eyes.</i>

829
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,480
<i>Because only then, were we able</i>
<i>to actually see the truth.</i>

830
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,880
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

831
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,560
How does it
feel to be designated?

832
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,280
<i>That's a good question...</i>

833
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,760
<i>and I just want to thank my</i>
<i>constituency...</i>

834
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,120
I just
downloaded it.

835
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,760
Aren't they great? Better than
what you had before.

836
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,680
Hello?
<i>Can you come over?</i>

837
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,840
I need to see you, John.

838
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,960
Anna, look, I need to talk to...

839
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,840
Before it's too late!

840
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,760
<i>Something terrible has</i>
<i>happened and I need to...</i>

841
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,920
What? Hello?

842
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,160
Hello?

843
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,920
<i>You have reached the Greene's residence.</i>

844
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,960
<i>Please leave a message and</i>
<i>we'll get back to you as</i>
<i>soon as we can.</i>

845
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,520
Hello?

846
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,520
Anna?
<i>John.</i>

847
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
Hey!

848
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,200
Open the door!

849
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,240
<i>John, there's someone in our house!</i>

850
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,440
Shit!

851
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,720
Mom? Mom?

852
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,960
Hello?

853
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,040
<i>Wh... emergency...</i>

854
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,160
Hello, can you hear me?

855
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,800
Shit.

856
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,280
- I
- don't want to die!

857
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:02,280
Hey! Hey! Open the
goddamn door!

858
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,200
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

859
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,400
I'm at 1103 Bayside.

860
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,560
I have an intruder and a
serious assault.

861
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,160
Okay, that's right.

862
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,160
We already have multiple units
responding to that address,
sir.

863
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,040
Anna!

864
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,400
Wait!

865
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,800
Anna!

866
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,840
John.

867
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,120
Anna! You okay? You hurt?

868
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,960
Look, we're being followed...

869
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,320
but the police are here, you
stay with me you're gonna
be safe. Okay?

870
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,440
I'm sorry.

871
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,080
What?

872
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,200
There's something over there!

873
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,120
Hey! Hey!

874
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,720
Over here!

875
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,400
Hey! Stop!
Stop!

876
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,320
Hey! Somebody's broken into
the Greene's house!

877
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,800
Police! I'm pretty su...

878
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,480
Stay where you are! Stay
right where you are!

879
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:49,000
Hands up, Mr. Washington! Hands
up, Mr. Washington!

880
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,400
You're
suspected of murder, Mr.
Washington.

881
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,880
We found hundreds of pictures
featuring underage girls...

882
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,480
in your computer.

883
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,920
She set me up.

884
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:35,520
A 16 year-old girl.

885
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,520
Look. We know the parents were
constantly threatening to send
the girl to an institution...

886
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,720
and that you... strongly
disagreed with that.

887
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,800
So the way I see it, you got
too close to the girl.

888
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,200
You drugged the parents, so you
could take her away...

889
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,160
but she refused to go and you
end up doing something you'd
never think you
were capable of.

890
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,880
The parents are okay?

891
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,840
Yeah... we found the mother's
sleeping pills in the kitchen,
John.

892
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,680
And I'd be willing to bet that
your fingerprints are all over
that prescription bottle.

893
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:07,240
We found a letter opener,
covered in blood...

894
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,440
in the forest, where you were.

895
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,040
I can explain every peace of
evidence you think you have.

896
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:18,240
We're carefully going through
the tapes of you chasing Anna.

897
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,080
Now obviously you disabled a
number of the cameras...

898
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,600
and then turned the power off
to cover your tracks.

899
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,760
I was locked inside the
surveillance room!

900
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,120
Recognize this?

901
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,480
Anna gave me that.

902
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,520
It's the key to the
surveillance room.

903
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,280
You panicked, needed an alibi...

904
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,560
so you damaged the interior of
the door, but you forgot...

905
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,040
that you had the key
in your pocket.

906
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,520
Do the right thing, John...

907
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,360
and tell me what you did
with the girl.

908
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,920
I went to the house, I was
looking for her.

909
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,240
And you got locked in the
surveillance room.

910
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,000
Exactly. And when I got out,
it was too late.

911
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,760
And there was blood on the
floor in the hallway, I
followed the trail
to the forest!

912
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,880
And that's how you got the
blood on your shoes? Yes.

913
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,560
By following the trail of blood
from a 16 year-old... in a
massive forest.

914
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:25,880
Yes, and... she came
out of nowhere.

915
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,960
She... she grabbed my hands, my
hands had blood on them.

916
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,240
She ran away.

917
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,920
And was this before or after
she called 911 on her cell...

918
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,920
screaming and crying that you
were chasing her through the
house, trying to kill her?

919
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,120
There is plenty of evidence
to convict you.

920
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,960
There was someone else there.

921
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,600
You're gonna die in jail.

922
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,320
And coming back... now.

923
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,920
<i>End of move, end of move!</i>

924
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,560
Okay, that's it.

925
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,400
We visited all the necessary
memories together...

926
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:50,160
through every aspect of your
involvement in Anna's case.

927
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,800
I should have realized
what she was doing.

928
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,960
It's not your fault, John.

929
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,240
Anna was able to study our
protocols during your
time with her...

930
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,880
and she eventually became
strong enough to control and
manipulate the sessions.

931
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:08,040
She was even able to figure out
that water triggered the
memories of your
wife's suicide.

932
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,360
She needed you to be
responsible for her death.

933
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:15,000
If she just ran away, her
parents would just keep
searching for her.

934
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,560
Did you find anything?

935
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,560
I'll submit our sessions
to the judge...

936
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,680
specifically highlighting the
time you were locked in the
surveillance room...

937
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,760
and when you spoke to her
in the forest...

938
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,520
but as you know, our sessions
don't yet carry the
same weight...

939
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,920
as eye witness
testimony in court.

940
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,280
The only irrefutable evidence
you could have is proving
Anna's still out there...

941
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,080
but... that's something
beyond my capabilities.

942
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,520
Mr. Lundgren?

943
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,560
I'm so sorry.

944
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,360
I don't know how she made
me believe her.

945
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,760
She had me completely fooled.

946
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,360
It's all good, John.

947
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,200
You've been under a lot of
pressure lately.

948
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,920
Thank you.

949
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,880
The judge is gonna consider
Peter's testimony for sure...

950
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,960
but since you both work
for Mindscape...

951
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,800
there are some legal issues we
need to get over and
that'll take time.

952
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,000
I know.

953
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,280
Now... the sooner you get rid
of the house the better.

954
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,360
It won't take long before the
bail will be granted.

955
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,520
But don't worry, John,
you're not alone.

956
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,480
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to help you get
clear of this.

957
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,320
And you just
want to send a single rose?

958
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,600
A single rose and...
this photograph.

959
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,480
Would you be so kind as to
remove all the thorns,
before sending it over?

960
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,200
You can count on it, yeah.

961
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,640
<i>The funny thing about memory...</i>

962
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,240
is that it can't be fully trusted.

963
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:15,800
<i>And yet, in the end, it's the</i>
<i>only truth we have.</i>

964
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,800
<i>And no matter how painful it is,</i>
<i>you gotta look at the truth...</i>

965
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,080
because sometimes...

966
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,040
it's the only thing
that can save you.

967
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,320
It's the only thing...

968
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,320
that can set you free.

969
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,120
I just thought I'd...

970
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,560
try to come up so you
could say no.

971
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,160
Come in.
