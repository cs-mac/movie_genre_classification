00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,734
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most Merciful

3
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:26,368
From Muhammad, the Messenger of God
to Heraclius,

4
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:31,303
the emperor of Byzantium, greetings to him
who is the follower of righteous guys

5
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:34,438
I bid you to hear the divine call

6
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:42,142
I am the messenger of God to the people,
accept Islam for yourself

7
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,042
He speaks of the new prophet in Arabia

8
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,443
Was it like this when John, the Baptist

9
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:54,198
came to king Hsrul out of the desert crying of salvation

10
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:21,611
To Mephocus, Patriarch of Alexandria

11
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:39,394
Kisra, emperor of Persia
Muhammad calls you with the call of God

12
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:45,095
accept Islam for your salvation
Embrace Islam

13
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:53,590
You come out of the desert, smelling of camel and goat
You stand as Persia kneel?

14
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:07,371
Muhammad, Messenger of God
Who gave him this authority?

15
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,591
God sent Muhammad as
a message to mankind

16
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,125
The Scholars and Historians of Islam -
The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo,

17
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:16,361
The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon
Have approved the accuracy and fidelity of this film

18
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,029
The makers of this film honour the Islamic Tradition

19
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,395
which holds that the Impersonation of the Prophet

20
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:25,564
offends againts the spirituality of his message

21
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:37,172
Therefore, the person of Muhammad
will not be shown

22
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:45,104
600 years after Christ died,

23
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,438
when Europe was sunk in the dark ages
and everywhere

24
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,241
the old civilizations were falling,
Muhammad was born in Mecca in Arabia

25
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:59,810
Mecca was then a rich trading city
ruled by its merchants

26
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:05,374
whose wealth was multiplied by a
unique privilege They housed the gods

27
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,580
Every year, at the time of the great fair,
the desert priests brought their idols

28
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,460
and the images of their gods into the custody of Kabbaah

29
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:49,894
Months, the most holyish reign of Abraham,
the Kabbaah has now

30
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:57,222
become a house of idology hosting
no fewer than 360 different gods

31
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:02,024
Mecca in 610 AD

32
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,198
Bilal!

33
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Have the other days counted Umaya?

34
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,948
Not yet But this year the Gods are gold

35
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,182
When you put the Gods and Prophet together,
its a pretty bit deal

36
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:57,041
Oh, more Gods in the place of Kabbaah

37
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,173
Caravans from Syria

38
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,907
mm They must be in running Very thirsty

39
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,655
Put 5 more men in North Wells

40
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,356
How many sheeps will I have to kill for them? 70?

41
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:15,657
Give them a 100

42
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,991
Macca should keep her name
for hospitality

43
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:22,451
And 10 lambs for the leaders

44
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,530
Bread and water, do the poets have in the Hakim's house

45
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:39,889
Where verse and prose are nightly
put to slaughter

46
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:49,325
And and the bread, I swear in there,
is thinner than the water

47
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:54,437
Oh, open the space Open the space,
you lovers of poetry

48
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:57,338
to Abu Sufian, willing and which

49
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,873
patron of the art

50
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:08,176
When Abu Sufian invites the poet in, there joy is
kids and love is kin

51
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:12,110
where wines and cakes abound
the skills of Abu Sufian

52
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:21,714
All revels and all songs begin
when Abu Sufian invites the poet in

53
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:37,919
Roman silk, worms of China, my lady,

54
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:46,784
a pleasure to the lin, and as my lady can see,
ravish to the eyes

55
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,784
Yes 7 lengths
20 dinars

56
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:58,347
Abu Sufian's wife? 15!

57
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:24,569
Oh, gold!
the gods of the Kabbaah have their needs

58
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,924
They are Acives

59
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,532
Who is that man who stood there,
who looked into my soul?

60
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,459
Cut me away from here

61
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,145
Why did Muhammad come down here?

62
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,146
Why don't you stop him?

63
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:55,179
He is your nephew

64
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,514
Maybe he will change!

65
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,163
Change?

66
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,584
He is 40 years old
Its unnatural, with a rich wife he could afford the best of Mecca

67
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,118
If he chooses to sit shivering in a cave,

68
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,985
it is unnatural

69
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:14,753
For a man who dares to risk the anger of

70
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:21,512
Lath-Uzza, who keeps our health,
Mannat, the god of our prosperity,

71
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:29,592
Allot, the god of our family and tribes
and Hubar,

72
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:32,525
Hubar, who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate

73
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,327
To challenge the gods within a year
sort of the gods is dangerous

74
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,461
Unreasonable

75
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,762
Rebellious, blasphemous

76
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:45,725
Yes, I'm afraid Muhammad will harm himself

77
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,169
I am always sad
when the great fair is over

78
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,424
I might not see the next one

79
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,560
Abu Talib! Abu Talib!

80
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,507
Catch your breath, Zaid!

81
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:18,142
Has Muhammad come down from the mountain yet?

82
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,741
He's been there for 3 days

83
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:24,444
No No, I haven't seen him

84
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,978
Khadija hoped he might have come to you
on his way home

85
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,812
Maybe he's still up there

86
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:34,465
3 days

87
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:45,645
I'm afraid for him on the mountain
because I don't know what it means

88
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:51,577
Men see the world too well from a mountain

89
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:28,150
Muhammad! Read!

90
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,435
In the name of the Lord who created
man from his sensitive drop of blood

91
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:37,169
teaches man what he knows not

92
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,457
Read!

93
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:24,386
He's still trembling under the blanket, but he has spoken

94
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:29,779
Zaid! What happened to my nephew on the mountain?

95
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:42,189
He was alone in the cave
Suddenly an angel came on to him,

96
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,527
The angel said: Read!
Muhammad replied: I can not read

97
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:56,830
The angle commanded again: Read!

98
00:14:56,831 --> 00:15:02,100
In the name of our Lord
who created man from his sensitive drop of blood

99
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:08,101
who teaches man what he knows not: Read!

100
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:12,802
Who knows if it was Gabriel!

101
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:17,797
It could have been a dream

102
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:22,406
When Muhammad was coming from the mountain
He saw Gabriel cleanly

103
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,874
in the shape of a man
standing on the horizon

104
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:31,542
Wherever he looked, upon every turn of his head
he saw him

105
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:47,656
Gabriel said to him again: I am Gabriel and
you Muhammad are the Messenger of God

106
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,751
Who has he told about this?

107
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,784
His Wife

108
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,651
and Ali

109
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:02,253
And his friend Abu Bakr

110
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,887
And you?

111
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:07,449
I am his adopted son

112
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,380
Be careful to whom you talk

113
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:19,326
Tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child will protect him still

114
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:23,794
After all, they say the God of Moses

115
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:28,846
spoke to him under the burning bush

116
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,832
If you do not restrain your nephew, then we will

117
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,466
He's dividing the city, heart against hopes
He's dividing the generations,

118
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,401
child against parent

119
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:48,568
The young are listening to him, he attract the yound

120
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:56,265
We are Arabs We obey our fathers
Our children cannot be our teachers

121
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:59,106
How can we accept that
the man we met in the street yesterday

122
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:02,908
can be some God's Prophet today?

123
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:06,409
Dead ones can live again, he says

124
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,877
because he who created man

125
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:12,412
can also make man return from the dead, he says

126
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:17,305
The Gods might leave us and
give their benefits to another city

127
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:28,651
Tell him we will give him authority, position,
and key to the Kabbaah,

128
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,674
and money what money he wants

129
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,108
Tell him we will give him anything he wants

130
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:06,229
Muhammad, spare yourself and me

131
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,123
Do not put a great burden on
an old man who can't bear

132
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,267
In your childhood, you were in my arms,

133
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:26,372
I cannot see you hurt
If you refuse them, they will hurt you

134
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:41,875
He said this to me:

135
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:47,541
Were they to put sun in my right hand
and the moon in my left

136
00:18:48,112 --> 00:18:53,106
I would not renounce my message
which is from God

137
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,749
When I am dead, you may do as you please

138
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,982
but last time in your life,
you will believe your father

139
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,783
Why did you hurt your father?

140
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:11,586
If I'd be drunk every day and played dice
every night, you'd call it high spirits

141
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:13,486
You'll be more my brother than you are now

142
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,013
You are all my children

143
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:29,558
I give you everything I could, but it seems
not to be enough

144
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:34,961
Muhammad gives me more, he give all the world more

145
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:37,816
Get him out of here father!

146
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,266
Its not worth it He's our father

147
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:55,122
You torture him

148
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,530
Wait Hudaifa, wait

149
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,640
How can they say its an invention, Musab

150
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:13,942
when it isn't new?

151
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:16,209
In Mecca it's new

152
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,239
If God has said it all before, to Noah, Moses, Jesus, to all of Prophets,
but people changed it, turned it, forgot it

153
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:34,610
Now God said it to Muhammad again,
and it is new again

154
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,139
What is it?

155
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:40,602
It Jafar

156
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,671
What have you brought with you?

157
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,074
The very word of God

158
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,128
When the sun is overthrown

159
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,795
when the stars fall

160
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:14,629
when the mountains vanish

161
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:18,864
when the camels bid with yound abandoned

162
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,898
When the wild beasts are herded together

163
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,799
when the seas rise

164
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,633
When the souls are sorted

165
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:32,502
when the female infant who is buried alive

166
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,636
asks for what crime she was killed

167
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:37,871
when the books are opened

168
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:41,139
when the sky is torn away,

169
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:48,842
then every soul will know what it has done

170
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:56,430
You were there Jafar when God
gave him these words?

171
00:22:10,183 --> 00:22:12,434
Dawn is coming up

172
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:25,848
Ammar you first, then you Jafar

173
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:29,509
Ammar, you keep your mother awake
all night with worry

174
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,709
I am sorry father

175
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,144
Where were you?

176
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:34,739
Have you been with Muhammad again?

177
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:40,201
What will happen now?

178
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,615
Forgive him It was my fault, I did it

179
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:49,082
That God has helped us all our lives

180
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:53,817
If it fell, it could not help itself

181
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:56,419
What talks have you been listening to?

182
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:03,454
The real god is unseen,
he's not made of clay

183
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:10,456
Ammar, we see the Gods in the Kabbaah every day

184
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:14,109
I am afraid for you

185
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,379
You are listening to people who will hurt you

186
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:21,661
I'm listening to Muhammad, mother

187
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:26,397
Muhammad is generous, yes He gives, he shares,

188
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:32,894
he pass no man without a smile,
but he is spreading dangerous ideas

189
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:36,550
Dangerous ideas that no man should start

190
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,301
that the rich should not afload the poor,

191
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:45,012
the strong should not oppress the weak
Are these dangerous ideas?

192
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,970
Girls should not be forced into marriage,

193
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,257
but be able to choose or refuse

194
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:54,306
But only tonight, he said to stop

195
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:56,831
the burial of new-born girls

196
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:02,435
I was fortunate, always fortunate with your mother

197
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:08,869
Yes, but you know that you and I nearly never met Yassar

198
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:12,836
and you were nearly never born

199
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,381
I was to be buried
like my 2 sisters

200
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:24,877
but my father couldnt' do it
He couldn't do it at that time

201
00:25:29,018 --> 00:25:31,873
When the second girl was buried,

202
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:38,683
when my father was putting sand over her,

203
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:47,225
finger raised him as do babies,
told her mother afterwards

204
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:54,394
she took hold of his finger the way baby does
He told my mother afterwards, that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased

205
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:59,445
and he had taken away his hand

206
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:07,731
When I was born, my father ran out of the house

207
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,066
screaming that he couldn't do it again,

208
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,149
that he could never do it again

209
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:17,268
Sumaya, it is the custom

210
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:24,938
But it is wrong
The Gods that let such things be are no Gods

211
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:29,772
I promised to go to Muhammad's house mama
and pray there

212
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:34,164
Yes! He is a good man

213
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:43,262
Yes, yes, you go

214
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:02,033
Two men are following him

215
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:05,418
Read?
Muhammad can neither write nor read

216
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:06,619
Muhammad can speak

217
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,886
What did you say?

218
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:15,622
He can speak? Well, so can you
So now, you speak up yound man

219
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:17,789
What does Muhammad say umm?

220
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,510
They are God's words, not his

221
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:30,223
Which god's? What words?
A speaking god?

222
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:35,352
Your Muhammad speaks only to himself

223
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,764
When god reveals his message to Muhammad,

224
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,265
he remembers every word and
then he tells it to those who can write

225
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:44,132
It is the Qur'an

226
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:51,034
Muhammad has starved himself into dreams,
he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut

227
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,835
His eyes are shut but his heart is open

228
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:56,869
You! kick him for his cleverness

229
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,326
There, is no need for hasts

230
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:06,072
Doesn't Muhammad realize that we live by housing
to the Gods?

231
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:08,240
We own the Kabbaah

232
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:14,703
Every year, the tribes of Arabia come here
to Mecca to pray and to buy from us

233
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:19,745
Now, were we to replace 300
gods with just one?

234
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:23,812
whom we cannot even see, was supposed to be in Taif and Medina,

235
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:28,636
here in my house, in Jerusalem, on the moon?

236
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,570
Where would Mecca be then?

237
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,350
The gods are both our vision and our revenue

238
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,585
You cannot buy and sell God

239
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,786
Young man, you are close to be whipped

240
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:47,655
Ammar, be sensible boy

241
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,221
I have a question

242
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:55,251
Muhammad teaches you,
a slave is equal to his master

243
00:28:56,924 --> 00:28:59,924
This black Bilal, I paid money for is equal to me?

244
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:07,787
Yes Muhammad says before God all
men are equal as the teeth of a gum

245
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:13,984
This is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars
It gives them pretensions

246
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:23,300
Bilal! Teach this man the difference between the Lord of Mecca and a slave
Take that whip

247
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:31,402
Lash his face to teach an enormous lesson

248
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:41,673
Whip him! Whip him!

249
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:43,892
Cut him!

250
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,458
Whip him!

251
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:58,395
Do it Bilal!

252
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:13,708
Obey them! They will kill you!

253
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,468
So you want anarchy to bring

254
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,035
They even infected our slaves

255
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:30,290
If you're human enough to have gods,
remember that there are gods for your owner

256
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:34,750
I bought humanity Bilal
when I bought you

257
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:38,475
You will be corrected

258
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:54,165
One, one god

259
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:58,200
There is only one God

260
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:04,034
Who is stronger now, your master
or this one god of yours?

261
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:10,304
One god There is only one God

262
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:12,271
Bring the stones

263
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:20,741
One god, One god! One god!

264
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:30,982
Crush him!

265
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,708
Are you finished with him?

266
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:50,818
There is only one God!

267
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:55,039
You could swear the slave was preaching!

268
00:31:55,554 --> 00:31:57,510
Lord Umaya!

269
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:06,590
Abu Bakr will pay 100 dinars for this slave

270
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,290
Wait now!

271
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,958
It's against our social order
to sell a slave during his punishment

272
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:14,609
The offer is to Lord Umaya!

273
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:24,961
If the price of slaves is raised,
we shall have to pay ourselves next year

274
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:37,398
Take him He is no use to me anymore
Kill him or take him more I'm finished with him

275
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:43,402
We are declaring ourselves

276
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:47,104
God has told his messenger to declare Islam to all men

277
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:48,904
Open the windows!

278
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:51,759
Let the world hear

279
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:58,494
We are coming out of the darkness

280
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:16,281
Hear well the word of God
Hear well the messenger of Lord

281
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:23,884
There are no other Gods, but God and Muhammad is his messenger
We have come into light, join us on the way to the Kabbah

282
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:29,085
God is most great, God is most great!

283
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:34,121
God has no partner, we have come into light

284
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:39,002
Join us on the way to Kabbah

285
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:52,827
Muhammad and his rebellion called Islam
are coming out

286
00:33:52,828 --> 00:33:56,329
to fall our gods
and de-throw our religion

287
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,095
Don't let them reach the Kabbaah

288
00:33:58,096 --> 00:34:02,919
Throw them back! Defend your gods

289
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:23,938
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

290
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:37,089
Protect the prophet!
There is no gods but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God

291
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:50,405
Guards!

292
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,949
God is great!

293
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,583
Blasphemy! ldiot!

294
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:05,146
God is great!

295
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:32,180
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

296
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,021
Now's the time to break them,
there are only 30 of them

297
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:48,733
No! we've done enough
More will only create sympathy for them

298
00:35:49,202 --> 00:36:08,228
God is great!

299
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:13,310
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

300
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:18,611
say: O you who reject faith
I worship not other

301
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:20,397
Get out of Kabbaah!

302
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,304
Silence, you'r a false prophet! Stop!

303
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:29,331
Back to the corner!

304
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:46,573
Hamza! Hamza!

305
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,163
You are brave

306
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,741
He is the bravest man in the desert
and he meets men unarmed

307
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,309
Muhammad is a liar

308
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,565
Liar? If you don't let him speak!

309
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:56,246
Where's the lie and where's the truth
when it hasn't been spoken yet?

310
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:58,930
Muhammad is a fraud

311
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:03,106
Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!

312
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:14,710
I affirm my nephew's religion
and I say what he says

313
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:19,672
Who ever has the courage to fight,
to fight with me!

314
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:58,769
Muhammed, when I hunt the desert at night,
I know that God is not kept in a house

315
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:13,138
Who'd have thought that Hamza, Hamza above all,
with his wine drinking, lion hunting

316
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,607
will come to join Muhammad?

317
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:21,330
More we attack, more seem to join him

318
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:24,142
Where does he find his words?

319
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:27,465
I don't know

320
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:31,045
How can an illiterate man go up on a mountain

321
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:36,780
and come back 3 days later blazing with poetry?

322
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:43,643
It wasn't just only poetry, he says it's God's

323
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:49,919
How do we fight someone
whose strength we do not understand?

324
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,287
Muhammad promises heaven, trees in the skies
It's natural he found audience

325
00:39:56,288 --> 00:40:00,155
Then we must make that audience
less eager to listen to him

326
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:04,137
We will begin with the weaker ones

327
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:44,737
Have mercy!

328
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:47,024
Left hand!

329
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,754
Who is your God? Answer me!

330
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,222
Say it! Say who is your God?

331
00:41:35,223 --> 00:41:36,155
Say it!

332
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:43,688
There is only one God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

333
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,582
Ammar!

334
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:57,404
Your father and mother are the first martyrs of Islam

335
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:00,772
You are promised Paradise

336
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:22,706
How much are you men prepared to suffer?

337
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:27,304
The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca

338
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:33,650
If we stay, they will kill you
One by one

339
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:35,752
Mohamed says in Abinisia, there is a Christian King

340
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:40,326
No man is wronged in his country

341
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,908
We must leave now, today

342
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:23,976
Usman!

343
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,570
Lord is great

344
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,542
Let us go

345
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:14,394
We found their tracks and followed them

346
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:16,886
But they just disappeared

347
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:22,931
They were there, in the desert, under the vultures
And you let them escape you

348
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:26,389
Escape? They vanished!

349
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:29,533
If Muhammed has stayed, then only the weakest are gone

350
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:32,583
Weak or strong, they blacken our name

351
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:35,069
We are honest merchants,  we buy and sell in good faith

352
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,026
We cannot afford scandal

353
00:48:41,738 --> 00:48:42,504
Amr!

354
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,971
You are a friend of Najjasi, the king?

355
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:46,238
Yes

356
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,821
can you use that friendship?

357
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:52,908
I think I can bring them back

358
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:55,684
Yes

359
00:48:57,577 --> 00:48:58,310
Abisinia...

360
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,960
Rise up Amr

361
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:07,867
Please, nothing you may ask for that we will not give

362
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:14,003
Lion of Judah, I.. I don't know where to begin

363
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:19,203
you have our friendship, begin there

364
00:49:19,985 --> 00:49:24,052
certain run-away slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom

365
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:29,520
Slaves go back
or you agree to return your slaves back to us

366
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:33,343
there are however some free men among them

367
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,390
Rebels

368
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,141
Rebels?

369
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:40,057
If there are disagreements in Arabia,
why am I not informed?

370
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:43,141
They are rebels in religion

371
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:47,127
at one time are another
all religions were rebellions

372
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:51,628
The bodies of slaves of the world
if bidden are in-disposed

373
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:57,698
But as Jesus Christ as a shepherd,
the souls of men are his sheep

374
00:49:57,699 --> 00:50:01,398
These are Arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers

375
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:05,967
they follow a lunatic they call.. Prophet

376
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:10,598
But I cannot put souls into chains
without hearing them

377
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:07,448
good, they'r stiff.
Next they will hang them

378
00:51:13,158 --> 00:51:15,424
Do you not now yourself before your prophet?

379
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:20,092
Muhammad is a man,
We kneel only to God

380
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:23,393
Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?

381
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:27,295
If he were a prophet,
he'd lit the sky with miracles

382
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:34,965
indeed, this is true.
God has given his prophets signs of miracles that we may recognize them

383
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,665
The miracle of Muhammad is the Holy Qur'an

384
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:44,301
A book! A book! Written by an illiterate
attributed to God

385
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,635
I think the emperor's heard enough

386
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,603
A mind full of pedicast

387
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:53,071
When God set down
tons of fire upon the heads of christ of puzzles

388
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:57,639
so that they can speak the many languages of the world
that they knew not before

389
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,294
But do such miracles happen in our time..

390
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:09,165
I've heard enough. You've made a poor case

391
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,348
When we suffered persecution in Mecca,

392
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,081
Muhammad told us go to Abyssinia

393
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:24,816
the land of the righteous king,
where no man is wronged

394
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:27,483
What they call persecution was fair punishment,

395
00:52:27,484 --> 00:52:29,084
that is order...

396
00:52:29,085 --> 00:52:30,950
Why did your prophet send you to me?

397
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:33,785
Because you believe in the book of the one God as we do.

398
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:37,286
He sent us because
in your heart God will protect us

399
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,687
Talking with him is like
drawing water from a mirage

400
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:45,375
But now, they'd let the judy on me listen to them, my friend.

401
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:55,440
Go on!

402
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:03,996
For years, we worshiped wood and stone,
images of our own manufacture

403
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:07,297
we lived in ignorance of God

404
00:53:07,298 --> 00:53:11,698
we had some earthly laws
and no heavenly laws. The rich neglect the poor.

405
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:14,499
And the natural pity of man

406
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:18,001
thereby lifts up when his brother has fallen

407
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:23,326
This is described by them as upsetting
social order

408
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:35,144
To this inhumanity has come a man
whom god chose and in that we believe

409
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:52,579
You've overcome. I beg you to collect yourself.
I speak of the messenger of god. Muhammad teaches us to worship one god,

410
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,548
to speak truth
to love our neighbors as ourselves,

411
00:53:57,549 --> 00:54:01,949
to give charity, even a smile can be charity

412
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:07,018
to protect women from misuse,
to shelter orphans

413
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:12,886
and to turn away from gods of Wood and stone

414
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:16,154
I cannot be still and hear this blasphemy

415
00:54:16,155 --> 00:54:18,988
We are an ancient civilization,
to call our gods wood and stone

416
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:23,557
is to speak ignorantly of them

417
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:30,452
The idol we home is not what we worship,
but the spirit that resides within the form

418
00:54:31,794 --> 00:54:36,253
I agree that idolatry is
not always fully understood Thank you

419
00:54:40,397 --> 00:54:43,286
Now, let me bring him back to the women

420
00:54:44,765 --> 00:54:46,865
God made woman to be the proper companion of man

421
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,533
she is different but equal

422
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:54,068
Equal? We buy them,
feed them, perl them,

423
00:54:54,069 --> 00:55:00,087
use them, distorb them,
women equal to us?

424
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:09,993
God created man from one male and one female

425
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:15,535
Amr, you must respect the woman's womb that bore you

426
00:55:16,509 --> 00:55:18,476
Why are you 300 guards so tongue-tied?

427
00:55:18,477 --> 00:55:22,493
what is only god is rependent.

428
00:55:24,212 --> 00:55:27,012
God has spoken to us before

429
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:31,575
through Abraham, Noah, Moses and through Jesus Christ.
Why should we so surprised when god speaks to us now through Muhammad?

430
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:35,882
Who taught you those names?

431
00:55:35,883 --> 00:55:37,749
they are named in the Qur'an

432
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,818
I knew Muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep

433
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:45,812
And you knew Christ as a carpenter

434
00:55:47,154 --> 00:55:50,654
What Christ says and
what your Muhammad says

435
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:54,622
is like two raised from the same land

436
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:59,378
They'r lieing to you
They deny Christ You worship 3 gods they say, father son and holy ghost they'r saying

437
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:04,058
What do you say of Christ?

438
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:08,193
They say God can not have a son,
Christ is not the Son of God

439
00:56:08,194 --> 00:56:11,413
speak to me of Christ

440
00:56:13,763 --> 00:56:18,730
we say of Christ what our prophet has told us,
that god cast his holy spirit into

441
00:56:18,731 --> 00:56:23,898
the womb of a virgin named Mary and that
she conceived Christ the Apostle of God

442
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:25,399
Apostol he says, not a son, not a son!

443
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:33,296
What does your miracle, your Qur'an,
say of the breadth, by the Lord Jesus Christ?

444
00:56:33,704 --> 00:56:36,285
may I relate the words?

445
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,891
Come closer to me

446
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:51,859
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

447
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:59,677
relate in the book, the story of Mary.
how she was grew away from her family

448
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:05,247
to a place in the east.
How we sent her an angel called Gabriel who said:

449
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:11,282
''I am a messenger from your God
to announce the birth of a holy son to you"

450
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:17,780
she said: How shall I Mary have a son when no man has touched me?''

451
00:57:18,552 --> 00:57:22,119
And Gabriel replied: For your Lord says,

452
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:27,989
it will happen"
"We appoint him as a sign on to man"

453
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:36,285
and a mercy from us!
It is a thing or didn't"

454
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:12,669
The difference between us and you
is not bigger than this line

455
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,198
Not for a mountain of gold
will I give them up to you

456
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:31,310
you may live in Abyssinia in peace as long as you wish

457
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:36,908
May God's blessings be upon you when you return

458
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:48,182
lntolerable! Mohamed disturbs
even our foreign alliences

459
00:58:48,183 --> 00:58:53,883
Very well! we will make him give up on him

460
00:58:55,153 --> 00:58:59,214
Abu Talib has his arms around him

461
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:07,756
Very well!  we will throw uncle and nephew out

462
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:13,889
In one bundle, his whole family out
we will expel them from ourselves

463
00:59:13,993 --> 00:59:17,725
No merchant make trade with them,
no land remain to them

464
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:20,193
no roof shelter them,
no beggar pay for them

465
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:23,161
no woman marry them

466
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:27,553
until they renounce their trend.

467
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,275
These were the worst years of Muhammad's life

468
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,716
For 3 years they suffered the hunger, thirst,

469
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:29,218
cruelty of the open desert,
but the year of grief was still to come,

470
01:00:29,219 --> 01:00:34,086
when Khatija, Muhammad's wife for 24 years died,

471
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:38,821
when Abu Talib his old Protector died

472
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:45,857
With his last breath Abu Talib tried again
to reconsile Mecca and Muhammad

473
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:55,193
He never asked more from you,
when one word,

474
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:58,461
one.. one God

475
01:00:58,462 --> 01:01:01,862
If it was only a question of one word

476
01:01:01,863 --> 01:01:08,621
I'd have given him 10 words,
but the word he wants would dethrown all the gods

477
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:35,348
You were afraid even to hear him

478
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:57,182
with the death of his uncle, Muhammad has now

479
01:01:57,183 --> 01:02:02,666
lost all protection
He was no longer safe in Mecca

480
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:08,119
Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,
he went to the hillside town of Taif

481
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,648
He asked to be taken in, to be allowed to preach

482
01:02:14,855 --> 01:02:19,952
But the children of Taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert

483
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:23,940
What are you doing?

484
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:32,012
Stop! Stop! Leave him alone! Wait!

485
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,486
Muhammad called this, the bitterest day of his life

486
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:53,935
Then miraculously, when Muhammad's mission

487
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:58,169
seemed to have failed, his entire situation changed

488
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,437
A deputation from the rich, but self-destroying

489
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:05,406
city of Medina met him by night at the Rock of Agaba

490
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,840
asking him to come to them to stand between their factions

491
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:14,768
to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars

492
01:03:14,777 --> 01:03:17,876
Muhammad agreed, provided they gave him a pledge

493
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,444
that they worship the one God only

494
01:03:21,445 --> 01:03:24,679
Wait! When we take this pledge

495
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:29,833
we expel ourselves from the rest of Arabia.
So, wait!

496
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:37,583
War is in this pledge.
We'll make enemies of brothers

497
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:42,452
we'll make firewood of our gods
That is the meaning of the pledge

498
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:47,154
If we take it, there can be no turning back

499
01:03:47,155 --> 01:03:52,022
for Muhammad is indeed the messenger of God
foretold to Jews in our city

500
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:56,456
So if anyone has doubt in this pledge, go now

501
01:03:56,457 --> 01:04:01,690
and if you have no doubts then you do as I do

502
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:10,961
I pledge myself to the one and only God
and to you Muhammad, the messenger of God

503
01:04:11,863 --> 01:04:15,685
He is of us and we are of him

504
01:04:16,297 --> 01:04:23,795
Leave him bring his followers,
our brothers, to use, to Medina

505
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,949
It was a journey that changed the world

506
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,017
The Hijrah of flight to Medina

507
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:21,787
Only 70 people split up into small groups
walking 250 miles of desert

508
01:05:21,788 --> 01:05:26,655
yet, so profound with the consequences
so lasting with the effects of this walk

509
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:31,821
that from it the muslims take their calendar

510
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:36,180
In this moment, Islam found its future

511
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:39,060
Muhammad himself stayed in Mecca

512
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:44,431
in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely

513
01:06:09,271 --> 01:06:11,670
Muhammad has become a nation,

514
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:16,038
he has received a city, entering into pledges and treaties

515
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:21,474
and you Salool who claim to be king of Medina
lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed

516
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:24,761
you should worry about yourself Abu Sufian

517
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:30,177
Every time you trade a whif of perfume of the city,
you must creep past that man in Medina

518
01:06:30,178 --> 01:06:35,079
he is across your merchantile throats as we speak

519
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,180
And what do you intend to do?

520
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,080
l intend to wait

521
01:06:39,081 --> 01:06:40,581
And how long will you wait?

522
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:46,083
Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him
to save your way of life

523
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,383
and while you wait?

524
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:51,451
I should accept his call of course

525
01:06:51,452 --> 01:06:56,560
To think I will give him my birth-rite...
I will not..

526
01:06:57,821 --> 01:06:58,787
Medina is worth the conversion

527
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:00,835
Hypocrisy

528
01:07:02,023 --> 01:07:05,015
Of course, its the healthy hypocrisy

529
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:12,185
King Salool, why put your head on the floor
5 times a day praying? I don't believe you

530
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:17,316
He may not have to.
Well, we do know we should have done it before

531
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:19,280
kill Muhammad

532
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:21,962
Come!
Come and see

533
01:07:21,963 --> 01:07:25,615
They say that practice leads to perfection

534
01:07:35,268 --> 01:07:40,435
7 young men each from a different family,
my own son Ikrima is with them

535
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:45,624
they will stab him together

536
01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:58,507
If the responsibility for his death
is shared, where lies the guilty? My idea

537
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,134
I'm not sure I'm part of it

538
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:12,312
Muhammad's body contains too much
his mind, his words

539
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:15,787
But it is an ingenious solution

540
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,980
And a final one

541
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:30,348
No

542
01:09:31,295 --> 01:09:39,085
Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?
Who are we fighting?

543
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:47,854
They cannot go far, all the tracks are watched
We must take to the desert

544
01:09:49,592 --> 01:09:52,025
Bakka will give 100 camels to the man

545
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:56,028
who brings back Muhammad
or his head

546
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:03,723
Look for 3 of them
Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Uriqat, the Bidune guide

547
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:25,722
What is it?

548
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:33,150
These are drains of camel
Maybe two days, that from the city

549
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:40,687
Why are you here?

550
01:10:40,688 --> 01:10:42,354
Medina is to the north

551
01:10:42,355 --> 01:10:45,187
They made the tracks, not I

552
01:10:45,188 --> 01:10:48,187
Know much? Traveling West?

553
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:50,152
I know my art

554
01:10:50,153 --> 01:10:54,338
They say that you can track a bird by smelling the air

555
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:59,077
we go with him

556
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,940
he may be in that cave over there

557
01:11:20,685 --> 01:11:26,610
Muhammad, if you come out, we will
take you to Mecca alive

558
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,132
Muhammad, come out

559
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:51,514
they cannot be in there
This web is unbroken

560
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:55,757
And these pigeons
they would not build

561
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:57,814
we were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north

562
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:01,658
Let's move then
we still have time to head them off

563
01:12:23,813 --> 01:12:28,744
A few threads of a spider's web
was all that was then

564
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:35,341
between Muhammad and murder
But he was a man not to be killed

565
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:41,310
The Bidune guide led him
and his companion Abu Bakr in their escape

566
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:47,282
through untracked spaces of the desert
and the heat of the June days

567
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:50,476
At Medina, his followers waited with their welcome ready

568
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:55,061
but in great fear for his journey

569
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:24,840
anything? No nothing

570
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,798
this shows that he is only a man

571
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:35,222
no man can survive that heat

572
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:05,952
There! I see them! Look!

573
01:14:40,427 --> 01:14:45,214
Run and hide! I might be obliged
to free you as a gesture

574
01:15:54,853 --> 01:16:00,949
Welcome to the city of Medina, the blessed,
your city, the messenger of god

575
01:16:11,786 --> 01:16:14,918
You will stay with me, messenger of god,
I have the best house in Medina

576
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:18,284
you'll give me the honor of keeping you

577
01:16:18,285 --> 01:16:20,741
Stay with me!

578
01:16:23,051 --> 01:16:28,250
Please! Please! Please! How can the Prophet
choose between so many welcomes?

579
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:33,950
Where God guides his camel to stop,
there he will build his house

580
01:16:33,951 --> 01:16:34,916
All agreed

581
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:38,782
We turn Quaswa, his camel loose

582
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:43,617
and where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays

583
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:55,781
Clever man!

584
01:16:55,782 --> 01:17:00,297
A choice made by camel
can offend no one

585
01:18:23,107 --> 01:18:25,825
Here we will build the house of the Prophet

586
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,591
And our first meeting place,
a prayer house

587
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,825
the first mosque of Islam, here!

588
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,165
God is great!
God is great!

589
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:20,101
What's got the prophet to start doing it?
carrying bricks?

590
01:19:20,102 --> 01:19:31,203
Give me that Look, you are doing too much,
please go and sit down we will do it

591
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:46,433
Look! He went for more

592
01:19:46,434 --> 01:19:48,667
"Work is a worship" he says

593
01:19:48,668 --> 01:19:51,199
he's 53 years old

594
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,259
How old are you?

595
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:49,250
There is something missing.
Maybe a bell to call people in

596
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:51,707
the Christians use a bell

597
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:55,022
what about a horn, like the Jews?

598
01:21:55,023 --> 01:21:57,512
A drum?

599
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:01,087
There's too much blood in a drum

600
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:05,321
Why not the human voice
as in Omar bin Kattab's vision?

601
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:08,471
The Prophet agrees?

602
01:22:11,322 --> 01:22:12,686
he means you, Bilal

603
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:15,086
me?

604
01:22:15,087 --> 01:22:19,874
You have a good voice, use it!
climb up there!

605
01:23:56,912 --> 01:24:06,411
Brothers, today a man of Medina
will embrace a man of Mecca

606
01:24:06,412 --> 01:24:16,910
Each will share half and half,
reach out, embrace your neighbor and brother

607
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:37,241
I'm tired of the politics of kissing slaves

608
01:24:37,242 --> 01:24:38,341
Read this

609
01:24:38,342 --> 01:24:42,629
The prophet should concern himself with the after-world

610
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:48,207
What is my son?

611
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:51,960
Praying like a horse

612
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:02,105
does it burn your hands?
It's not upon us to burn down the house

613
01:25:02,106 --> 01:25:05,305
he's making laws like a king.
He's declared that loyalty to Islam

614
01:25:05,306 --> 01:25:09,305
is more than loyalty to tribal family

615
01:25:09,306 --> 01:25:09,572
What?

616
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:14,905
All muslims are next of kin to one-another?

617
01:25:14,906 --> 01:25:20,104
Don't be mislead by that...
They must change the nature of the tribes before that

618
01:25:20,105 --> 01:25:25,670
The danger is here, the quality:
a man's neighbour is as good as himself

619
01:25:25,671 --> 01:25:27,870
The Lunatic means it

620
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:30,869
Jews and Christians
have equal rights with Muslims,

621
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:34,636
the Jews who attach themselves to a common wealth
will be protected

622
01:25:34,637 --> 01:25:39,569
Women have rights of inheritance... Rights

623
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,636
Next, he will be giving the camel rights

624
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:47,234
He has! the lunatic has!
You can't overload them

625
01:25:47,235 --> 01:25:53,535
he's remaking a city, my city...

626
01:25:53,536 --> 01:26:06,867
damn him..
He's taken our sons from us, he took the children, our future from us. His rights are wrongs

627
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:14,533
no more...
This time there will not be any regret

628
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:20,465
it will take everything of value they left in Mecca

629
01:26:20,466 --> 01:26:30,623
their rugs, their houses, their silver
and with it, large of caravans to Damascus

630
01:27:02,396 --> 01:27:08,227
My friends, listen to me!
I have news from Mecca

631
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:12,528
everything you have left behind is gone

632
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:18,660
the Thieves! Abu Bakr's shops,
the prophet's house... sold

633
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:21,560
Every cup or piece of cloth,
every rag or bone

634
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:26,303
you ever owned is thrown on the market

635
01:27:26,794 --> 01:27:33,857
You are a people of nothing.
Don't you even fight for what you own?

636
01:27:34,327 --> 01:27:35,526
Who talks of the fight?

637
01:27:35,527 --> 01:27:40,714
What other way is there, Hamza?

638
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,758
When the Prophet says Fight!,
we fight, now he says Peace!

639
01:27:47,759 --> 01:27:49,124
Exactly

640
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:55,551
you are a peace loving people
up to your necks and fore bearers

641
01:28:01,925 --> 01:28:05,745
go back to work!

642
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:23,022
We have to defend ourselves.

643
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:29,540
You are the Messenger of god.
Yet, they mock, abuse and plunder us and we do nothing

644
01:28:30,355 --> 01:28:33,311
In the pathage of war, we are pathetic

645
01:28:33,722 --> 01:28:40,318
But they are led by greed, we are
led by god and you

646
01:28:41,654 --> 01:28:50,389
I know how you hate the sword, but
we have to fight

647
01:28:54,753 --> 01:29:02,352
they've stolen our property, they are taking it to Damascus

648
01:29:02,353 --> 01:29:10,189
right past our own door our door.
I say, by God turn back

649
01:29:32,517 --> 01:29:35,235
I'm sorry I got carried away

650
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:39,532
Its pounding in my head

651
01:29:41,749 --> 01:29:46,537
Please, fight them!

652
01:30:26,912 --> 01:30:30,062
But look at the sun!

653
01:30:38,244 --> 01:30:40,734
It's not the time of prayer

654
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:10,262
It is newly revealed by god to his messenger

655
01:31:11,308 --> 01:31:16,767
Fight, but fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

656
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:19,240
Drive them out of the places from where they drove you out,

657
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:23,073
for persecution is worse than slaughter

658
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:28,172
Fight them until persecution is no more

659
01:31:28,173 --> 01:31:34,337
and religion is God,
but if they stop, let there be no more war

660
01:31:34,839 --> 01:31:39,538
for god never loves the slaughters of wars

661
01:31:39,539 --> 01:31:45,009
so, fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

662
01:31:45,372 --> 01:31:53,140
God is great!
God is great! God is great!
