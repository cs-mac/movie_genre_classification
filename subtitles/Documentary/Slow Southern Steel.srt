1
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,564
All the time, everywhere...

2
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,734
...everything's hearts
are beating and squirting...

3
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,404
...and talking to each other
the ways I can't understand.

4
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,784
Most of the time,
they probably be saying:

5
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,912
"I'm hungry. I gotta poop."

6
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,999
But sometimes
they be talking in codes.

7
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,050
Get out the way.

8
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,430
Get your pants on, man.

9
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,965
Feed up time! Feed up!

10
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,466
Feed up time!

11
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,198
Share with the dog.

12
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,227
Ain't that ugly over there?

13
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,357
We got the prettiest place on earth.

14
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,659
Daddy says, up above the levee...

15
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,995
...on the dry side,
they're afraid of the water...

16
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,539
...like a bunch of babies.

17
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,418
They built the wall that cuts us off.

18
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,929
They think we all gonna drown
down here.

19
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,139
But we ain't going nowhere.

20
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:18,150
The Bathtub has got more holidays
than the whole rest of the world.

21
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,904
Yeah!

22
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,572
Yeah!

23
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,534
Yeah!

24
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,548
Yeah! Yeah!

25
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,680
Daddy always saying...

26
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,268
...that up in the dry world,
they got none of what we got.

27
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,318
They only got holidays once a year.

28
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,281
All babies in the race,
come up to the starting line.

29
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,330
They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers.

30
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,127
They got their babies stuck in carriages.

31
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,631
And chicken on sticks
and all that kind of stuff.

32
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,981
One day, the storm is gonna blow...

33
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,819
...the ground is gonna sink
and the water is gonna rise up so high...

34
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:48,532
...there ain't gonna be no Bathtub.
Just a whole bunch of water.

35
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,173
Yeah!

36
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,372
But me and my daddy, we stay right here.

37
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,041
We's who the earth is for.

38
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:29,091
Meat. Meat, meat, meat.

39
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,429
Every animal is made out of meat.

40
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,391
I'm meat. Y'all asses meat.

41
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,936
Everything is part of the buffet
of the universe.

42
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,028
This here is an aurochs...

43
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,282
...a fierce, mean creature
that walked the face of the earth...

44
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,452
...back when we all lived in the caves.

45
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,455
And they would gobble them
cave-babies down...

46
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,208
...right in front of the cave-baby parents.

47
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,128
And the cavemans,
they couldn't even do nothing about it...

48
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,089
...because they was too poor
and too small.

49
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,467
Who up in here think
that the cavemans...

50
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,637
...was sitting around crying
like a bunch of pussies?

51
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,226
Y'all better think about that
because any day now...

52
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,395
...fabric of the universe
is coming unraveled.

53
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,815
Ice caps gonna melt,
water is gonna rise...

54
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,527
...and everything south of the levee
is going under.

55
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,324
Y'all better learn how to survive now.

56
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,584
Way back in the day...

57
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,337
...the aurochs was king of the world.

58
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:55,511
If it wasn't for giant snowballs
and the Ice Age...

59
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,596
...l wouldn't even be Hush puppy.

60
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,099
l would just be breakfast.

61
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,561
Daddy?

62
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:28,043
Feed up time.

63
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,313
Daddy?

64
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,149
Daddy!

65
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,596
Kids that got no mama,
no daddy and nobody...

66
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,099
...they got to live in the woods...

67
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:28,312
...and eat grass and steal underpants.

68
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,321
If Daddy don't get back soon...

69
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,657
...it's gonna be time for me
to start eating my pets.

70
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,122
Daddy?

71
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,253
- That taste good?
- Yeah.

72
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,890
Hey, my baby, you need a ride?

73
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,476
No, my dad come and pick me up.

74
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,978
Well, what about some food
or something, darling?

75
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,688
You hungry?

76
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,945
All right, then. Well, suit yourself, okay?

77
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,150
Everything we still got from Mama,
I keep in my house.

78
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,365
Daddy says the first time
she looked at me...

79
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,868
...it made her heart beat so big...

80
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,370
...that she thought it would blow up.

81
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,873
That's why she swam away.

82
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,717
Hi, my sweet baby.

83
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,053
Hi, Mama.

84
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,567
Hush puppy, what you doing there?

85
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,749
You being good like I taught you?

86
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes, Mama.

87
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,613
You're good

88
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,782
You make me happy

89
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,743
You're good

90
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,037
You make me happy

91
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,414
You're good

92
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,124
That's pretty, Ma.

93
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,293
You're pretty, Hush puppy.

94
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,383
Get out of my way, you fat animal.

95
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,845
Daddy.

96
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,891
Daddy! Daddy!

97
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,565
l learned lots of things
while you were gone.

98
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,445
If I drink all this here,
l can burp like a man.

99
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,916
Why are you wearing that dress?
Leave me alone, man.

100
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,009
You wearing a bracelet too?

101
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,678
Go to your house.
You wouldn't understand.

102
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,852
l want to come to your house.
Get out of here!

103
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,354
l want to come--
Go ahead!

104
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,041
Get down from there. Get over here.

105
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,306
Feed up time! Come on, man! Feed up!

106
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,780
Boss lady!

107
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,117
Hush puppy, where you at?

108
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,079
Where you at, boss lady?

109
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,376
If Daddy kill me,
l ain't gonna be forgotten.

110
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm recording my story
for the scientists in the future.

111
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,346
In a million years,
when kids go to school...

112
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,974
...they're gonna know, once,
there was a Hush puppy...

113
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,935
...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.

114
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,230
Hush puppy!

115
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,194
Where you at, man?

116
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,071
Hush puppy!

117
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,742
Boss lady, goddamn it!

118
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,290
Come here!

119
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,043
Don't you run away from me!

120
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,212
l swear to God!

121
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,302
Get your ass back here!

122
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm tearing off!

123
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,139
I'm tearing off just like my mama!

124
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,601
I'm gonna bust your ass! Come here!

125
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,186
Come here!
No!

126
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,271
See what happen.
See what happen to you.

127
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,481
No!

128
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,868
l got to worry about you all the damn time!
You killing me!

129
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,037
You killing me!

130
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,164
Get up and now come on!

131
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,043
l hope you die.

132
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:54,341
And after you die, I'll go to your grave
and eat birthday cake all by myself.

133
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,395
Mama, I think I broke something.

134
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,283
Get over here!
Come on, let's go! Come on!

135
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,618
Miss Bathsheeba!

136
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,704
My daddy fell down.

137
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,626
Oh, God. Come on, baby.

138
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,263
Be okay.

139
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,938
Hush puppy, take this medicine.
You run fast as you can. Go.

140
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,807
Daddy could've turned into a tree.

141
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,684
Or a bug.

142
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,896
There wasn't any way to know.

143
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,541
The whole universe...

144
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,295
...depends on everything
fitting together just right.

145
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,138
If one piece busts,
even the smallest piece...

146
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,392
...the entire universe will get busted.

147
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,675
The storm's coming! The storm's coming!

148
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:28,763
The storm is coming!

149
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,796
Hey, Walter. What it is?
Afraid of a little water?

150
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,883
l ain't messing with you, Wink.
I'm getting out of here.

151
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,218
You can stay if you want, but I'm out.

152
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,972
Hey, now. What's up?

153
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,640
Look at these assholes...

154
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,393
...running around all over the damn place.
C'est la vie, assholes.

155
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,270
- Hey.
- Ho! There's my boy, Wink!

156
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,647
- We gonna do this storm?
- Let me tell you.

157
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,983
These assholes go up and down here
all day long.

158
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,403
- That's what I'm talking about.
- We ain't leaving. I'm behind you.

159
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,740
Man, I don't mind telling you, I am scared.
Just leave.

160
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,658
- This ain't no little one.
- Damn pussy.

161
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,827
I'm leaving here
soon as I finish my beer.

162
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,539
No, you're not. You're gonna stay here
with me. I'll see you tomorrow, Walrus.

163
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,167
Y'all want to die, okay, fine.
Look at Winston.

164
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,669
Winston, I know you with me,
huh, man?

165
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,464
What you gonna do about the storm,
man?

166
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,842
Hey, Hush puppy.
Hush puppy?

167
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,428
Get that girl a beer.

168
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,348
Where you been?

169
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,601
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

170
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,895
You don't talk.

171
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,989
Come here!

172
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,783
Come here, ugly!

173
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,754
Just because you
burnt your house down...

174
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,465
...don't mean you can walk
in here and take over.

175
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,593
This side of the house
is still Wink's side.

176
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,680
No toys, no girl stuff over here.

177
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,641
And if I want to come over there
and smack you in the face...

178
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,894
...that's against the rules,
so that's a plus for you.

179
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,230
So come on down here
and get in the boat.

180
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,566
Come on, get in the boat!

181
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,905
Get in the boat.

182
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:56,369
And if the water gets real high,
we're gonna float to this roof...

183
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,248
...we're gonna bust through the ceiling
and we're gonna ride away, okay?

184
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,047
Now I want you to put these on, okay?
Slide your arm through here.

185
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,718
Don't you never, never take these off.

186
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:15,263
I'm your daddy and you're
gonna do what I tell you to do...

187
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,516
...because it's my job
to keep you from dying, okay?

188
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,060
So sit back and listen to me.

189
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,104
And close your eyes.

190
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,191
Go to sleep.

191
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,446
Go to sleep!

192
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,184
Why you staring at me like that?

193
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:05,021
How I'm supposed to sleep
with you staring at me like that?

194
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,065
What, you scared?

195
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,485
I'm gonna show you,
no storm can't beat no Doucet.

196
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,697
We Doucets.
We not scared of no damn storm!

197
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:18,826
I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna take care of that storm.

198
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,995
I'm coming to get you, storm!

199
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,175
Look at me! Look at me, Hush puppy!

200
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:38,263
Look at me whip butt!
Come on, storm!

201
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,555
Come on!

202
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,602
I'm gonna get you!

203
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,688
Come on, I'm right here!

204
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,190
I'm right here! Yeah!

205
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,610
Yeah! Yeah!

206
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,371
Mama!

207
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,504
Mama?

208
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,997
For the animals that didn't have a dad
to put them in a boat...

209
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,292
...the end of the world already happened.

210
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,179
Winston!

211
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,349
Yo, Winston!

212
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,655
They're all down below,
trying to breathe through water.

213
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,018
Yo, Edison, you in here?

214
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,295
Someday, when I'm gone,
you gonna be the last man in the Bathtub.

215
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,839
You're gonna have to learn
how to feed yourself.

216
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,800
Now stick your hand in this water.

217
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,761
Stick it in there.

218
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,268
Okay, what you do is
you hold your hand steady...

219
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:57,563
...and you just wait on your fish to come.

220
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,032
You gotta ball your fist up, okay?
That's your punching hand.

221
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,953
Ball your fist up, case you have
to whack him when he come out.

222
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,047
All right, all right.

223
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,929
Oh, got it, got it!

224
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,723
Yeah! Oh, Lord!

225
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,101
Look what we got!
Look what we got!

226
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,812
Gotcha. We got it! Say, "l gotcha!"

227
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,647
l gotcha!
Yeah!

228
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,900
Hold him down.
You hold him down like this...

229
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,111
...and you whack him good
with your fist.

230
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,989
Go ahead, whack him!
You whack him good.

231
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,658
Hold him like that and whack him.
Hold it.

232
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,035
Ow!

233
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,623
Don't worry about that.
That's all a part of it.

234
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,875
Come on, you want to try it again?

235
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,170
Come on, one more time.

236
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,393
Mama?

237
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,605
ls that you?

238
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:11,238
I've broken everything.

239
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,226
Strong animals know
when your heart is weak.

240
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,107
That makes them hungry,
and they start coming.

241
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,802
Yo, Walrus.

242
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,595
Hey, man.

243
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:23,352
Come on, I gotcha. All right, partner.
l knew you wasn't gonna leave.

244
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,568
l must've passed out.

245
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,655
Little Jo.

246
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,576
- Hey.
- You okay, huh?

247
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,829
What happened to you? Get up.
Come on.

248
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:48,294
He been talking all night long
how it's the last night on earth.

249
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,714
- Don't worry about him.
- Trying to touch my titties and shit...

250
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,175
...right in front of Peter T over there.

251
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,427
Oh, Peter T, my man.
Hello.

252
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,221
Good to see you, man!
l knew you wasn't gonna leave me.

253
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,975
Oh, no. Oh, no.
That's one classic dude right there.

254
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,769
You a titan, man.

255
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,313
Yeah! Glad you stayed, man.

256
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:14,028
If I had a pair of wings,
l know I could have flown in that bad boy.

257
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,947
Almost blew off Walrus' panties, ha, ha, ha!

258
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,325
But I would probably
have bounced off a tree.

259
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,628
Hush puppy.

260
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,590
Did I ever tell you the story
about your conception?

261
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,050
Jesus.

262
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:43,057
One day, when me and Hush puppy
mama first met...

263
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,644
...we were so shy,
we used to sit around...

264
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:51,023
...and drink beer
and smile at each other.

265
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,487
One day, I got so shy, I just napped.

266
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:35,276
Back when Daddy
used to talk about Mama...

267
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:40,781
...he said she was so pretty,
she never even had to turn on the stove.

268
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,286
She'd just walk into the room...

269
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,080
...and all the water starts to boil.

270
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:10,394
Your mama battered that gator up
and set it to frying.

271
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:18,944
And Hush puppy popped into the universe
about four minutes later.

272
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,163
l got it under control.

273
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,102
Miss Bathsheeba!

274
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,013
Come on, y'all. Come on, girlie! Come on!

275
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,723
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

276
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,641
That's it.
Thank you.

277
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,727
Thank you. Very nice.
Look what we got.

278
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,521
We got the fresh catch today.
You like that, babe?

279
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,314
Yeah! Come on!

280
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,567
Come on, children,
l got some for y'all too.

281
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:25,154
Yeah! Let's go. Time to eat.

282
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:34,246
For the ones we never find,
we make a funeral the Bathtub way.

283
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,291
Yeah, tastes like more.
Come on. All right.

284
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,460
With no crying allowed.

285
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,920
Yes, to the water!

286
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,632
Come on, boy! Come on!

287
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,218
Pick that goddamn thing up!
Let's go!

288
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,470
Okay.

289
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,766
So I say to myself...

290
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,603
...I'm gonna pee in my pants just a little.
Hell, when the water goes down...

291
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,980
...I'm gonna French kiss the dirt.

292
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,232
The water ain't going down, man.

293
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,152
That's my beautiful place
under that water.

294
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,946
Everything beautiful is gone.

295
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,327
Man, you know they got salt in that water,
done ate everything up.

296
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,165
Trees are gonna die first,
then the animals, then the fish.

297
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,501
You gotta think about moving.

298
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,628
l got it under control.

299
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,425
Come here, Hush puppy.
Come sit by your Uncle Jean.

300
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,303
Let me show you how to do this.
Here. Here, baby.

301
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,264
Don't be scared of it, now.
Now, turn it upside-down.

302
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,683
There you go.
Now, push it with your thumb.

303
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,187
Good girl. That's it.

304
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:45,442
And then, real careful,
take this knife and you pop this off.

305
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,820
That's beautiful.

306
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,155
No, Hush puppy!

307
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,159
Beast it.

308
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,749
Beast it!

309
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,462
Show me you can do it!

310
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,506
- Come on, I know you can do it.
- Come on!

311
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,757
- Beast it!
- Come on, now!

312
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:15,139
Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!

313
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,392
Beast it. Beast it.

314
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,729
Come on, now! Beast it!

315
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,691
Yeah!

316
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,197
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

317
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,745
You see what kind of family we got?
We got feeling!

318
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,582
You're an animal!

319
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,918
Yeah, you're an animal. Yeah.

320
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,011
Yeah!

321
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,485
It wasn't no time to sit around
crying like a bunch of pussies.

322
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,991
We're gonna make a camp
right on top of the Bathtub.

323
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,752
We got enough animals to eat
until the water goes down.

324
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,141
Like this.

325
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,312
Smoother. Gentler.

326
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,689
Yeah, that's right. Right there.

327
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,566
It's gonna be all right.

328
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,818
Okay. Okay.

329
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,822
That's the most important thing
l can ever teach y'all.

330
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,662
Y'all got to learn how to take care
of people smaller and sweeter than you are.

331
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,332
You got it.

332
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,833
You okay?

333
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,384
Two weeks later,
everything started to die.

334
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,237
Got to get something out of this water.

335
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:51,331
Walrus, you want to leave the Bathtub?

336
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,833
No.

337
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,255
l heard that.

338
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,678
Nobody is leaving the Bathtub.

339
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,513
You don't know nothing.

340
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:15,689
This water gonna kill us here.
We gotta do something about this.

341
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:21,403
l ain't starving to death while them people
going grocery shopping and all that.

342
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,722
Shit. Son of a....

343
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,903
Boss, Daddy got to go
take care of something.

344
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm gonna fix everything the way it was.

345
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,660
Where are you going?
Don't worry. I'm the man.

346
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,662
We gonna win.

347
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,333
And if anything go wrong,
Walrus is daddy.

348
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,176
You gonna be the king of the Bathtub.
l promise that.

349
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,722
Just sit right there. I'll be back.

350
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,535
l think they be gone.
l really can't say where.

351
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,788
What are you
talking about? They go to the levee?

352
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,290
Ain't no problem.
Don't make me slap your ass!

353
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,002
You so much as piss on that wall,
you know what them people gonna do?

354
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,547
They gonna find us
and stick us in a damn shelter.

355
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,886
Daddy says brave men don't run
from their home.

356
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,641
Peter T, hold onto the boat.
You're gonna be fine.

357
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:38,081
Peter T, you hold the trip wire. Okay?

358
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,178
Get the line over there.
Okay.

359
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:08,528
The entire universe depends on
everything fitting together just right.

360
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,534
If you can fix the broken piece,
everything can go right back.

361
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,119
Come on, baby!

362
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,888
Peter T...

363
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,140
...hand me that trip wire.

364
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,726
I'm so sorry, but....

365
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,228
Peter T, you drop the trip wire?

366
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,022
Well, yes, I did.

367
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,692
- Peter T.
- I gotta go find it.

368
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,457
Get over here!

369
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,209
Aah! What are you doing, woman?

370
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,294
I'm hauling your ass home, little boy.

371
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,837
Get off!

372
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,964
Touch that wall,
they gonna come after us.

373
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,508
You don't know nothing!

374
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,426
Jean Battiste! Get the trip line!

375
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,349
Get in the boat!
Get your ass in here!

376
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,393
Hush puppy!

377
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:31,277
Pull!

378
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,532
Pull, pull!
Now, boss!

379
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,951
Now, boss!
No!

380
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,730
It didn't matter
that the water was gone.

381
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,735
Sometimes you can
break something so bad...

382
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,780
...that it can't get put back together.

383
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,017
Mama!

384
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,357
Mama!

385
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:19,237
This is a mandatory
evacuation area. You can no longer live here.

386
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,621
l repeat,
this is a mandatory evacuation area.

387
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:50,560
When you're small,
you gotta fix what you can.

388
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,175
Goddamn!

389
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,845
What the hell wrong with you?
What you doing?

390
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,016
What you gonna do now, huh?
Grr!

391
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,027
Oh, you want to throw things, huh?
All right, I can do that too.

392
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,446
Come on, then.
You want to play the game?

393
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,199
Come on, let's throw stuff. Come on!

394
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,868
l can do that too! So come on.

395
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,663
You want to throw stuff? Come on!

396
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,124
Come on. Aah!

397
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,210
Come on!

398
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,797
Ah! Ah! Ah!

399
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,298
Aagh!

400
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,550
Gotcha. Come on, come on!

401
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,222
Aagh! Gotcha. Come on! Come on!

402
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,890
Come on.

403
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,688
Uh....

404
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,625
Man, you think I don't know.

405
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,132
You think I can't see?

406
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,053
No crying.

407
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,102
No crying, man! Hey!

408
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,230
Goddamn it, I said no crying!

409
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,922
Come on, get a drink.

410
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:57,330
This counts as I'm sorry
for a whole bunch of things, Lord.

411
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,845
You gonna be dead?

412
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,347
No.

413
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,975
You gonna leave me alone?

414
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,686
No, I ain't gonna leave you alone.

415
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,689
Because if you be gone, I be gone too.

416
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,317
No, that's not how it work.

417
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,695
Sometimes in the bed...

418
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:34,200
...l start to shake and I can't stop.
l got what you got.

419
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:38,204
No, that's just a side effect
of you being a stupid little girl.

420
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,998
l ain't gonna be dead?

421
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,168
No, you'll probably live
a hundred years more.

422
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,757
Come on, let me see them guns.
Come on. Show me them guns.

423
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:53,678
Let me see them.
Come on, show them to me.

424
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,223
Show them to me.
Show me them guns!

425
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,975
Show them to me! Guns!

426
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,811
Guns! Guns! Guns!

427
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,981
Gun! Guns! Come on. Come on.

428
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,151
Come on!

429
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,155
Come on! Let me have it!

430
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,826
You the man! Who the man?

431
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,744
I'm the man.
Yeah, you the man!

432
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,830
Who the man?
I'm the man!

433
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,957
You the man! Who the man?
I'm the man.

434
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,544
I'm the man! I'm the man!
Yeah, you the man! Fuck this table. Shit!

435
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,057
l got to go lay down.

436
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,143
l got to get strong.

437
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,104
Don't be scared.

438
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,327
What?

439
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,626
Come on.

440
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,471
Lay down.

441
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,836
Hey.
Yeah?

442
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,923
You ain't the one that's sick.

443
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,217
Strong animals got no mercy.

444
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,559
They're the type of animals...

445
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:49,645
...that eat their own mamas and daddies.

446
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,792
- Think someone is in there?
- I don't know. This is a freaking shack.

447
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,836
Go check around the back.

448
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,214
There's no one in there. Look at this place.

449
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,512
- Will you please open the door?
- Get back.

450
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,223
This is a mandatory evacuation area.

451
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,393
Everyone in this region has to leave.

452
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,687
We ain't going nowhere!

453
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,773
Sir, we have food and shelter.

454
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,608
- Kick it in.
- Go around the back.

455
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,193
Let's go. Get in there.

456
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,778
Just remain calm.

457
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,238
Son, you want me to cancel
your birth certificate?

458
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,949
- Grab her arm!
- Son of a bitch!

459
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,203
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hold her down. Hold her down!

460
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,955
- Stay down, sir.
- Stay down!

461
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,250
- Let her go! I'm gonna kill you!
- You have her?

462
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,752
Let her go!

463
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,295
- Keep still.
- Let her go!

464
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:19,652
It didn't look like a prison.

465
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,197
It looked more like a fish tank
with no water.

466
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,538
They said that we were here
for our own good.

467
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:39,171
You're supposed to hear me!
l want an answer!

468
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,508
I don't have an answer.
The doctor is gonna have to give you that.

469
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,763
Don't eat that, hear?

470
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,977
Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you?

471
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,271
We found something in your test.

472
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,982
It's urgent--
Whoa, whoa. Not in front of my kid.

473
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,025
Stay there, Hush puppy.

474
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,695
The procedure is--
I said not in front of my kid.

475
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,530
The procedure is very risky.

476
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,324
There's really no way to guarantee
it will be successful.

477
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,201
In case anything happens....

478
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:21,172
Get your hands off me.
If we don't do this, you could die.

479
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,843
- l tell you! I don't need nothing from you!
- Hey, stop it!

480
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:28,137
- Mr. Doucet, calm down!
- Stop it! Come here.

481
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,849
I tell you! I tell you!
You don't tell me!

482
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,102
- Calm down!
- Let me go! Get your hands off me!

483
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,396
l don't need nothing from y'all.
Let me go!

484
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,939
Wink!

485
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,567
- Leave her alone!
- Let go of me!

486
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,860
Stop it!

487
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,571
Get off of me!

488
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,239
Daddy!

489
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:53,412
You're gonna have time-out.
Are you even listening to me?

490
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,491
When an animal gets sick here...

491
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,994
...they plug it into the wall.

492
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,601
They're coming for you.

493
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,522
Daddy used to say that
if he ever got so old...

494
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,609
...he couldn't drink beer
and catch catfish...

495
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,487
...then I had to put him in the boat
and set him on fire...

496
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,782
...so no one could come plug him
into the wall.

497
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,576
Dave! Dave.

498
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:58,996
Dave, help me out here.
Help me out here.

499
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,245
Boss.

500
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,290
Get up. We busting out of here.

501
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,917
Come on.

502
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,762
Wait, there's a person out there.

503
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,266
Here you go.

504
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:13,028
Hey! Go home!

505
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,197
Come on, let's go! Everybody get out!

506
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,953
Wait, wait, wait.

507
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:23,372
Let's go! Let's go!

508
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,310
Make sure you put her somewhere good.
Let me out of here! No! No!

509
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,020
Let me go!

510
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:51,150
- Let me off!
- Get off me!

511
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:58,824
You're trying to get rid of me!
You're trying to get rid of me!

512
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,663
Listen to me.
I'm not trying to get rid of you.

513
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,498
Yes, you is.
You don't understand!

514
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,710
l can't take care of you no more,
you understand?

515
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,545
I'm dying!

516
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,177
My blood is eating itself.

517
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,637
You know what that mean?

518
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,850
Don't be saying things about dying.

519
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:29,688
Everybody daddies die.
Not my daddy.

520
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,732
Yeah, your daddy.

521
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:40,365
l didn't want you to watch that, okay?

522
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,452
You understand?

523
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,714
Come on, let's go!

524
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:59,259
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here! Come on!

525
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,386
Come on, let's go!

526
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,558
Wait, wait, wait.

527
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,393
- Back up, back up.
- Girls, get back.

528
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:12,898
- Dad! Come on! Come on!
- Give him room to breathe.

529
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,068
Walrus, get me home.

530
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:09,204
Everybody loses the thing
that made them.

531
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,085
It's even how
it's supposed to be in nature.

532
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,675
The brave men stay and watch it happen.

533
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,802
They don't run.

534
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,021
Come on!

535
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,315
I'm going by my mom.

536
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,527
That's a good place to go.

537
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:30,929
Which way are we going?

538
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,098
It don't matter, baby.

539
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:36,393
This boat will take you
exactly where you need to be.

540
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,730
It's that kind of boat.

541
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,818
Want a chicken biscuit?

542
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,447
They're good for you.

543
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,702
I've been eating these all my life.

544
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:59,666
l keep the wrappers in the boat
because they remind me of who I was...

545
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,710
...when I ate each one.

546
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,964
The smell makes me feel cohesive.

547
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,092
l want to be cohesive.

548
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,637
I'm sure you will, baby.
No doubt in my mind.

549
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,780
Oh, hi.

550
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:15,117
Sergeant Major, how are you doing?

551
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,202
Hey, Miss Frankie.

552
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,704
Holy crap. You have toddlers.

553
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,500
A whole litter of them.
Oh, they are so cute.

554
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,677
They're so cute.

555
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,389
Hey, baby.

556
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:09,129
I'd work for you
I'd even slave for you

557
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:13,216
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you

558
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,929
And if that isn't love
It'll have to do

559
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:23,059
Until the real thing comes along

560
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,628
You need something, baby?

561
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:56,134
Well, what you want? You alone?

562
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,182
That's it?

563
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:07,979
Get in here.
Let me show you a magic trick.

564
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,213
Let me tell you something.

565
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,548
When you're a child,
people say that life...

566
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,510
...is gonna be happy
and hunky-dory and all that bullshit...

567
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:43,139
...but I'm here to tell you that it's not, so you
need to get that out your head right now.

568
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,351
Because, yeah, life is some big old feast,
but you...

569
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,272
...ain't nothing
but a stupid little waitress.

570
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:54,025
One day, everything on your plate
gonna fall on the floor.

571
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,153
And nobody gonna be there
to pick it up for you.

572
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:01,032
One day, it's gonna be all on you.

573
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,785
You understand what I'm saying?

574
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,668
So smile, girl.

575
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:15,547
Smile.

576
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:20,552
Because nobody like
a pity-party-having-ass woman.

577
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,435
The gator is magic.

578
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,858
Oh. Mm-hm.

579
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,006
You can take care of me.

580
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,257
Me and Daddy.

581
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,470
Don't know nothing about your daddy.

582
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,806
l can't take care of nobody but myself.

583
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,435
And if that isn't love
It'll have to do

584
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,395
You can stay if you want.

585
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:15,231
Until the real thing comes along

586
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:18,943
I'd gladly move

587
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,654
This is my favorite thing.

588
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,449
To prove my love, dear, and its worth

589
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:26,076
l know.

590
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,662
If that isn't love,
It'll have to do

591
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,791
l can count all the times I've been lifted.

592
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:39,464
l can count all the times I've been lifted
on two fingers.

593
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,094
Wink! Bring my baby here!

594
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,388
We got to wash her up!

595
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,390
No, that waits.

596
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:56,231
All right, fatso, breathe some air.

597
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:04,572
l need to go home.

598
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,987
If that isn't love
It'll have to do

599
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,700
Until the real thing comes along

600
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,720
You're my friend, kind of.

601
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,275
l gotta take care of mine.

602
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,676
Real good.

603
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,239
No crying, hear?

604
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,951
No crying.

605
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:00,470
Don't you cry.

606
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,836
As I stand by the bayou,
l watch a ship as she disappears.

607
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,420
There, she is gone.

608
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,090
And we cry for this.

609
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:20,925
But she's not gone.

610
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:24,804
She's just as real as when she left me.

611
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:28,182
And somewhere else,
other voices are calling out:

612
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,934
"Here she comes."

613
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,270
And that is dying.

614
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,356
Here she comes!

615
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:49,203
When it all goes quiet
behind my eyes...

616
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,455
...l see everything that made me...

617
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:54,542
...flying around in invisible pieces.

618
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:02,508
When I look too hard, it goes away.

619
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,263
But when it all goes quiet,
I see they are right here.

620
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:13,144
l see that I'm a little piece
of a big, big universe.

621
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,397
And that makes things right.

622
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:24,655
When I die, the scientists of the future...

623
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,366
...they're going to find it all.

624
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:29,201
They're going to know...

625
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:31,662
...once, there was a Hush puppy...

626
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,665
...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.
