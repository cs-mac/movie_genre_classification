1
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,503
From the White House and the
Office of the President of the

2
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:18,701
United States we present an
address by Dwight D. Eisenhower.

3
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:21,980
This is the farewell address for
president Eisenhower, whose...

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,358
eight years as chief executive
come to an end that noon Friday.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,995
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

6
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:31,755
We now stand 10 years passed
the midpoint of the century,

7
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:35,481
that has witnessed four major
wars among great nations.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,100
Three of these involved our own country.

9
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,036
We have been compelled to create a...

10
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:46,040
permanent armaments industry
of vast proportions.

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:52,726
Three and a half million men and women are
directly engaged in the defense establishment.

12
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:57,061
Of this conjunction, of an
immense military establishment...

13
00:00:57,161 --> 00:01:01,494
and a large arms industry is
new in the American experience.

14
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,876
We recognize the imperative
need for this development.

15
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:10,000
Yet we must not fail to comprehend
its grave implications.

16
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:21,201
What are we fighting for?

17
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:26,729
Why do we bury our sons and fathers in
lonely graves, far away from home?

18
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:34,519
Our men are dying to preserve a way of life.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,304
This religion, these rights, they are precious
enough to fight for, precious enough to die for.

20
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,558
WHY WE FIGHT

21
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:12,202
The United States is the greatest
force for good in the world.

22
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:17,419
And we have not an obligation to
go out and fight and start wars,

23
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,187
but certainly do everything we can to spread
democracy and freedom throughout the world.

24
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:25,834
We shall pay any price, bear any burden...

25
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:30,283
to assure the survival and
the success of liberty.

26
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,516
- What are we fighting for?
- Freedom.

27
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:33,823
Freedom.

28
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:42,361
I think we're fighting because it's
necessary and because it's right.

29
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,297
We are not talking simply
about the price of gas,

30
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,906
we are talking about the price of liberty.

31
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,204
We seek neither territory nor bases.

32
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,449
We fight for the principle
of self-determination.

33
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,786
America's strength and military power
have been a force for peace, not conflicts.

34
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:03,271
By keeping our military
strong, by using force where...

35
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,960
we must, America is making a difference...

36
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:08,127
... for people here and around the world.

37
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:13,537
Our course is just. And no
matter how long it takes,

38
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:17,551
we will defeat the enemies of freedom.

39
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:31,164
I was on my way to work and
I was taking the subway,

40
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:33,046
which is elevated subway.

41
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:37,902
And as the subway heads to
New York it comes a point...

42
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:44,017
where it makes a very abrupt lefthand
turn, almost a 90 degree turn.

43
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:49,811
And when it does that the wheels
of the subway always screech loudly.

44
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,550
If you look out of the window that's when
you can see the World Trade Center.

45
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:56,000
I was sitting on subway, reading as I always do.

46
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,476
Train made a lefthand
turn, the wheels screeched,

47
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:02,403
everybody jumped up and start to gasp...

48
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:03,829
'Oh.'

49
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,215
And I look up and there's the building
with smoke pouring out of it.

50
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:14,530
I didn't know if that was my
son's building, because...

51
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,151
tower 1 and tower 2 were in perfect symmetry.

52
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:21,149
And I didn't know which tower I'm looking at.

53
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,898
And I'm just thinking to myself you know,
'How did my son get out of there?'

54
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,746
I don't know how, but he got out of there.
There's no two ways about that.

55
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:33,580
He can't be in there. Cause anybody
who's in there is gonna die.

56
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,328
Blowback.

57
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:44,492
It's a CIA turn.

58
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:49,994
Blowback does not mean simply the
unintended consequences of foreign operations.

59
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:53,162
It means the unintended
consequences of foreign operations,

60
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:56,483
that were deliberately kept
secret from the American public.

61
00:04:56,484 --> 00:05:00,438
So that when the retaliation comes,
the American public is not...

62
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:04,184
able to put it in context, to
put cause and effect together.

63
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,813
That they come up with questions like
'Why did they hate us?'

64
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:10,201
The forces of evil declared
war on the America...

65
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:13,063
Since Pearl Harbor has there
been so much national...

66
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,382
Bringing the democracy under attack.

67
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:17,085
'Why do they hate us?'
That's the question everybody's asking.

68
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:21,993
Our government did not want the forensic
question asked 'What were their motives?'.

69
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:26,054
And instead shows to say
'Thy were just evil doers.'

70
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:29,711
And the towers keep falling. Every
five minutes they go to tower again.

71
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:33,268
I've Come on the phone, I call the NBC.

72
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:40,339
I'm listening to your newscast. How many times
you gonna show those goddamn towers coming down?

73
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:45,346
Don't you have any respect for the people,
who have family and friends in those towers?

74
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,706
Do we have to keep watching
them fall down? I watch them...

75
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,934
fall down fifty times already.
When are you gonna stop?

76
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:57,152
Please stop. You are ripping my heart out.

77
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,197
...I guess people, that hate freedom.

78
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:03,629
God gave me two greatest sons
any parent could ever ask for.

79
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,219
Why he took one back?

80
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,837
I'll never know.

81
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,620
I can hear you.
The rest of the world hears you.

82
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,704
And the people..

83
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:19,111
And the people, who knock these
buildings down will hear all of us soon.

84
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,943
Yeah!

85
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,605
USA!
USA!

86
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,476
Somebody has to pay for this.

87
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:28,298
Somebody has to pay for 9/11th.

88
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:32,959
I want enemy dead. I wanna see their bodies...

89
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,027
stacked up, for what they
did, for taking my son.

90
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:41,137
On September 12, 2001, The President's
national security team met...

91
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,253
to discuss a military response to
the attacks of the previous day.

92
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,496
The discussion included the prospect of a...

93
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:51,587
preemptive military strike
against the nation of Iraq.

94
00:06:56,572 --> 00:07:02,124
There was a moment when
the entire world was behind us.

95
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,213
There was a million people,
demonstrating in the streets of Teheran

96
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,784
in favor of the United States.

97
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:16,693
We had the world behind us.

98
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,078
Now kids are dying.

99
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,658
Billions are being spent every month.

100
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:35,811
Animosity against United States is stronger
now than it ever has been in history.

101
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:38,661
What happened here?

102
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:42,633
Is it just the experience of September 11th?

103
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,132
Or is there something else going on here?

104
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,897
When something like this
happens you got to take stock...

105
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:52,426
of this, you got to understand
what went wrong here.

106
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:10,554
We live here in the United States of Amnesia.
No one remembers anything before Monday morning.

107
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:13,129
Everything is a blank.
We have no history.

108
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,642
Guatemala 1954.

109
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:20,020
The United States intervened
unilaterally, to protect its vital interests.

110
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,395
Lebanon 1959, the United
States fills its policy of...

111
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:26,362
containment and the Middle East is threatened.

112
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,554
They response openly an unilaterally.

113
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:33,427
The United States intervened
in Laos, Boetoeng, Brazil.

114
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:36,621
There are so many theories
about what happened in Iraq.

115
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:38,548
And why we really went in.

116
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,713
But when you look at the history of the
United States, almost every president,

117
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,224
there is something we
don't like, somewhere in...

118
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,938
the world and we've got to
dispense military force.

119
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:50,338
Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada in 1983.

120
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,708
Last night I ordered US
military forces to Panama.

121
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,288
This is not about one president or one party.

122
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,355
We fight as a nation because
we perceive it is our interest to fight.

123
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:04,145
And we then mention words like freedom...

124
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,726
and nice common values.
Who can be against freedom?

125
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:12,342
When in fact much more has
been going on privately.

126
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,229
Just completed the meating
where our national security...

127
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,146
team and we've received the
latest intelligence updates.

128
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:26,940
The deliberate and deadly attacks, which
occurred yesterday against our country

129
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,976
were more than acts of terror.

130
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:31,930
They were acts of war.

131
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,765
September 11th, 2001 provided a group of people,

132
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:40,428
deeply committed to the
expansion of the American empire.

133
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:45,345
The opportunity to implement plans
that they had been laying since 1992.

134
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:50,062
At that time a young Paul Wufowitz
was working in a subordinate position

135
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:53,901
under Dick Chaney, then
Secretary of Defense, in the Pentagon.

136
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:58,533
With the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 Chaney orders

137
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:02,708
Wufowitz to write a plan,
to write a grand strategy.

138
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,407
That it was now our destiny that
without the Soviet Union...

139
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:10,393
there is no one who can possibly
approach us in military terms.

140
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:14,948
It says, that's the way it ought
to be and our policy must...

141
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:19,301
be to maintain and expand
that. That we are the new Rome.

142
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:24,119
That's their strategy, on 9/11
they began to implement it.

143
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,040
It's not just simply a matter of capturing
people and holding them accountable,

144
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,757
but removing the sanctuary is removing...

145
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:34,584
the support systems, ending
states response territory...

146
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,975
The people who came in with the
president, there are many of them anyway,

147
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:42,096
were certainly prepared to
shift direction in a...

148
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:46,483
radical direction, I think
it's fair to say radical.

149
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:49,279
When September 11th happened,
the President and...

150
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,458
his top advisors said to
themselves, correctly I think,

151
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,901
'We need to rethink American foreign policy'

152
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:58,405
And I think that would have happened
even without the September 11th.

153
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:02,454
But September 11th was really the event,
that changed American foreign policy.

154
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:08,341
When I was in a Pentagon, when we
got hit, you know, yes it did change.

155
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,934
It was a very dramatic and terrible thing.

156
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:17,689
And it does change the perspective. But the war
in Iraq had nothing to do with war on terrorism.

157
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,047
There was a huge leap, a
manufactured leap. In order to...

158
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:26,655
implement a very calculated and
predeveloped foreign policy.

159
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:30,606
We must take the battle to the
enemy, disrupt his plans...

160
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:34,104
and confront the worst
threats before they emerge.

161
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:39,903
The Bush doctrine is that
preemptive strikes or preemptive...

162
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:45,130
conflicts, which would never
contemplated in the past,

163
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:48,573
now have to be contemplated
under certain scenarios.

164
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,408
If you saw the missile about to
be launched and you could...

165
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:56,666
kick it over before it could be
launched, you'd do it, of course.

166
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,702
If you saw someone about to
shoot at you and you thought...

167
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:04,353
you can shoot first, you'd
do it. It's common sense.

168
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,568
I don't know anybody who
doesn't agree with that.

169
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:10,483
So what's the big fuss about preemption?

170
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:24,027
March 19th is a night I will never forget.

171
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:31,127
March 19th is one for the history books.
It's one for my personal history books.

172
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:34,013
On March 19, 2003, the U.S. Air Force
Stealth Fighter Wing was ordered...

173
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:36,757
to conduct a precision airstrike
on a location in southern Baghdad.

174
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:40,972
When we first got the phone call, all what
they told us, we have a high priority mission.

175
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:45,986
A high value target. It was one of those SAS,
it was a leadership target.

176
00:12:45,987 --> 00:12:49,501
The F-117 is an extraordinary
machine and it is only ordered...

177
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:53,284
forward on the order of the President
or the Secretary of Defense.

178
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:56,651
First night od the conflict, the
117 pilots were fully trained.

179
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,846
All they had to do is be briefed,
have the weapons put on.

180
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,819
The whole mission up to this point
was kept at the top secret levels.

181
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,189
I think they really didn't expect both of us
to come back, which is why they sent two jets.

182
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,442
It's now 3:30, we have to hit the
target at 5:30 or all bets are off.

183
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:17,427
The President of the United States
called it a target of opportunity,

184
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,827
and they wanted to take
advantage of it and they did.

185
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:23,090
It's quite chilly and cold,
I'm looking southwards,

186
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,070
expecting any attack to come in from the south.

187
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:31,102
The choice in the timing is entirely now
in the hands of the allies.

188
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:42,382
The Bush doctrine is certainly not something
unprecedented, unknown in American life.

189
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:46,376
This statement that we are going to
dominate the world through military power,

190
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:49,898
that we reserve to ourselves
the right of preemptive war.

191
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,214
It is an extreme statement of what
has been there in the works for a long time.

192
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:06,537
World War ll is without question
the formation of the American military empire.

193
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,714
General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme

194
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:12,756
Commander in Chief of
allied expeditionary force.

195
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:16,901
I have complete confidence
that the soldiers, sailors...

196
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,471
and Army of the United Nations will demonstrate

197
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:26,341
that an aroused democracy is almost quantifiable
fighting machine that can be devised.

198
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:29,674
Eisenhower was there and saw it happening.

199
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:34,316
He had seen the build up of the
American military to fight World War ll.

200
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:39,190
I this war, more than any
other in history, we are...

201
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,792
on the side of decency
and democracy and liberty.

202
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:49,110
He believed very deeply in the
necessity for World War ll.

203
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:53,505
And felt that Nazism was a terrible tyranny.

204
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:58,007
And he brought this conviction
to defeating Nazi Germany.

205
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:04,155
People waited for this moment the
culminating victory, the end of the war.

206
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:11,028
We were on top of the world.
We were only unwrecked major power on earth.

207
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:20,630
Europe was bleeding to death, Japan was gone,
those paper cities had all been burned up.

208
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,831
So what are we doing?

209
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:32,067
At 2:45 in the morning August 6th,
1945, colonel Tibbits takes the...

210
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:38,930
It is an atomic bomb, it is a harnessing
of the basic power of the universe.

211
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:50,169
The United States bombed the Japanese city
of Hiroshima on August 6th 1945.

212
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,960
And three days later, they detonated
another atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki.

213
00:15:55,961 --> 00:16:02,815
What has been done is the greatest
achievement of organized science in history.

214
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:08,596
I can remember in the Pacific, when the word
spread, that the bombs had been dropped.

215
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:12,122
99.9 percent of us were
delighted, because we'd been...

216
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,747
convinced that if Japan was
not hit by nuclear weapons,

217
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:17,789
one million of us would be killed.

218
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:20,496
Drop those bombs and they will surrender.

219
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:23,577
Well they were trying to surrender
all that summer, Truman...

220
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:26,655
wouldn't listen, because Truman
wanted to drop the bombs...

221
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:31,637
To show off, to frighten
Stalin, to change the balance...

222
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:36,189
of power in the world, to
declare war on communism.

223
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,367
Perhaps we were starting a preemptive World War.

224
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:43,817
Eisenhower hated the dropping of them
and thought it should not have been done.

225
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,870
We just thought war was
terrible enough as it was.

226
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:54,667
I can not trace evolution of my dad's thinking.

227
00:16:54,668 --> 00:17:01,062
He was complex, he was a five star general,
but he was never military fanatic, never.

228
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:06,684
One night in July of 45, that day
the Secretary of War had told...

229
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:12,061
my father about the development
of atomic weapon, atomic bomb.

230
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:17,127
He was sitting up in his bedroom
and he said that his all first...

231
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:21,905
impression, his all emotions
had been to be feeling down low.

232
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,280
He wished we hadn't adverted it.

233
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:27,212
In the background was the
growing conflict between...

234
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,736
two great powers to shape the postwar world.

235
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:34,332
Already an Iron Curtain had dropped
around Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia.

236
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,397
You see, we had to fight communism
wherever it was in the world.

237
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:43,270
So a decision was made that the
United States will remain militarized...

238
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,542
... permanently.

239
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:48,685
We lack the weapons to defend ourselves, build,
prepare as required.

240
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:53,066
Quickly the government springs an election
and initiate the gigantic rearmament programme,

241
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:58,341
a programme designed to make
America the arsenal of democracy.

242
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:04,306
From that moment on the American empire
was in every corner of the earth.

243
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,627
In Burma and Iceland...

244
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:10,221
We were going to maintain dominance not just of

245
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,224
Europe, not just of Japan,
but of the entire globe.

246
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:23,917
'Oh gee I wish, that I
could be with you tonight.'

247
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:25,751
'Gee I wish'

248
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:40,581
'And gee I know, that
everything will be alright.'

249
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:45,434
'The crickets are singing a love song.'

250
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,426
What are we fighting for?

251
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,670
Fighting for continued freedom.

252
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,344
That's the only way we're
gonna have it, I think.

253
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:58,690
Why do we fight? I think that the...
I honestly don't have an answer for it.

254
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:03,324
It's just... the people who start the war,
who know what they are fighting about.

255
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:08,974
I think we fight for ideals and what
we believe in. I hope that so what it is.

256
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:19,605
Today we don't have a broad based American
feeling about why we are fighting in Iraq.

257
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:22,537
People's confidence in the United
States is not what it was...

258
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,423
50 years ago, it's not what it
was during the World War ll.

259
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:28,501
Yesterday USA precious celluloids, such as...

260
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,651
'Why we fight' orientation
films, depicting our soldiers...

261
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,269
You know it's interesting 'Why we fight' was...

262
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:38,092
actually the title of series
of World War ll films.

263
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,482
They were done by one of the great directors.

264
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:44,147
Master of the of the art of motion
picture entertainment, Frank Cappra.

265
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:48,078
The Frank Cappra films, even
back then were propaganda.

266
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,416
To kind of build up a war fewer.

267
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,475
Americans fighting.

268
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:56,656
But given that it was
during a global Word War...

269
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:59,854
there were a lot of reasons
that Americans embrace.

270
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:06,041
We are fighting for liberty,
the most expensive luxury known to man.

271
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:10,293
Today, if you went downtown, to
my local town and you ask five...

272
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:14,908
people 'Why we are fighting in Iraq?'
you get five different answers.

273
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,299
Why do we fight? I 'm not quite sure,

274
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,581
but I think it's for
powering control, for greed.

275
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:25,268
I'm not sure if we are fighting for the
oil or not. We could be, we could not be.

276
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,030
Our government has more knowledge than I know.

277
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,254
I think everybody has the
different idea why we are there.

278
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,436
And a lot of people think we shouldn't be.

279
00:20:32,437 --> 00:20:36,300
What we're seeing is a disconnection
of our American foreign...

280
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,767
policy from the citizen, from
average American citizen.

281
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:41,659
Why do we fight?

282
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:48,232
I wish we didn't.
Sometimes you have to though.

283
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:23,116
This is one of my favorite pictures of all time.
Smiling with his two teeth.

284
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,250
Man Jason.

285
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,766
What can I do for my son's memory?

286
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,266
I'm not a millionaire.

287
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:38,099
I can't build schools and libraries.
We're just a regular couple on pension.

288
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,682
I want to be able to do something.

289
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:48,908
So that hopefully one day,
I can go over to my son's grave...

290
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:05,723
and tell him that I've done
something in his memory

291
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:13,410
that hopefully will be a step in
preventing another attack like that.

292
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:19,231
After September 11, the Pentagon unveiled
a new weapon for use against terrorists.

293
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:27,974
The bomb is designed to be
delivered inside a target.

294
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:31,460
My expertise is an explosive technology.

295
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:36,043
And so are a lot of my
colleagues here at Indian Head.

296
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:43,514
When Pentagon called, my position then was
the head of what we call 'the pay load team'.

297
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:47,975
A bomb, it's the Norman cliche for bomb.

298
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:51,732
I find it's sometimes
amusing when people ask me,

299
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:56,830
'where do you work?' and I would
say explosive. And they would...

300
00:22:57,673 --> 00:23:04,162
But our mission was to quickly weaponize
what was called a 'penetrator'.

301
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:09,355
It basically was a big bomb, engineered
to enhance its blast effect...

302
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:13,973
inside confine structures, such
as tunnels, caves, et cetera.

303
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,883
We're gonna attack somebody, we're gonna
bomb some place, there's no question about that.

304
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:23,019
The question is, where are
we gonna do it and why?

305
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,837
Do you think that after an
advisory gets nuclear weapons...

306
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:30,561
is a better time to engage that
advisory then now without?

307
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:34,915
Iraq continues to flaw in its hostility
toward America and to support terror.

308
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:39,906
This is a regime that has something
to hide from the civilized world.

309
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:46,163
The invasion of Iraq in 2003, is to
a very considerable extent about...

310
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:52,163
repositioning the United States as
the country that must be obeyed.

311
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,573
It's an easy way to send the
signal to the planet, that the

312
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:59,081
United States is in charge and
it's going to what it wants.

313
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:03,036
And anybody who defies the
United States will be punished.

314
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:06,753
The decision to attack Iraqi
leadership at the opening selva,

315
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:09,889
it was a bold new, it was
a new way of making war.

316
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,055
And technology was able to provide
our leadership that opportunity.

317
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:17,082
Now we have received this new weapon,
called the 'Enhanced gutter bomb unit 27'.

318
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,061
And it was like the new
candy at the candy store.

319
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:24,032
We needed something that was gonna give us
a capability to strike through the weather

320
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,546
and don't worry about having
to bring the bombs home.

321
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:29,946
The whole of the city is
still lit very brightly.

322
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:32,553
But nobody's moving on the streets whatsoever.

323
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:35,433
It's like everybody here
is holding their breath.

324
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,752
We really didn't know who was there and...

325
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:40,846
who was gonna take the blow
of what we're about to do.

326
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:45,248
We both probably had our
suspicions about who it was.

327
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:49,866
We've got some indications that
maybe sons maybe Saddam himself.

328
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:53,437
Assassination, people sometimes
think with precision weapons

329
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:57,802
that maybe you can now assassinate
people from very hard place.

330
00:24:57,803 --> 00:25:01,017
First of all, if it's a fixed
target like a building...

331
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:03,737
you have the time to understand its location.

332
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:06,639
The next hardest target is
one that moves around...

333
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,698
and a single hardest target
of all is a human being.

334
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:13,256
Sometimes, before you can
bring about democratic change,

335
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:16,720
you have to remove the
obstacle to democratic change.

336
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,301
You have to remove Saddam Hussein, because...

337
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:22,215
there is no hope for
democracy with Saddam there.

338
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:26,134
The point in many ways
for these guys wasn't just

339
00:25:26,135 --> 00:25:29,541
to target Saddam, it was to
transform the Middle East.

340
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:32,807
They wanna take the US military and go in and...

341
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,656
show up American interest in
the key area of the world.

342
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:38,277
And that's their vision.

343
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,946
They wanna spread democracy around
the world on the point around Baghdad’s.

344
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,475
- Do you want Iraq to be like America?

345
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:50,483
What can I say? Some people
do and some people don't.

346
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:54,373
I want American streets,
her gardens, her buildings.

347
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:56,312
That's what I want.

348
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:02,376
In the beginning we stood against America,
but there are people...

349
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,373
...who were welcoming America.

350
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:09,182
They said, 'America is a democracy
and really they will liberate us.'

351
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:12,630
Before the war, frankly,
many of us were clapping.

352
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,986
'Live, Live Bush!'

353
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,964
'Die, Die Saddam!'

354
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:19,205
'Live, Live Bush!'

355
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,700
'Die, Die Saddam!'

356
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:25,149
I think most Americans don't
want to police the world,...

357
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,249
...but I think most Americans
understand that if we don't...

358
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:31,291
at least help to police the
world then no one's going to.

359
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:34,176
Where the debate and controversy begins...

360
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,674
... is how far does the United
States go, when does...

361
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:41,270
it go from a force for good
to a force of imperialism?

362
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:44,944
People complain a lot about American
arrogance and American power.

363
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:49,370
But the great threat for the future is not
American power or American strength.

364
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:51,985
It would be American weakness
and American withdrawal.

365
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:55,845
They do believe that this is not only for
the long term benefit for the United States...

366
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,532
... but it's for the long term benefit
for everybody else as well.

367
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:02,191
We'll bring them American values,
prosperity, peace, all the rest of it.

368
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:05,229
But the way we're gonna do that is to take over,

369
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:08,816
even more than we did it at
the height of the cold war.

370
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:14,090
Three, two, one.

371
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,091
Fire.

372
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:23,855
After the second World War the United States
literally divided the world up into commands.

373
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:28,399
And some American officer was
responsible for every region of the world.

374
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:35,124
There was the subdominant theory that
if any of these places fall to communism,...

375
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,738
... then the next place, and the
next place, and the next place...

376
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:40,491
will fall as well. And the next
thing you know they're in Missouri.

377
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,860
Once upon a time your hometown was safe.

378
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:48,075
But not now. It is possible for a rocket...

379
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:52,880
to strike your home, right
now, today, right now.

380
00:27:53,336 --> 00:28:04,639
And what defense remains?
Strength, strength ready if we need it.

381
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:21,118
When my dad first became president, he came in
at the beginning of the third nuclear age.

382
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:25,101
I think we have to put the
1950's into perspective.

383
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:32,285
We look back today and we think that 1950's
was a period of Elvis Presley and poodle skirts.

384
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:35,753
But in fact it was very
dangerous period of time.

385
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:41,393
Defense budgets throughout the western world,
doubled or tripled in four years in 1948-52.

386
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:44,970
The Soviets are outproducing
Americas aircraft factories.

387
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:47,684
There is a threat, but we
can't measure how much...

388
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:50,551
is enough defense spending
to stop the Soviet Union.

389
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:59,265
So by the time Eisenhower is president, there is
a huge new flow of cash into defense industries.

390
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:02,011
He was the first to
acknowledge that a permanent...

391
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:05,350
military establishment would be
required during this period.

392
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:08,840
But then unless we could find
some kind of breakthrough,

393
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,303
that in fact it would end up
creating a terrible cost.

394
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:15,903
The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this.

395
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,679
In modern brick school more than 36.

396
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,642
It is two electric power plants
serving at 60,000 population.

397
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:28,500
It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals.

398
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:33,236
We pay for a single fireplane
with a half million a week.

399
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:38,513
We pay for a single destroyer with new homes
that could have housed more than 9,000 people.

400
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:40,737
This is not a way of life at all.

401
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,736
And then the truth is...

402
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:48,218
Under the cloud of threatening war it is
humanity hanging from across the violence.

403
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:52,324
My father is president, yet
withdraws guiding principles.

404
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:57,101
He used to say weapons take food from
the hungry and shelter from the homeless.

405
00:29:57,102 --> 00:29:59,792
So he was fighting with
the Pentagon all the time.

406
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:02,776
For asking how much is Congress giving to.

407
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:06,695
I don't think we should pay one cent for
defense more than we have to.

408
00:30:06,696 --> 00:30:13,197
Eisenhower saw a starting to build programme
after programme, that was just out of control.

409
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:16,638
And his own ability to shape
national security policy...

410
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:20,241
was being hemmed in by these
forces, he couldn't control.

411
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:21,959
And he was the President.

412
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,053
On at least one occasion Eisenhower
was heard to say by those in the room,

413
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:29,097
'God help this country when
somebody sits at this desk,

414
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:32,127
who doesn't know as much
about the military as I do.'

415
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,511
January 17, 1961 Presided Eisenhower's
farewell address to the American people.

416
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:44,226
My fellow Americans, this evening I come to you
with message of leave taking and farewell.

417
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:48,720
And to share a few final thoughts
with you, my countrymen.

418
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:54,901
We have been compelled to create a permanent
armaments industry of vast proportions.

419
00:30:54,902 --> 00:31:01,988
3,5 million men and women are directly
engaged in the defense establishment.

420
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:07,484
The total influence, economic,
political, even spiritual...

421
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:13,317
is felt in every city, every state house,
every office of the federal government.

422
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:16,606
We recognize the imperative need
for this development.

423
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:22,334
Yet we must not fail to comprehend
its grave implications.

424
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,947
In the councils of government we must guard
against, the acquisition of unwanted influence,

425
00:31:30,948 --> 00:31:35,935
whether sort or unsort by
the military industrial complex.

426
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,446
The potential for the disastrous rise of
misplaced power exists and will persist.

427
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:45,594
You have to realise, this is
one of the greatest presidents,

428
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:48,122
great military leaders on his way out the door.

429
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:50,539
At the end of his second term he says...

430
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:54,289
'By the way, watch out for the
military-industrial complex'.

431
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,630
People know that he invented the
phrase 'military-industrial complex'

432
00:31:57,764 --> 00:32:00,529
But very rarely you see the whole thing and...

433
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:03,578
realise how utterly
straightened his warning was.

434
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:07,339
I think it's one of the most profound statements
ever made by an American President.

435
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,065
Just like George Washington gave his warnings
about foreign tackles and things like that.

436
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,586
My dad was giving his warning against...

437
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:17,849
this military-industrial
complex, get out of hand.

438
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:25,322
We must never let the wait of this combination
endanger our liberties or democratic processes.

439
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,238
BLUE ANGELS AlR SHOW Pensacola, FL

CELEBRATE FREEDOM AlR SHOW Camden, SC

441
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,666
Today, the United States spends
more on defense than on...

442
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,774
all other discretionary parts
of the federal budget combined.

443
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:50,491
President has asked Congress for
401,7 billion dollars for fiscal year 2005.

444
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:54,785
Our country spends more on
defense than all of the...

445
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:58,686
other 18 members of NATO plus China and Russia.

446
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:02,261
From my point I think numbers
almost are distracting.

447
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:09,829
2003 AUSA Defense Show Washington, DC

448
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,841
This is the medium machine gun,
7.62 mm over a 450 rounds per minute.

449
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:19,894
I'm here to see hit-to-kill technology,
I'm not familiar with it.

450
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:25,793
It's a missile that goes up and shoots a
tactical ballistic missiles out of the sky.

451
00:34:25,794 --> 00:34:27,380
These are my two daughters.

452
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:30,787
President Eisenhower's
concern about the military...

453
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:34,758
industrial complex, his words
have unfortunately come true.

454
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:39,810
He was worried that priorities are set by
the what benefits corporations...

455
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,787
is opposed to what benefits the country.

456
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:47,607
Name any plane part that would come
into your mind. 1,2,3 name a part...

457
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:51,144
Perfect, now we've never
met before, no collusion.

458
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:55,067
Which is really odd, because
collusion is our business.

459
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,722
Yes, collusion with the military.

460
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,445
You know, people sometimes
think of the defense...

461
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,545
budget as you got to arm the
troops, defend the nation.

462
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:07,083
But for most people who are involved
in that, you realize this is business.

463
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:11,649
Competition for contracts between
very large corporations.

464
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,072
Industry has to have a bottom line that's black,
otherwise their shareholders don't like that.

465
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:22,196
So they have to find ways to interest the
government in continuing to buy the product.

466
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:27,606
Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas
and Boeing throughout America.

467
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:31,959
There are factories, there are corporations,
that are involved on a daily basis...

468
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,973
...to produce the weaponry, the ammunition,
to carry out the American way of war.

469
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:39,047
Raytheon Missile Systems Tucson, AZ

470
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,426
The overall rate here on mission
in general, is to be the...

471
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:49,291
premier supply of solutions
that meet our customers' needs.

472
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:53,334
Our job is to provide tactical missiles
for our practical purposes.

473
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,466
Laser-guided bombs, Tomahawk
missiles, Stinger...

474
00:35:56,566 --> 00:36:00,021
missiles, veilings, which is
actually a great big gun.

475
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:03,022
The American way of war has been described as...

476
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:06,885
overwhelming firepower, supported
by overwhelming logistics.

477
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:11,528
For every shooter out there, every man with a
gun there are hundreds behind supporting,...

478
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:18,284
... providing the ammunition, the
boots, the gas for the tanks, the oil.

479
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:21,686
I don't guess I'm real proud
of the fact that I make...

480
00:36:21,786 --> 00:36:24,434
bombs, you know, for what they're used for.

481
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:28,601
I think about when I see
something explode out there,

482
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:32,470
that my hands actually help make that, you know.

483
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:37,814
I'd rather really be helping Santa make
toys is what I'd really rather be doing.

484
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:42,817
We're trying connect our people
with the actual guy in the field,

485
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:47,608
in the plane, some of them are
their sons or their daughters.

486
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:48,825
Is your son is reservist?

487
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:52,794
Yes, he is reservist with the 6/52, engineer.

488
00:36:52,795 --> 00:37:00,906
Sometimes I'm okay, another
times I can cry a river.

489
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:06,948
You wrap the flag around every weapon system,

490
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:09,545
every weapon system is
supposed to be for the troops.

491
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:15,424
Give the soldier the tools they need.
But it ends up becoming a product competition.

492
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,719
If you had the same car year
after year, if industry...

493
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,418
didn't change the car at all,
would you buy a different car?

494
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:26,149
No. But when they come up with something
that's got extra bells and whistles...

495
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,419
... and it suits what you need it to do,
then you'll buy more.

496
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,218
If you look at the weapons that were buying,

497
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,633
new aircraft carriers, new
submarines, F22 fighters.

498
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:40,628
You know for an attack, that
if FBI estimates probably...

499
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:44,296
cost of Al-Qaeda or Osama,
500 cade are pulled off.

500
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:47,931
We are now spending more
than we did at the peak of Vietnam.

501
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,705
A lot of what's going on is
simply because people don't...

502
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:55,973
understand the larger architecture
of how the Pentagon operates.

503
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,988
Mister Chairman and distinguished
members of the committee,...

504
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:02,180
I am the US Air force programme
manager for the Boeing company.

505
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:06,589
Let's use the example of buying a weapon
like a new fighter plane for the Air Force.

506
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:11,079
The action usually starts in the Pentagon,
maybe at the contractors initiatives.

507
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,238
But essentially, everybody's working together.

508
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,703
The KC-7678 can carry up to 190 troops.

509
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:20,191
Basically what you do is you come
in and you lowball the initial estimate.

510
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:22,952
The actual venue cost is
about half that estimate.

511
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:25,509
You over promise what it's gonna do and you...

512
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,391
underestimate the kind of
burns it's gonna impose.

513
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:32,137
We separately met with the companies
and both proposals are very good

514
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:35,463
Once the Air Force buys off on
it, then you start flooding...

515
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,556
money to as many congressional
districts as possible...

516
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:40,173
... as quickly as possible.

517
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:43,732
The B2 bomber has a piece that
is made in every single state.

518
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:47,386
To make sure that if you ever
try to face that project out...

519
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:52,582
... you will get howls from among
the most liberal Members of Congress.

520
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:56,332
I believe in this military, I am urging
the Senator support this bill,

521
00:38:56,482 --> 00:39:00,019
66 billion dollars for men and women in uniform.

522
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,040
Well I just want to thank the
Chairman for working with me...

523
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,892
... and aiding a hundred million dollars
to upgrade 10 aditional B1 bombers.

524
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:09,398
And that B1 has been a great asset
for the projection of power.

525
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:13,107
The F35 joined strike fighter, the FH22 raptor.

526
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:17,165
Because the military industral
complex has not two legs...

527
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:21,321
it's three. It's a military
and the industry and Congress.

528
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:24,648
For a Congressman defence spending means jobs.

529
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:28,337
These are manufactured in my
district, in Indiana by...

530
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:33,477
Losing hundred defence jobs in his
district could mean five hundred votes.

531
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:39,126
It's not just a hundred workers,
it's the their spouses, their children.

532
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:43,513
It's the representative's duty
to bring home the bacon.

533
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:47,486
I am also greatful for the work that
the health arms services commitee

534
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:51,923
has done to fully fund the
FH22 programme this year.

535
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,124
God bless our contractors.

536
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,826
It is our conclusion that
a Lockheed Martin team...

537
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,735
is the winner of the joined
strike fighter programme.

538
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:11,615
We have a snapshot in time after September 11th,
where at least 71 companies...

539
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:17,654
... that we're able to identify were starting to
get contracts to go in Afghanistan and Iraq.

540
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:21,082
All of the top 10 companies
had former US officials, who...

541
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,727
had worked in the Pentagon or
other parts of US government...

542
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:27,983
.. on the board as directors
or as their top executives.

543
00:40:27,984 --> 00:40:31,424
It's known as a revolving door
and people cashing all the time.

544
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:36,684
Public officials go to work for companies
and they make triple, quadruple, ten times...

545
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:40,310
... sometimes as much money as
they used to make in public service.

546
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:43,302
There's too close relationship
and there's outright.

547
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,574
I hate to use the word 'corruption'...

548
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:48,742
... but it borders on it.
The behaviour of some...

549
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:52,524
of these individuals both in
industry and in the Pentagon.

550
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:58,668
The number one recipient of contracts was vice
president Chaney's former company Halliburton...

551
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,912
... and subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root.

552
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:02,196
KBR

553
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:04,589
We're the army's contractor on the battlefield.

554
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:11,804
Currently 65 thousand KBR people
around the world, assisting the troops.

555
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:15,334
You know the military industrial
complex isn't just the...

556
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:18,901
people in the Pentagon and
people, producing the weapons.

557
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:22,502
It's now increasingly got a
very large service sector.

558
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,558
Ham and eggs.

559
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:31,056
Things that troops used to do by peel potatoes
and do laundry we now have contractors doing.

560
00:41:31,057 --> 00:41:33,175
Somebody has to do this work.

561
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:40,461
And the Halliburton thing is just an outrageous
effort to associate the vice president with...

562
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:46,031
... the activities of a company with which
he has no connection, no connection at all.

563
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:54,752
Congressional critics are questioning whether
Dick Chaney held Halliburton to get billions...

564
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:59,915
The FBI has revealed, it is expanding its
investigation into how Halliburton company

565
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:03,378
built tax payers for its contract in Iraq.

566
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:06,012
And it now appears some of
those contracts were rewarded...

567
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:08,655
with a knowledge and approval
of vice president's office.

568
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,125
Which would seem to contradict
his previous statements.

569
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:14,754
As vice president I have absolutely
no influence of involvement...

570
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:17,758
of knowledge in any way
sharing perform of contracts.

571
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:22,997
We did a report that took 2,5
years, 600,000 dollars, 33 people,

572
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:27,592
including ten investigate
reporters on 6 continents,...

573
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:32,668
...looking at private military companies and
outsourcing war all over the world.

574
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:40,593
And we noticed that in 1992 there was a contract
of 9 million dollars, giving out to a company...

575
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:44,249
... Kellogg Brown and Root,
to study the idea should the

576
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,268
Pentagon start using the private
sector to do some of the...

577
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:51,887
... support type functions
like food service, latrine...

578
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:55,212
duty, but even maybe some
military things as well.

579
00:42:55,213 --> 00:42:58,629
And the Secretary of
Defense at that time was one

580
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:01,863
Dick Chaney. So Chaney goes the contract out.

581
00:43:01,864 --> 00:43:06,193
Kellogg Brown and Root comes back
and says 'This is a terrific idea'.

582
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:11,439
For the next ten years they get 7 or
8 hundred contracts to do just that.

583
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,484
I ran Halliburton and I'm
proud of Halliburton's...

584
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:18,101
This company brought in a
Rollerdeck's guy, a former

585
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:22,381
US Congressman Defense Secretary
Chief of Staff to President

586
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:25,596
to make sure that he could get doors opened...

587
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:29,286
not only in Washington but in
capitals all over the world.

588
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:32,563
And yes, he becomes
personally wealthy from that.

589
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:33,756
No question about it.

590
00:43:33,757 --> 00:43:37,138
Isn't that worth when from
million dollars or less...

591
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:40,813
to 60 or 70 million dollars
that he spend in five years.

592
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:42,162
Are you ready to take the oath?

593
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:43,163
I am.

594
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:45,486
Please raise your right
hand and repeat after me.

595
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:49,395
So we've elected a government
contractor as vice president.

596
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:56,457
This could be Indonesia, it sounds like Russia,
Nigeria, no it's the United States of America.

597
00:43:56,458 --> 00:44:01,309
And everything I just said is entirely legal.
And it is our system of legal corruption.

598
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,822
If I am sure of anything I'm sure of this.

599
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:10,038
Vice president Chaney had nothing to do with
the award of any contract of Halliburton.

600
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:12,920
He wouldn't pick up the
phone, he wouldn't whisper...

601
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,845
in someone's ear, I know
it, he just wouldn't do it.

602
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:19,886
It looks bad, it looks bad
and apparently Halliburton...

603
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:23,879
more than once has overcharged
the federal government.

604
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,400
That's wrong.

605
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:29,479
How would you tackle from that?

606
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,374
I would have a public
investigation of what they've done.

607
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,175
So...

608
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:39,564
What's that? Vice president's
on the phone. Okay.

609
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:41,997
You probably have to take the call from him.

610
00:44:41,998 --> 00:44:46,202
Whenever you get into a situation where
anybody's got unwanted influence,

611
00:44:46,203 --> 00:44:50,353
it has the potential to be deeply distorting.
It corrupts our system.

612
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:55,099
You don't have to show that he directly
came in and hit the cash register button.

613
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,969
The door flew open and he took some
money out and put in his pocket.

614
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,228
It's to say anybody allocating
things at the Department...

615
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:03,901
of Defense knows who the vice president is,...

616
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:06,674
... knows what his connections
are in Halliburton.

617
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:13,582
We have a process that has a seamlessness where
the corporate interest that stand to benefit...

618
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:18,983
... are so intertwined and interwoven
with the political forces.

619
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:22,858
The financial leads and the politically
leads, have become the same people.

620
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,418
You do have to follow the money.

621
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:28,789
If you follow the money here it's not so
much that Halliburton wanted a war...

622
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,892
... so they told Dick Chaney
to go get one for them.

623
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:35,458
It wasn't that. But you do get
a willingness to go to war.

624
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:37,974
On October 10, 20002, the U.S. Congress passed
Joint Resolution 114, granting the President the

625
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:38,915
right to use force against
Iraq at his discretion.

626
00:45:39,015 --> 00:45:48,526
YEAs are 296 the NAYs are 133. The Joint
Resolution has passed without objection.

627
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:52,470
You get a willingness to look
at the cost benefit scenario.

628
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:55,743
American people, who have a son or
a daughter, that's going to be...

629
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:58,676
deployed and maybe shot and
maybe killed or maimed in Iraq.

630
00:45:58,677 --> 00:46:01,977
They look at the cost benefit and they
go 'Hm, I don't think that's good.'

631
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:05,638
When politicians, who understand
contracts, future contracts,

632
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:09,762
when they look at war, they have
a different cost benefit analysis.

633
00:46:09,763 --> 00:46:12,774
The defense budget is 3/4 of a trillion dollars.

634
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:15,948
Profits, went up last
year, well over 25 percent.

635
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:20,540
I guarantee you, when war becomes that
profitable, you're going to see more of it.

636
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:26,476
I don't know how you would want to assess
the reasons United States went to war in Iraq.

637
00:46:26,477 --> 00:46:29,093
But ultimately you have to
ask yourself at the end of...

638
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:31,904
the day, 'Does any of this
contribute to whether or not...

639
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:38,518
... we are making valid and appropriate
decisions about our conductive foreign policy?'

640
00:46:54,485 --> 00:46:56,610
Why do we fight?

641
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:59,910
I don't know why do we fight.

642
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,665
Being a military officer,
I really don't set back...

643
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:05,250
and look at who's with me and who's against me.

644
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:09,334
My job is to make sure that my squad
and my unit is ready to go to war.

645
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:12,071
There's always gonna be people
that disagree with what...

646
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:14,955
we do. And we can't stop that.
That's a part of democracy.

647
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:20,364
From a soldier's perspective and stuff, it
gets all listening to the debates on policy.

648
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:24,681
But it's not ours to decide.
We do what we are told.

649
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:29,198
The first light of dawn is breaking above me.

650
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:35,099
No exclusion to get, that the distance
sound of low rumble all across the city.

651
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:41,526
They know that something is about to happen.

652
00:47:42,256 --> 00:47:46,225
- Did you know what to expect before the war?

653
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:49,909
- I swear to God, no. We don't know.
We're illiterate people.

654
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:53,020
We go out with the sheep and
we come back with them.

655
00:47:55,008 --> 00:48:00,323
We knew that this time the consequences
of the war would be extraordinary.

656
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:03,744
Because the threats were intense.

657
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:07,807
This will be a campaign,
unlike any other in history.

658
00:48:07,808 --> 00:48:13,458
A campaign, characterized by
shock, by surprise, by the...

659
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:19,699
employment of precise ammunitions
on a scale never before seen.

660
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,459
You also have to understand that in trying
to take out Saddam during OIF

661
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,047
we wanted the Iraqi people to
have their infrastructure...

662
00:48:30,147 --> 00:48:33,695
there and not be mad at the coalition forces.

663
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:38,284
That's one of the great-great results
of the military industrial complex.

664
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:41,695
The defense industry, with the
advance in the weaponry now,

665
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,911
we can destroy the target of
our commander's choosing.

666
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:47,801
And minimize collateral damage, which is...

667
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:51,542
such in all composing term,
the risk to innocent life.

668
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:54,092
Nobody's out there to destroy things.

669
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:56,843
Just because I wear a uniform
makes me no different...

670
00:48:56,943 --> 00:49:00,005
than anybody else, that's sitting
here in this room with me.

671
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:04,177
I have the same family, I get up,
I shave just like everybody else.

672
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:06,853
The only difference is there's
times, when I have to...

673
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:09,677
leave my family and go to
another country and go to war.

674
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:13,626
We have the greatest fighting forces
on the face of the earth.

675
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:17,801
Our nation is blessed to have
so many brave men and women...

676
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:21,794
who voluntarily risk their
lives to protect our country.

677
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:30,142
'Every generation has its heroes.
This one is no different.'

678
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:38,528
'Woke up this morning, I suddenly
realized we're all in this together.'

679
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:41,837
Hi, my name is William
Solomon. I'm 23. I have...

680
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,313
decided to enlist in United
States regular Army...

681
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:48,465
...and I'm gonna shipping out on January 26.

682
00:49:48,466 --> 00:49:52,922
The latest stuff that I've been going
through recently, was my mother's death.

683
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:57,481
My financial hardships and my inability to...

684
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:02,548
complete my education,
those three main problems.

685
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:07,793
Plan is simple, it just gonna be solved
by my enlistment in the military.

686
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:11,241
When Will first came in he was
actually talking to the Air Force.

687
00:50:11,374 --> 00:50:14,305
But he asked me a question
about the army aviation...

688
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:17,279
and once he asked me a
question I told him about it.

689
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,452
And then he showed me the
brochure with some of the...

690
00:50:19,552 --> 00:50:22,095
helicopters and then like the
RH-66, it's a stealth helicopter.

691
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:23,361
I was like 'Wait, they got this?'

692
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:27,199
At that point of time I explained to him
our One-Author flight program.

693
00:50:28,414 --> 00:50:30,785
You can take somebody right
off the street as long...

694
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:32,754
as the person has the high school diploma.

695
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:35,919
He can come in, get a good
job guaranteed to you.

696
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:39,534
I think once Will found out about that
he was pretty much locked in.

697
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,492
He was completely unlike what I expected
of recruiter when I first spoke with him.

698
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:54,197
Cause he told me that army recruiters
got the bad reputation of car salesmen.

699
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:59,206
The toughest part about recruiting
is gaining the person's trust.

700
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:02,269
What do we say we back-up with
black and white regulations?

701
00:51:03,678 --> 00:51:06,067
There's no smokes and mirrors around here.

702
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:07,797
You fixed up my life real good man.

703
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:10,372
Because of you I'm gonna retire real nice.

704
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:13,631
Cause I'm thinking of it as a career thing.

705
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,407
Every little bit of strife
I've gone to in my life...

706
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,377
Every little inconvenience, I've always...

707
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:22,635
Since I've signed the papers anyway...

708
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:27,389
I just look at it as something that'll make
basic training that much easier.

709
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,286
AN ARMY OF ONE

710
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,776
One team. One mission. One goal.

711
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,812
BETWEEN 2002 AND 2003, THE
PENTAGON SPENT $1.2 BILLION

712
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,666
ON ADVERTISING INTENDED TO INCREASE RECRUITMENT.

713
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,938
You know the whole idea, you can be
all you can be if you join the army.

714
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:56,358
Look how it appealed to them.

715
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:59,215
You're gonna learn a skill, you're gonna get
a trade, you'll be able to go to college.

716
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,573
It gives you all these benefits,
if you go and serve your country.

717
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:05,466
We appeal to people self-interest.

718
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,904
And then put them into a situation
which is based on self-sacrifice.

719
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,454
I don't really have a much of a blood family.
My mom was the only blood...

720
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:17,719
Hold on.

721
00:52:17,754 --> 00:52:20,138
Hello.
Hello?

722
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:21,215
Yeah, Jimmy.

723
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,779
I've got real good friends and they've been
just as good as a blood family,

724
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:27,265
but not that supportive of me going in this.

725
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:31,907
They try to give me boogie man stories
about what's gonna happen in basic.

726
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:36,798
As rough as basic can be,
this can't be as bad as they say.

727
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,700
I've no word.

728
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:45,161
Right now you have more of
the separation between the military

729
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:48,339
and particularly the middle class
and the upper middle class

730
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,176
in this country than existed
even in the draft era.

731
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:54,392
If you go back to Vietnam,
basically the inequity...

732
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:56,678
of the draft helped prolong the war.

733
00:52:56,713 --> 00:53:01,457
As long as the poor and unrepresented
were dying people went along with it.

734
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:04,999
We got out of Vietnam effectively
when the lottery started

735
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:07,298
and middle class kids were getting killed.

736
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:10,754
First thing that happened was they
went to this all-volunteer army.

737
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:14,504
And that solved the draft inequity problem,
cause everybody's the volunteer.

738
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,700
This is supposedly a Stealth
helicopter which hopefully

739
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:20,525
will go into service by the
time I'll become a pilot.

740
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,047
And that makes the military much easier to use.

741
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:28,857
Because: You guys are fucking volunteers,
screw you, you signed up for this.

742
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:33,142
The objections don't carry as much water.

743
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:41,025
In a period of increased tension, the advantage
gain by flying men into position quickly

744
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,984
might represent the difference between
success or failure in a military operation.

745
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:51,624
I arrived in Vietnam in July of 1965.

746
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:57,213
I was part of the build-up of the 50,000 troops.

747
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:00,448
I remember saying to one of mine bodies:

748
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:04,940
You know, this keeps up, they're gonna
have a 100,000 troops over here.

749
00:54:05,651 --> 00:54:09,708
And he laughed, he said: What are you nuts?
They'd have to declare war for 100,000 troops.

750
00:54:09,743 --> 00:54:14,072
My fellow Americans, renew to cost elections

751
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:19,390
against the United States ships on
the highest ease in the gulf of Tomkin

752
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:23,427
have today required me to
order the military forces...

753
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:26,854
of the United States to take action in reply.

754
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:31,739
I was assigned to a helicopter company,
13th aviation battalion.

755
00:54:31,774 --> 00:54:35,463
I was a door gunner on one of the helicopters.

756
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:39,655
It was quite an experience
for a 21 year old kid.

757
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:43,647
We're involved in taking people's lives.

758
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:54,460
From the perspective of a helicopter,
you're X number hundred to feet.

759
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:58,021
And you're shooting at little dots
that are running around.

760
00:54:58,056 --> 00:55:00,290
You're not shooting at somebody face to face.

761
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:03,413
There's a blue shirt in the trees
around here. Turn right!

762
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,650
It's almost like they're not real human beings.

763
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:11,738
They're objects.

764
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:23,256
As the refugee of war,
I think I understand first hand

765
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:27,147
the suffering, the pain, that war could cost.

766
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,952
I came here when I was 15.

767
00:55:33,237 --> 00:55:40,433
We left Saigon on the 28th of April 1975,
right before the downfall of Saigon.

768
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,780
I was very lucky to make it here intact.

769
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:49,618
I always was very much aware of why I'm here.

770
00:55:49,653 --> 00:55:55,281
It's because our strong thirst for
freedom that brought me here.

771
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:58,629
And the sacrifice of other
people that brought me here.

772
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,808
A full scale evacuation have been ordered.

773
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:05,557
But I do remember the
desperation. A lot of people

774
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:09,930
indeed fell down, the Americans have
left them there for themselves.

775
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:15,350
America deliberately withdrew all the support.

776
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,071
But I step down from the American people.

777
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:25,535
I grew up knowing that
should the situation rise,

778
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,776
you are expected to answer the call
when you country made the call.

779
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:32,488
There was no such thing as:

780
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:36,233
Well I wonder if my country is right,
is anybody lying to me about this?

781
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,817
You don't grow up thinking that.

782
00:56:38,852 --> 00:56:42,695
You grow up saying if the bugle calls, you go.

783
00:56:43,477 --> 00:56:49,216
With time we find out this whole
goal for Tomkin thing was farce

784
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:50,929
and nobody was really attacked.

785
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:52,088
So you say to yourself:

786
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:57,359
You know what, that's really crappy,
why did somebody lie to us?

787
00:56:58,153 --> 00:56:59,469
There was no need to lie.

788
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:05,881
We have been lied to in every military escapade

789
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:10,098
frankly over the last 50-60
years without exception.

790
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:13,200
There's no battery example
probably then Vietnam.

791
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:15,766
You had the President of the United States

792
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:19,042
and the top generals in Pentagon lying about the

793
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:22,452
Gulf of Tomkin incident
that got us into the war.

794
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:25,634
About the casualties, about
how the war was going.

795
00:57:25,669 --> 00:57:28,841
Anyone who has ever looked
closely at the Vietnam war

796
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:34,623
can see that the public and the media
were manipulated substantially.

797
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:38,482
We don't like to think of
ourselves as the militant nation,

798
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:43,185
but we're in fact incredibly
militant and militaristic nation.

799
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,950
It is not a view of ourselves that we wanna
carry around, but the fact is we are.

800
00:57:48,985 --> 00:57:54,129
If the President and the military industrial
complex and defense establishment,

801
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:58,449
if they all have decided that
suddenly there's a problem somewhere,

802
00:57:58,484 --> 00:58:04,021
we need to drop some bombs or even put
blend forces somewhere in some country,

803
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:07,376
this is our ritual that we
have been seeing for decades.

804
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,553
We have toppled governments,
we've done Coup Ousts.

805
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:19,599
We've used intelligence
services for covert purposes...

806
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:21,986
and done horrible things around the world.

807
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:25,977
And we have put up with the most
human rights abusing countries.

808
00:58:26,899 --> 00:58:31,151
We have prop them up, we even trained them
how to commit human rights abuses.

809
00:58:31,981 --> 00:58:34,440
Today's demon was yesterday's friend.

810
00:58:34,475 --> 00:58:39,935
All in the name of either the cold war
or for commercial reasons.

811
00:58:45,698 --> 00:58:51,259
It's basically economic colonialism.
No one uses the colonialism word.

812
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,519
But instead of just taking over the
countries, we have a better way.

813
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:57,608
We just go and have free
markets whether we're trying...

814
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,764
to sell our products to their citizens

815
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,228
or we're trying to mind their resources.

816
00:59:02,263 --> 00:59:04,927
We need to be in that country for some reason,

817
00:59:05,027 --> 00:59:08,398
therefore we're gonna talk
about free markets, free trade.

818
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:12,727
But what's really going on is we want our
companies to get rich in your country.

819
00:59:16,872 --> 00:59:18,386
HALLIBURTON COMPANY PROMOTIONAL FILM 1951

820
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,914
There she is. That's what all the fuss is about.

821
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:24,365
Oil. That's kind of pretty, isn't it?

822
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,538
Oil. Coming up out of the ground and
making life a bit more easy for all of us.

823
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:35,266
The United States is the world's
largest consumer of fossil fuels.

824
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:38,880
Oil is what drives the military
machine of every country.

825
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:43,745
Whether it provides the fuel, or the aircraft
for the ships, for the tanks, for the crocks.

826
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,865
Control of oil is indispensable.
When you run out of it, your army stops.

827
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:54,888
There is a direct connection
between events that happened

828
00:59:54,923 --> 00:59:58,703
more than 50 years ago
and the war in Iraq today.

829
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:06,066
In 1953 the Prime Minister of Iran,
Muhammad Mossadegh became extremely irritated.

830
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:09,768
The British were ripping off his
country's national resources.

831
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:11,751
He wanted a greater share in it.

832
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:16,751
The British came to the new President Eisenhower
and asked for help on this.

833
01:00:16,786 --> 01:00:20,553
Eisenhower very conveniently declared
Mossadegh to be a communist

834
01:00:20,588 --> 01:00:24,373
and we then set the CIA to overthrow him.

835
01:00:24,408 --> 01:00:27,185
Three days of bloody rioting
come to a military...

836
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:31,836
The result was we brought the Shah to power
and he created an extremely repressive regime

837
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,074
that within 20 years had led
to a revolution against him.

838
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:40,002
Ajtulogh Almeny creates a government
that is violently anti-American.

839
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:46,421
Then he said: I pray the God to cut
the hands off all those foreign advisors.

840
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:51,959
In the after action report by the CIA,
on what they had done in the Iran in 1953

841
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:55,252
they said: We're going to
get some blowback from this.

842
01:00:56,402 --> 01:01:00,259
We then made a puppet out
of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

843
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:04,553
Who was a friend of ours.
He was an asset in the CIA's computers.

844
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:08,214
We did so because he was anti-Iranian.

845
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:11,994
He was very fearful that the revolution in Iran

846
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:16,451
which spread into his country
easier for went to war with Iran.

847
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:20,608
The war was extremely bloody.
It went on throughout the 1980s.

848
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,527
Unfortunately for Saddam Hussein
he began to lose the war.

849
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:27,331
At that point in comes the United States
and the former Donald Rumsfeld

850
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:30,035
sent to Saddam Hussein by President Reagan...

851
01:01:30,135 --> 01:01:33,046
to tell him we will supply
you with intelligence.

852
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:36,659
We will supply you with the weapons
you may need through covert means.

853
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,637
It is why Washington say:

854
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:43,066
We know Saddam Hussein had weapons
of mass destruction. We have the receits.

855
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:45,356
This is what we mean by blowback.

856
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:51,773
He remained a friend of ours right up to his
envasion in the summer of 1990 of Quveit.

857
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,361
We became alarmed when he invaded Quveit,

858
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:57,966
that he could also go on and
invade Soudi Arabia itself.

859
01:01:58,001 --> 01:02:00,336
The largest preserves of oil on earth.

860
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:04,648
We station troops inside Arabia.
It was a mistake in every sense of the term.

861
01:02:07,381 --> 01:02:09,470
Remember, Osama bin Laden had said:

862
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:12,600
I resent the government
of Saudi Arabia for using

863
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,602
Americans to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq.

864
01:02:15,637 --> 01:02:20,997
At that point we began to fear that we're going
to lose our position in Saudi Arabia.

865
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:26,070
With the second largest source of proven
reserves on earth are in Iraq.

866
01:02:26,105 --> 01:02:30,668
This leads us now to demonize
our previous ally and

867
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:34,460
to prepare the American public for
the thought that we must take him out.

868
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:48,320
I'm retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.
Retired from military after 20 years.

869
01:02:49,992 --> 01:02:53,623
I initially started in the Air Force.
Then they trained me

870
01:02:53,658 --> 01:02:57,194
as a communicational electronics officer
and I did that for about 15 years.

871
01:02:57,229 --> 01:03:01,496
And once I joined the
Pentagon, I became political...

872
01:03:01,596 --> 01:03:04,885
military affairs officer for Middle East.

873
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:08,304
Things went strange from the
very beginning of my assignment.

874
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:12,824
Within a week or so it became clear
to me that war was gonna happen.

875
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:14,657
This toppling was going to happen.

876
01:03:14,692 --> 01:03:17,054
And it was just the matter of
bringing American people...

877
01:03:17,154 --> 01:03:19,009
up to speed and gain them behind this effort.

878
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:22,516
A number of people from outside of the Pentagon,

879
01:03:22,616 --> 01:03:25,289
political appointees were
flowing into our office.

880
01:03:25,324 --> 01:03:26,771
And they were working Iraq issues.

881
01:03:26,806 --> 01:03:33,678
These political appointees that we had
came from very small set of think tanks.

882
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:38,117
As Eisenhower said: The military industrial
complex is really three components.

883
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:43,836
There's a military professionals, there is
defense industry, and there is Congress.

884
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,461
There is now fourth component,
and that is the think tanks.

885
01:03:49,331 --> 01:03:52,087
One of the little known
secrets in Washington is that

886
01:03:52,122 --> 01:03:56,551
palsy isn't really generated
very much within the palsy apparatus.

887
01:03:56,586 --> 01:04:01,222
A great number of the ideas come
from outside the government.

888
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:05,767
From various think tanks like the
project for The New American Century.

889
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:10,467
Saddam Hussein. Here's the
man, here he is in this box.

890
01:04:10,502 --> 01:04:14,287
I wouldn't exaggerate the influence of
the project The New American Century.

891
01:04:14,322 --> 01:04:16,149
That's a very small think tank.

892
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:21,345
But in some respects we argue
for elements of the Bush doctrine,

893
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,382
before the Bush doctrine existed or
before George W. Bush became President.

894
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,797
The group included principals
like Rumsfeld, but it also included

895
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:33,580
a large number of people more or less
unknown to the American public.

896
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:35,116
And these people all know each other.

897
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:39,451
They'd all work together before
the Bush admininstration.

898
01:04:39,486 --> 01:04:42,495
I used to write speeches for
Don Rumsfeld in the Pentagon.

899
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:48,583
And we came up with this phrase that
weakness is provokative, strength detours.

900
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:52,336
I reported on the Rebuilding America's Defenses
even before September 11th.

901
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:55,745
The Defense budget was too low,
it looked ahead to the kinds of wars

902
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,440
that we've now ended up fighting
in Afganistan and in Iraq.

903
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:04,968
What think tanks do is come up with
new rationalisations and new threats.

904
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:07,127
That's what they're paid to do.

905
01:05:07,162 --> 01:05:12,852
Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a terrorist state.
I think Iran is a terrorist state.

906
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:15,570
North Korea is a very special problem.

907
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:19,478
They can build nuclear weapons and
they're perfectly capable of exporting them.

908
01:05:19,513 --> 01:05:21,388
And we cannot allow that.

909
01:05:21,423 --> 01:05:26,894
These are states that are like host,
but in a way fund international terrorism.

910
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:30,130
Encourage international terrorism.
They have to be eliminated.

911
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:35,421
This was almost completely adopted
by the administration in part,

912
01:05:35,456 --> 01:05:38,885
because the people who wrote this
had open board into the admininstration.

913
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,900
We must prevent the terrorists
and regimes who seek

914
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:47,126
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons
from threatening the United States.

915
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:51,284
It is not at all accidental that
when President names our enemies

916
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:55,439
in the 2002 State of the Union
message as 'the access of evil'.

917
01:05:55,474 --> 01:05:58,654
He includes Iraq, Iran and North Korea.

918
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:02,806
So in a real way we have this new phenomenon

919
01:06:02,841 --> 01:06:06,657
where think tanks are now a part of

920
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:10,264
what we used to think as the
military industrial complex.

921
01:06:11,686 --> 01:06:15,717
Eisenhower may well have been predicting
these people when he talked about:

922
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:18,558
If we didn't keep an eye on
the military industrial complex,

923
01:06:18,593 --> 01:06:22,243
we would see what he called a
disastrous rise of misplaced power.

924
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:27,483
People making policy, who have
zero accountability to the voter.

925
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:32,987
So throughout the summer something was
operating in the Pentagon that was unique.

926
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:37,720
In August of 2002 it was announced
to us that all those folks,

927
01:06:37,755 --> 01:06:40,326
who had come in, made up this expanded Iraq...

928
01:06:40,426 --> 01:06:43,168
desk would be called the
Office of Special Plans.

929
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:48,007
The Office of Special Plans was created
in the Rumsfeld Department of Defense

930
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,852
in order to produce the
intelligence that the President

931
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:55,587
and the vice president wanted
making an enemy out of Iraq.

932
01:06:57,282 --> 01:07:01,569
The Office of Special Plans had one
primary job and that was to produce

933
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:06,585
the set off talking points on the
topic of Iraq, WMD and terrorism.

934
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,980
And we were to use them in
any document that we prepared,

935
01:07:10,015 --> 01:07:12,585
exactly as they were written in their entirety.

936
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,468
We were, myself included, very familiar with
what the intelligence was saying about Iraq.

937
01:07:18,503 --> 01:07:21,625
But the problem was when you look
at what was in these talking points,

938
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,903
you could tell it was designed
to convince the reader

939
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:34,637
that Iraq and Saddam Hussein specifically
constituted a major serious terrible evil threat

940
01:07:34,672 --> 01:07:38,443
to not just his neighbours,
but to the United States.

941
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:41,301
This regime has the design for nuclear weapon,

942
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:45,889
was working on several different
methods of enriching uranium

943
01:07:45,924 --> 01:07:51,111
and recently was discovered seeking significant
qualities of uranium from Africa.

944
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:52,344
And that would be the statement.

945
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:55,224
He's actively seeking it and
this means that he's a danger.

946
01:07:55,259 --> 01:08:02,355
But the intelligence actually said
that Saddam Hussein in the late 80s

947
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:07,053
actively sought materials
in Africa, but he hasn't...

948
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:11,105
done anything like that in the past 12 years.

949
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,437
The statement would act
like he did it yesterday.

950
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:16,353
Taking bits of intelligence
out of context, without...

951
01:08:16,453 --> 01:08:18,900
the qualifiers, without the rest of the story.

952
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:23,537
And placing it as a bullet and
presenting it as if it's a factoid.

953
01:08:23,572 --> 01:08:29,420
There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein
now has weapons of mass destruction.

954
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:33,531
And this was given to us,
action officers to use in papers that

955
01:08:33,566 --> 01:08:37,498
we would prepare for our hire ups, two include
guys like Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld.

956
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:42,105
The United States knows that Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction.

957
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:46,038
The U.K. knows that they have
weapons of mass destruction.

958
01:08:46,073 --> 01:08:49,819
Any country on the face of the earth
with an active intelligence program

959
01:08:49,854 --> 01:08:52,879
knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.

960
01:08:55,475 --> 01:09:03,603
These guys were manipulating public opinion
creating falsehoods and fantasies

961
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:08,956
to inspire fear in the American people,
so that they could have their war.

962
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,331
The President of the United States!

963
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,313
If war is forced upon us,

964
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:23,683
we will fight with the full force and might of
the United States military and we will prevail.

965
01:09:29,306 --> 01:09:32,453
Evidence from the intelligence sources,
secret communications,

966
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:35,712
and statements by people
now in custody reveal that

967
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:41,505
Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists,
including members of Al Qaeda.

968
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:46,599
I remembered when I was in Vietnam,
we use to get requests:

969
01:09:46,634 --> 01:09:52,027
Can you put my father or my son's name
on the side of the helicopter?

970
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:54,161
Can you put it on a rocket?

971
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:58,773
I said: You know what?
That's a good idea.

972
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:02,203
I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna try to do that.

973
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:07,128
So I sent out e-mails to the
secretary of all the arm forces:

974
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:10,178
I'm a retired NY City
Police Department Sergeant,

975
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:11,980
and a proud Vietnam Veteran.

976
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:16,589
I lost my son on 9/11th. I
can't tell you in words...

977
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:18,907
what his loss means to me.

978
01:10:19,745 --> 01:10:24,014
I would respectfully request
if you could put his...

979
01:10:24,114 --> 01:10:27,967
name on some piece of armament in the Iraq War.

980
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:32,256
You know, we haven't caught Bin Laden,
but let's do something.

981
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:35,111
Who's responsible,
Come on, let's hit him!

982
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:37,919
Iraq was responsible.
Good, let's go!

983
01:10:38,563 --> 01:10:40,199
You say Iraq?
Let's go!

984
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,151
Let's get in there,
let's kick the hell out of them.

985
01:10:43,725 --> 01:10:47,792
It turns out it's not that hard
to get a country to go to war.

986
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:51,197
That even in the country
like the United States where

987
01:10:51,232 --> 01:10:54,967
there is freedom of information
and multiple media channels

988
01:10:55,002 --> 01:11:00,360
that an admininstration can just dominate
the debate. Dominate the argument.

989
01:11:00,972 --> 01:11:04,380
We have this idea that we have
lots of information available.

990
01:11:04,415 --> 01:11:07,645
There are so much that's not available
and so much of the 'truth'

991
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:13,699
is obscured by political actors who don't want
the world to see what they're doing.

992
01:11:13,734 --> 01:11:17,078
Needless to say that President is correct.

993
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:28,919
What's going on, I'm sorry to say, is a belief
that the public doesn't need to know.

994
01:11:28,954 --> 01:11:30,349
What your policy is?

995
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:34,337
I'm working my way over to figuring out
how I won't answer that.

996
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:40,055
Limiting access, limiting information
to cover the backsides

997
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:44,902
of those who are in charge
of the war is extremely dangerous.

998
01:11:44,937 --> 01:11:47,015
And cannot and should not be accepted.

999
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:50,754
And I'm sory to say, but up to
including the moment of this interview,

1000
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:53,878
that overwhelmingly it has been accepted.

1001
01:11:53,913 --> 01:11:57,485
And Pentagon for many
years now since the Vietnam

1002
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,230
has worked extremely hard at shaping news
and how the media reports at news.

1003
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:06,578
We train people to say certain
things in a certain way.

1004
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:09,787
Our defeat and humiliation in South Vietnam...

1005
01:12:09,822 --> 01:12:14,437
What they learned from Vietnam above all,
was that they lost the war,

1006
01:12:14,472 --> 01:12:17,440
because they couldn't keep it private
from the American public.

1007
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:22,401
After the Vietnam war the
Pentagon began studying.

1008
01:12:22,436 --> 01:12:26,595
How can we make sure there are no more
body bags in American living rooms?

1009
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:32,965
And we must find the way to no longer allow
reporters in a field actually see death.

1010
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:36,884
You get to the Iraq war
where they discovered this...

1011
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:39,333
new typical Pentagon called it embedding.

1012
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:41,642
Big gun fire coming from
the tops of the building...

1013
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:43,570
We've got to know these marines very well,

1014
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:46,285
we do live with them, we eat with them,
we travel with them.

1015
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,644
But I have I think remained objective...

1016
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,411
The embedding coverage had flies and banners,

1017
01:12:52,446 --> 01:12:57,118
but no one was actually finding out the truth
about the reasons the rationals for going in.

1018
01:12:57,153 --> 01:12:58,953
I have great respect for the media.

1019
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:06,168
Our society is a good solid democracy,
because of a good solid media.

1020
01:13:06,203 --> 01:13:10,925
But I also understand that a lot of times
are just opinions mixed in with news.

1021
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,280
We won't disagree with that, sir.

1022
01:13:12,315 --> 01:13:13,562
Must this be really be honest.

1023
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:17,023
Reporters and news organisations
need access to power.

1024
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:19,589
They need the President,
they need the Defense Secretary,

1025
01:13:19,624 --> 01:13:23,945
they need these people to speak,
to be on camera, to do interviews.

1026
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:28,339
What you have is a miniature version
what you have in totalitarian state.

1027
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:31,635
They produce films about how
great the great leader is,

1028
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,947
how it's getting greater in every way every day.

1029
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:43,218
There will be a day of reckoning for the
Iraqi regime and that day is drawing near.

1030
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:48,104
Ladies and gentlemen, the
United States army orchestra.

1031
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:04,797
Saddam Hussein and his sons
must leave Iraq within 48 hours.

1032
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:08,646
Their refusal to do so will
result in military conflict.

1033
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:07,410
I've only got what's left and I'd rather spend
as much time with my friends as possible.

1034
01:15:08,157 --> 01:15:11,632
I got my stuff in storage.

1035
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:16,797
Except for this TV, a couple of weights there
and this right here, this hangers

1036
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:21,130
and this Snoopy soap thing
I've had since before I can remember.

1037
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:24,105
That's just stuff I won't put in storage
cause of its sentimental value.

1038
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:28,179
Never really had that many feelings of place.

1039
01:15:28,214 --> 01:15:32,249
My mom lived here for a while.
But my mom is not here anymore,

1040
01:15:32,284 --> 01:15:37,448
so all the feelings I had associate with
that place went away along with my mom.

1041
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:43,271
There was a point when I almost
blamed myself for my mom's passing.

1042
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:44,464
I'm handing over the keys...

1043
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,983
Because she so didn't want
me to go into service.

1044
01:15:47,018 --> 01:15:49,368
I had spoken with her about it.

1045
01:15:49,403 --> 01:15:52,353
I said: If anything goes wrong,
I'm gonna have to go into the service.

1046
01:15:52,388 --> 01:15:55,275
I told her that. If anything goes wrong,

1047
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:59,142
if you pass away. I'm gonna
have to go into service.

1048
01:15:59,177 --> 01:16:03,243
Because as it is, I can't
take care of myself normally.

1049
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:06,789
What I'm gonna miss the most, just a normal
day sitting down with my friends,

1050
01:16:06,824 --> 01:16:10,002
cause that's not what I gonna get from months
on the stretch. That I'm gonna miss.

1051
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,966
And this view right here. This view
looking outside of the window.

1052
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:16,254
I've been seeing this since 1990.

1053
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:20,059
I used to hate this view,
I think somehow I still do.

1054
01:16:20,094 --> 01:16:22,425
But that's strange to think
I'm gonna actually miss it.

1055
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,094
Probably not. That's just buildings.

1056
01:16:25,129 --> 01:16:26,617
That's my friends who I'm gonna miss.

1057
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:32,907
I have two sons and I won't allow none of my
children to serve in the United States military.

1058
01:16:32,942 --> 01:16:37,429
If you join the military now, you are not
defending the United States of America.

1059
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:42,602
You are helping certain policy makers
pursue an imperial agenda.

1060
01:16:47,363 --> 01:16:51,291
On February of 2003 ten
million people around the world

1061
01:16:51,326 --> 01:16:54,337
marched to demonstrate against the war in Iraq.

1062
01:16:54,372 --> 01:16:57,146
The largest demonstrations in British history.

1063
01:16:57,181 --> 01:17:00,246
2 million in London. 400
thousand in New York city.

1064
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:03,281
A million each in Berlin, Madrid, Rome.

1065
01:17:04,028 --> 01:17:10,061
On this February day as this nation
stands at the brink of battle,

1066
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:15,711
every American on some level must
be contemplating the possibility of war.

1067
01:17:17,057 --> 01:17:29,537
And yet this chamber is for the most part
harmoniously, harmoniously dreadful and silent.

1068
01:17:31,601 --> 01:17:34,370
You can hear a pin drop. Listen.

1069
01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:38,401
There's no debate.

1070
01:17:39,511 --> 01:17:45,368
There's no attempt to lay out from the nation
prose and cons of this particular war.

1071
01:17:45,403 --> 01:17:49,522
We have a Congress that failed in every way

1072
01:17:49,557 --> 01:17:53,777
to ask the right questions,
to hold the President to account.

1073
01:17:53,812 --> 01:17:55,420
Our Congress failed us miserably.

1074
01:17:55,455 --> 01:17:59,544
And that's because many in Congress are
beholden to the military industrial complex.

1075
01:17:59,579 --> 01:18:03,835
I would think Eisenhower...
He must be rolling over in his grave.

1076
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:10,515
In some ways the military industrial complex
may become so pervasive that it's now invisible.

1077
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:16,462
This is about ideas and influence,
what's safe for your career.

1078
01:18:16,497 --> 01:18:23,477
Being seen in opposition to strong
defense policies is the liability.

1079
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:26,486
Not just for politician who
wants to run for President,

1080
01:18:26,521 --> 01:18:29,674
but for an expert who wants
to make a name in town,

1081
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:32,692
for a journalist who wants
to get his or her story...

1082
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,401
on a front page of the paper.

1083
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:42,775
In this way we're strickting the level of
discussion to this rush for war.

1084
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:45,275
Mr. Vice President, do you
think the American people

1085
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:50,327
are prepared for a long
costly and bloody battle?

1086
01:18:50,362 --> 01:18:53,034
I don't think it's likely to unfold that way,

1087
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:55,355
because I really do believe we
will be greeters liberators.

1088
01:19:02,953 --> 01:19:06,535
Now we're just starting to see the
creepings of the sun coming up.

1089
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:11,170
As we approach the city
low deck of clouds showed up.

1090
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,111
In the past that would have been the bad thing,

1091
01:19:13,211 --> 01:19:15,449
cause in the airfront 17 we
dropped lazer guided bombs.

1092
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,979
So if you can't see your target,
you can't drop a bomb on it.

1093
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:21,538
This day I had the enhanced TV,
now I was kind of happy.

1094
01:19:21,573 --> 01:19:25,007
They couldn't see me, I couldn't see them.
But my bomb could find a spot on the ground.

1095
01:19:25,984 --> 01:19:28,921
Still people are heading towards west.

1096
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,282
The target area was called Dora farms.

1097
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:40,168
It was a Presidential type palace
along of the side of the river.

1098
01:19:40,203 --> 01:19:43,241
I see the river. I know I'm
in right part of the town...

1099
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:45,607
where I was told I need to deliver a bomb.

1100
01:19:45,642 --> 01:19:54,518
And let's just have a look at the scenes live,
sirens are being sounded in the Iraqi capital.

1101
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:58,520
Pressed in across the target I think
our time over target was about 0530.

1102
01:19:58,555 --> 01:20:01,853
And so I let the bombs go.
Let them ring.

1103
01:20:01,888 --> 01:20:03,904
Those sirens...

1104
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:08,389
I think it's been heating up.

1105
01:20:10,424 --> 01:20:15,093
We dropped 4 enhanced TBU 2000
pump bunker satellite guided.

1106
01:20:17,511 --> 01:20:19,241
There's the large blast.

1107
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:22,904
They both came off.
Seemed to come off.

1108
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:25,855
I didn't notice anything at first,
I dropped bombs before.

1109
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,465
When the weapons flew out
of the airplane, I realized

1110
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,460
that this is the opening strike
of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

1111
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:36,671
And I said: Well, if we did our job tonight,
this whole thing might be over tomorrow.

1112
01:20:59,306 --> 01:21:02,231
Honestly what we saw the first day
of the war astonished us.

1113
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:06,488
And most of the doctors
were in a state of anger.

1114
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:12,576
There were shrapnel injuries
to women and children, civilians...

1115
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:15,414
...all of them were civilians.

1116
01:21:16,353 --> 01:21:18,843
In the first days of war,
we didn't receive any soldiers.

1117
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:22,058
The first group was from Dora.

1118
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:25,926
The wounded were civilians
who were in their houses at dawn...

1119
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:28,113
...when an explosion happened.

1120
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:32,899
There's no question the strike on that
leadership headquarters was successful.

1121
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:34,870
We have photographs of what took place.

1122
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:40,925
The mystery of what happened begins here,
at a palace compound called Dora farms.

1123
01:21:41,678 --> 01:21:46,789
One weapon clearly missed. Others landed just
outside the wall destroying other buildings.

1124
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:53,084
What happened was my son and
my brother's two sons were in a house.

1125
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:59,562
In Dora. They were in a
house with their friend...

1126
01:22:00,976 --> 01:22:02,280
...and a missile fell on them.

1127
01:22:09,764 --> 01:22:13,797
I think I was reading something
about the bombing in Iraq.

1128
01:22:13,832 --> 01:22:18,241
And I get this e-mail: To
major Thomas. V. Johnson...

1129
01:22:18,341 --> 01:22:21,909
from lieutenant commandor Stephen Franzoni.

1130
01:22:21,944 --> 01:22:24,440
The private to the capral
to the captain to this...

1131
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:28,281
It must have been like 42 e-mails.

1132
01:22:28,316 --> 01:22:31,592
And some of them was saying:
Well I don't know if we can do this.

1133
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,711
Normally we do not take personal requests.

1134
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:38,868
Son died on 9/11. He wants to know
if we could put his name on bomb.

1135
01:22:38,903 --> 01:22:43,364
Piercing it up Harry, this is Jerry.
Do you think we can do something like that?

1136
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:45,632
Joe, fairly easy, don't you think?

1137
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:48,262
Well, let me go ask Harry.

1138
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,852
And you read this whole list of e-mails.

1139
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:54,749
Sorry for the delay, but business is booming.

1140
01:22:54,784 --> 01:22:57,720
The weapons don't stay still
long enough to write on them.

1141
01:22:57,755 --> 01:23:03,382
And finally it goes to this Marine Air Division.

1142
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:05,814
Can do. Semper Fi.

1143
01:23:06,692 --> 01:23:08,123
I get back to pictures.

1144
01:23:09,702 --> 01:23:13,165
I'm looking at the picture
that's saying: Holy smokes!

1145
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,766
This is a picture of bomb and
then a close-up of the same bomb.

1146
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:21,797
And on the side of it:
In loving memory of Jason Sekzer.

1147
01:23:22,756 --> 01:23:27,757
And the story that this is
a 2000 pound guided bomb

1148
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:35,975
and that it was dropped on April, 1
and it met with 100% success.

1149
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:41,373
The weapons that are being used
today have a degree of precision

1150
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:45,334
that no one ever imagined.

1151
01:23:48,329 --> 01:23:50,813
A family inside their house
sleeping and they bomb them.

1152
01:23:50,848 --> 01:23:53,791
Is that smart? Is that a smart missile?

1153
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:57,391
For a long time the Americans
military's been emphasising

1154
01:23:57,426 --> 01:24:00,529
this idea of precision guided ammunitions.

1155
01:24:00,564 --> 01:24:05,232
That we can now wage war and
prevent casualties to civilians.

1156
01:24:05,267 --> 01:24:08,783
It's simply isn't true. The
bombs aren't that reliable.

1157
01:24:08,818 --> 01:24:11,350
The precision guidance isn't that good.

1158
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,702
I would say is there a personal computer owner

1159
01:24:14,737 --> 01:24:19,457
who's not had his machine bomb on him
or loses work that day

1160
01:24:19,492 --> 01:24:21,545
there's not a one who
hasn't had that experience.

1161
01:24:22,663 --> 01:24:25,434
During the first 6 months of
the Iraq war, 50 precision...

1162
01:24:25,534 --> 01:24:27,964
airstrikes were conducted
against Iraqi leadership.

1163
01:24:27,999 --> 01:24:31,241
Of these strikes, none hit its intended target.

1164
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:34,322
Now the military industrial
complex is handling it.

1165
01:24:34,357 --> 01:24:38,609
He provided guys with all sorts of weapons
and basically a level of technical arrogance

1166
01:24:38,644 --> 01:24:41,381
that we can go do anything we want
cause we got smart weapons,

1167
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:44,791
that'll do the job with
minimum of collateral damage.

1168
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:47,069
But it's be as far as I'm concerned.

1169
01:24:48,237 --> 01:24:52,041
NAJI SHEESHAN Director, Baghdad Morgue

1170
01:25:00,815 --> 01:25:04,800
The yard of the hospital
was filled with corpses.

1171
01:25:12,249 --> 01:25:14,568
The corpses that we saw, ninety
percent of them were civilians...

1172
01:25:14,603 --> 01:25:17,932
I have records to confirm
it. I can show you the books.

1173
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:19,338
Ninety percent were civilians.

1174
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:20,376
Children.

1175
01:25:20,411 --> 01:25:22,703
I can show you in my books.

1176
01:25:23,504 --> 01:25:28,269
This is the special record book
for the people killed in the war.

1177
01:25:29,282 --> 01:25:30,188
Housewife...

1178
01:25:30,453 --> 01:25:31,054
Soldier...

1179
01:25:31,247 --> 01:25:32,055
Student... Student...

1180
01:25:32,432 --> 01:25:33,392
Soldier... Student...

1181
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,816
Civilian... Housewife...

1182
01:25:35,137 --> 01:25:36,065
Civilian... Civilian...

1183
01:25:36,485 --> 01:25:37,513
Worker... Housewife...

1184
01:25:37,729 --> 01:25:38,965
Worker... Worker...

1185
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:40,517
Child... Child...

1186
01:25:40,894 --> 01:25:41,984
Housewife... Housewife...

1187
01:25:42,223 --> 01:25:44,403
Housewife... Female student...

1188
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:57,118
There's no security, no freedom.
There's nothing.

1189
01:26:08,118 --> 01:26:09,427
Still seems like a dream to me.

1190
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:12,345
I mean we tell stories about it,
we sit down and talk with our kids.

1191
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,193
You get some tough questions.

1192
01:26:14,228 --> 01:26:18,401
You get asked by your daughter:
Did you go out and tried to kill Saddam Hussein?

1193
01:26:18,436 --> 01:26:20,866
And that's a tough one to
answer to a little kid.

1194
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:23,653
When we saw him on TV, one said:

1195
01:26:24,318 --> 01:26:27,195
I guess we didn't get him.
But in the end we got him.

1196
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:33,000
How many times in a lifetime does
an individual get the opportunity

1197
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:40,200
to get the opening shots in a
conflict that will liberate people.

1198
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:21,610
You got a weapon?

1199
01:27:35,924 --> 01:27:38,816
So let there be no doubt
that the liberation of Iraq...

1200
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:40,173
27,000 MORE U.S. TROOPS

1201
01:27:41,658 --> 01:27:43,127
U.S. TOLL REACHES 500

1202
01:27:45,631 --> 01:27:48,432
U.S. TOLL IN IRAQ CROSSES 2,000 MILESTONE

1203
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:51,832
With U.S. casualties mounting in Iraq...

1204
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:56,214
Bomb exploded and two men were shed
there today on a horrific scale.

1205
01:27:58,056 --> 01:28:02,619
Under fire from critics who charge he's been
blurring the lines between Iraq and 9/11th

1206
01:28:02,654 --> 01:28:05,264
President Bush was forced to clarify yesterday.

1207
01:28:05,299 --> 01:28:09,912
Now we've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein
was involved with the Septermber, the 11th.

1208
01:28:12,828 --> 01:28:14,076
What did you just say?

1209
01:28:14,111 --> 01:28:16,112
I mean I almost jumped out of chair.

1210
01:28:16,947 --> 01:28:23,207
I don't know how people got the
idea that I connected Iraq to 9/11.

1211
01:28:23,921 --> 01:28:26,480
Was he nuts? What the hell we go in there for?

1212
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:28,927
We're getting back for 9/11th.

1213
01:28:28,962 --> 01:28:32,361
If he didn't have anything to do with 9/11,
why we're going in there?

1214
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:33,601
I was mad.

1215
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:39,421
My first thought is: You're a liar.

1216
01:28:45,472 --> 01:28:47,073
I'm from the old school.

1217
01:28:47,108 --> 01:28:48,813
Certain people walk on water.

1218
01:28:49,403 --> 01:28:51,672
And President of the United
States is one of them.

1219
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:56,931
If I can't trust the President of
the United States, I don't know...

1220
01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:00,949
It's a terrible thing when Americans
can't trust their President.

1221
01:29:02,268 --> 01:29:04,717
You begin to wonder what a
hell is with the whole system?

1222
01:29:04,752 --> 01:29:07,111
There's something wrong with the entire system.

1223
01:29:13,443 --> 01:29:16,601
The government exploited
my feelings of patriotism.

1224
01:29:18,195 --> 01:29:23,266
Of deep desire for revenge
for what happened to my son.

1225
01:29:25,509 --> 01:29:33,068
But I was so insane with wanting to get even,
I was willing to believe anything.

1226
01:29:39,263 --> 01:29:43,867
Undoubtedly there are people
who may listen to my statements

1227
01:29:43,902 --> 01:29:47,535
and think that I'm no good,

1228
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:49,708
I'm a war monger, I'm this, I'm that, whatever.

1229
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:51,332
I should never put my son's name on it,

1230
01:29:51,432 --> 01:29:53,526
I should be ashamed that
I put my son's name on it.

1231
01:29:56,951 --> 01:30:02,271
Am I sorry I asked for my son's name
to be put on the bomb?

1232
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:10,452
No, because I acted under
the conditions at that time.

1233
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:13,913
Was it wrong?
It was wrong, but I didn't know that.

1234
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:19,428
So is it regrettable?

1235
01:30:43,413 --> 01:30:47,770
The reason we're in Iraq first has not honestly
been told to the American people.

1236
01:30:47,805 --> 01:30:50,312
It's certainly had nothing to do with
the liberation of the Iraqi people.

1237
01:30:50,347 --> 01:30:53,998
It was never part of the agenda,
and it's not part of the agenda now.

1238
01:30:54,758 --> 01:30:58,446
We know we did not have an exit strategy
in the invasion of Iraq,

1239
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:00,129
because we didn't intend to leave.

1240
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:04,946
We are in the process right now of
building 14 permanent bases in Iraq.

1241
01:31:06,245 --> 01:31:11,486
There is this incredible point right now,
that we are invincible

1242
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:14,833
and we are the preeminent power on planet Earth.

1243
01:31:15,628 --> 01:31:23,028
American power and Amercan empire is actually
flaunted in people's faces around the world

1244
01:31:23,063 --> 01:31:28,834
where we rub our shoe in their face
and tell them that we're tough.

1245
01:31:30,465 --> 01:31:34,945
And you will work with us because you
sure as hell don't wanna be against us.

1246
01:31:35,984 --> 01:31:39,777
The world is changed and we're not
going back to where we were.

1247
01:31:39,812 --> 01:31:45,526
I find one of the sillier ideas
is the notion that you hear all the time

1248
01:31:45,561 --> 01:31:49,226
that American policy has been hijacked by people

1249
01:31:49,261 --> 01:31:53,458
and as soon as they're out of there
we're gonna go back to the way it was.

1250
01:31:53,493 --> 01:31:55,209
They're wrong about that.

1251
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:58,721
Because we're not the same
people we were before.

1252
01:32:02,326 --> 01:32:04,401
We're walking on thin ice.

1253
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:09,869
We are creating the same path
taken by the first democratic regime

1254
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:13,137
ever created in the western world
namely the Roman Republic.

1255
01:32:13,172 --> 01:32:17,452
The Roman Republic inadvertently acquired
the empire around the world

1256
01:32:17,487 --> 01:32:20,892
and then they discovered
that to maintain, expand,

1257
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:23,795
protect this empire
they require standing armies.

1258
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:27,030
Standing armies is what
George Washington warned us against.

1259
01:32:27,065 --> 01:32:31,879
It's his farewell address that they will
destroy the structure of goverment

1260
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:37,477
that we try to create in our constitution
to prevent the rise of imperial presidency.

1261
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:45,049
The single most important article in our
constitution is the one that gives the right

1262
01:32:45,084 --> 01:32:48,455
to go to war exclusively to
the elected representatives...

1263
01:32:48,555 --> 01:32:50,097
of people, to the Congress.

1264
01:32:50,132 --> 01:32:54,546
Our Congress in October of 2002
voted in both houses

1265
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:59,969
to give this power to a single man, including
the use of nuclear weapons if he so chose.

1266
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:05,529
And of course less than 6 months later
he did choose to excercise it in Iraq.

1267
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:10,300
For too long our culture has said:
If it feels good, do it.

1268
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:14,694
Now America is embracing a
new ethic and a new creed.

1269
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:16,198
Let's rule.

1270
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:21,804
I think of the history of the
United States as a work in progress

1271
01:33:21,839 --> 01:33:26,036
and our attempted democracy
here is a constant struggle

1272
01:33:26,071 --> 01:33:27,956
between capitalism and democracy.

1273
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:31,989
And there have been absent flows
where democracy looks like it's winning.

1274
01:33:32,024 --> 01:33:37,758
You reign in those powerful forces,
but the fundamental reality is that most

1275
01:33:37,793 --> 01:33:40,905
of the government's decisions
today are substantially...

1276
01:33:41,005 --> 01:33:43,213
dictated by powerful corporate interest.

1277
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:45,254
Clearly capitalism is winning.

1278
01:33:50,473 --> 01:33:52,510
Due to this behavior, America will fail.

1279
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:54,841
She will fail completely among the countries.

1280
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:57,463
And another country will rise
and take America's place.

1281
01:33:57,498 --> 01:34:01,948
I am not a political man, but that is
my analysis as an ordinary person.

1282
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:06,265
America will lose because her behavior
is not the behavior of a great nation.

1283
01:34:07,673 --> 01:34:13,080
In my lifetime I have seen the collapse
of the Nazi, of the imperial Japanese,

1284
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:16,530
of the British, French,
Dutch and Russian empires.

1285
01:34:16,565 --> 01:34:18,173
They go down pretty easily.

1286
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,209
What I want Americans to understand today,

1287
01:34:21,244 --> 01:34:25,254
the price of liberty is eternal vigilance
and we've not been vigilant.

1288
01:34:25,289 --> 01:34:29,826
Since Dwight Eisenhower issued
his warning to us back in 1961

1289
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:35,073
about the dangers of unauthorised power in
the form of the military industrial complex.

1290
01:34:35,108 --> 01:34:36,740
We should take nothing for granted.

1291
01:34:36,775 --> 01:34:43,104
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen
can compel the proper meshing

1292
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:46,561
of the huge industrial and
military machinery of defense...

1293
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:48,730
with our peaceful methods and goals.

1294
01:34:48,765 --> 01:34:52,340
So that security and liberty
may prosper together.

1295
01:34:55,227 --> 01:34:57,736
You gotta realize 20 years in
the military you're trained

1296
01:34:57,771 --> 01:35:01,391
always to respect authority,
to be a team player.

1297
01:35:02,624 --> 01:35:07,594
When the war started in Iraq,
I hit a targeting point...

1298
01:35:07,694 --> 01:35:11,140
where my values as an officer diverged.

1299
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:14,859
I had to basically remove myself.

1300
01:35:16,531 --> 01:35:18,434
So, why we fight?

1301
01:35:18,469 --> 01:35:21,285
I think we fight cause too many people
are not standing up saying:

1302
01:35:21,387 --> 01:35:22,519
I'm not doing this anymore.
