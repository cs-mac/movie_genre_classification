<i>NARRATOR: Following months
of high rainfall,</i>

2
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:38,787
the river Seine begins to rise
more rapidly than normal.

3
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,674
Over the course of the last week,

4
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,974
<i>thousands of Parisians living nearby the
river</i>

5
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:45,631
have already evacuated.

6
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,191
<i>To continue moving throughout the city,</i>

7
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:50,475
<i>residents travel by boat or across</i>

8
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,447
<i>a series of wooden walkways
built by Parisians themselves.</i>

9
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:58,530
<i>The water reaches a height
of 20 feet above the normal.</i>

10
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,279
<i>The Eiffel Tower has wet feet.</i>

11
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,578
Emile, hey! Over here!

12
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:47,166
- Let me take that.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,446
You know, Emile, I only have one regret.

14
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,500
You do? What?

15
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,509
That it took you two years
to ask me for a date.

16
00:01:56,544 --> 00:01:58,437
I... I was scared you'd say no.

17
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,331
Oh, Emile. I wish I had known.

18
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,242
All that time wasted.

19
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,806
Maud, my darling.
Don't let your mind dwell on that.

20
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,678
The past is past. The future is ours.

21
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,375
Nothing. Nothing can come between us
now.

22
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,914
Emile!

23
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,159
It's show time! What do you
got?

24
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,924
To the left! Yes, parry! To the right!

25
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,419
Whoa!

26
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,787
It's a dragon!

27
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,154
What on earth is a dragon doing in
France?

28
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,486
What on earth is a dragon doing on earth?

29
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:46,835
Oh, no!

30
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,983
Okay, come on! Here it is!

31
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:03,810
Whew.

32
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,085
Come on.

33
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,295
Hmm.

34
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,942
Hey.

35
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,398
Hello, Raoul.

36
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,562
Well, hello, Maud.
Look at you. Petite as always.

37
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,518
That's a lovely dress. What is that?

38
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,440
- Kind of an eggplant?
- Oh, thank you.

39
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:51,562
Um, I think it's more of a purple.

40
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,031
More of an eggplant I think.

41
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,017
Is Emile in? I have something for him.

42
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,969
No, I guess it is kind of an eggplant.

43
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,514
- Oh. The new Melies film!
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,232
He'll be so excited, it's his idol.

45
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:02,250
- Hey, Emile!
- Oh!

46
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,310
- Hey, Raoul!
- Catch this!

47
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,690
Oh! Oh, that's embarrassing.

48
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,510
Hey You!
"oh!

49
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,377
Come on, come on. Quick.

50
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,196
Okay, not looking.

51
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,408
- I can't see anything now.
- Come on, come on!

52
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:20,810
Going somewhere, Emile?

53
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,507
I have to go to Barbers to buy a new belt.

54
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:23,980
Obviously.

55
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,450
Oh, no, no. A belt for my projector.

56
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:31,004
Since when do you put
pants on your projector?

57
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,250
- Pants on my projector?
- Yeah, because uh... Never mind.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,829
Do you need a lift? It's on my route.

59
00:04:37,864 --> 00:04:38,606
Catherine is right...

60
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,027
Oh! Catherine!

61
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,016
Come on! Could you stop the...

62
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:44,375
Sorry! Come here!

63
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,922
Come on, bad truck! Come back.

64
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,435
So, I'll see you later
at the screening?

65
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,305
Yes. Uh, yes, you will.

66
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,488
You know, Maud,

67
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,793
I was wondering if...

68
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,137
If you don't mind...

69
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,601
- Uh, maybe... Maybe you would...
- Yes! Of course I would.

70
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,351
You would?

71
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,557
Ah, yes, yes... That!

72
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,422
Well, yes, of course... I mean, thank you.

73
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:18,960
Uh, here. Thank you, Maud.

74
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,728
Um, anything else, Emile?

75
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,533
Yes. Uh...

76
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,289
Well, I thought perhaps
after the screening...

77
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,941
Emile, buddy! Let's shake a leg.
I'm on a schedule here.

78
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:34,969
You'll have plenty of time
to woo Maud when you're back.

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,722
Bye!

80
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,059
EMILE: Well, thank you very much, Raoul!

81
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,863
Well, you're very welcome, Emile.

82
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:52,073
Uh, for what?

83
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,195
I was talking to her and you ruined it!

84
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,192
You little devil, you!
Let me pinch those cheeks.

85
00:05:57,227 --> 00:06:00,154
You finally decided to ask her out, didn't
you?

86
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,244
Well, no, it's so complicated.

87
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,038
What's so complicated?
You ask her out, she swoons.

88
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,737
She says yes, you swoon back.
Deal sealed. You're on a date.

89
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,310
EMILE: It's not that simple.

90
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:10,920
Every time I see her,

91
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,220
my tongue kind of gets glued
to the top of my mouth.

92
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,092
Which is why you write her a letter.

93
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,893
The only thing you have to glue then
is an envelope.

94
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:19,928
A letter.

95
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,139
That's not a bad idea!

96
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:24,336
Of course that's not a bad idea.
It's a great idea. I had it!

97
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,336
- I'll help you if you want.
- I got a way with words as you know.

98
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,951
EMILE: Well... I do know.

99
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,531
But do you know much about love, Raoul?

100
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,574
Do I...

101
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,366
Oh, you are adorable. Do I know about
love?

102
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,550
Do you have any idea
what they say around Paris?

103
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,163
When Raoul is on the prowl,
the kitty cats all meow!

104
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:46,215
- EMILE: Oh. That does rhyme.
- It better than rhymes, my friend.

105
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,625
Hello, Madame Omelette!

106
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,425
Hope you're not feeling too scrambled
today

107
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,688
and you're feeling nice and over-easy.

108
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,631
Where... Where are my eggs?

109
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,175
It's not that I don't trust you, Raoul,

110
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,044
but the way you drive,
I figured it's safer to deliver the eggs

111
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,939
with a little padding.

112
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:03,997
Great!

113
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,134
- Raoul, are you okay?
- No I'm fine, it's just...

114
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,435
Allergies!

115
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,244
MAN: Hey!

116
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,585
- Moron!
- RAOUL: Sorry, honey!

117
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,109
EMILE: You drive very fast!

118
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,401
I know!

119
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:26,300
Ever since Catherine runs on
sunflower oil, she really flies.

120
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,214
Uh, speaking of flies...
Your coat. It's very itchy!

121
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,580
It feels like straw.

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,697
Straw? Are you kidding? What I paid for
this?

123
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,225
Oh, Emile.

124
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,556
This is genuine 100%...

125
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,486
...rare!

126
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:46,506
The flood of the century!
Commissioner's popularity sinks as...

127
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,441
- As fast as the water rises!
- Uh, Raoul!

128
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:50,983
Oh!

129
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,144
Whoa!

130
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:05,718
Oh.

131
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:11,868
Oh, no.

132
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,525
<i>RAOUL: I hate birds!</i>

133
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,986
- EMILE: Thank you, Raoul!
- Don't mention it, big man!

134
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:31,842
See you later!

135
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,058
Hey! Watch where you're going!

136
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,344
Here. A brand new second-hand belt.

137
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,899
- Anything else?
- Uh, maybe.

138
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,391
Mmm-hmm. She's a beauty, isn't she?

139
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,092
Oh, yes!

140
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,614
- What's that?
- What is that?

141
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,013
That is the future!

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,809
No, that! Is it straw?

143
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,540
No. Okay. Now, back to the future.

144
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,756
You see? No more blisters,
no more dirty clothes,

145
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,262
no more aches and pains.

146
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,028
All comfort, no effort! That's the future.

147
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,076
- Okay. But what does it do?
- What does it do?

148
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:12,470
It does...

149
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,860
Well...

150
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,455
- Bye-bye now! Thank you.
- Thank you.

151
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,213
Uh, bye!

152
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,965
My camera.

153
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,993
Oh, look at that!

154
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,555
This is beautiful.

155
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,909
That's... That's my camera.

156
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,459
Wait! He's running away.

157
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,009
Thief! Thief!

158
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay? Well, okay. Oh, right, right, right.

159
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,360
- My camera!
- MAN: Hey, stop, thief!

160
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,310
Oh, no. It's not supposed to do that.

161
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,573
Huh? That's fantastic!

162
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,658
It worked great yesterday!

163
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,275
Okay. Maybe if I just press...

164
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,444
Oh. Hey!

165
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,377
One. Two.

166
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,872
And it's supposed to do that?

167
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,342
Raoul! Thank you. Thank you so much!

168
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,501
You saved my life!

169
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,470
- Uh, I did?
- Yes. Look.

170
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,958
And three. And I meant to do that!

171
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,879
Now, we are all nice and warmed up,
let's deliver those babies.

172
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,595
Uh, I don't know if I can.

173
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,183
It's just that I don't want to be late.

174
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,153
Don't worry. We're gonna get there in a
flash.

175
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,412
Wow!

176
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,268
RAOUL: You're gonna love the professor.
He's a real character.

177
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,173
Way ahead of his time.
A real visionary. A little like myself.

178
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,395
Too bad he never lets me see his work.

179
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:02,920
Maybe he's shy?

180
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,684
Yes, maybe. Professor!

181
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,083
- Oh, apparently very shy!
- Hmm.

182
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,011
Okay, what have we got?

183
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,572
"Dear Raoul, I am in New York
for a conference.

184
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:13,530
"Just leave the peat outside.

185
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,900
"In my absence, Charles will take care of it.

186
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:16,883
- Hmm.
- Who's Charles?

187
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,448
RAOUL: Charles, come on.

188
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:23,666
Oh!

189
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,601
Oh! "Charles, Assistant Botanist. "

190
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:29,280
Hello, Charles.

191
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,907
Now, let's get those precious bags inside.

192
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,071
We wouldn't want them to get wet.
Right, Charles?

193
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:35,244
What? Okay.

194
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,113
"Well, now that you're inside,
just leave the peat at the door.

195
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:41,017
"Whatever you do, don't... "
"... touch anything. "

196
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:41,999
"Thank you. Good day. "

197
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,946
Okay. Okay, I get it.

198
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,954
The professor seems to know you pretty
well!

199
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:46,989
Yeah. Yeah.

200
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,204
EMILE: WOW!

201
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,663
Beautiful.

202
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:58,387
Another job well done.
For peat's sake! Right?

203
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:02,224
'Cause it's peat!
Get it? Do you get it?

204
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:02,909
Pete's sake?

205
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,616
You're a monkey.

206
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,779
All right! Ready for a quick tour?

207
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,335
But the monkey said
we weren't supposed to...

208
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,783
The monkey said, come on! You could
film it!

209
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,379
Imagine, Your own jungle movie!
I play the brave explorer.

210
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:18,884
- What do you think?
- You think I could?

211
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,674
You are... Yeah, of course!

212
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,957
Let's get to it!

213
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,620
Right. We'll call him...

214
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:25,955
Let's call him Jeff,

215
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,380
with my companion Charlie

216
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:31,648
and we're going to save the damsel
from the dark regions of the jungle.

217
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,695
Oh, my... Look at that monster!

218
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,644
EMILE: What kind of tree is that?

219
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:40,201
Well, that, Emile,
it's an Extremus Gigantis Circus uh...

220
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,012
Asparagus.

221
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,950
Actually, it's a sequoia.

222
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,986
If you prefer the generic name.

223
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,082
Oh, my... Look at that! it's the professor's
lab!

224
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,322
Emile! Emile! Come and get a shot of me!

225
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,389
Okay! What do we got? "Do not use. "

226
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:07,420
All right. Let's see what it does.

227
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,686
- Are you filming?
- Yes, but it says do not use...

228
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,625
No.

229
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,025
Oh!

230
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,544
Huh? Right. Okay, next.

231
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,396
How about this one? "Atomise-a-tune. "

232
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,488
Atomise-a-tune. Good name!

233
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,665
"Blah blah blah...
For a more melodious voice. "

234
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,044
That's incredible!

235
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,589
That's amazing!
Charles, you have a lovely singing voice.

236
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,942
All right let's try this one.
"Super-Fertilizer. " Hmm.

237
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:46,977
"Unstable. "

238
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,725
Okay. Now all I need now is a little seed.

239
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,794
From this jar, here.
A tiny drop, or two. And then we wait.

240
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,542
And we continue to wait.

241
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,651
And we wait.

242
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,891
This one's a... This one's a dud.

243
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,055
- Maybe you need to water it.
- Good idea, Emile.

244
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,938
Very disappointing, Professor.

245
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,140
Okay. Next!

246
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:19,941
RAOUL: Let's see if the old geezer invented
anything that actually works?

247
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,255
EMILE: Whoa!

248
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:25,499
Wow!

249
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,918
Did you get that?

250
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,183
<i>L did! All of it!</i>

251
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,686
God! A sunflower that big
must produce tons of oil.

252
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,075
This could cut Catherine's fuel budget by
10.

253
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:39,809
Emile, this must be my lucky day!

254
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,628
Emile!

255
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,174
Huh? What?

256
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,919
Raoul? Raoul?

257
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,869
Raoul! Raoul, are you okay?

258
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,189
Yeah. I think... I think the coat saved my
life.

259
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,762
Emile? Emile! I'm okay! I'm okay.

260
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,616
Oh. Good. Good.

261
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,543
Charles! Where is Charles?

262
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,322
Charles?

263
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,718
"Look up. "

264
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,242
Huh? Oh!

265
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,295
Hey, Charles!

266
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,821
Right, good, Charles is fine.
You're fine. I'm fine.

267
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:17,368
The plants are fine. Everything's fine.

268
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,557
There. So, I think we'll be going now.
Good night.

269
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,017
It's been a pleasure.

270
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,789
Raoul. Raoul?

271
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:29,718
You didn't see something
strange in there, did you?

272
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:31,707
You mean besides a singing monkey,

273
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,576
a 50 foot sunflower
and vials of potions that almost killed us?

274
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,004
No. You see anything strange?

275
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,673
You mean you didn't see
a seven foot creature

276
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,542
with big red bug eyes, four arms,
and spikes all over his body?

277
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,982
Emile. I think somebody has been
watching too many movies.

278
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,254
- You think?
- Yes, my friend.

279
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,440
MAN: With all this flooding,
what a dreadful winter...

280
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,967
- Whoops!
- CARLOTTA: Very harsh winter, yes.

281
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:59,296
- But I don't complain.
- Naturally.

282
00:17:59,331 --> 00:17:59,795
- We're lucky.
- Yes, we are.

283
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,858
Uh, say, Madame Carlotta,
have you told Lucille about my songs yet?

284
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:05,329
- Go on!
- Oh, okay.

285
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,567
- Water goes where water goes.
- Mmm-hmm?

286
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,466
Who do they think I am? Moses?

287
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,673
Am I supposed to make miracles?

288
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,588
Uh, no, but perhaps some boats,

289
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,266
more walkways, shelters for
the poor, blankets...

290
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,686
Forget blankets.
What's needed here is diversion.

291
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,762
Oh, yes, perfect. We can divert the water.

292
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,339
- Not water, Pate. Their minds.
- Oh.

293
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:32,254
We need to get their minds out of the wet
and onto something big.

294
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,706
Something that will wash this headline
away

295
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:39,575
and replace it with something
that will grab their imagination.

296
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,512
Uh... Like What?

297
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,262
I don't know.
Something that will have some pizzazz.

298
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,124
Something that will pop!

299
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,515
ALBERT: Whoa!

300
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,809
Give me that!

301
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,138
- What?
- Go!

302
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,182
Not my fault!

303
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,516
- Now!
- Whatever!

304
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:58,886
Commissioner Maynott, Captain Pate,
I trust everything is to your liking?

305
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,361
Oh, yes, my dear Carlotta, yes.

306
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:01,231
Yes, of course it is, isn't it?

307
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,429
- One step from perfection.
- One step from... Oh!

308
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:05,718
All that is needed now is

309
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,804
for your angel of a niece

310
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,606
to accept my invitation.

311
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,296
- With my compliments.
- Oh, Commissioner, what an honour!

312
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,730
Oh, I'm sure she will be delighted.

313
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,166
Oh, speak of the devil.

314
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,260
Ah!

Not interested.

336
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,584
Everybody needs somebody. Even you!

337
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,728
You look at the Commissioner.

338
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,222
He's successful, he's a national figure.

339
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,681
- He's pompous.
- He has a medal of honour!

340
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,820
- He's boring.
- People respect him.

341
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,815
He's got nice hair. Oh, I love his hair.

342
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,448
He smells good, doesn't he?

343
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,509
- He's attractive...
- He's not my type!

344
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,144
Not your type? Okay, maybe not yet.

345
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,333
But you meet him,
you're nice, and he becomes your type.

346
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:26,094
Perhaps you smile
that wonderful smile of yours.

347
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,319
And who knows?

348
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:28,509
Come on, let me see it.

349
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,533
Ah, perfect!

350
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,322
- What a singer!
- Mmm, and what a woman!

351
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:44,110
What do you mean, "What a woman"?

352
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,863
I'm wondering. Would you be jealous?

353
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,600
- Oh, dear!
- What?

354
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:56,885
There.

355
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,458
- What's wrong?
- Something touched me!

356
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,929
Oh! Don't worry, dear.
It won't attack a larger animal.

357
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,267
What?

358
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,589
Oh, God, no! No! Let me go!

359
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,924
Go! Run!

360
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,228
Rum

361
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,352
Oh, horrible. Seven feet tall,

362
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,253
razor-sharp teeth.

363
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,080
Horrible.

364
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,708
- Yeah, of course. Sign here.
- Oh.

365
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,590
How's it going with that sketch?

366
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,731
- Huh? Wait. Uh...
- He's getting good, huh?

367
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,321
Let's see here.

368
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,025
What could rhyme with "great destiny"?

369
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,256
Ah, yes, I know! "Me!"

370
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,156
Come in!

371
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,135
Pate.

372
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,103
What in the world are you wearing?

373
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:11,870
It's all part of the new fitness campaign
for elite officers.

374
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,759
I have agreed to lead
the Rapid Response Bicycle Unit.

375
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,351
Brilliant. Anything new?

376
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,601
Well, it's just a theory but...

377
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,583
Here is where the store window was
smashed.

378
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:25,288
Yes.

379
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,873
- Here is where the children were traumatized.
- Okay.

380
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:32,379
Here is where the horse was spooked
and stampeded through the lingerie shop.

381
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,896
- See what I'm getting at?
- Uh... Actually no.

382
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,729
There is a pattern, a logical progression,

383
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,234
leading all the way to here.

384
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,428
MAYNOTT: And?

385
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:45,468
Well, I would like permission to do
a more thorough investigation,

386
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:48,148
- Sir.
- Yes, of course, investigate away.

387
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,213
Let the public see that we are men of
action.

388
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,442
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- Yeah. Hmm.

389
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,324
But don't be too quick
at solving the case, Pate.

390
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,172
But, sir, I should think the quicker the
better.

391
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:01,823
We are on the verge of a catastrophe.

392
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,725
Where you see catastrophe, I see
opportunity.

393
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,771
You see, my dear Captain,

394
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,885
when people are frightened
they need protection.

395
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,872
They need someone that they can turn to,

396
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,892
someone to believe in,

397
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,458
a saviour,

398
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,085
a hero.

399
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,326
In other words, they need

400
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:24,738
me!

401
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,026
CARLOTTA: And say hello for me.
LUCILLE: Sure.

402
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,373
CARLOTTA: No, don't.
You don't have to. No, no.

403
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,273
I mean, well, if he mentions me.

404
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,331
- LUCILLE: Okay!
- Oh, let me see...

405
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:39,354
Darling, wait. Stop. Let me take a look.

406
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:40,370
- Oh, perfect.
- Mmm-hmm?

407
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,220
What's that?

408
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,415
"A strange creature has been
seen in the streets of Paris. "

409
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,370
"The beast is seven feet high,
is extremely hairy,

410
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,046
"and has two big and red eyes.

411
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:07,796
"Under those circumstances,
we recommend all citizens

412
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,544
"not to go out alone at night. "

413
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,385
Ch, great!

414
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,506
"Be cautious and do not panic. "

415
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,439
Raoul! You scared me!
What are you doing here?

416
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:22,946
You scared me! And I'm working here!

417
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:26,042
- Well, I hope nothing's broken.
- No, I'm fine.

418
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:28,040
I'm talking about the champagne, you
idiot!

419
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,800
Look at me! I'm a mess!

420
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:31,508
Here comes the drama queen.

421
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:33,181
Come on. It's nothing. Here.

422
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,211
Give me that! You're making it worse.

423
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,753
Oh, great. Now, I have to change again!

424
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,258
Uh, not a bad idea.
Brown is definitely not your colour.

425
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,411
I see. You're a fashion expert now.

426
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:46,970
Very credible with that straw coat on.

427
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,639
- It's not straw.
- I see nothing has changed.

428
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:53,008
Still the same birdbrain you were
in the first grade.

429
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,027
And you're still so, so...

430
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:54,888
$0 you!

431
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,032
- What a repartee!
- What a repartee!

432
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:00,640
Oh, I'm so smart. I use words like repartee.

433
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,944
Look at me. Look at how amazing I am!

434
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,572
Ooh, I'm so dumb.
Oh. I fell on my butt again!

435
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,441
I'm a star. I'm a princess.
But I sing like a frog!

436
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,620
- Oh. I get it.
- You get what?

437
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,818
- You're jealous.
- Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

438
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,344
- You're jealous of my success.
- It makes you feel small.

439
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:19,334
- Listen, honey...
- Don't you honey me.

440
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,290
Listen honey. I'm doing just fine, okay?

441
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:23,428
Women like me, men want to be me,

442
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,255
uh, men want to be with the women
who like me.

443
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,401
And the women, uh, want to be...

444
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,271
The men who want to be with me...

445
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,919
I'm popular and creative.

446
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:37,571
Creative?

447
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,872
You mean that piece of junk?

448
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:43,151
Don't you... Don't you dare
bring Catherine into this!

449
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:47,248
If you want to see popular and creative,
come see my show one night.

450
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:49,314
Oh, wait! You can't. We don't accept losers.

451
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:53,425
Oh, good one. Oh, pardon me,
your Royal Pain in the Buttness.

452
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,302
I didn't realise you had to win
the Medal of Honour

453
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:56,498
to gain entrance to the Cheese Hall!

454
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,334
In your case, the only way you
will be admitted

455
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,805
is if you show up with that medal
pinned to your chest.

456
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,099
It would look great on your lovely straw
coat!

457
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,852
It's not... It's not... It's not straw!

458
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,763
Ah, and one more thing.

459
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,014
If you come with that medal,

460
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,418
the best table will be waiting along with
all the champagne you can drink.

461
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:18,129
On the house.

462
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,702
ALBERT: I'm in the bathroom!
LUCILLE: Now!

463
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,477
ALBERT: Okay, okay!

464
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:30,859
Pest!

465
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,134
There is a monster in Paris!

466
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:36,596
People are scared!

467
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,182
Give me one! Here.

468
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,201
Thanks.

469
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,426
Huh?

470
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,255
How is it going up there?

471
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,142
I'm close.

472
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,079
POLICEMAN: Would you just check
over there...

473
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:09,921
Let's see... Okay.

474
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,573
There... Oh.

475
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,976
POLICEMAN 3: Let's search thoroughly.
Look everywhere.

476
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:16,272
oh;

477
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,640
Wait a minute. What is this?

478
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,216
Oh, my God!

479
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,640
Oh, this is a nightmare!

480
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,107
Emile! It's a nightmare! I've lost all my
clients.

481
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,185
- What's that?
- It's the monster!

482
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,079
The monster that we created!

483
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,776
Yes, our own monster. He's got your eyes.

484
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,241
And, Uh, my hairy legs!

485
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:04,699
What are we going to do?

486
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:08,172
Everything's fine. Nothing happened.
It's not our fault.

487
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,688
Besides, nobody knows
we were there!

488
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,836
Could have been anybody!
Could have been anybody.

489
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:14,219
Sorry to interrupt the show, gentlemen,

490
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,020
but I think you are about to
be the stars of the next feature.

491
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,260
It's called The Interrogation!

492
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,540
The faceless and nameless masses

493
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,541
living their lives like cockroaches,

494
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,314
and those with a great destiny,

495
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,092
those like you and me.

496
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,068
You're very kind, Commissioner,
but I'm just a singer.

497
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,997
Oh, don't be modest.

498
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,356
You see, I'm due to inaugurate
the new railway.

499
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,009
Everybody will talk about it

500
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,207
and I would be honoured
to have you open the event

501
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,167
and stand by my side.

502
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,278
Because you're not just a singer,
you're a star.

503
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,152
Shining brighter than all others,

504
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,409
lighting the way to a brilliant future.

505
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,935
For you, for me, for us.

506
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,216
Uh, that's very nice of you,

507
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:23,069
but don't you think it's
a little early to refer to us as "us"?

508
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,507
Excuse me?

509
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,577
Yes, Pate?

510
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,494
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I have extremely important news.

511
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,197
- What?
- The monster...

512
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,229
I have three suspects.

513
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,141
Now, if you'll look very closely

514
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,804
right here, just before the explosion...

515
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,603
See that little black dot?

516
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,646
It's a flea from the monkey's fur.

517
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,707
I believe that the combination
of these potions

518
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,100
turned it into

519
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,793
- the monster!
- Bravo, Pate!

520
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,197
Bravo! A giant flea!

521
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,380
This is exactly what I've been looking for!

522
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,971
Excuse me, sir. I'm just starting out in life.

523
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:13,755
I don't want to go to jail.

524
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,919
Prison's a low-growth market
for home deliveries.

525
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,826
Arrest the monkey! It was his flea!

526
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,897
Prison? Who said anything about prison?

527
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,833
This is a story about heroes.

528
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:25,734
Heroes don't go to prison.

529
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,770
- But, sir, they're guilty!
- Guilty of what?

530
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:33,276
Of giving me the chance to show the
public where they can place their trust?

531
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,809
No, no, they do not deserve to go to
prison.

532
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:39,483
They deserve to be celebrated,
to be honoured.

533
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,431
They deserve...

534
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,353
- Huh?
- Here, pick one.

535
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:47,483
Uh, well...

536
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,518
Would you have a medal of
honour in there, by any chance?

537
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:51,553
Hmm?

538
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,512

00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,201
Thank you, Albert!

543
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,895
I, uh... Look, I'll be honest with you...

544
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,939
What? You don't like that one?
This one perhaps.

The song isn't the problem.

548
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,150
What is the problem then? I have talent.

549
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:23,199
All my friends say so.

550
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,761
All I need is someone to
give me a big break. That's all.

551
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:27,412
That or some new friends.

552
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:30,883
It's just me, but I have to go, sweetie.
I have to run.

553
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,236
You'll tell me about it, right?

554
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:32,792
Tell you what?

555
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:36,058
You know! How it went with
the Commissioner! Right?

556
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,249
- Oh, right.
- Okay, good.

557

I can't wait!

558
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,642
- Look, Albert. Thank you.
- Don't bother.

559
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:47,009
I know. I'm too original for a place like this.

560
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:47,724
Too avant-garde.

561
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,080
You took the words right out of my mouth.

562
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:52,054
- That's what I am.
- That's what you are.

563
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,993
- Too avant-garde...
- Of course you are!

564
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:54,819
- I'm so out of here!
- Bye now!

565
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,114
She's jealous! That's what she is.

566
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,414
She's stuck in her little bourgeois
dance hall tunes

567
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:07,586
while I'm blazing a trail.

568
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,276
It scares her.

569
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,336
True talent scares her.

570
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,192
Who's there?

571
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,064
Open the door. Open up! It's me Albert!

572
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,921
Open the door!

573
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,902
Ouch! Oh, my ankle! I broke my ankle!

574
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,537
Listen, Albert...

575
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,880
Oh, my God!

576
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,462
Are you okay?

577
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,070
Did I hurt you?

578
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,232
I am really sorry.

579
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,514

No! Let me go!

It's a nightmare. I'll wake up.

00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,748
Whatever you do, don't make a sound,
okay?

642
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,370
I'll be right back.

643
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,960
- Good evening, Miss Lucille.
- Good evening.

644
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,649
Well. Well. Twinkle, twinkle little star.

645
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:10,249
What are you doing here?

646
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:13,288
My dear, we came to see your
so called "show. "

647
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,838
Say, Emile, what's that on your lapel?

648
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:18,740
I do believe it's the Medal of Honour,
Raoul.

649
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:20,564
Well, Emile. What a coincidence!

650
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,386
I happen to have one, too!

651
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,583
What? Where did you steal this?

652
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,058
Oh, no. We didn't steal them.

653
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,097
- They're from Commissioner Maynott.
- Really!

654
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:30,895
Hold on! Wait, what is that?

655
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,813
Do you hear something? I hear a voice.

656
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:36,978
"If you get the Medal of Honour,
you get the best seat in the house. "

657
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:37,717
Sound familiar?

658
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,903
- Albert...
- What?

659
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:42,169
Show these gentlemen
to the best seat in the house.

660
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,109
Why me?

661
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,768
Enjoy the show. If you even know
what you're watching.

662
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:49,915
Bye.

663
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,703
- You two know each other?
- Oh... Yes!

664
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,020
I mean, uh... Yes.

665
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,157
He's such a...

666
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,551
Francoeur! What are you?

667
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,419
- Darling! He's brilliant!
- I can explain.

668
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,598
Genius needs no explanation, my dear.

669
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:11,069
I've never been so transported.
Where did you find him?

670
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:12,520
He, uh... Just dropped in.

671
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,820
Well he's a perfect fit for your
sweet, sweet voice.

672
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:18,136
I'll go inform the rest of the musicians.

673
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:18,943
I really don't think...

674
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,811
History will be made tonight. I can feel it.

675
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,961
What part of "Don't make a sound,"
did you not understand?

676
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,490
Thank you, my good man! Thank you.

677
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:35,876
Don't mention it.

678
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,346
Come on, buddy relax! Lose the coat!

679
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:40,845
okay-

680
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:45,816
What's this?

681
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,800
- Dear Maud...
- Don't... Give me that!

682
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,654
Oh, you took my advice, you dog.

683
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,226
I didn't know you had it in you.

684
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,815
- Give that back!
- No, no, no, no, no...

685
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,369
- I'd really like...
- Stop reading that.

686
00:41:57,404 --> 00:41:58,783
- A date?
- No.

687
00:41:58,818 --> 00:41:59,727
Oh! Where?

688
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,495
I don't know. Please give me that back.

689
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:06,575
Or I'll tell everyone
that you are in love with Lucille.

690
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,947
Are you crazy? Me? That woman?

691
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:14,848
How can you even think that?

692
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,593
It's so obvious.

693
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,227
You're so obvious.

694
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,676
CARLOTTA: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

695
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,045
- it is with the greatest pleasure
- Francoeur, hurry!

696
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,066
that I give to you, the one, the only.

697
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:32,400
- Francoeur, move!
- The incomparable.

698
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,990
Lucille!

699
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,426
Huh? Uh-Oh.

700
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:41,864
Good evening!

701
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,177
Welcome to The Rare Bird.

702
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:47,897

We're delighted to introduce
a brilliant new talent.

704
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,563
The master of the guitar, all the way from...

705

we clear the entire thing up.

What press conference?

800
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:00,796

00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:05,960
Send it back to hell from whence it came!

803
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:09,993
REPORTER: Uh, Commissioner?

804
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:11,683
How do you propose to kill it?

805
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,574
Why, with water.

806
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:16,304
See fleas cannot live in water.

807
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:20,961
At the moment, as fate would have it,
Paris is full of water.

808
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:26,197
Which is why I have not moved
more aggressively to drain the streets.

809
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:28,088
Water is my weapon of choice.

810
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:32,514
When I find the beast,
I will take it and drown it.

811
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:33,090
AUDIENCE: Oh!

812
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:35,431
REPORTER: Uh, Commissioner.

813
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:37,284
Commissioner. Very commendable.

814
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:40,431
But how are you going to drown the
monster,

815
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:41,093
when you can't even find it?

816
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,654
Oh, I Will find it all right.

817
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:45,514
As a matter of fact,

818
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:48,883
I am using this press conference
to announce a reward

819
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:51,264
for the first person
to offer up any information

820
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:53,610
that leads to the discovery
and death of this menace

821
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:55,517
to our peace and happiness.

822
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:57,644
Uh, sir...

823
00:48:57,686 --> 00:48:58,819
MAYNOTT: Yes?

824
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:00,515
I have information...

825
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:02,267
Excellent, excellent.

826
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:04,902
- Please, come up.
- Come on, let's go.

827
00:49:04,937 --> 00:49:06,326
RAOUL: That little rat!

828
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:09,311
He is the one who's gonna get drowned
when I get my hands on him.

829
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,262
- We'll never get there before the police!
- Are you kidding?

830
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:14,169
There is no one alive who can beat Raoul
when he drives!

831
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,156
- Oh, Emile!
- Maud!

832
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,423
I heard about how brave you were!

833
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,587
- You did?
- Yeah, with a medal to prove it, huh?

834
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:25,362
- It was nothing.
- I don't think so.

835
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:25,771
- Emile!
- Coming.

836
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:28,107
I have to go. But... For you.

837
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:29,855
- Emile!
- Duty calls.

838
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:36,423
"Dear Maud, I'd really like a date.

839
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,118
"Saturday 3:00 p. m.

840
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:42,482
"Yours affectionately, Emile. "

841
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:48,169
Saturday at 3:00 p. m. okay, but where?

842
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,845
Come on, let's go.

843
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,478
To the cabaret!

844
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:02,232
Ah! A monkey.
This is not Noah's Ark, you know.

845
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,580
Look, sweetheart,
I didn't come to argue with you.

846
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:06,183
- I came to save you.
- Save me?

847
00:50:06,218 --> 00:50:07,089
Let's go. Maynott...

848
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:10,165
- The police...
- The police what?

849
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,801
Hurry up! In here. Go!

850
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,264
Commissioner. What a surprise!

851
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:27,257
For both of us. Where is he?

852
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,255
- Who?
- The monster!

853
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,740
Not as much as you've hurt me.

854
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,176
Your words carry no weight
with me any longer, my dear.

855
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:39,461
Now let's stop this little charade

856
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,966
and at least have one moment
of true honesty between us.

857
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,355
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

858
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,057
Uh, sir? It's in there.

859
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:48,570
Oh!

860
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:53,067
First you accuse me
without a shred of evidence.

861
00:50:53,102 --> 00:50:55,353
Then you violate my private property.

862
00:50:55,804 --> 00:51:00,173
If you dare to enter my dressing room,
you'll have to find another singer.

863
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,067
Consider it done.

864
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:07,123
MAYNOTT: Damn.

865
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,049
Not in here.

866
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,810
We've searched all over, sir. Nothing!

867
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:20,662
Really?

868
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:21,990
I told you!

869
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:26,127
I'm... I'm confused. I do not know what to
say.

870
00:51:26,162 --> 00:51:27,268
I do. Thank you.

871
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:28,712
Thank you?

872
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:30,971
For putting the public's safety
before your own.

873
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:35,239
Leading the charge to rid
the streets of Paris of this terrible danger,

874
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:36,792
wherever it may take you.

875
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:40,605
It was right here!

876
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,768
- I heard it...
- Arrest him!

877
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,025
What have I done?

878
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,610
MAYNOTT: What have you done?

879
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:48,410
Lying to the police, bearing false witness.

880
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,700
Malicious intent.

881
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,858
Do you want me to go on?

882
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:54,359
Take him away!

883
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,900
But wait! I didn't do anything!

884
00:51:56,935 --> 00:51:57,866
My dear...

885
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,565
I am mortified.

886
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:03,587
You thought you were doing the right
thing.

887
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:07,627
I would not blame you
if you did not sing at the inauguration now.

888
00:52:08,043 --> 00:52:09,607
Of course, I will sing.

889
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:10,927
If for nothing else,

890
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:14,796
to show my support and admiration
for all you have done for us.

891
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,083
<i>Oh. Thank you, mademoiselle.</i>

892
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:19,793
Enjoy your day.

893
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,204
And you.

894
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,196
Francoeur? Raoul?

895
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,608
Okay, it's safe now.

896
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:33,535
You can come out!

897
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,678
Francoeur.

898
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:38,695
There you are.

899
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,433
RAOUL: Bravo, Lucille.
Excellent acting skills.

900
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:48,167
EMILE: Well he can hide
in my projection room.

901
00:52:48,202 --> 00:52:48,590
No one ever goes up there.

902
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:52,061
Until they do.
And then we will have to move him again.

903
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:52,750
We need a more permanent solution.

904
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:53,729
Here, take that.

905
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,047
God, feathers.

906
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:01,358
If only we could shrink him down
to his normal size,

907
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:02,229
then no one would ever find him.

908
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:05,097
Smaller you are the less people look at
you.

909
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:06,107
At least that's been my experience.

910
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:09,203
There's only one person
who could save Francoeur

911
00:53:09,238 --> 00:53:10,098
and he's in New York right now.

912
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:10,628
Mmm-hmm.

913
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,405
But we don't need him.

914
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,377
Lucille, no offence,
we're talking big-time science, here, okay?

915
00:53:16,412 --> 00:53:19,428
All I know is deliveries,
Emile is all about movies,

916
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,444
you're an expert in show business,
but you know...

917
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:22,479
Exactly!

918
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,816
Mmm-hmm. I see.

919
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,531
Smart girl!

920
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:28,289
Thank you.

921
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:32,666
Excuse me, will someone tell me
what you two are talking about?

922
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:35,021
Ladies and gentlemen,
come see Paris from above.

923
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,213
An uplifting experience!

924
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,496
MAYNOTT: My fellow citizens,

925
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,015
I know we are here today

926
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,278
to dedicate this wonder of technology

927
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:54,248
even as we are beset by problems on all
sides.

928
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:58,214
Monsters are ruling our streets.

929
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,623
Floods threatening on our very lives.

930
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:03,915
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse us.

931
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,580
And so, along with this marvel,
I bring you something else.

932
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,755
I bring you hope.

933
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:10,988
I bring you me!

934
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:17,878
And so, it is with great pride
and great expectations

935
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:22,796
that I announce my candidacy
for the post of Maire of Paris!

936
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:28,338
Yeah, oh, yeah.

937
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:30,901
But before I take on this momentous task,

938
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:33,962
it is my great, great pleasure to present to
you

939
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,647
a symbol of its current greatness.

940
00:54:38,193 --> 00:54:39,854
Ladies and gentlemen,

941
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:42,978
I give you, Lucille, the Angel of
Montmartre.

942
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:46,349
Lucille.

But Commissioner! It is the antidote.
For the monster!

958
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,969
I found it in the professor's lab.

959
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:50,670
May I see that?

960
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,769
Did you not hear my speech?
I am the antidote!

961

965
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:09,319
RAOUL: Oh, my God! It's the monster!

966
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:10,478
Where?

967
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,615
Over there!

968
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,388
No!

969
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:27,200
Oh, I'm scared!

970
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:29,444
Oh, dear!

971
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:33,676
No! No! Don't shoot! You'll hit my angel!

972
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:35,518
Commissioner. The antidote!

973
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,370
Throw it!

974
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:50,784
Hey! Look everybody!

975
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,189
It's the monster!

976
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:55,137
Shrunk back to his flea size!

977
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:57,575
- Oh, yes. Kill it!
- I shall!

978
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,216
The monster is dead!

979
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,084
Long live our hero! Long live Mayor
Maynott!

980
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:03,338
Oh, bravo!

981
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:06,372
Long live Mayor Maynott!

982
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,169
Thank you! Thank you!

983
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,352
Maynott! Maynott!

984
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:14,254
MAYNOTT: I'm thrilled.
Thank you! Thank you!

985
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,654
Not at all.

986
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:18,656
Commissioner!

987
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,862
Yes?

988
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:21,746
No! Pate!

989
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,250
Open the trap door!

990
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,538
I've been fooled.

991
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:50,776
LUCILLE: Francoeur! Get out of here!
RAOUL: Get out! Jump!

992
00:57:50,811 --> 00:57:51,226
RAOUL: Jump! Yes!

993
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:54,265
RAOUL: Yes, yes, yes. Jump!
LUCILLE: Hurry up!

994
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,254
LUCILLE: Come on, get out of there!

995
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:57,282
EMILE: Go on, Jump! Jump! Go!

996
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:10,606
Out of the way! Move!

997
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,343
LUCILLE: Oh, no!

998
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:19,763
Oh. What?

999
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,787
Hey! Is that a monkey?

1000
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,507
LUCILLE: See you down below!

1001
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:52,276
MAYNOTT: What are you waiting for?

1002
00:58:52,614 --> 00:58:54,241
Go and get him! Now!

1003
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:03,989
Raoul, come on!

1004
00:59:04,024 --> 00:59:04,834
Okay.

1005
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:08,554
Hey!

1006
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,962
- Ready? Huh?
- Oh, no!

1007
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:14,481
- Raoul, if we die, I'll kill you.
- Okay.

1008
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,156
Haul that car back up!

1009
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,949
Impossible, sir! The system is automated.

1010
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:32,851
Once the doors are closed, you can't stop
it.

1011
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:34,787
Won't come back up?

1012
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,257
Okay, then it'll go down!

1013
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:44,030
Let's go get Catherine!

1014
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,731
- Raoul?
- Oh, no!

1015
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:12,671
Uh, Lucille?

1016
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:15,828
And what about Raoul?

1017
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,628
Come on! He'll find us!

1018
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:20,333
Hey! My bike!

1019
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:22,530
There you are. Did you miss me?

1020
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:22,878
Hey!

1021
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,729
Stop, thief!

1022
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,422
Gimme that!

1023
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,735
MAYNOTT: Requisitioned!

1024
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,774
You want to be poster boy
for the cycle corps?

1025
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:52,624
Well, here's your big chance!

1026
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:53,751
Start pedalling!

1027
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:06,630
Hey!

1028
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,541
Your ticket, please.

1029
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,918
POLICEMAN: Hey! Look out!
Stop that bus!

1030
01:01:17,953 --> 01:01:18,851
EMILE: Excuse us.

1031
01:01:22,013 --> 01:01:24,038
Ah! There you are! Climb on!

1032
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,407
Welcome aboard!

1033
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:04,431
Raoul!

1034
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:14,805
Oh. Oh, my! Are you okay?

1035
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:17,216
My hood!

1036
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:20,003
Let's put him in the back!

1037
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:21,360
Okay, hold on!

1038
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:27,777
POLICEMAN: Hey, you!
You are under arrest! Don't move!

1039
01:02:27,812 --> 01:02:30,081
Guys! Guys! Guys! We've got go. Come on.

1040
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,298
Get in, quick! Let's go!

1041
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,092
Come on! Shake a leg! Shake a leg!

1042
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:36,755
POLICEMAN: Stop right there! Don't move!

1043
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,107
They're here! Raoul, come on!

1044
01:02:38,142 --> 01:02:39,424
- Okay!
- Come on! Hurry up!

1045
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:42,776
POLICEMAN: Onwards! Onwards men!
Let's get them!

1046
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,368
Charles?

1047
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,935
POLICEMAN: Stop right there! Stop!

1048
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,221
Got you. Show me some ID.

1049
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,066
Oh.

1050
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:20,275
Well, well! Pardon me!

1051
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:23,582
What? What are you doing?

1052
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:29,447
- Your coat.
- It's okay.

1053
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:31,677
It was straw anyway!

1054
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,025
POLICEMAN: Look out!

1055
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:47,507
Hey!

1056
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,885
Oh, you thought you would
escape me, did you?

1057
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:53,847
- Emile!
- Yes?

1058
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,084
Can you get rid of that thing!

1059
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:57,055
- Out there?
- Please.

1060
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,710
Okay.

1061
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:13,983
- Whoa.
- RAOUL: Emile!

1062
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,282
Emile! Be Careful!

1063
01:04:16,317 --> 01:04:16,737
Huh?

1064
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,285
Hey!

1065
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,510
Pate! I need a bigger weapon!

1066
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,101
MAYNOTT: Oh! Of course! Perfect!

1067
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,179
To the Seine.

1068
01:04:38,584 --> 01:04:40,848
To the Seine, Pate. To the Seine.

1069
01:04:41,963 --> 01:04:46,127
I'll happily take you there, little lady,
but there's no one up there.

1070
01:04:46,162 --> 01:04:47,260
There will be. I'm sure of it.

1071
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,869
MAYNOTT: Faster, Pate!

1072
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,999
Imagine you're winning the Tour de
France!

1073
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,917
I never planned on doing
the Tour de France, sir. It's too tough.

1074
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:05,604
Precisely! This is easier.
There are no mountains.

1075
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,429
Pedal, man! Pedal!

1076
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:20,843
The wheels are useless. I can't turn!

1077
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,631
Oh, no!

1078
01:05:43,024 --> 01:05:44,185
Oh, my God!

1079
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:47,290
Oh, my goods!

1080
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,131
Francoeur!

1081
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,027
Quick! We have to help him!

1082
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:23,292
We have to help ourselves first!

1083
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:24,353
We're sinking!

1084
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,796
Emile!

1085
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,271
Oh! I know!

1086
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:14,413
RAOUL: There we go!

1087
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,917
- One-two, one-two, one-two...
- Oh.

1088
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,721
Sorry, but we're still sinking!

1089
01:07:19,756 --> 01:07:21,574
RAOUL: Maybe, but we're moving.

1090
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:22,806
Up, down. Up, down.

1091
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,457
Get us down, Pate. Get us down!

1092
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,672
I'm trying my best, sir!

1093
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,734
Your best is not good enough!

1094
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,659
<i>And, voila!</i>

1095
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:53,458
Safe and sound and dry!

1096
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:57,299
Thanks to the great team,
"Raoul and Catherine"!

1097
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:58,659
Catherine!

1098
01:07:58,826 --> 01:07:59,600
No!

1099
01:08:10,045 --> 01:08:12,514
- Oh, Emile?
- Maud? What are you...

1100
01:08:12,548 --> 01:08:15,779
You know the monster
that everyone's talking about?

1101
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:16,308
He's here...

1102
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:19,870
No, no, no. Don't worry, Maud.
We're here to protect him.

1103
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:20,354
You protect a monster?

1104
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:23,256
- RAOUL: Come on, Romeo!
- Yeah! I'm coming!

1105
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:24,634
I will be right back for you.

1106
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:25,978
Wherever you go, I'm going.

1107
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:33,884
It's no good, sir!

1108
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,703
Huh?

1109
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:39,022
MAYNOTT: You're hopeless.

1110
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:42,044
Sir?

1111
01:08:45,706 --> 01:08:48,971
I don't... I don't mean
to tell you what to do, sir,

1112
01:08:49,006 --> 01:08:50,814
but don't you think... I mean...

1113
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:51,746
We should reconsider.

1114
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:55,918
I mean, that, that creature
never really hurt anybody.

1115
01:08:55,953 --> 01:08:56,223
That's not the point...

1116
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:59,284
Why are you talking
with that ridiculous voice?

1117
01:08:59,319 --> 01:08:59,769
It's the helium, sir.

1118
01:08:59,804 --> 01:09:03,672
The monster stands
between me and the city hall.

1119
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:05,260
He dies...
And I Win!

1120
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:10,689
Francoeur!

1121
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:13,329
Are you okay?

1122
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,847
Uh-oh.

1123
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:19,968
Come on! Quick! Quick!

1124
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:23,870
Step aside, Lucille!

1125
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:26,095
Go ahead. Shoot.

1126
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,445
Don't tempt me.

1127
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,049
The newspapers were right.

1128
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:33,645
There is a monster in Paris.
And I'm looking right at him.

1129
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,463
What?

1130
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:36,697
Have it your way!

1131
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:39,946
Oh, I'm hit! Man down!

1132
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:42,237
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1133
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:45,099
- Go, Francoeur! Go!
- Go!

1134
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:54,855
No,Lucille,no!

1135
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,304
Raoul!

1136
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,424
- Raoul!
- Hold on, Lucille.

1137
01:10:03,459 --> 01:10:04,778
- Raoul!
- I'm here!

1138
01:10:06,829 --> 01:10:08,167
Stop right now!

1139
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:09,506
Of course, yes...

1140
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:10,590
Boo!

1141
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:15,710
Oh! Emile! Are you okay?

1142
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:26,406
What are you doing?

1143
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,450
Hold on, Lucille! I'm coming!

1144
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,516
Emile, it's okay, it's over. Let me help you.

1145
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:42,130
You know what, Maud? I'm very upset.

1146
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:46,168
And for the first time,
I'm gonna do something about it!

1147
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,962
- May I borrow that, please?
- Sure!

1148
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:52,557
- Almost there. It's okay!
- Raoul!

1149
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,481
Don't worry everything
is gonna be all right. Okay?

1150
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:57,752
Lucille, I'm right here.

1151
01:10:58,172 --> 01:10:59,230
Oh, no...

1152
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:03,591
Oh, no! We're gonna die!

1153
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,922
Give me that, you dwarf!

1154
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:35,790
Well, I may be a dwarf but I have a big gun!

1155
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:39,570
Actually the gun is pretty small.
Now, now give it to me!

1156
01:11:39,605 --> 01:11:41,037
You leave my Emile alone!

1157
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:42,106
Maud? No, no, stop!

1158
01:11:43,717 --> 01:11:46,652
- Still want to play the hero?
- EMILE: Stop!

1159
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:46,917
Give me my gun.

1160
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:48,854
Or over she goes.

1161
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:51,415
Okay, okay! No, here. Here's your gun!

1162
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,744
We each have our destiny.
Yours lies in the shadows.

1163
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,664
And mine is out in the spotlight.

1164
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,043
RAOUL: Oh. Your brooch.

1165
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:08,284
Wait.

1166
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:11,461
Hey!

1167
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:18,813
Maud, close your eyes!

1168
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:01,212
Oh, Emile. You were wonderful.

1169
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:03,726
Just like in my dreams.

1170
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,371
In your dreams?

1171
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:23,442
Francoeur!

1172
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,845
MAYNOTT: Where are you? Where are
you?

1173
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:33,592
I did it!

1174
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:36,623
I killed the monster of Paris!

1175
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,282
Commissioner.

1176
01:14:00,771 --> 01:14:02,205
Oh! Pate! Hello!

1177
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:05,380
I have a message from the Interior
Minister.

1178
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:07,904
He's not happy with all the
destruction caused

1179
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:11,650
by your psychopathic chase
in pursuit of your own ambitions.

1180
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:14,968
But as everyone can plainly see,
I have risked my life.

1181
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,365
Pate, I have slain the monster.

1182
01:14:18,997 --> 01:14:21,932
- Tell that to the Minister.
- With pleasure.

1183
01:14:21,967 --> 01:14:23,342
Victor Maynott, I am arresting you

1184
01:14:23,377 --> 01:14:26,540
for the premeditated murder
of Monsieur Francoeur.

1185
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,758
What? Have you lost your mind?

1186
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:30,354
The opposite.

1187
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:32,559
I was so set on being a loyal officer,

1188
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:35,461
I did not see the road you had taken us
down.

1189
01:14:35,848 --> 01:14:38,215
I needed a flea to show me the way.

1190
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:41,688
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!

1191
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:43,862
You are so wrong, sir.

1192
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:46,307
There was more humanity in that flea

1193
01:14:46,342 --> 01:14:48,717
than in the louse I see before me now!

1194
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,358
Take him away!

1195

Of course, you can.
