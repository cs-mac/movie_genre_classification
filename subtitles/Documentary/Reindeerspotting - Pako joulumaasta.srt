1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
But the Crayfish Demon is very strong!

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,520
I'll die soon!

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,830
But I'll stand up every time!

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,030
Its wondrous power is letting me do this.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,930
While the flower in the prince's stomach is shining...

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,400
wonders and bravery are pouring out out him.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,680
Onuki.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,520
Onuki.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,380
Does it hurt?

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,850
No, I'm OK.

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,390
It doesn't hurt.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,430
I... I'll call the doctor.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,860
Oh no!

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,270
Maybe the air conditioner next to the bicycle parking lot was meaning him.

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,300
Onuki.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,170
Ah...

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,640
Tomorrow is OK.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,680
Let's continue reading tomorrow...

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,540
No...

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,520
It's over soon.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,010
I want to...

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,560
read it till the end.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,190
You're reading it to her every day, right?

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,400
The picture book.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,130
Yes.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,060
Hm.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,030
I can't think of anything else.

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,370
What're you doing?

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,740
Oh? Nothing...

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,140
I'm just checking whether your head is still OK...

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,840
because the old fart has suddenly become a nice person...

32
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,680
Don't mess with me, you quack doctor!

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,780
Good, you're back to your normal self.

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,950
Maybe you've really been chosen by god.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,620
By god?

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,760
In order to make Paco happy...

37
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,290
you've...

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,460
That's nonsense!

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,430
I just...

40
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,040
want to be in this child's heart tomorrow...

41
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,880
that's all.

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,050
About this time...

43
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,350
she should have already forgotten who I am.

44
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,860
When I'm together with her...

45
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,330
I can't help but to think that I'm a weak being, too.

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,130
Does that hurt?

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,740
No.

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,310
It's more like my heart is becoming lighter.

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,850
Doctor!

50
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,920
Why do we have to assemble at this time of the day?

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,860
Is everyone here?

52
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,740
<i>Humans...</i>

53
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,040
<i>Lala-la-lalalala-la</i>

54
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,780
it's sad, right? Being a human...

55
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,540
Well, well...

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,340
Please listen. My first song for tonight...

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,380
Sit down.

58
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,180
So, today...

59
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,550
there's a superb suggestion from Onuki for you all.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,980
Well...

61
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,790
Rejected!

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,420
What?

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,050
Rejected!

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,990
Horigome, please listen to him first.

65
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,890
But isn't it much more interesting to decide before listening to him?

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm absolutely against it and that's why I'll start singing now.

67
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,260
Sit down.

68
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,630
So... well...

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,680
It's about Summer Christmas.

70
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,040
Here... what do you think about it?

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,340
I want to do this play together with all of you...

72
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,520
"The Toad Prince versus the Crayfish Demon"?

73
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,950
Is this the script?

74
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,740
How is it?

75
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,410
Rejected!

76
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,990
I'm also against it!

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,950
Why should we do what that old guy wants?

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,620
Isn't he always just looking down on us?

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,350
Why should we do what he wants?

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,290
That's true.

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,660
I can fully understand why you're saying this.

82
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,120
I know that you all...

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,860
hate me.

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,940
But just that play...

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,910
Wha... wha... what's going on?

86
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,200
Hot!

87
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,900
Onuki!

88
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,310
Onuki.

89
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,810
Not so close... your beard is prickling me.

90
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,210
What's with the air conditioner next to the bicycle parking lot?

91
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,540
Are you OK? Do you want to lay down?

92
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,550
It's natural that you're angry.

93
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,560
But...

94
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,550
What?

95
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,720
Is that true?!

96
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,560
What?

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,550
But, isn't this strange?

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,400
But... but isn't everyone of us needed for this script?

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,830
So what?

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,300
Who's gonna watch?

101
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,800
Good morning!

102
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,560
Oh!

103
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,610
It's a really superb suggestion, right?

104
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,340
Wha... what's that?!

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,350
I'm the only one without a role!

106
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,270
There aren't enough characters in this play.

107
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,650
Rejected! Absolutely rejected!

108
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,580
Then you're just discarding the weak ones as always.

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,920
You're just a prankster, after all.

110
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,520
Humans... humans...

111
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,590
One, two...

112
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,630
I absolutely cannot play that role.

113
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,170
No problem. I'll give the role and the company to someone else...

114
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,400
I'll do it. Please let me do it.

115
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,300
Wow! I'm the Toad Prince! Isn't that the main character?

116
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,070
You've got a nice role.

117
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,730
Here, you're "Medaka"...

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,210
I absolutely won't do that!

119
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,310
Hey, hey. This is gonna be fun!

120
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,810
Let me join in!

121
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,330
What?

122
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,730
You've touched my cheek yesterday, too, right?

123
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,570
Yes.

124
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,410
I'm Onuki.

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,930
Onuki?

126
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes.

127
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,810
Come.

128
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,740
I'll read this picture book to you.

129
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,080
Why the hell should we do that just for that child's entertainment?!

130
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,610
Don't make fun of us!

131
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,520
You're just an old fart who laughs about people who are suffering!

132
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,020
And now you're suddenly acting like a good person!

133
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,230
It's already too late to pretend that you're a good person!

134
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,730
Someone like you should just drop dead! You should die and go straight to hell!

135
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,130
Please... please wait!

136
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,820
Listen to my story...

137
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't touch me, old man!

138
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,770
What's with that performance?!

139
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,660
Is he a bad person?

140
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,090
No.

141
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,590
He's not a bad person.

142
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,440
Let's go.

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,350
Do it!

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,620
What?

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,060
Do the performance! Aren't you an actor?

146
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,920
As I would do that...

147
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,500
Aren't you just scared?

148
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,530
Shut up! That's just nonsense!

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,130
Why should I take part in that performance,...

150
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,700
when that child will forget everything anyway?

151
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,600
You won't know that if you don't try it out!

152
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,780
"The Toad Prince is a selfish prince."

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,410
Let me go! Bitch!

154
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,810
"...and the Pond Skater..."

155
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,990
"to do mean things again."

156
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,980
I believe him. He's...

157
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,190
trying to let something remain...

158
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,330
in this girl's heart, which is forgetting everything...

159
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,760
Even though it seems stupid.

160
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,870
"Haven't you heard my orders?"

161
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,370
This is stupid!

162
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,540
I'll do it.

163
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,170
What?

164
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,680
I'll play the Medaka!

165
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,650
I'll show you damned weak coward...

166
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,220
the willpower of a layperson!

167
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,130
Ribbit, ribbit.

168
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,940
"I'm very hungry!"

169
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,850
"I'm in a bad mood."

170
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,480
"The malicious Toad Prince..."

171
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,850
"The Toad Princess was worried about the Toad Prince."

172
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,150
The Toad Princess?

173
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,490
She's the mother of the Toad Prince.

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,490
Wow, Kinomoto. You have a daughter?

175
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,570
Well, I haven't seen her for the last twenty years, but...

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,100
she's going to marry soon!

177
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,900
He's the employee of a top-notch trading company.

178
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,970
Isn't that wonderful?

179
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,500
Because this is going to be a big change for her, she had sent me this card.

180
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,800
Are you going to the ceremony?

181
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,670
I can't go. Which face should I show them?

182
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,710
This one? Or one with a beard?

183
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,180
If her father, who looks like her mother,...

184
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,620
would appear, everybody would laugh!

185
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,580
It would be too embarrassing.

186
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,150
Look, here...

187
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,960
It even stands here: "You don't need to come to the ceremony".

188
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,960
You're always so cheerful, Kinomoto.

189
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,120
He's dead?

190
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,900
Junpei has been...

191
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,370
killed?

192
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,700
Shall we go back to your room, Paco?

193
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,910
He's dead...

194
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,550
Junpei...

195
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,620
Was he a relative?

196
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,790
Or a friend?

197
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,960
A monkey.

198
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:52,820
A monkey?

199
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,400
A monkey.

200
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,630
He sometimes came from the mountains to play with me...

201
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,830
Strawberries.

202
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,140
He ate them straight out of my hand.

203
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,640
Out of my hand.

204
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,480
We've played together in my room.

205
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,890
One day he's found a gun from my gang which I've kept.

206
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,080
He was so clever.

207
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,890
He turned to my direction...

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,930
and shot me...

209
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,030
You...

210
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,760
You've been brought here, after a monkey had shot you?

211
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,890
Don't you believe me?

212
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,930
No.

213
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,830
He was so shocked.

214
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,840
He just screamed and ran off to the mountains...

215
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,240
Yesterday, he's been shot by a huntsman.

216
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,940
If you think it's funny, just go on and laugh...

217
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,780
This hospital...

218
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,050
is only full of crazy people.

219
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Yes.

220
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,020
That quack doctor...

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,860
has taught me how to stop crying.

222
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,090
Do you want to know how?

223
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,770
Yes.

224
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,430
If you cry a lot, it will stop.

225
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,320
Junpei is dead...

226
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,620
He's dead...

227
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,790
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

228
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,830
Junpei is dead...

229
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,270
He can't be dead...

230
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,270
"I don't know why, but..."

231
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,970
"So many tears are flowing down!"

232
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,670
"All the tears the others have cried up to now..."

233
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,840
"are now flowing out of my eyes."

234
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,950
"I won't forgive him, I won't forgive him. I won't forgive the Crayfish Demon."

235
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,150
Because of the Crayfish Demon's pincers...

236
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,620
my body is all worn-out...

237
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,760
as long as I have courage...

238
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,330
I'll fight against him with all my might!

239
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,800
"Toad Prince, don't cry and don't lose."

240
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,770
"Cute, cute..."

241
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,310
"Toad Prince..."

242
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,780
"But the Crayfish Demon's very strong!"

243
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,820
"I'll die soon!"

244
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,060
"But the Toad Prince is..."

245
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,900
"always standing up again"

246
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,600
"He's always, always standing up again"

247
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,140
Hey, what is that?!

248
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,640
You've written this script and made it extra "cute", right?

249
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,950
You've written it, right?! I'll kill you, old fart!

250
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,150
"Its wondrous power is letting me do this."

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,500
"This feeling was suddenly born in a corner of my heart"

252
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,820
"A gentle feeling that was suddenly born."

253
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,190
"Sorry everybody! Sorry everybody!"

254
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,270
"But the Crayfish Demon's very strong!"

255
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,770
"I'll..."

256
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,270
"die soon!"

257
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,120
I won't forgive him, I won't forgive him, I won't forgive the Crayfish Demon"

258
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,390
Muromachi!

259
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,740
Takita! Takita!

260
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,110
Hang in there!

261
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,540
What's with him?

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,650
Takita!

263
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,710
Aren't you a fireman?

264
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,580
Muromachi...

265
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,880
Why?

266
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,780
Takita!

267
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,930
What happened?

268
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,830
What happened, answer!

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,160
We fell together.

270
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
From a window... from the third floor...

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,230
Why?!

272
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,340
I don't know!

273
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,830
He just suddenly tried to hold on to me!

274
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,300
Have you tried to jump out of the window?

275
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,380
But, I can't do this!

276
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,420
I've tried to read it and try it out...

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,590
But... I can't do it.

278
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,670
I can't do such a cute performance!

279
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,510
Even though I'm the Crayfish Demon... the villain's part...

280
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,570
I'm not scary at all.

281
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:05,940
I...

282
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,370
I'm not good enough anymore...

283
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,610
Don't fool me.

284
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,820
Don't fool me!

285
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,120
Let me go!

286
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,620
There was once a stupid little girl.

287
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,650
What?

288
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,060
And she liked a certain boy.

289
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,990
But he was a person on the other side of the television screen.

290
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,970
She saw him in the role of a child who was dying in a hospital...

291
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,970
She was really touched and couldn't stop crying...

292
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,070
And without knowing she's become a nurse...

293
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,730
You...

294
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,870
It wasn't me!

295
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,310
That girl...

296
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,080
had seen all movies and all his appearances on TV...

297
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,850
When the boy had grown big...

298
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,420
and became unpopular...

299
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,390
Even though everybody had forgotten him...

300
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,860
she could never forget him!

301
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,060
Ah!

302
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,170
Don't fool me, dammit!

303
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,980
Is that your's?

304
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,820
That girl...

305
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,660
was living together with two good-for-nothing parents...

306
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,230
They were poor and stupid...

307
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,130
They were evil...

308
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,500
There were no good things in her life...

309
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,040
<i>Title: The Ugly Duckling</i>

310
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,380
But...

311
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,750
But when she looked at that boy...

312
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,810
she was so happy.

313
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,930
You were...

314
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,930
the dream of that child.

315
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,430
Do it!

316
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,770
Play the Crayfish Demon!

317
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,770
It doesn't matter whether you're weak, bad...

318
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,780
a kid or a transvestite!

319
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,650
Show it to her one more time!

320
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,880
Hey, am I going to die?

321
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,950
She wants to see it!

322
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,870
This child...

323
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,810
This year at Summer Christmas...

324
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,020
we'll start for today in the waiting room...

325
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,250
and will be performing the act...

326
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,190
"The Toad Prince versus the Crayfish Demon".

327
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,660
Wow, what's this?

328
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh, the Pond Skater.

329
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,500
The Whirligig Beetle...

330
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,670
Fish, and...

331
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,340
Medaka.

332
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,300
The Pond Snail and...

333
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,380
and a strange... insect?

334
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm the Dragonfly Larva.

335
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,380
A dragonfly larva? There was a dragonfly larva?

336
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,610
No, there wasn't.

337
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,720
It's just a shaky old man.

338
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,710
I'm the Dragonfly Larva.

339
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,620
The title we'll present to you is...

340
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,290
"The Toad Prince versus the Crayfish Demon"

341
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,330
Ribbit, ribbit.

342
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,250
Oh, a frog!

343
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,420
"Bring me my snacks, I'm very hungry!"

344
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,390
"I'm in a bad mood."

345
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,260
Toad Prince!

346
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,650
"The Toad Prince is a selfish prince."

347
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,660
"The Whirligig Beetle is swimming very fast..."

348
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,350
Fast, fast.

349
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,520
"The Pond Skater is swimming up and down..."

350
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,560
Up and down.

351
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,060
"He's ordering them to do mean things again."

352
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,660
Could it be that she's suddenly become very cute?

353
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,370
"Bring me my snacks, kidnap the bee's children!"

354
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,070
What're you saying? We can't do that.

355
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,770
Ah!

356
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,410
We're living in the water.

357
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,670
How should we be able to kidnap the bee's children?

358
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,810
Oh, why are you talking in Kansai dialect?

359
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,250
Don't change your text!

360
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,980
Ouch!

361
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,450
Go on, go on...

362
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,180
Go on...

363
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,910
Ah, now I've forgot everything.

364
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,850
Idiot!

365
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,020
Ah, sorry. We'll try to go on.

366
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,960
What?

367
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,200
"Haven't you heard my orders?"

368
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,920
"Take this, then!"

369
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,330
Bachan!

370
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,390
Keron!

371
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,370
How mean!

372
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,370
Bachan Keron!

373
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,440
Please forgive me...!

374
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,010
Stop it! Toad Prince! Stop it!

375
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,680
"The angry Toad Prince..."

376
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,180
"destroyed the house of the Pond Skater,..."

377
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,360
"the house of the Whirligig Beetle..."

378
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,190
"and the house of the Pond Snail."

379
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,800
Let me go, let me go, let me go!

380
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,730
Stop it! Stop it!

381
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,910
"And also the house of an insect which I don't know."

382
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,540
I'm the Dragonfly Larva.

383
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,610
"He's destroyed all of them."

384
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,410
Ah!

385
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:22,980
Hm.

386
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,650
This song is "Miserarete".

387
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,330
What? What? What is that?

388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,030
<i>Women are like the sea</i>

389
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,610
Oh? Who's that? An enemy?

390
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,930
I'm the princess!

391
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,670
Impossible!

392
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,610
Toad Princess...

393
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,010
Toad Prince...

394
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,210
My sweet, sweet...

395
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,940
Toad Prince.

396
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,390
Why have you become such a malicious child?

397
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,690
This performance stinks!

398
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,130
Oh! Over there he's...

399
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,630
destroying the flowers which the Medakas had raised.

400
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,200
Stop!

401
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,900
Let's go! We have to save them!

402
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,300
Yes!

403
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,710
Come, let's go together.

404
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,980
Yes!

405
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,570
Go!!!

406
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,040
YES!!!

407
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,870
Onuki was so enthusiastic.

408
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,670
That was a nice Christmas.

409
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,840
The last one?

410
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,770
You knew?

411
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,340
Medical science can't do anything anymore.

412
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,960
How much?

413
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,110
How much time is left?

414
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,000
Can medical science at least predict that?

415
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,840
The predicted time span has already passed a long time ago.

416
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,830
Hey, hey, whose turn is it now?

417
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,070
Now, the Medaka's flowers are going to be eaten and the Toad Prince's belly will start shining...

418
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,970
Medaka? That's my turn!

419
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,450
Why didn't you tell me?

420
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,280
What? I?

421
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,820
It's OK, the Dragonfly Larva is helping out.

422
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,740
The Dragonfly Larva?

423
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,520
Stop, Toad Prince.

424
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,520
Stop, Toad Prince!

425
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,120
Stop, Toad Prince!

426
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,290
Further, there's something I'm really worried about.

427
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,190
Shut up.

428
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,830
But it's about the "Last Rain".

429
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,830
Last Rain?

430
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,700
It's coming! Something terrible is coming!

431
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,430
What?

432
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,700
There it is!

433
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,720
Bugegegegegegege...

434
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,190
Buge...

435
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,590
I work for the Crayfish Demon:

436
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,990
I'm the Mud Lobster Witch!

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,260
Scary! That's really scary!

438
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,490
Such worthless beings like you...

439
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,500
shall all become food for the demon!

440
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,900
Bugegegegegegege...

441
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,440
Buge...

442
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,170
No! It hurts!

443
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,170
That's too much, Masami.

444
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,350
Who the hell is Masami?

445
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,250
So that you can become the company's president...

446
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,520
no... so that the dogs can wear clothes...

447
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,820
I'll do everything!

448
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,900
What's going on?

449
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,830
Impossible...

450
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,630
Cr... Cr... Cr... Cr...

451
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,900
Crayfish...

452
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,970
Demon.

453
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,680
Exactly!

454
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,790
My name is...

455
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,690
Crayfish Demon.

456
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,760
I don't get it.

457
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,100
Such lowly and not cute creatures like you...

458
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,940
cannot be allowed in my lake!

459
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,710
It's scary, but in a different way than before!

460
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,140
It's evil and cute at the same time...

461
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,580
Such garbage like you...

462
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,720
should all be eaten by me as a snack!

463
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,030
Beautiful...

464
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,670
What're you doing, dammit?!

465
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,580
Bugegegegege...

466
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,610
That's too mean, you...

467
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,650
Bugegegege...!

468
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,150
Buge... Buge...

469
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,120
Human speech cannot describe this anymore...

470
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,850
Buge....!

471
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,320
Stop it!

472
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,150
"And so everyone in the lake..."

473
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,350
"had been eaten by the Crayfish Demon."

474
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
Everyone?

475
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,800
Yes, everyone!

476
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,600
It hurts! Let me go!

477
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,380
Hikomaro!

478
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,290
Bugegegege...!

479
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,290
Buge...

480
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,860
Buge...!

481
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
Ribbit.

482
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,770
Ribbit!

483
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,610
Toad Prince!

484
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,320
Wha... what happened?

485
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,530
Hey, Toad Prince, they're all dead!

486
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,260
I'll never forgive him...

487
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,330
I won't forgive him!

488
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,600
I won't forgive the...

489
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,540
Crayfish Demon!

490
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,260
I won't forgive you, too!

491
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,370
I was so malicious up to now.

492
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,910
I was so stupid.

493
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,710
I've done so many mean things up to now.

494
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,810
I was such a blockhead.

495
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,350
I won't forgive him, I won't forgive him, I won't forgive him!

496
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,520
I won't forgive the...

497
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,850
Crayfish Demon!

498
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,630
You...

499
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,350
Paco, where did he go?

500
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,430
That way!

501
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,130
Let's go, Paco!

502
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,390
Yes!

503
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,300
Assault!

504
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,140
Hm... was that really him?

505
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,140
He seemed like a different person.

506
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,950
That's what happens when he's together with a child.

507
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,480
Why are you crying?

508
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,990
Because... because...

509
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,990
The air conditioner...

510
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,260
Bugegegege...

511
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,060
Oh, Masami is dead.

512
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:49,990
Yes!

513
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,830
Now, peace will finally return.

514
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,270
We've defeated the Mud Lobster Witch, right?

515
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,500
Yes, a strange insect...

516
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,510
The Dragonfly Larva?

517
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,980
I'll kill you!

518
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,610
Imago!

519
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:13,850
Here!

520
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,690
You!

521
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,160
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

522
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,130
Toad Prince!

523
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,150
Ribbit!

524
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,430
You!

525
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,880
Don't lose, Toad Prince!

526
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,170
What?

527
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,680
How impudent!

528
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,850
Toad Prince!

529
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,030
Sorry, everybody!

530
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,330
Sorry, everybody!

531
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,190
Toad Prince!

532
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,360
Die!

533
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,270
I was so malicious up to now.

534
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,470
Help me, Toad Prince!

535
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,810
It was such a stupid blockhead.

536
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,680
I want to do something for them...

537
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,320
Toad Prince!

538
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,480
But...

539
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,340
But the Crayfish Demon is very strong!

540
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,580
I'll...

541
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,280
die soon!

542
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,090
But...

543
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,620
I'll stand up every time!

544
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,200
Its wondrous power is letting me do this.

545
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,630
"This feeling that was suddenly born..."

546
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,110
"in a corner of my heart."

547
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,510
Don't lose!

548
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,010
Sorry...

549
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,080
Everybody.

550
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,240
Sorry!

551
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,490
Everybody...!

552
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,460
Toad Prince!

553
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,440
Oh, wha... wha... what now, Toad Prince?

554
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,470
Onuki?

555
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,380
Onuki?

556
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,650
Hurry, Tamako. Bring him to the hospital room!

557
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,450
No, let me finish this, please.

558
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm OK, it's just a spasm.

559
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,960
Don't talk anymore!

560
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,460
I want to finish it.

561
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,240
This is the dying scene anyway...

562
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,600
Onuki, hey, Onuki. What's going on?

563
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,810
It's OK, Paco.

564
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,350
See, the story will be over soon.

565
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,760
I have no choice but to pull "that" out, then.

566
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,760
Here, press it!

567
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,470
What's that?

568
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,970
Hm? What's that?

569
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
You're a jokester, huh?

570
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,560
Ahhh... that impudent Toad Prince...

571
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,390
That you still had such a power left...

572
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,090
I... I...

573
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,860
I've lost!

574
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,500
What's that?

575
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,510
What?

576
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,350
This is the rain of the last scene.

577
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,850
This is supposed to be rain?

578
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,450
Even shabbiness has its limit.

579
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,880
That's why I wanted to talk to you about it before...

580
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,050
Kouichi...

581
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,560
Sorry, uncle.

582
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,290
Hm.

583
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,860
How miserable.

584
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,110
Hey you. Please...

585
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,130
Please read the rest of the story.

586
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,540
But...

587
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,870
If you don't read it till the end,...

588
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,890
it won't be possible tomorrow as well.

589
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,030
I'll read it.

590
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,170
"After the Toad Prince had died, it was raining heavily."

591
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,380
"As if everyone in heaven was crying"

592
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,340
"It was raining heavily."

593
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,290
"After the Toad Prince had died, it was raining heavily."

594
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,660
"The rain which the frog always loved so much, was falling down from heaven."

595
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,300
Rain.

596
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,710
What a heavy rain.

597
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,470
No...

598
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,410
There's someone in the garden!

599
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,740
Is that Takita?

600
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,350
It's Takita!

601
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,850
Takita!

602
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,680
You're a great fireman!

603
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,080
Buge!

604
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,160
Rain more! Rain more!

605
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,100
"After the Toad Prince had died, the water plants'..."

606
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,040
"lovely, lovely small yellow flowers..."

607
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
"started to blossom gently..."

608
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,170
"The small, small yellow flowers..."

609
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,150
"were blooming in the big, big lake."

610
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,550
"This was the story of a small, small frog..."

611
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:32,390
"in a big, big lake."

612
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,900
Paco...

613
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,810
I'm really glad now that you've told me this story...

614
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,310
till the end.

615
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,640
End?

616
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,040
What?

617
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,810
But... he had died, didn't he?

618
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,420
Not at all, meow!

619
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,480
It really was just a spasm after all.

620
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,620
After he rested for a while...

621
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,230
He recovered immediately.

622
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,950
What?

623
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,960
What?

624
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,800
What? Would it have been better if he'd died, meow?

625
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,360
Ah, no, but...

626
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,270
That it turned out that way...

627
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,940
It was much more moving the way before.

628
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,300
Well, then... he died.

629
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,300
"Well, then", stop lying!

630
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,610
Don't make things up, please.

631
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,050
Oh... But...

632
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,050
I wanted to change the truth so that you like it...

633
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,550
It doesn't matter whether I like it or not. The truth is the truth, right?

634
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,660
Yes.

635
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,820
Please tell me the truth till the end.

636
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,500
Yes, I've understood.

637
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,160
Now I'll tell you the truth.

638
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,610
The true end...

639
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,430
Uncle! Uncle!

640
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,430
Onuki.

641
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,300
It's time to say goodbye.

642
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,410
Just let her peacefully pass away.

643
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,980
I beg you!

644
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,880
If I don't touch her cheek...

645
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,710
she won't know who I am!

646
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,180
Onuki.

647
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,280
You know,...

648
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,990
because you've read that picture book with her together,...

649
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,560
she had felt like a normal child.

650
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,390
But Onuki...

651
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,730
Really,...

652
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,000
just by meeting you, she had felt like the child she could've never really been.

653
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,900
I just want to touch her cheek.

654
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,510
I beg you, doctor!

655
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,680
I...

656
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,050
I want to be in that girl's heart!

657
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,230
This...

658
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,400
This picture book...

659
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,300
is the book I've been reading with her together!

660
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,910
I don't need it.

661
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,320
I don't need that book anymore.

662
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,390
I don't need it. I don't need that book anymore!

663
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,610
Paco...

664
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,260
It's your birthday, right?

665
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,390
Happy birthday.

666
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,510
"You..."

667
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,240
"It makes me angry that you know me".

668
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
The person who always had said that...

669
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,240
while desperately trying to remain in Paco's heart...

670
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,620
managed to remain in the hearts of everybody.

671
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,020
So this is the story behind this book.

672
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,160
It's regrettable! I...

673
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,430
Ah, no... his story was quite lovely, right?

674
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,170
It was based on the book I had written.

675
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,040
What?

676
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,450
"Horigome..."

677
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,140
What?

678
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,180
You're the author of this book?

679
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,480
I've disturbed you long enough.

680
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,350
Bye.

681
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,720
Oh, yes...

682
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,400
I've forgot the most important thing.

683
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,430
Oh!

684
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,900
That's...

685
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,100
So that we would never forget what happened...

686
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,730
everyone of us...

687
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,910
got a page of the tattered book.

688
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,180
But even without it...

689
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,280
I will never forget what happened.

690
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,590
I give it back.

691
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,620
Because of its title and bad workmanship...

692
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,360
this book didn't sell at all.

693
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,360
But this book is still...

694
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,100
the most happy book on earth.

695
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,640
Bye.

696
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,990
"The Toad Prince versus the Crayfish Demon"

697
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,900
What?

698
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,440
Erm.

699
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,700
Ribbit!

700
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:40,910
Oh!

701
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,920
Wow!

702
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,510
Toad Prince.

703
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,410
Ribbit!

704
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,300
One, two, three, four.

705
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,530
<i>You've made a pool of water with your tears.</i>

706
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,000
<i>Let's swim together in it</i>

707
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,570
<i>Please tell me the reason of your tears</i>

708
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,830
<i>Up and down, up and down</i>

709
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,980
<i>We'll jump over it</i>

710
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,350
<i>After you've started laughing, the sun came out</i>

711
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,820
<i>Your tears were twinkling</i>

712
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:09,360
<i>Let us search for your treasure</i>

713
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,760
<i>Up, up, up, up</i>

714
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,830
<i>Let's go up to the sky.</i>

715
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,530
<i>Because you are here, the flowers are blooming</i>

716
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,040
<i>Please remember what happened today</i>

717
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,510
<i>Women are like the sea</i>

718
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,640
"Bachan Keron."

719
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,710
"Bachan Keron."

720
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,410
""Bring me my snacks."

721
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,070
"Kidnap the bee's children!"

722
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,320
"The Toad Prince is a selfish prince."

723
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,790
"The Toad Prince is a hated prince."

724
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,280
End!

725
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:20,830
