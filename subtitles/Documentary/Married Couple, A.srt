Jang Chul Soo.

7
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,569
Did you think I left?

8
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,612
You were no where to be found
since this morning. I thought you left.

9
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,309
What’s with your expression?

10
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,306
I thought you’d be happy if I’m gone.

11
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,221
I was happy.

12
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,552
I’m disappointed now.

13
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,685
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

14
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,122
I have no plans to leave yet.

15
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,255
Although I might be
bugging you like that,

16
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:55,186
I can only depend on you now.

17
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,798
The dog went missing so
I went out to look for it.

18
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,763
Na Sang Shil.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,327
When you really want to leave,

20
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,952
Don’t leave without a word.

21
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,849
Tell me that you’re
leaving, or leave a note.

22
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,995
What difference does it make?

23
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:17,321
If you leave a note, I wouldn’t
have to waste time looking for you.

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,826
You…

25
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,766
were looking for me?

26
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:26,908
If Ggot Soon went missing,
you’d look for her too right?

27
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:29,294
Me too. If you went missing,
of course I’d look for you too.

28
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:30,876
So you meant,

29
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:32,954
you’d search for me as if
you’re searching for a dog?

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,159
That’s right.

31
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,141
Some more, about Ggot Soon...

32
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:39,144
she occasionally goes looking
for the neighbor’s dog.

33
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,192
You don’t have to bother looking for her.

34
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:47,818
Hey...dog!

35
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:49,536
Did you go out to date?

36
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,494
How can a dog not guard the
house and instead go off on a date?

37
00:02:00,074 --> 00:02:02,075
Don’t wander off. Guard the house properly!

38
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,998
Got worried for nothing.

39
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,449
I should be worried that she’s not leaving.

40
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,056
Why am I worried now that she’s leaving?

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,353
It’s normal for her to leave.

42
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:22,841
Of course she has to leave.

43
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:31,430
I’m going to see Anna today.

44
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,311
Not bad.

45
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,302
Right.. that’s better.

46
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,444
I told you to adjust it better.

47
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:50,450
Oh that’s right.

48
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:53,444
2 times will do.

49
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,851
Oh yes.

50
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:00,493
The last weapon to
attract Anna’s attention…

51
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:04,666
Princess…

52
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,904
There’s something wrong with my mobile phone.

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,771
What is it again?

54
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,318
It was still functioning well at home.

55
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:13,419
But the ring tone volume went down as I came out.

56
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:16,054
It’s noisier outside. Nothing’s wrong.

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,726
If you call again for no reason,

58
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:20,204
I’d have to confiscate your phone.

59
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,468
That’s it.

60
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,113
A wretched phone.

61
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:29,459
How about I use it to
order for jjajangmyun?

62
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:31,539
Unni!

63
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,915
Long time no see.

64
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:39,820
Unni.

65
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,182
You got a mobile phone?

66
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,390
Kang Ja, do you know how to make calls?

67
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,648
Yeah. What’s your number?

68
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,888
Tell me.

69
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:51,873
Kang Ja.

70
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,764
You have a phone too?

71
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,138
Jang Chul Soo.

72
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,839
Even Kang Ja has a phone, why
did you only get me one now?

73
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,559
I’m the only one who doesn’t
have a phone all this time.

74
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,580
Petty fella..

75
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,270
What is she talking about again?

76
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,692
Sang Shil’s really troublesome.

77
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:16,946
Then don’t answer her calls.

78
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:18,886
Or else, just switch off your phone.

79
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,824
I’m the only one she can call,
how can I switch off my phone?

80
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,821
I’d have to answer anyway.

81
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,259
Ha Duk Gu-ssi.

82
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,198
What’s the matter?

83
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,293
Your phone was switched off. I
was worried so I came to see you.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,002
What are you doing?

85
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,468
Working.

86
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,237
Duk Gu why are you
doing these kind of jobs?

87
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,062
It’s my hobby.

88
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:47,503
Alright?

89
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,113
Really…

90
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,287
I didn’t get it wrong..

91
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:55,873
It really is his interest.

92
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:57,957
He has 100 cows!

93
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,759
Ha Duk Gu-ssi!

94
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,279
The toilet in my house
is broken again.

95
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,004
Sang Shil, alright it’s done.

96
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,320
How do I store numbers?

97
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:09,994
Let me help you.

98
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:15,018
Kang Ja. Like this.

99
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,385
Can we take pictures with this?

100
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,319
Yea. We can even play
games and watch videos.

101
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:22,811
Games?

102
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,051
Let me see.

103
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:25,238
Here.

104
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,960
Yours is bigger than mine.

105
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:31,929
Bingo!

106
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,714
If I go in abruptly like this,

107
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,916
something bad might happen again.

108
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,026
I will have to pretend to
meet her up coincidentally.

109
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:58,583
When Anna comes…

110
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,754
I will leave Princess here.

111
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,507
You helped me find Princess again!

112
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,542
Let me treat you to dinner as
an appreciation for your help.

113
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:13,637
Princess.

114
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:14,752
Princess…what’s wrong?

115
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,221
Princess! Princess!

116
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:19,825
Princess! Princess!

117
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:20,738
Princess!

118
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:21,776
Princess!

119
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:23,877
Princess!

120
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,229
You helped me find Princess again.

121
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,228
As an appreciation…

122
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:39,274
You’re bleeding.

123
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,426
It’s okay.

124
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:41,563
It’s bleeding there too.

125
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,569
It’s alright.

126
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:44,861
You’re looking for her again?

127
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:46,967
It seems that she likes to wander off.

128
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,496
As an appreciation…

129
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:53,592
You look familiar.

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,766
I’ve seen you before several
times… you look familiar.

131
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:07,786
Na Sang Shil.. again?

132
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:12,370
Yes Hyung?

133
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,337
I’m very busy.

134
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,810
How could I have time for fishing?

135
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:19,678
What?

136
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:20,867
You know which yacht is it?

137
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,770
Didn’t you say it was a very big yacht?

138
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:24,994
Didn’t Young Bok just go to Seoul?

139
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,377
He has worked on a similar yacht before.

140
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:29,810
Young Bok?

141
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,261
I think I know the person.

142
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:35,099
It should be my high school senior.

143
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:39,688
He got fired for a small matter.

144
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:41,598
I even remember him
being furious back then.

145
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,238
Well just give me his
contact number now.

146
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:49,900
She’s not getting off me.

147
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:53,900
Yeah.

148
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,439
It’s as if you’re her owner.

149
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,109
This cat,

150
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,169
and also you…

151
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,696
are very familiar.

152
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,032
Because we’re family.

153
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:19,934
Your bruises, do they hurt?

154
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,293
If they hurt, plasters work well.

155
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,184
Do you want me to get you one?

156
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,357
Can you?

157
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,153
Anna’s worried about me.

158
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,263
It means she still
remembers me sub-consciously.

159
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:49,887
Where’s the plaster now?

160
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:55,117
Jang Chul Soo. What is it?

161
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:57,346
Come to the office. I will
treat you something delicious.

162
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,328
Right.

163
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,476
It’s the last time.

164
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,702
Treating me to something delicious.

165
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:16,303
He wants me to do something again.

166
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,516
Stick it here?

167
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:26,277
No… stick it on both sides.

168
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:36,498
Buy the plaster yourself.

169
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,944
I’m busy.

170
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,198
See ya.

171
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,211
Eat a lot.

172
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:00,422
Sorry for making you eat
jjajangmyun all the time.

173
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:03,600
I don’t it eat just because
you buy them for me.

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,212
I eat them because I like them.

175
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:08,329
I don’t eat food that
does not suit my taste.

176
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,733
That’s right.

177
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,382
You’ve stayed here long enough.

178
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,553
You’ve gotten used to it huh?

179
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,647
You didn’t like to eat
jjajangmyun in the past.

180
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:20,884
No.

181
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,638
Although I have lost my memory,

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,539
it’s impossible to like something
that I disliked in the past.

183
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:27,537
I like it now because
I liked it in the past.

184
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,919
That’s why, Jang Chul
Soo.. a person like you…

185
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,112
Since I liked you in the
past…so naturally now I…

186
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:36,881
won’t hate you.

187
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:42,713
Even if I remember everything in the future,

188
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,713
I will still like the
things I that I like now.

189
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:47,766
Till then you will know,

190
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,773
whether you will still like them or not.

191
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:53,009
Eat a lot.

192
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,956
But why is it only the two
of us eating good food?

193
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:58,730
What about the kids?

194
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:01,747
You’ve become caring for others
now huh?

195
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,668
It’s alright for today.

196
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,437
Let’s come again next time.

197
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:07,125
With the kids.

198
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:18,070
“Mom says she doesn’t like jjajangmyun.”

199
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:26,414
“Ahh.. we’re so in love.”

200
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:27,996
This mother is really strange.

201
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:29,785
Why doesn’t she like jjajangmyun?

202
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,560
It’s not that she doesn’t like it.

203
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,624
Didn’t she say that she doesn’t like it?

204
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:42,243
It’s not because she doesn’t like it.

205
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,314
She doesn’t like it for
the sake of her children.

206
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:47,856
Why?

207
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,354
Forget about it.

208
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,682
A mother’s great love and sacrifice...

209
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:58,044
how can Na Sang Shil
understand a thing like that?

210
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,274
The mother is so choosy.

211
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,806
She likes it yet she pretends not to.

212
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,523
I don’t like to be pretentious.

213
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,456
Sang Shil.

214
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,581
If someone lies to you…

215
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,010
Only those who don’t know
anything can live happily.

216
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,646
Live your life the way you want.

217
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,437
She just left like that? After telling
me that she would help me get a plaster?

218
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,455
How long would it take
to stick a plaster?

219
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,932
It must be Jang Chul Soo
who asked her to leave.

220
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:48,701
Hateful Jang Chul Soo!

221
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,067
I’m going to Seoul.

222
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,778
I will come back by tomorrow night at the latest.

223
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,610
What’s the matter?

224
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,261
I will tell you everything
after I come back.

225
00:12:58,707 --> 00:12:59,798
When I come back,

226
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:02,160
I will really tell you everything.

227
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,184
Take care of the kids.

228
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,966
I love you?

229
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:43,263
The title of the book sounds awkward.

230
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,743
The main characters are
Young Gu and Kyu Joo?

231
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,313
It’s not them.

232
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,211
Bang Gu you’re so cute.

233
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,516
It’s my sincere gift to you.

234
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,421
It’s a comic book. It’s more
convenient like this then.

235
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,811
The main guy’s name is Chul Soo.

236
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,983
I also know a person
by the name of Chul Soo.

237
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,926
I’m going to Seoul today,
with my son and Chul Soo.

238
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,286
There’s a wedding to attend.

239
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,056
Right, I can read the comic in the car.

240
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,838
Thank you Bang Gu.

241
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:23,959
Let’s go.

242
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:25,787
Noonim..

243
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:27,963
Why don’t you let me send you to Seoul?

244
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,236
Why?

245
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,865
I’m going with my son.

246
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,222
Oh it's just that...

247
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,303
I want to chat with you.

248
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,440
And have a nice meal
together at the resting place.

249
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:39,914
Nevermind.

250
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:46,928
Bang Gu.

251
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,893
Yes?

252
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,140
You’re really very cute.

253
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,447
Of course, I’m Young Gu.

254
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,436
Am I really cute?

255
00:15:14,221 --> 00:15:17,063
But why is Jang Chul Soo going to Seoul?

256
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:25,821
Assistant Gong,

257
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,300
where have you been lately
with your phone switched off?

258
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,288
Were you looking for me, Chairman?

259
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,285
Mr. Gong...

260
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,055
is there anyone called Bang Gu in our resort?

261
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:40,467
What?

262
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,396
That Bang Gu guy seemed to have
badmouthed me behind my back.

263
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,574
Spreading rumors about me going
after my dead wife’s property.

264
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,211
Now Anna knows about it.

265
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:53,273
Bang Gu.

266
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,976
It doesn’t sound like a formal name.

267
00:15:58,093 --> 00:15:59,630
Could it be a nick name?

268
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,609
Check out this Bang Gu guy for me.

269
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,004
Everything’s going berserk
now. I’m going crazy.

270
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,420
I am Bang Gu.

271
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,164
Chairman.

272
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,692
I’m sorry.

273
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:25,881
Are you sure you have
worked on the yacht before?

274
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,185
Of course.

275
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,949
The owner’s a wealthy foreigner’s wife.

276
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,720
She has a disgusting character.

277
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,155
Aren't all wealthy people the same?

278
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:40,709
She’s the owner of the yacht right?

279
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:45,081
We’re home.

280
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,188
What’ wrong?

281
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:57,562
Are you guys sick?

282
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,538
I think we got a cold.

283
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:01,835
Cold?

284
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,571
What do I have to do?

285
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,724
Bring us to the hospital.

286
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,417
Alright.

287
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:11,780
Let’s go now.

288
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,612
So you don’t know this woman?

289
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,378
The yacht that I had worked on...

290
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:19,463
is this one.

291
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,616
It looks the same,

292
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,090
but it’s not this one.

293
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:26,578
There are not many big
yachts in the country.

294
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,228
I will help you ask around,

295
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,061
but I’m not sure if
this can really help.

296
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,567
Please do it for us.

297
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,145
Alright.

298
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:35,789
What do we do now?

299
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,462
Since we’re in Seoul now,

300
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:40,225
we’ll just go check at the
Missing Person’s Center then.

301
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:41,637
Let’s go.

302
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,345
According to your situation,

303
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,041
it’d be quite difficult if
nobody comes to look for her here.

304
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,565
If anyone contacts you, give me a call.

305
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:59,446
Did you take in someone unrelated?

306
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:02,920
Do you want any information on
homes which take in such people?

307
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:06,944
Jang Chul Soo.

308
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,473
I beg you…please abandon Anna.

309
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,891
If you abandon her, then
only I can take her back.

310
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,404
Abandon her.

311
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,628
They’re back from their cold shots
already. They’re sleeping now.

312
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,238
You’re not coming home today?

313
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:28,894
I still have some things to handle.

314
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:30,579
Thanks a lot for taking care of them.

315
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,558
I will go home early tomorrow morning.

316
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,911
Thank you for doing this.

317
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,568
Ahjumma… Ahjumma…

318
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:14,521
What is it?

319
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,069
Geun Suk’s is feeling really sick.

320
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,488
They got their shots already
and took their medicine.

321
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:29,442
Why are they still like this?

322
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:37,289
Don’t cry.

323
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,816
Don’t cry.

324
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,170
What are their body temperatures?

325
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:45,289
I don’t know.

326
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:46,478
How am I supposed to know?

327
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:48,320
I have a thermometer in my drawer.

328
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,092
It’s not very serious.

329
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:08,480
Did you give them fever medicine?

330
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,578
They took the medicine given
by the hospital already.

331
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,140
But they’re still vomiting.

332
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,635
It’s normal when
they’re down with fevers.

333
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,489
You know the cooling method right?

334
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,003
The fever has resided.
Then it’s alright now.

335
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,410
I will rush home as soon as possible.

336
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,166
Thank you Sang Shil.

337
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:01,450
Come home quickly.

338
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,786
I’m tired.

339
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:27,933
I really hate being sick.

340
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,547
Kids…

341
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,788
Why did you all fall sick together?

342
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:06,869
My child…

343
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,023
I feel very sick..

344
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,503
I’m dying soon.

345
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,498
No.

346
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:16,410
I don’t like to be sick.

347
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,179
And I don’t like death too.

348
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,629
Mom and Dad died already,

349
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:23,605
Grandma, you don’t have to die either.

350
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:25,661
My poor child.

351
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,732
I will hold onto your hand.

352
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,026
Don’t go.

353
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:38,218
You won’t have any family
to hold onto in future.

354
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,863
Poor child.

355
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,470
What dream was that?

356
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:20,702
I will let you be, since you’re sick.

357
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:45,898
Did something happen?

358
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:50,135
Kids…

359
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,555
It’s time to eat.

360
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:57,901
Ahjumma, we’re unable to eat rice.

361
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,349
You have to eat to gain energy.

362
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:00,752
Only then you will recover fast.

363
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:03,021
Our throats are sore.

364
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:05,146
It’s painful.

365
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,027
But you still have to eat.

366
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:10,418
Will you have to eat porridge?

367
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:14,949
It’s burnt.

368
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,545
And there’s only little rice left.

369
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,233
Do I have to add more?

370
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:26,822
Jang Chul Soo.

371
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,840
Oppa is not in?

372
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:34,750
No, he’s not.

373
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:37,999
He’s not in his office.
I was worried so I came.

374
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,973
Since he’s not in,
then I will just leave.

375
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,612
Flower girl.

376
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:51,892
You know how to cook porridge right?

377
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,598
They must have sweated a lot.

378
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,509
Did you help them change their clothes?

379
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,101
No, I didn’t.

380
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:07,496
They must have felt thirsty?

381
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,068
Did you give them any water to drink?

382
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,079
No.

383
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:13,191
So I just give them water?

384
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:18,156
How can you let them drink
cold water when they’re sick?

385
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,117
Do you have barley tea?

386
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,045
No.

387
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,805
Then go buy some barley tea.

388
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:31,058
Alright.

389
00:25:47,842 --> 00:25:49,363
The house is in a mess.

390
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:51,460
What did they do?

391
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:03,249
Sang Shil.

392
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:04,529
Na Sang Shil.

393
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:06,940
Oppa.

394
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,302
Yu Kyeong.

395
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,305
Why are you here?

396
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:11,714
Where is Sang Shil?

397
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:14,794
She went out to buy something.

398
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,951
I cooked porridge for the kids already.

399
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,948
The fever has gone down. Don’t worry.

400
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,394
Kids…

401
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:25,220
Are you guys alright?

402
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,502
We’re fine now.

403
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,435
We were really sick.

404
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:31,123
Uncle...

405
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:32,791
Alright. Everything’s fine now.

406
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,199
Flower girl.

407
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:53,080
You came at the right
moment. You’re clever enough.

408
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,339
Well..

409
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,264
For the sick kids,

410
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,414
Flower Girl would come
more useful than me.

411
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,532
I hate being sick the most.

412
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:14,776
Just leave that. I’ll do it.

413
00:27:16,554 --> 00:27:19,075
With the kids sick,
why didn’t you call me?

414
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:22,716
Without any proper care,
they have been suffering.

415
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,191
Sang Shil is taking care of the kids.

416
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,655
What’s the use of having her around?

417
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:33,477
When I got here, she was even
going to give them cold soup!

418
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:37,509
Don’t know if she spilled
it, their beds were all wet.

419
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:40,340
Their clothes were soaked in sweat
and she didn't even get them changed.

420
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,793
Also, she’s been out
till now and not back yet.

421
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,478
Leaving these sick kids, can
she still be in the mood for fun?

422
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:47,911
Yu Kyeong.

423
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,010
Sang Shil may not be
experienced in the household,

424
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,811
But for the kids, she
has tried her best.

425
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,780
So don’t say that anymore.

426
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,027
I only said that because I
was worried for the kids.

427
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,892
Then I’ll be going.

428
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,481
Oppa.

429
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:15,233
You’re still hanging onto this?

430
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,254
Can you give this to me?

431
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,377
I’d like to have it.

432
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,173
If you like it, just take it.

433
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:48,845
Have the kids eaten the porridge?

434
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:51,798
Yes. It’s all done.

435
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,929
Get on it.

436
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,666
Whatever the case, thank you!

437
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,815
I didn’t do it for you.

438
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:03,083
Just the kids alone, they’re
already a big burden on oppa.

439
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:05,586
Even if you can’t help him,

440
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,275
You should not become his burden, too.

441
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:23,261
Why does Flower Bouquet keep saying the
right things these days? So upsetting.

442
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,225
Don’t give up.

443
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:30,648
If I give up then I can’t
stick with him any longer.

444
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:34,959
I have no where else to go too.

445
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,672
Just a short period and
everything’s in a mess.

446
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:41,597
Uncle, I’m so sick.

447
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:47,224
It’s alright. You’ve taken the medicine.

448
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:48,881
Sleep some more.

449
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:55,682
What’s this?

450
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:01,225
Joon Suk, how are you feeling?

451
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,837
I’m not sick anymore, I’m well already.

452
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:06,010
Uncle, I’m hungry.

453
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:07,372
Hungry?

454
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:09,435
Oh, because you only ate porridge.

455
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,895
I’m sorry I couldn’t be around.

456
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:14,965
Let’s eat something nice.

457
00:30:15,227 --> 00:30:16,039
Yes.

458
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:18,362
What do you feel like eating?

459
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:19,816
I’d like pizza.

460
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:20,976
Pizza?

461
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,413
Is that interesting?

462
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,584
Sang Shil.

463
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:44,022
What should I do with you?

464
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:30,909
Someone’s looking for the yacht?

465
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,666
Yes. Who?

466
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:35,951
Yes.

467
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:38,906
Please give me the
contact of that person.

468
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:40,373
Yes.

469
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,653
What is it?

470
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:48,754
Someone in Seoul is looking for the
yacht that was sold to Hong Kong.

471
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,547
Seoul?

472
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:53,663
Oh yes. Yesterday, Jang
Chul Soo went to Seoul.

473
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,856
Why did you say so only now?

474
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,744
Quickly get on a plane to
Seoul to solve this problem!

475
00:31:58,494 --> 00:31:59,570
Jang Chul Soo.

476
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,245
I think it’s impossible
to find that yacht.

477
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:06,874
Those are all high-ranking folks,
really hard to get in touch with.

478
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:09,687
I’m so sorry I can’t help you.

479
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:12,261
It’s alright.

480
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:14,139
Yes, I understand.

481
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:36,604
What you looking at?

482
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:39,080
What’s wrong?

483
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,992
Nothing, you eat.

484
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:42,407
I’m leaving.

485
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:45,661
Jang Chul Soo.

486
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,483
Didn’t you say when you got back
from Seoul, you’ll tell me everything?

487
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:56,069
Is something going on?

488
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:01,302
Let me think through it carefully
before I tell you.

489
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:15,461
You thought you could send her back
immediately, you must be disappointed.

490
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,061
Duk Gu.

491
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:21,183
Don’t you think it’s strange?

492
00:33:21,774 --> 00:33:24,003
The yacht….the call log too.

493
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:28,490
It’s like someone doesn’t
want Sang Shil to be found.

494
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:29,717
What?

495
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,666
That can’t be.

496
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,914
We can’t find the yacht, I’m feeling
down so I’m just saying that’s all.

497
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:41,357
You did well, Mr. Gong

498
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,565
Are you sure he will
not leak any information?

499
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:46,016
I can’t let any of this be out there.

500
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:53,229
Jang Chul Soo has thoughts
of sending Anna away.

501
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,349
As this goes on, if he
feels tired of it all,

502
00:33:57,406 --> 00:33:59,114
Naturally, he will abandon Anna.

503
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,745
There’s a limit to playing Mr. Nice Guy.

504
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,261
He didn’t bring his phone out huh?

505
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:22,550
Who is this?

506
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:25,943
This is the Missing Persons
Center. Is this Jang Chul Soo?

507
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:35,218
The Missing Persons
Center? You can tell me.

508
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:44,404
We wanted to suggest welfare facilities for
the person that Jang Chul Soo is taking care of.

509
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,407
Although he said it’s not necessary…

510
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,214
But since the person
is unrelated to him,

511
00:34:48,474 --> 00:34:50,432
We thought it would be better for him
if that person was sent to a facility.

512
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,114
Jang Chul Soo.

513
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,272
Playing Mr. Nice Guy.

514
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,985
Stupid retard.

515
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:05,266
What's this?

516
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:11,454
Now it’s Flower Bouquet?

517
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,610
I'm telling you straightforward.

518
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,464
I’m… not going to America anymore.

519
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:24,132
I will meet oppa and tell him this.

520
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,531
What?

521
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,523
Didn’t you leave Jang Chul Soo
and run to some other man?

522
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,500
I couldn't go.

523
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:39,602
I don't think I can leave oppa.

524
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:41,110
You...

525
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,855
Really...Jang Chul Soo…

526
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,824
I love him.

527
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,181
This feeling I have is for real.

528
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:57,163
And yours...it’s not love, is it?

529
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:13,809
That watch....

530
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,722
He gave it back to you?

531
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:21,404
Yes.

532
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,087
This watch....

533
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:31,803
You already know the significance
of this between me and oppa, right?

534
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:45,621
Both ends are coming at me so fiercely.

535
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:49,087
I don’t have staying power anymore.

536
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:58,257
What is it, Kang Ja?

537
00:36:58,575 --> 00:36:59,585
Unni, where are you?

538
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,964
On my way home.

539
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:03,029
I’m not in the mood now, hanging up.

540
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:05,528
Unni.

541
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,978
Unni, this time you call me.

542
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:16,821
You’re right here, why
do we need the phone?

543
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,147
There’s not a call on my phone.

544
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:22,315
There’s no snow and no call.

545
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,897
It’s all over.

546
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:36,011
What an ‘act cool’ song!

547
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,205
Hello? Long time no see.

548
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,873
I’ve called. That’s it, right?

549
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:45,845
Of course, I’m familiar with that area. Yes.

550
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,854
I’ve gone with my dad many times.

551
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:53,411
I can’t go.

552
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,243
Yes.

553
00:37:56,463 --> 00:37:57,850
Kang Ja,

554
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:02,108
Do you know why mothers say
they don’t like jjajangmyun?

555
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:04,573
My mum likes jjajangmyun very much.

556
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,818
Yes.

557
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:08,931
Mothers do like jjajangmyun.

558
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,291
But there are times
when they say they don’t.

559
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,701
That’s what they call
love and sacrifice.

560
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,452
That’s what Jung Chul Soo said.

561
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,619
Then, unni doesn’t like jjajangmyun?

562
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,252
Yea.

563
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,067
From now on,

564
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,991
I will say I don’t like it.

565
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:43,828
You’re here just to pass this to me?

566
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:45,397
Yes.

567
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:49,384
I’ve been calling you. You’re getting
irritated so you didn’t bring it out?

568
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,413
Yes, you’re irritating.

569
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:54,952
I thought so too.

570
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,290
Jang Chul Soo.

571
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:58,842
I feel like drinking
today. Give me a treat.

572
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:00,085
What?

573
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:02,473
Jjajangmyun with makgulee*,
how is that? (*Korean rice wine)

574
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:06,754
Jjajangmyun with makgulee,
do they go together?

575
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:08,242
What’s the problem with that?

576
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,127
Today, I’ll eat whatever
I feel like eating.

577
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,675
Today we’ll drink makgulee,
tomorrow we’ll go for jjajangmyun.

578
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:15,644
No.

579
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:17,891
Today, we’ll eat both.

580
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:23,210
Who ordered jjajangmyun?

581
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:24,367
Here.

582
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,974
Hyungnim, only today, never again.

583
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:45,326
Na Sang Shil,

584
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:48,316
Drinking makgulee like
this is really weird.

585
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,768
But it’s not bad too.

586
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,579
Of course it’s not bad.

587
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:54,191
That’s what I like.

588
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:55,445
Yes.

589
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:58,595
The two things that you like are
both here. Of course you’re happy.

590
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:01,890
No, it’s 3 things.

591
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,415
There’s Jang Chul Soo here too, right?

592
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:11,764
It’s my honor.

593
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:15,508
To be listed with
jjajangmyun and makgulee.

594
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,019
Don’t think too much about it.

595
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,825
I like you because you buy me food.

596
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:25,058
Yes, I’ll buy and into the future too.

597
00:40:25,264 --> 00:40:26,775
Eat a lot, Na Sang Shil.

598
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:52,405
Jang Chul Soo, what is that?

599
00:40:53,357 --> 00:40:54,957
That? That’s BungMakPan?

600
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,355
You want some?

601
00:40:56,406 --> 00:41:00,140
BungMakPan? See how awful it looks.

602
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,709
Awful looks aside, it tastes good.

603
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,446
Jang Chul Soo,

604
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:06,250
What is a JimDaeBang?

605
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,746
Don’t you like it when it’s heated up?

606
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:11,254
When we next have a chance,
let’s go. You’ll like it.

607
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:12,951
Heated up?

608
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:14,995
I like that.

609
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:19,405
Jang Chul Soo, what is this?

610
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,205
This is a doll machine.

611
00:41:22,676 --> 00:41:26,240
You seem to have come from another
world. Everything is new to you!

612
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:29,869
It’s true I’ve come from
another world, isn’t it?

613
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,588
My memory is at another
world I don’t know of.

614
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:40,440
Want to try getting a toy?

615
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:06,855
How can there be a machine like this?

616
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:09,161
A whole money-eating machine!

617
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,194
It’s a friend, your friend.

618
00:42:11,407 --> 00:42:13,128
I would never eat money so shamelessly.

619
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,333
Give me more money.

620
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:17,995
I must get that toy no matter what.

621
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,737
If you go on your way, the
house will not be ours anymore.

622
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,483
Shove aside.

623
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,161
It’s all about technique.

624
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,926
You did well, Jang Chul Soo!

625
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:44,471
A cat doll, huh?

626
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,977
Just nice. You like cats very much.

627
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,298
Is that so?

628
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:51,074
I knew that.

629
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,446
I’m going to take it away with me.

630
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:54,848
What?

631
00:42:55,383 --> 00:42:57,649
Huh? I said let’s go.

632
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:03,478
Why is she so happy today?

633
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:05,479
You’re coming along with me.

634
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:08,714
That’s good.

635
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:21,986
Sleeping again!

636
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:50,769
She’s not Na Sang Shil,
Jang Chul Soo!

637
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:53,637
Don’t get confused.

638
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,918
We’re off to school.

639
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:09,104
Yes, go well children.

640
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,050
I’m off.

641
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:19,330
Jang Chul Soo.

642
00:45:21,237 --> 00:45:22,303
What?

643
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:27,426
If you’re very bored
by yourself, call me.

644
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,142
Jang Chul Soo.

645
00:45:33,173 --> 00:45:34,007
What?

646
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,042
Thank you.

647
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,127
Take care.

648
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,313
Goodbye.

649
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,234
Dog,

650
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,961
Take care.

651
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,578
Go often and see your beloved.

652
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:29,058
Na Sang Shil is very quiet today.

653
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:31,485
Did she lose interest in
the hand phone so quickly?

654
00:47:32,635 --> 00:47:36,749
Chul Soo, are you really going
to let Miss Na earn her own money?

655
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:37,970
What?

656
00:47:38,176 --> 00:47:39,562
Miss Na looked me up,

657
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,280
She asked if she could make money by being
good at English and playing the piano.

658
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:45,843
Did Sang Shil ask you that?

659
00:47:46,057 --> 00:47:46,741
Yes.

660
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:57,403
Hello?

661
00:47:57,403 --> 00:47:58,813
<i>This is the Missing Persons Center.</i>

662
00:47:59,048 --> 00:48:01,554

Thank you.

668
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:12,301
Hyung, where are you off to?

669
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:14,441
In the middle of eating!
Where are you going, Chul Soo?

670
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,224
Sang Shil!

679
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:19,807
Got to figure out where she’s headed.

680
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:25,858
Just a minute.

681
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:31,705
This is the woman Chul Soo is
looking for, everyone take a look.

[Subject: Looking for Na
Sang Shil. Attachments: One]

683
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,359
This is the woman,
Chul Soo is looking for her.

684
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:51,506
[Saw her on the bus
headed for the city.]

685
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,705
[Saw her at the bus terminal.]

[Saw her at the highway bus terminal.

687
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:25,057
I got so far away from Chul Soo's house so quickly.

688
00:51:36,205 --> 00:51:36,914
Jang Chul Soo,

689
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:40,955
Why are you here?

690
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,579
Just come with me,
everyone’s looking for you.

691
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:44,348
No need.

692
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:46,434
It’s time for me to go anyway.

693
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,292
So you’ve regained your memory?

694
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:50,458
Yes.

695
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,643
That’s why I’m not
related to you anymore.

696
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,116
The money I borrowed I’ll pay
you back later, don’t worry.

697
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,505
Regained your memory?

698
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:01,416
Yes!

699
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,727
That’s fine, right?

700
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,903
Don’t tell lies.

701
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:08,349
If you did regain your memory, how
is it you’re still Na Sang Shil?

702
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:13,275
What…do you mean?

703
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:14,575
You...

704
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:16,688
You’re not Na Sang Shil!

705
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:35,225
Stealing a dog from the
kids, aren’t you ashamed?

706
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,999
Who was the one who first
sold somebody else’s cat?

707
00:52:43,926 --> 00:52:45,101
Didn’t I mention?

708
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:47,014
Our relationship is
already very “special”.

709
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:48,435
The butterfly knot is
as big as a watermelon,

710
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,712
No, looks good, looks good.

711
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:50,928
Just like a gift wrap box.

712
00:52:50,928 --> 00:52:53,105
I’m starving and you’re still eating?

713
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:55,128
You have food so you’re happy?

714
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:56,988
Buy you jjajangmyun?

715
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:02,622
That plaster,

716
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:03,294
Get over here.

717
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:04,368
- No. 
– Get that plaster off.

718
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,859
It feels warm. 
Feels like it’s effective.

719
00:53:07,994 --> 00:53:10,471
Jang Chul Soo, I found money!

720
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:11,919
Really?
