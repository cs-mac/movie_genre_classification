Oh, little Judy.

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,110
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

10
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:35,145
Ahead of... us.

11
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,047
You'll never have her now.

12
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:38,749
Not like I did.

13
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:40,384
And I had her all day,
every day.

14
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:41,685
You son of a bitch!

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,187
Don't crush me,
Allen Gregory!

16
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:45,773
Don't do it, best friend,

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,408
he's not worth it.

18
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:50,527
Hell, I'd love nothing more than
to watch you smoke this clown,

19
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:52,196
but that's not gonna
bring your lady back.

20
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,281
You're right, it's not!

21
00:00:54,349 --> 00:00:57,985
She's dead,
and she was only 86!

22
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,004
Now, get out of here
before he changes

23
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:01,622
his damn mind, old man.
Okay.

24
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,425
Sid's right, you know.

25
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,560
I never made a play,

26
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:09,663
and now...
clock's run out.

27
00:01:17,238 --> 00:01:19,773
I thought I lost you, babe.

28
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:23,210
Julie... if I were your clothes,
what size would I be?

29
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:24,745
Oh, no, not another
fund-raiser.

30
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,179
That's right, it's not
just another fund-raiser.

31
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,715
This one's for Africa,

32
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,267
which is where you're...
not from.

33
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,618
It might be fun, Jules.

34
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,570
Get all dressed up,
eat a fancy dinner.

35
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:34,905
Have Richard nudge
me and whisper,

36
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:37,023
"Be more ethnic" every
time I meet someone.

37
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,575
Well, if you took
the note the first time,

38
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,693
I'd only have
to give it once.

39
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,812
I don't even know what it means.

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,815
I'd explain it to you,
Jules, but guess what?

41
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,417
I don't have the time.

42
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:49,336
Because the clock...
it doesn't stop for any of us.

43
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:51,972
One day you wake up and wonder,
"What's my purpose?

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,424
"To be flaunted around

45
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,192
"like a piece
of Asian street meat

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,794
or some useless boy toy?"

47
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,796
Well, it's too late
for you two, yes,

48
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,364
but it's not for me.

49
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:02,633
It's time, bitch.

50
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:07,287
I wonder which one of you
he was calling "bitch."

51
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,599
I, uh, heard the water
shut off,

52
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,250
so I thought you might
like your coffee

53
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:21,652
while you get yourself
made up.

54
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,388
Although why you bother
with makeup is a mystery to me.

55
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,039
Very sweet, Sidney.

56
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,392
I hope you think
the same about this.

57
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,793
Happy Anniversary.

58
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,261
Oh, Sid.

59
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:33,430
What happened to us
not making a fuss?

60
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,833
I know, I know, I just
couldn't help myself.

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,936
Oh, a new pill case.

62
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:40,370
Nope, your old one.

63
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,923
I was able to repair the plastic
hinge on the Thursday box

64
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,758
with a little help
from Mr. Glue Gun.

65
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,059
Go ahead, test it.

66
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,261
I see.

67
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,030
It's very... nice.

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,002
You know, since it is
our anniversary,

69
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,471
and you're in
that very sexy towel...

70
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:58,906
Gotta get to work.

71
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:00,707
Yeah, me as well,
me as well.

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,778
No, no, no, no, no.

73
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,263
This is all wrong.

74
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,731
Jeremy, why did you
bring me here?

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,433
We should've gone to one
of those secondhand shops.

76
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,468
Don't you want to find something
nice for Julie to wear?

77
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,587
It's a charity benefit,
you bonehead.

78
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,656
You really think Julie should saunter
in wearing Oscar de la Renta

79
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,524
in front of all those
underprivileged people?

80
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,193
- Well, no, but...
- Oh, no.

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,627
Oh, no. Oh, no.

82
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:22,079
Don't look.
Don't look.

83
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,014
Jeremy, what did I say?!
What did I say?!

84
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:26,316
- Who is that?
- It's Perry Van Moon.

85
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,235
The guy from college
who makes you hate yourself?

86
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:31,371
No, the other Perry Van Moon who
makes me hate myself, Jeremy.

87
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,840
Ooh, I despise him.

88
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,658
- De Longpre?
- Oh, Perry!

89
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:37,127
Dickles De Longpre.

90
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,363
Well, I don't actually go
by Dickles anymore.

91
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,647
Never did...

92
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,549
Classic Dickles.

93
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:43,767
Who's your buddy?

94
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,235
Oh, this? This is
my husband, Jeremy.

95
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,621
Ooh, you got a tight grip
there, Jeremy. I like it.

96
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:48,922
Oh, thanks.

97
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,491
So, you still doing nothing

98
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:52,059
with the ol' life there,
or...?

99
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,844
Uh, no, actually, really
into my charity work.

100
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,179
Africa.

101
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:56,730
Don't know if you've
heard, but...

102
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:58,081
lot goin' down
over there.

103
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:59,483
Oh, yes, well aware.

104
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,618
I'm actually on
the board, so, uh...

105
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:03,554
On the board
of Africa?

106
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,939
I don't think there's a board
of Africa, huh, Jeremy?

107
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,208
Well, I actually meant
the board of the charity.

108
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,610
You were with me,
right, man?

109
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,862
I was totally...
on board.

110
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,165
Ah, he was on board.
That was good, Jeremy.

111
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,034
So I guess I'll see
you guys there.

112
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,802
Oh, I know--
we should sit together.

113
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,038
I'll set it up since
I run the whole thing.

114
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,356
Yeah, great.
Great idea.

115
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:24,658
But FYI-- it's gonna
be three of us.

116
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:27,678
We went ahead and adopted
a starving Cambodian child.

117
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,430
Just trying to make a dent,
one life at a time, you know?

118
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,566
Oh, do I ever?

119
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,717
Babatunde.

120
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,886
Hello, Dad.

121
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:37,721
You adopted an
African boy?

122
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,957
Well, I don't think
of it that way.

123
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,292
I mean, he's just
my African son.

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,410
Babatunde.

125
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,878
You ready for
the cages, pal?

126
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,647
Ooh, you keep him
in a cage.

127
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:49,032
No. The batting cages.

128
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,801
Kid loves sports.

129
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,203
- You got it, didn't you, Jeremy?
- Yeah, Per.

130
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,272
It was a meatball
right down the middle.

131
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,657
Meatball right down
the middle.

132
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,058
That was good.
I love this Jeremy.

133
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,643
Who was that, Daddy?

134
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,995
Oh, that's absolutely nobody.

135
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,166
65 years of marriage...

136
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,254
Judy, I need you to listen,
and I need you to listen good.

137
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:11,538
Get the hell out of here.

138
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,173
I won't get the hell
out of here.

139
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:14,758
I'm done getting
the hell out of here.

140
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,193
I mean, what are
we doing, Jude?

141
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,527
What are we waiting for?

142
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,062
Let's pull the trigger
on this thing.

143
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,697
Allen Gregory,
not today.

144
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,933
Well, then when?
Tonight? Tomorrow?

145
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,918
'Cause the following night
is no good for me.

146
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,154
I can maybe squeeze something
in late afternoon-style, but...

147
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:29,356
Okay. I don't have
time for this.

148
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:31,892
I don't either,
and that's the whole point.

149
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,696
You were in my dreams
last night, babe.

150
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,414
Oh, my God.

151
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,249
It's okay,
it wasn't sexual.

152
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,018
I mean, there's always
a sexual undertone, but...

153
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:42,386
I'm gonna count to three,

154
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:44,604
and when I turn around
you better be gone.

155
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:45,839
One...

156
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,641
Wait, so I have till three?
...two...

157
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,376
Well, stop for one second,
'cause I'm just trying

158
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:50,978
to clarify whether...
...three!

159
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,115
I had a new thought...

160
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:06,542
Hey, Allen Gregory.

161
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,793
Just leave it alone, Pat.

162
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,261
It doesn't
concern you, okay?

163
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,296
Hey there, sluts.
What's with the shades?

164
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:12,598
Yeah.
What, do your eyes hurt

165
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:14,049
from looking up Patrick's butt?

166
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,885
I feel weird having
to say this, Ian,

167
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,320
but it's dark inside
people's butts.

168
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:19,822
You wouldn't need
sunglasses.

169
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,324
It's literally called
"Where the sun don't shine."

170
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,210
Yeah, you guys are
right. Stupid Ian.

171
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:25,978
So back to the glasses.

172
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,446
They're lame.
I want 'em.

173
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,848
Wait, just...

174
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,950
It was covering a blemish.

175
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,085
Allen Gregory, what's
that on your face?

176
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,603
It's nothing.
I-I walked into a door...

177
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,772
at the bottom of the stairs
I fell down.

178
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,741
- Oh, gotcha.
- What do you want to hear, Patrick?!

179
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:41,326
You want to hear that the door I
walked into was named Gottlieb?

180
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,162
Or that the stairs I fell down
had the same name as that door?

181
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:45,714
- Gottlieb?
- You weren't there.

182
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,066
She's a good woman, damn it.

183
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,551
She loves me,
but I egged her on.

184
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,835
I practically dared her
to do it.

185
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:51,120
This was all my fault.

186
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,788
Don't take it out on her,
Patrick.

187
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,925
Well, if it's your fault,
maybe you should apologize.

188
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:59,161
You said a mouthful
there, boy-o.

189
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,696
So much wisdom locked up

190
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,932
in that big, red tomato can
you call a head, huh?

191
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,433
Thanks.

192
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,536
Oh, and Patrick--
pop into that middle stall,

193
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,405
give that toilet a big
old flush for me.

194
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,210
Of course Perry Van Moon adopts
a perfectly-themed African boy

195
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:16,412
for the fund-raiser.

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,880
He knew I was
gonna be there,

197
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:19,815
so he ran down to that
adoption agency and he said,

198
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,250
"Give me an African one

199
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,419
that I can pretend to know
in front of Richard."

200
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,287
Or he didn't consider
you at all,

201
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:27,156
and adopted the kid
for the right reasons?

202
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:28,624
Okay, new idea.
We take Julie back,

203
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,426
tell them it's not working,
we can't crack her,

204
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,294
we want to swap her out
for something else.

205
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:33,812
Richard...
Hang with me.

206
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,064
We skip this benefit
because Van Moon's

207
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,231
got us on the ropes,

208
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:37,683
find out the theme
of the next one,

209
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,218
and get a kid that fits that.

210
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,854
- Thoughts.
- Uh, I think maybe there's an easier,

211
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,989
and possibly more sensible
way to go about this.

212
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,190
Oh, really?

213
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,842
Jeremy's got the fix?

214
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,579
Can't wait for Big Bad
Jeremy to storm into town

215
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,631
with his
fancy idea machine.

216
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,966
What is it?

217
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,368
Well, you could
talk to Julie.

218
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,603
Actually get to know
your daughter.

219
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:01,273
Jeremy, you sneaky bitch.

220
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:11,450
Obviously this is awkward.

221
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,619
Things were said,
things went down.

222
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:16,088
Certain people
were struck in the face.

223
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,123
Look, about that...
No, no. Let me finish.

224
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:20,626
What happened
shouldn't have happened,

225
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:23,963
and an apology
is definitely in order.

226
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,248
So, Judith...
I'm sorry!

227
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,549
Don't interrupt me,
this is hard eno...

228
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,351
You're sorry.

229
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,455
Yes. And I'd appreciate it
if you kept this between us.

230
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,891
I'd lose my job
if it got out.

231
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,761
You'd lose your job
because you hit

232
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,963
a defenseless child,

233
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,799
who is in no way responsible
for what happened.

234
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:46,101
What do you want?

235
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:49,271
- Excuse me?
- In exchange for keeping your mouth shut.

236
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,541
Judy, that hurts me.

237
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,177
You think I would use this unfortunate
incident as leverage?

238
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,263
Dinner.

239
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,632
- What?
- Say 7:00?

240
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,701
Say it.
Dinner at 7:00.

241
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,570
Dinner at 7:00.

242
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:06,405
I'll make a rez.

243
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,941
It'll be under,
"Let's do this."

244
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:11,777
Uh!

245
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,014
<i>Okay, give me an easy one.</i>

246
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,682
Okay, here we go.
What is Julie's middle name?

247
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,685
Coming out of the gate
with a stumper.

248
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:22,004
Cory.

249
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:23,321
You think my
middle name is Cory?

250
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,707
Rory?

251
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,809
Oh, give me a hint.
First letter.

252
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,277
"L." And it's not Lori.

253
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:29,561
Well, it's not Lori,
it's not Rory.

254
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:30,813
At this point,
I'm starting to think

255
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,164
it doesn't rhyme
with Cory at all.

256
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,867
Um, okay.

257
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:37,002
Hey, how about a simple
"yes or no," huh?

258
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,072
Does Julie like movies?

259
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,378
Does Julie... like movies?

260
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,547
I feel like I know this one.

261
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:49,815
We've been to the
movies together.

262
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,184
Yeah, that
doesn't help me.

263
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:54,353
Well, it could.
Think back, try to remember.

264
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,555
Okay. I know we went to see
<i>Going the Distance.</i>

265
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:57,923
That's right.

266
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,709
Justin Long starred as
Garrett, a young hipster

267
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,745
who recently got out of
a long-term relationship,

268
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,191
he's still licking his wounds,
doesn't want anything serious.

269
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,065
Okay?

270
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,966
Sure enough, he meets Erin,
a journalism grad

271
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,735
who's only in town
for the summer.

272
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,787
You know more about
<i>Going the Distance</i> than me.

273
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,672
I know more about
it than anybody.

274
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,124
That movie's like
a daughter to me.

275
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,546
Come on, Gottlieb.
He's just a kid.

276
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,481
You fought in Korea
for God's sake.

277
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,049
What?!

278
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:25,451
Delivery for Judith Gottlieb.

279
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:27,086
From Allen Gregory
De Longpre.

280
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,188
Oh, my God. Okay.

281
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,425
"Wear this and nothing else."

282
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:36,512
Oh, for Pete's sake.

283
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:38,931
Poops?

284
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,099
Oh, Sid.

285
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,467
This isn't really
a good time.

286
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,068
Okay, gotcha.

287
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,637
Just wanted to float an idea
by you for tonight--

288
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,973
couple of Hungry-Mans right
into a little <i>Bones-a-thon.</i>

289
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,241
The show, not...

290
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,326
Can't.
I-I'm working late tonight.

291
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,329
All right, not a problem.
That's what a DVR is for.

292
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,465
That's why we pay $4.99
a month to lease it.

293
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,300
Smart, Sidney.

294
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:05,157
Oh.

295
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,491
You guys in
for my BBQ later?

296
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,826
It's gonna be
pretty tight.

297
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,227
I can't.

298
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:14,629
I have to go to a fund-raiser
with my dad.

299
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,164
Sounds more like
a "fun" raiser.

300
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:18,066
See what I did there?
You dropped the "D."

301
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,867
Yeah, dropped the "D."
She's lovin' it, Jules.

302
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,469
What's the cause?
Anything we can get behind?

303
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:23,438
It's for Africa.
Oh, is everything okay?

304
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:25,239
Uh, no, Beth,
it's so not okay.

305
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:26,908
Africa's got problems.

306
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,876
I know it's hard to hear,
but it's the cold, hard truth.

307
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,678
Oh, there you are.
So many kids, it's like

308
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,146
a salmon farm in this place.

309
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,015
Dad, what are you doing here?
We need a last minute

310
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,716
"get to know Julie" cram sesh.

311
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:37,502
Girls?

312
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:38,736
Ew.

313
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:40,421
Okay. Let's get
to the nuts of this.

314
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,757
- For you to memorize.
- What is this?

315
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:45,426
Well, since it's impossible to
remember all the stuff <i>you</i> like,

316
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,961
I figured that you
should just like

317
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,396
all the stuff
that I can remember.

318
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:49,964
Does that make sense?
Yeah, makes sense to me.

319
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:52,183
This is Drew Barrymore's
character description

320
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,451
from <i>Going the Distance.</i>

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,553
Ooh, Erin.
Such a great role.

322
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:57,355
You could really sink your
teeth into that, Jules.

323
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:58,940
But it's not me.

324
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,293
And I'm not gonna memorize
this because I'm not going!

325
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,562
Mmm. You're from Africa,
huh, bud?

326
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,930
Well, no, my family's
from India, but...

327
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:07,448
Ugh, you're the worst.

328
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,602
Wow. Look at you.

329
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,371
I've never seen so much beauty

330
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,339
squeezed into so little
Vera Wang.

331
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:17,742
Let's just eat our food
and get this over with.

332
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,044
Oh, there's three
kinds of bread.

333
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:21,879
Mama loves her carbs.

334
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:24,148
So I was thinking we'd do
a round of hors d'oeuvres,

335
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,900
maybe a cheese plate,
some truffled quail eggs...

336
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,452
I know what you're doing.

337
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,619
Don't drag this out.

338
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,555
I eat it, then I beat it.

339
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:32,690
Sure, as you wish.
Jean-Michel!

340
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,976
Ah, Mr. De Longpre.
Welcome back.

341
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,210
Would you like to hear
the specials?

342
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:37,512
No.

343
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,547
Just bring us our trays
and we'll get our stuff.

344
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:40,965
Oh.

345
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,767
- This is not that kind of place.
- Huh?

346
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:45,670
You see, this is a fine
dining establishment.

347
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,271
Not a-a... a food court.

348
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,123
I'm what you call a waiter...

349
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:51,659
Jean-Michel, you
heard the lady.

350
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,094
But, sir, we don't have...

351
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:54,862
Two... trays.

352
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,998
Very well, sir.

353
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,905
Ugh, I feel so naked
without Julie.

354
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,823
It's like no one even knows
we have her.

355
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,075
But that's not why
we have her. Right?

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,410
Richard?

357
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:10,778
Is this seat taken?

358
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,246
I'm kidding, of
course it's not.

359
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:14,115
I run this whole thing, I could
take your seat if I wanted.

360
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:15,399
Oh, Perry.

361
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,070
Is that an empty spot
there, Dickles?

362
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:20,805
Geez, I put you
down plus two.

363
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,773
I see Jeremy there--
what's up, homes?

364
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,091
Ah, hey, Per.
Hey, Babatunde.

365
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,295
And-and remind me,
the other seat was for...?

366
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:28,880
Julie, my adopted...

367
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:33,217
Julie, right, your
adopted daughter from...

368
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,653
- Cambodia.
- Yeah.

369
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:36,988
And that's not in Africa?

370
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,356
No, they're separate
continents, actually.

371
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:39,941
Okay, Jeremy.

372
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:42,326
Actually, a lot of people would
say it's worse over there.

373
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,128
Well, I guess
the <i>Times</i> wouldn't.

374
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,363
They did a piece ranking

375
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,065
the world's most
impoverished regions...

376
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:49,984
Oh, and you have it...
Let's see here...

377
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:52,086
number one, Africa-- knew that--

378
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:54,188
two, three, four...

379
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:10,438
Beep... beep... beep... beep.

380
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:13,374
Boop! 17, Cambodia.

381
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:14,942
There it is.
So, where is Julie?

382
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,510
Did we get to
the bottom of that?

383
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,512
She's... with her boyfriend.

384
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,182
He's moving away,
which she knew,

385
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,783
but now there are
real feelings involved,

386
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:24,385
so they're trying to figure out

387
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,988
if the relationship
has legs to...

388
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:29,557
Go the distance?

389
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,325
That's our favorite movie, Papa!
We watch it every night!

390
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:32,827
Ah, don't beat
yourself up.

391
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:34,395
No way you could've known.

392
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,330
Does somebody want to help
Dickles find his face?

393
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:38,065
Probably somewhere on the floor.

394
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,134
Oh thanks, Barb. That's where I
was gonna suggest people look.

395
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,458
So tell me about you.

396
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:49,343
I want to hear
about Judy.

397
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:50,761
What do you want to know?

398
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,430
Everything, really.
Were you always this beautiful,

399
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:54,765
or did you go through an
awkward phase at some point?

400
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,267
- Huh?
- I mean, before you were principal,

401
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:57,602
you obviously
started out modeling

402
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,570
and then made the transition.
How did it...?

403
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:02,273
- Modeling?
- I've never done any modeling.

404
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:03,841
Allen Gregory, stop.

405
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,676
Never.

406
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,815
Oh, awkward.
Pill time.

407
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:15,870
<i>"Ah, Sweet Judy Blue Eyes.</i>

408
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:19,607
<i>Take one of these for every day</i>
<i>of the week that I love you."</i>

409
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,942
<i>Always...</i>
<i>Sidney.</i>

410
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,544
Aw, Sid.

411
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:25,296
Anyway, focusing back
up for a second.

412
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:26,781
I... I shouldn't be here.

413
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:27,915
- I have to go.
- What?

414
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,250
Was it-was it
something I said?

415
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,801
Judy?

416
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:32,086
Judy!

417
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,971
Woman, right?

418
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,306
You're telling me.

419
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:38,342
No, I'm asking you--
that was a woman, right?

420
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,481
Dinner over already?

421
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,815
Oh, no, it's still going on.

422
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,317
Richard was really flailing.

423
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:47,618
It was painful to watch.

424
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:49,120
Wish I could've seen that.

425
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:50,755
There's still time.

426
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:51,889
Sorry, I'm busy.

427
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,791
Julie...

428
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,092
Wait, is this
<i>Going the Distance?</i>

429
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,761
Yeah.

430
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,796
I'm trying to figure out why
it's more interesting than me.

431
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:00,581
It's not.

432
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,869
Look... Richard loves you.

433
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,704
I don't have any
actual proof,

434
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:10,174
but I believe in his
own very limited way,

435
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:11,559
he does love you.

436
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:12,760
He loves us.

437
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,045
Does he?
I think he does.

438
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm not sure I do.
Julie, please.

439
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:17,715
Just let me believe this,
it's all I have.

440
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,467
If you pull that thread,
the whole thing unravels.

441
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,951
Okay, okay,
he loves us.

442
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,003
And... we love him.

443
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:25,923
Okay, how about this...

444
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,192
if Perry Van Moon wins tonight,

445
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,529
your dad's not gonna
take that so well.

446
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,130
If he loses...

447
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:34,965
we lose huge.

448
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:37,985
I'm scared, Julie.

449
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,789
We could really use a hero
right now.

450
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,725
But it's up to you.

451
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,032
But, Garrett, it's so far!

452
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,454
Babe... come on,
get in the car.

453
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,256
This is crazy already.

454
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,008
- What are you gonna do, walk home?
- Yes.

455
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:03,144
Can you honestly tell me
you didn't enjoy tonight?

456
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:05,396
It was a nice time, okay?

457
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:07,348
It was a welcome change of pace,

458
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,767
with the big napkin
that covered the whole table,

459
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,252
and the man coming over,

460
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,903
but it's done now.

461
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:15,072
Okay. If that's really
the way you feel about it,

462
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,241
then I guess
Superintendent Rossmyre and I

463
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:18,526
have some catching up to do.

464
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,113
I knew you'd come around.

465
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,314
Now, come on.

466
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,182
Quit being silly,
ya goose.

467
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,285
Do what you have to do.
I'm going home to my husband.

468
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:30,421
Good night, Allen Gregory.

469
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,626
He has just never been
a sleeper.

470
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,161
There was only one way
that I could

471
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:38,963
ever put the little sucker down.

472
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,231
Remember what it was, buddy?

473
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,582
"Breathe."

474
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,783
"Breathe"

475
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:44,335
by Faith Hill.

476
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:46,103
I would sing it to him
every night.

That is so laugh-out-loud
funny, Perry.

Because my Julie
was the same way.

Oh, I didn't put that together.

it, it is the same song.

- Yeah,

504

you'd think you would've noticed
it when he was just singing it.

Seems like you
made up that story

having an adopted child from
a poverty-stricken nation.

Right here.

Sorry I'm late, Dad.

Julie.
How did you...?

515
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,506
I was at the airport
saying good-bye to Garrett.

Right...
your boyfriend.

We're gonna try to make it work,
see if we can go the distance.

518
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,147
And when I say
"go the distance,"

519
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,350
I mean both emotionally
and the physical distance

520
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,751
that will be between us.

521
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,386
Yeah, I guess it has
two meanings.

522
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:44,722
Two.

523
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,724
Well, speaking
of distance,

524
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,475
Babatunde, go long!

525

Damn it, Babatunde!
What's the matter with you?

526
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,298
I'm sorry, Perry.
I don't like football.

527
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,816
I don't like sports at all.

528
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,351
What? You don't mean that.

529
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:58,468
He doesn't mean that.

530
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
He doesn't mean that.

531
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,255
Baba!

532
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,357
Julie, I...

533
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,959
I know, Dad.

534
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:06,360
I love you, too.

535
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,062
Oh, I wasn't gonna...
Oh.

536
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,631
Yeah. I was gonna say...

537
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:12,099
thanks for coming.

538
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,234
You're welcome.

539
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,371
And your middle name,
it's Leslie, isn't it?

540
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:20,674
Sure, Dad. Sure.

541
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:27,563
Uh, Ms. Gottlieb, Superintendent
Rossmyre is in your office.

542
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:34,087
Judith, you out there?

543
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:36,155
- Yeah...
- Well, get your ass out of park

544
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,624
and back that camper on
in here. We got business.

545
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:42,628
You and I need to have
a very serious conversation

546
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,464
and I'm gonna need you
to come back around

547
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:46,716
and sit in one of these chairs
in front of me.

548
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,301
Oh, okay.
Judith,

549
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:51,921
a faculty member hitting
a student is a major offense.

550
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,257
I know.
Not only is it a career-killer,

551
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,025
but it's a freedom-killer.

552
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:57,543
As in... jail time.

553
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,946
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God, is right.

554
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:04,033
We need to do something
about the fact that <i>you...</i>

555
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:06,035
let his teacher
do such a thing.

556
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:08,771
Wait, he said Gina hit him?

557
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:09,452
Of course.

558
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,577
Seems kinda weird
the way you told me.

559
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,609
I know. Allen Gregory
was very specific

560
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:15,194
about how he wanted me
to break it to you.

561
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:17,563
I didn't quite
understand it myself,

562
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,132
but he's the boss.

563
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,283
You wanted to see me?

564
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,951
Gina! You look good.

565
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:23,503
And you hit a student.

566
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,271
Jude, you taking off?
I thought you wanted my help.

567
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:26,472
Oh, I got it from here.

568
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,174
And I'm gonna need
the office for a few.

569
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,375
No, don't leave me alone...

570
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:33,045
Oh... what to do
about this pickle?

571
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:34,564
Oh, please don't
use "pickle" again

572
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:36,516
as a way to show me your...
