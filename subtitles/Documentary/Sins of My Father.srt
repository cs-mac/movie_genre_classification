1
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,424
And last but not least, to Susan
"The Steamroller" Purtree

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,304
for putting this all together.

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,225
And now, finally, at long last,
as some of you may be saying,

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,470
it is my honor, my privilege,
my personal pleasure

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,907
to present to you the
man of every hour,

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,031
University of Perth's own
Professor Edgar Solomon.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,144
Hear, hear!

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,907
Thank you. Sincerely.

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,748
A bear taking a dump
asked a rabbit,

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,949
"Does shit stick to
your fur as a habit?"

11
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,188
"Of course not," said the hare,

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,305
"it's really quite rare,"

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,828
so the bear wiped his
ass with the rabbit.

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,747
There once was a lady named Dot..

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,303
who lived off of pig shit and snot.

16
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,944
When she ran out of these,
she ate the green cheese..

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,784
that she grew on the sides..

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,027
of her twat.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,227
Oh, my God.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,470
Are you all right? You OK?

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,783
- I'm so sorry.
- OK.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,943
Edgar? What are
you doing? Oh, my..!

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,467
Stop!

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,106
- Hands over your head, sir!
- Just one moment.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,821
Please, sir, don't
reach in your jacket!

26
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,023
I'm calling on behalf of
AAMQ debt acquisitions,

27
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,791
regarding the balance on
your LBF Platinum card..

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,427
This is an attempt
to collect a debt.

29
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,344
If you do not pay your
outstanding bill..

30
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,071
your power will be cut off
by noon Friday, July..

31
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,588
Hello? Hi, I'm here. And I might
be able to pay you today.

32
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,465
I think I'm about to
get some good news.

33
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,624
- I think you're gonna get it.
- Oh, stop jinxing it.

34
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,067
- It's unjinxable. You got it.
- Stop saying that.

35
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,190
- Too bad.
- Just tie my lucky tie.

36
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,463
Senior sales representative.

37
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,863
Honey, when's the last time Kopeckny
asked you in for a meeting one on one?

38
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,546
- Never.
- So there.

39
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,830
If I get this promotion, we
are so going on a honeymoon.

40
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,223
Who needs a honeymoon?
After this weekend we'll be married.

41
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,189
You'll ask, "Where's the remote?"

42
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,981
But I mean like a husband asking
his wife where is the remote.

43
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,465
- Thank you.
- Hey.

44
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,860
- Yes?
- What about the kid?

45
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,864
The kid.

46
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,385
Geez.

47
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,943
All right. Senior sales
representative, here I come!

48
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,828
Sir, I'm just trying to understand.

49
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,427
You're firing me?

50
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,829
I made more sales
than ever last month.

51
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,551
And you're still not producing.
What does that tell you?

52
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,021
Explain to me what
happened yesterday.

53
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,181
I made the sale.

54
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,581
The woman was interested
in the gold plan.

55
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,629
- You talked her out of it.
- Wh..

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,471
You talked her out
of the gold plan.

57
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,909
I sold Ms. Palmer a policy that was
appropriate to her age and income.

58
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,145
I didn't feel like I should
take advantage.. of her.

59
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,860
That's what we do here?

60
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,184
- We take advantage of people?
- No. No, not at all.

61
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,781
- That's not what I meant.
- I got it.

62
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,103
- Sir..
- No, I got it. I do, really.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,780
We shame you. You're
too pure for this job.

64
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,262
Please, I cannot lose this
job right now. Sir..

65
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,223
My brother is mentally disabled,
and if I lose this job,

66
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,679
I'm going to lose my insurance.
And if I lose my insurance,

67
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,225
I'm not gonna be able to
afford his outpatient care

68
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,463
and they're gonna
re-institutionalize him.

69
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,667
Sounds like you have a lot
of people depending on you.

70
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,660
You got this brother.

71
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,184
You're getting married,
having a baby.

72
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,510
Yeah.

73
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,063
You realize the same things
that make you a lousy salesman

74
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,911
are going to fuck
you up as a father?

75
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,267
Or a husband, for that matter.

76
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,785
I mean, you're marrying this girl.

77
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,387
She's marrying someone who
refuses to get his hands dirty,

78
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,508
who lacks the balls

79
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,984
to ever really lay it on the
line for her or her child.

80
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,349
If you think I'm being unfair,
tell me to go to hell.

81
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,265
Like a man. Huh?

82
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,465
Mm..mm..mm..

83
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,829
Vince.. get him out of here.

84
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,382
No, no, no. OK, 'cause..

85
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,591
they'll send me back to Bayview.

86
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,507
And I can't go back to Bayview. They
lock the doors on you at Bayview.

87
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,665
- I know.
- Then you have to say a promise to me,

88
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,181
that you promise me I don't
have to go back there.

89
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,787
Like, "I promise," well,
"I promise you, Michael,

90
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,227
you don't have to go
back there to Bayview."

91
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,271
You have to say that to me.
You have to promise me.

92
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,022
OK.

93
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,071
OK. You take the elevator
and I'll take the stairs

94
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,183
and I'll meet you
like in five seconds!

95
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,264
I know it's only a day
away, but is there any way

96
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,344
to move the rehearsal dinner
into maybe a smaller room?

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,106
The Cypress Room's already
our most economical.

98
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,264
There's a number of affordable
motor inns all along the highway.

99
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,424
No! It's just, things have come up.

100
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,742
- I have to take this.
- Hello?

101
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,504
Dad, why didn't you show me this?

102
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,106
I could've at least been
looking for a place for you!

103
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,187
What kind of nigger paradise do you
think you're going to move me into?

104
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,782
I'm not gonna live among Bantus.

105
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,951
I'm gonna have to move in
with you. We both know it.

106
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,461
- Dad.
- Oh, I know. I'm a blight.

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,271
This is why you should
have made more money.

108
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,586
You sealed all our fates when you
settled on a liberal arts major.

109
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,109
Mythology and Folklore. What
the fuck were you thinking?

110
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,265
- If I just had more time.
- You had 15 years by my count.

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,900
Fifteen years to find
something you were good at.

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,906
By the time I was your age,
I'd amassed a fortune so huge,

113
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,226
it took decades of dedicated
self-destruction to wind up like this.

114
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,469
Dad, you know we already have
Michael living with us..

115
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,861
- Leave me alone.
- And the baby on the way.

116
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,948
My bowels are finally moving. Let me
savor these last little victories.

117
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,187
Your father despises me, Elliot.

118
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,901
Shelby, I know how hard this is
gonna be on everybody. I know that.

119
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,631
Then why did you tell him yes?

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,386
Hey, Ellie, do you remember
when Dad would always..

121
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,060
was always saying he was
going to have a man

122
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,188
from the orphanage
to come and get us?

123
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,866
And we never knew why that
was going to be a punishment

124
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,342
to get to live away from him.
Do you remember that?

125
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,104
Yeah, I remember.

126
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,031
Well, that's not even
an option anymore.

127
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,621
Do you remember Deborah, who
lived across the street, Ellie?

128
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,990
Well, I wonder if she's still alive.
She's probably still alive, Ellie.

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,067
She wouldn't be that old. She'd be
maybe 57 now. That's not that old.

130
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,110
Ellie, can you give me a ride
to Joe Burger? I took my pill.

131
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,548
OK? I just.. I took
my pill already.

132
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,988
Well, I can't go back to
Hot Dog Castle right now

133
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,461
'cause things just got
very unpleasant there.

134
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,783
OK? Well..

135
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,864
- Don't go faster, Ellie.
- I won't.

136
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,631
- Just don't do that.
- I won't. I'm not.

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,465
Just stay there.

138
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,864
Well, yeah, because he knows
that Marisol likes me

139
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,342
and there's sometimes when
she is at the counter,

140
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,949
we'll make.. we'll make eyes
at each other sometimes.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,421
Is that what people say, to
"make eyes at each other"?

142
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,227
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, to make eyes. Well..

143
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,109
I think that Shelby is like Mom.

144
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,423
When she was alive, she was poor.

145
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,787
You don't think about
that, but they were.

146
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,942
Dad didn't make his
money until later

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,106
and he didn't start to be
mean until later. So, yeah.

148
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,866
Bye.

149
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,266
What the fuck?

150
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,831
- Hello?
- Mr. Elliot Brindle?

151
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,187
- Yes?
- Congratulations.

152
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,104
You have been selected
for the opportunity

153
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,662
to take part in a
one-of-a-kind game show!

154
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,026
- Uh, look..
- Of a long list of candidates

155
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,822
in financial need, you have been chosen
to compete for a fantastic cash prize.

156
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,719
I think you may have
dialed the wrong number.

157
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,629
Elliot Brindle, age 32.

158
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,148
Your mother was killed in a car
accident when you were nine.

159
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,507
Ever since, you've felt
responsible for your brother,

160
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,470
whose outpatient care
cost you $1,200 a month.

161
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,545
Add that to $90,000 in student
loans and credit card debt,

162
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,510
- no wonder you have trouble sleeping.
- Who is this?

163
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,221
You always mean well, but follow-through
has often been a problem.

164
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,987
Like today, you somehow were
unable to protect your fiancee

165
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,189
from having a vindictive old
racist move in with her.

166
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,503
- What do you want?
- You can't honestly even say

167
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,664
you put up much of a fight on
that one, can you, Mr. Brindle?

168
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,185
OK, I'm gonna hang up now.

169
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,907
And at this moment, you are
being defeated by a fly.

170
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,704
Don't be alarmed, Mr. Brindle.

171
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,387
All that matters is the
challenge I put before you now.

172
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,827
Swat the fly.

173
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,541
If you kill the fly,
$1000 will be instantly

174
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,342
credited to your Nola Bank
account number 5366286.

175
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,985
Shit.

176
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,107
If you wish to proceed, we have
another challenge for you,

177
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,549
no more complicated than
the first. Are you ready?

178
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,463
- Swallow the fly you just killed.
- What?

179
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,387
If you eat the fly,
$3,622 will be credited

180
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,261
to your account, exactly what
Shelby owes on her MasterCard.

181
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,629
That would be a nice wedding
gift for her, wouldn't it?

182
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,111
Well done. You have
completed challenge two.

183
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,869
$3,622 has been credited
to your Nola bank account.

184
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,581
Jesus. You're watching me now?

185
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,586
You can have your privacy
back right now, if you like.

186
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,541
But I must tell you, great
wealth is within your grasp.

187
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,022
Thirty-six hours from now,
you can be a very rich man.

188
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,310
All you have to do is
complete 13 challenges.

189
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,351
You've already completed
two, so only 11 more to go.

190
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,982
Please make sure you are
alone, entirely alone,

191
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,347
as I relate to you the rules.

192
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,628
There are 11 more challenges.

193
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,183
For each one you complete, the
cash prizes will grow in value.

194
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,904
If you complete challenge 13, you
will claim a life-changing fortune.

195
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,064
Our last winner took
home 6.2 million.

196
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,143
Six point two million dollars?

197
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,865
If you fail to
complete a challenge,

198
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,229
the game will end and you
will lose everything,

199
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,145
including any money you
have won to that point.

200
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,622
There are two other
ways the game can end.

201
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,465
One, tell anyone you
are playing the game.

202
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,467
Two, attempt to contact or in any
way interfere with the game.

203
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,066
- Why me?
- Everything will be revealed to you

204
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,029
at the appropriate time.

205
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,706
If you understand the rules
and wish to continue,

206
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,670
please press one to
register your entry.

207
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,825
- Otherwise, press two, end the game.
- El?

208
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,988
Mr. Brindle?

209
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,630
Did you just slam the
door in my face?

210
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,066
No.

211
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,144
- Congratulations, Elliot Brindle.
- Elliot..

212
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,509
You are now a
registered contestant.

213
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,301
Now, please, face forward and say,

214
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,306
"I will dance with a golden toad."

215
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,350
- I will dance with a golden toad.
- Excellent!

216
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,582
Get a good night's sleep,
and in the morning,

217
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,950
be sure to wear a comfortable
pair of walking shoes.

218
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,061
Who was that?

219
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,870
- It's a surprise.
- Hm.

220
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,506
Everything will be revealed to
you at the appropriate time.

221
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,106
OK. Mm..hm.

222
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,069
Now, back to bed.

223
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,107
You know, when Shelby was little..

224
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,301
Mom!

225
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,704
..she used to always go on about
the wedding she was gonna have,

226
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,943
and it always got bigger.

227
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,983
By the time she was 12,

228
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,509
she was riding in at the head
of a parade of elephants..

229
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,826
- attended by six eunuchs!
- I've since amended that.

230
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,745
Give me one second.

231
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,507
- Hello?
- Good morning, Mr. Brindle.

232
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,668
This is challenge three of 13.

233
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,302
For $5,000, make a child cry.

234
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,468
- What?
- You have five minutes.

235
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,827
- What?
- We wish you luck.

236
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,187
Elliot?

237
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,782
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

238
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,509
- And now I gotta urinate.
- Right.

239
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,946
I'll just post it on Facebook.

240
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,383
We can put out a proper
press release later.

241
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,502
Hey..

242
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,301
- Your mommy doesn't love you.
- Yes, she does.

243
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,189
They don't want to let you know,
but the man from the orphanage

244
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,466
is coming to take you away.

245
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,670
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

246
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,670
That's what they're
talking about right now.

247
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,583
It's because of what you did.

248
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,260
Mommy! Mommy!

249
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,982
I'm so sorry!

250
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,585
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong, sweetie?

251
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,711
OK, so we're off? Let me get that.

252
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,147
- OK.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,261
- I got it.
- Bye, Dad!

254
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,586
If you want, I can just go pick my dad
up myself and drop you off at home.

255
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,823
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No.

256
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,187
We're not even married yet,
and it's already started?

257
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,705
- Women, right?
- Hey!

258
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,109
What the..?

259
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,660
How fucking dare you!
What kind of a pervert are you?

260
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,380
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Sick, twisted..!

261
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,225
- Whoa! Baby, stop, stop!
- The fuck is wrong with you?!

262
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,104
Fuck you!

263
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,580
He's right there.

264
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,740
- I'm not loving this new ringtone.
- I'm sorry.

265
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,949
This next one is worth $10,000!

266
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,023
Challenge four of 13.

267
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,946
We'd like to draw your
attention to a nativity scene.

268
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,344
Handcrafted in darkness by the children
of the Chabert Home for the Blind.

269
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,989
- Hey, Bill, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm fuckin' ready.

270
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,428
What do you think? I gotta
piss like a racehorse.

271
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,424
- OK.
- We wish you luck.

272
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,947
You can't be serious.

273
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,989
The baby was a miscalculation.

274
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,861
Elliot's already collapsing
under the weight of it.

275
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,307
You'll get tired of
propping him up.

276
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,349
Years go by,

277
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,903
and your bitterness will grow
in proportion to your ass.

278
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,424
Come here and give me a hand.

279
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,901
With my zipper, please.

280
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,791
My arthritis.

281
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,066
Fuck.

282
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,024
I'm wondering what Elliot's
told you about his mother.

283
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,150
He told you I was driving?

284
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,065
- He told you that, at least.
- Uh..huh.

285
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,269
- I know he thinks I was drinking.
- Were you?

286
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,027
I was in a hurry. I was a
busy man in those days.

287
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,706
Things to do, an empire to build.

288
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,511
I couldn't slow down for anything.

289
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,583
Least of all a telephone pole.

290
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,501
Fuck!

291
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,786
- Do you hear that? The fire alarm?
- Hm?

292
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,744
No, I didn't. Sorry.

293
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,863
- Hello?
- Mr. Brindle!

294
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,944
I'm sorry, that was a
total accident. I didn't..

295
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,469
Take a breath, and when you're ready
to begin challenge five of 13,

296
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,547
follow the unseasonably dressed
homeless person across the street.

297
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,787
What's going on?

298
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,704
I'm still working on the surprise.

299
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,191
I'm gonna be gone for
a couple of hours.

300
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,388
- Fuck you!
- I'm not joking, I gotta go.

301
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,301
If I were a paranoid bridezilla, I'd
think you were getting cold feet.

302
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,706
My feet are very warm.

303
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,101
What if, just say, your
extremely strange behavior..

304
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,719
you do agree, it's
extremely strange..

305
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,901
Yes, definitely.

306
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,631
Well, what if, hypothetically,
I decided I didn't find it

307
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,221
as delightful as all that and
I seriously wanted to know

308
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,030
- where you're running off to!
- I'd just have to hope

309
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,467
it blew over by tonight.
I love you!

310
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,822
You're doing great. I know
this is taking a little while,

311
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,427
but we're almost done.
That should do the beard.

312
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,504
Um, let's move on to the eyes.

313
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,382
Do you think the eyes were
bigger or smaller than these?

314
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,908
- What do you think?
- Katie? Katie?

315
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,821
- Honey, the guy's eyes?
- That's him! That's the man!

316
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,467
- Who?
- That's the man who said

317
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,907
that I was gonna go
to the orphanage.

318
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,791
It says "wanted."

319
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,705
- What's this?
- This is just weird is what this is.

320
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,945
Beautiful back there, claims that this
guy came up to him on the street

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,900
and offered to trade him an ostrich
for his clothes and shopping cart.

322
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,188
- Did he have an ostrich?
- He did.

323
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,547
What would a homeless guy
want with an ostrich?

324
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,182
He didn't want an ostrich, so the guy
sweetened the deal by a thousand bucks.

325
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,463
- And he believed him.
- The guy's got an ostrich.

326
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,782
He might have a thousand bucks.

327
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,030
- What do you got?
- Ostrich Boy again.

328
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,105
This is from the identikit of the church
arson that happened earlier today.

329
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,991
There's security footage, too.
I just put Richardson and Dobbs on it.

330
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,585
- I'll go myself.
- They just left.

331
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,705
- Call them back. I'll go myself.
- OK.

332
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,261
Challenge six for $50,000 is
a good deed, for a change.

333
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,584
Upstairs in 6-B lives
Mr. Shaw, a lonely man.

334
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,346
- Take him for a cup of coffee.
- And?

335
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,824
And there's a diner called Taylor's
two blocks from where you are.

336
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,588
Have him there with a cup of
coffee in front of him by 4:00.

337
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,304
Mr. Shaw?

338
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,863
Mr. Shaw?

339
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,828
Mr. Shaw?

340
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,151
Oh, my god.

341
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,506
Oh, my God.

342
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,871
Oh!

343
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,068
That man is dead.

344
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,350
That man is really dead.
You kill him?

345
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,107
Mr. Brindle, this man
took his own life.

346
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,901
You see there in that tub what
the meek actually inherit.

347
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,269
No. No, I can't.
I'm not doing that.

348
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,307
This is not swatting flies anymore.
It's a crime. It's desecration.

349
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,103
Dragging a corpse through the streets.
Are you insane? Who are you?

350
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,026
Two paths lie before you.
One requires a bit of courage

351
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,501
and leads to enough money
to settle your debts,

352
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,947
keep Michael safe, and
provide your child

353
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,547
everything from a pony
to a college education.

354
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,748
The other leads to
loveless poverty.

355
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,302
All that requires is you
just continue being you.

356
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,462
- You don't know me.
- Well..

357
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,391
No, you don't know me. You
don't know anything about me!

358
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,823
Maybe you've done research, maybe you
know facts, but you do not know me!

359
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,384
You have until 4:00. Mr. Shaw
takes his coffee black.

360
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,863
- Hi there. How we all doing today?
- Great.

361
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,546
- My name is Jeanette..
- He's just gonna have a cup of coffee.

362
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,664
- Black, please.
- OK.

363
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,186
- And for you?
- Nothing for me.

364
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,679
If you're sitting at the booth,
you have to order something.

365
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,111
Well, I'm gonna be going, so..

366
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,981
- I'll have a cheeseburger.
- The Bernars burger?

367
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,670
Yeah, that sounds great.

368
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,911
OK. And you get sides with that.

369
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,348
Your choices are baked
potato, baked beans..

370
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,821
- Baked beans. The baked beans.
- OK.

371
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,631
My name is Jeanette, and I
will be taking care of you.

372
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,942
Great. Can you just take care of me?
You don't have to explain

373
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,900
any of the procedure or anything.
He just really needs a cup of coffee.

374
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,863
Thank you.

375
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,143
She puts in for a transfer,
he takes early retirement.

376
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,462
Scoot.

377
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,749
- We ain't gonna fit in this booth..
- That's true.

378
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,908
I think so. There you go.
Come on, get it..

379
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,983
Wide load.

380
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,824
- I remember.
- Right.

381
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,030
- OK. Three regular and one decaf.
- Yeah.

382
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,831
Good and hot, fresh pot.

383
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,784
- Sugar.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

384
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,820
The hair of the dog.

385
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,661
- Hey, hey!
- You got a problem here, sir?

386
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,744
No. Not at all. I, uh..

387
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,586
- I was waiting before you. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

388
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,111
I, uh..

389
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,944
Why don't we step outside real
quick and have a word about this?

390
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,421
- Is that a flask?
- What?

391
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,824
- Is that a flask on the table?
- I'm gonna need you to step outside.

392
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,105
You know that's not
just a code infraction.

393
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,230
In uniform, it's a 306.

394
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,702
My guess is you've never been
to a diversion program before.

395
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,660
Make you open up to a shrink like three
days a week, and there's group sessions.

396
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,188
They show films about empowerment.
There's reading materials, too.

397
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,144
You want your coffee? Please.

398
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,666
No? OK.

399
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,742
Drink your coffee, buddy.

400
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,102
Did you see how it
went down back there?

401
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,662
Kudos! We were so impressed
by the way you avoided arrest

402
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,108
during challenge six, we've
decided, what the hell,

403
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,945
to count that as challenge
seven completed as well.

404
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,944
- Thank you so much!
- You'll be less pleased to hear

405
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,547
your brother's doctor's office just
received an anonymous phone call

406
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,388
alerting them to the fact that Michael
would soon no longer be insured.

407
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,908
- What?
- His file's already marked for review.

408
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,826
But none of this matters,
of course, if you win.

409
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,943
- Who was that?
- He said he was a reporter.

410
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,024
What was he asking you?

411
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,901
If you guys had said anything about
other things the guy might have done,

412
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,143
the destruction of a sacred place.

413
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,666
He gave you something?

414
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,587
- Yes.
- Before the next challenge,

415
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,381
please take out your New
Orleans Parish Library card.

416
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,941
My library card?

417
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,828
- I don't have it.
- No, you don't.

418
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,870
You dropped it back at Taylor's
Diner, where it's been found.

419
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,070
It won't be long till they trace the
number to you, if they haven't already.

420
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,587
You're facing at least
ten years in prison

421
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,506
for arson, assault, and
desecration of a corpse.

422
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,901
But here's the good news.

423
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,950
If you successfully
complete all 13 challenges,

424
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,671
we will make all these
charges go away.

425
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,822
It's what we do for winners.

426
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,870
Losers, however, are on their own.

427
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,621
Try to think of this in the
most positive, empowering way

428
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,067
as a gun pointed to your head.

429
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,270
Mr. Vogler?

430
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,667
Mr. Vogler!

431
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,503
Mr. Vogler!

432
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,949
I'm with the police.

433
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,784
I'm not here to arrest you.

434
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,461
You were at the diner today.

435
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,942
You seem to know something
about a man I'm looking for.

436
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,627
- I can't trust you.
- You saw my badge.

437
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,263
That doesn't mean anything! They got
cops working for them, I'm sure!

438
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,468
They?

439
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,705
All right. I'll tell you this, in
case you are who you say you are.

440
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,104
If you get this guy in your
sights, do not hesitate,

441
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,661
blow his brains out.

442
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,545
Hello.

443
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,510
Hi.

444
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,790
Um..

445
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,231
I'm sitting here counting to ten
over and over again on my fingers.

446
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,065
You get used to things, you know?

447
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,869
OK.

448
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,580
- Gum?
- No, thanks.

449
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,466
You know, um..

450
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,341
you kinda had this thing
in your head and..

451
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,470
but then it actually gets to you.

452
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,985
You know?

453
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,268
Is this your fantasy?

454
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,585
Have you ever done
one of these before?

455
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,942
Done what?

456
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,425
You didn't go to Holmes, did you?

457
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,942
Holmes Middle School? Yeah, I did.

458
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,023
Did you have Metal
Shop with Fishman?

459
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,466
Uh..huh.

460
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,704
- I'm Elliot Brindle.
- That's right.

461
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,386
I'm John Witter.

462
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,108
I was in real estate
for a long time.

463
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,422
Made good money.

464
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,104
But I had some reversals.

465
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,591
What's going on here?

466
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,710
We've gone to a great deal of
effort to arrange this reunion.

467
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,626
You don't remember Johnny Witter
from Mr. Fishman's class?

468
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,262
How he and his brother
Tom tormented you daily?

469
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,141
How they held you by the ankles
out the computer lab window?

470
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,747
Challenge eight is worth $100,000.

471
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,141
Amputate his right arm
just below the elbow.

472
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,348
- No. No way.
- It's your right to decline, of course.

473
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,743
But if you don't complete
all 13 challenges,

474
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,986
you will forfeit the grand prize,
as well as everything you've won.

475
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,551
You should know that Mr. Witter

476
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,147
has quite gladly consented
to this procedure.

477
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,665
Ask him.

478
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,830
You want your arm cut off?

479
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,506
Yes.

480
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,271
- Yes?
- Just get on with it.

481
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,310
They're paying you.

482
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,624
- He's still awake.
- I've given him a local anesthetic.

483
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,668
You have no right to
back out of this.

484
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,150
I knew you were gonna
pussy out! I knew it!

485
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,707
- Look, I know you are trying to..
- You're gonna give me fucking sympathy?

486
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,070
Are you for real?
You're fucking sickening.

487
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,470
You know why we always picked on you?
'Cause you fucking asked for it!

488
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,466
You walked around with that stupid
look on your fucking face saying,

489
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,100
"Please punch me in
my fucking throat."

490
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,228
The day after we threw
you in the dumpster,

491
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,826
you passed me in the quad
and you smiled at me.

492
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,308
You fucking smiled at me!

493
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,510
My brother pissed on
your brother's face.

494
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,307
You remember that? You can't
tell me you don't remember that.

495
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,751
I do. I bust a gut every
time I think about it.

496
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,748
Now do it! Go on, do it!

497
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,821
Come on.

498
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,144
Come on, come on, come on!

499
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,225
Where's your car?

500
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,509
Did you call my brother?

501
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,865
Did you tell him who you were?

502
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,991
This doesn't change anything.
You're still a loser.

503
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,346
You'll always be a loser.

504
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,822
Yeah, well, you've obviously
done very well for yourselves.

505
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,150
Got yourselves a nice
leather jacket, fancy car.

506
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,867
It's going to be a little difficult
for you to put it in gear, though.

507
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,790
Guess you didn't really
think that one through.

508
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,949
Thank you.

509
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,871
- We're going to need a report.
- Of course.

510
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,347
Sir. Sir?

511
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,788
Dr. Anderson to Maternity,
please. Dr. Anderson..

512
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,631
I don't care about
your goddamn system!

513
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,951
It's Witter. W-I-T-T-E-R.

514
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,989
I know you have my brother
back there somewhere.

515
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,519
- Just a moment.
- Get off your fat fucking ass,

516
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,799
- and go find out where he is!
- Hey. I'll tell you what

517
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,028
happened to your brother.
Just grab a chair.

518
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,310
- What the fuck!
- Security!

519
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,227
Oh, oh!

520
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,709
Security!

521
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,431
Elliot Brindle.

522
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,269
You were a challenge.

523
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,109
You were a challenge.

524
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,747
I can't believe Sergio gave us the grand
ballroom. He says we get it all night!

525
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,222
- Elliot's a miracle worker.
- Uh..oh! Speak of the devil!

526
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,748
Oh! Well, well, well.

527
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,950
- My man of mystery.
- Mmm..

528
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,661
- Hm.. You look rather snazzy.
- Mmm. So do you.

529
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,901
Where did you get this?

530
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,988
- Aunt Jessica. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

531
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,790
Have you told her the story
of your Alaskan cruise?

532
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,704
- You gotta hear it, it's amazing.
- What?

533
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,344
Have a good night.

534
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,744
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah.

535
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,823
- Looking good.
- You don't have to do that.

536
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,749
I can do that myself. OK?

537
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,904
- Well, you look good.
- Thank you.

538
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,024
That one's clean.

539
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,705
What about this dresser?

540
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,624
Check underneath.

541
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,623
Could be a false bottom there.

542
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,861
Got something, boss.

543
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,751
Looks like they're attending
their wedding rehearsal dinner

544
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,709
at the country club.

545
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,702
- Boss?
- Let's go.

546
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,020
Congratulations.

547
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,266
Challenge ten of 13 is a worth
a half million dollars.

548
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,425
All you have to do is wait until
you're called upon to give a toast

549
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,501
and then destroy the wedding hall,
while singing "The Internationale."

550
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,822
- What?
- We're quantifying destruction

551
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,905
in the following manner: At
least 75 percent of all ceramic

552
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,382
or crystal objects in the
hall must be shattered.

553
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,907
- Bastard!
- At least one of the wonderful

554
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,070
floral centerpieces
must be urinated upon.

555
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,224
If you're not familiar with the
Internationale Communist Anthem,

556
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,589
you will find the lyrics in
your left jacket pocket.

557
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,105
You know I was doing this for her.

558
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,831
And it is for her you
must soldier on!

559
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,348
You've committed six felonies.
Any future with Shelby,

560
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,141
indeed, any future not organized
around routine sodomy,

561
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,430
now depends on you completing
all 13 challenges.

562
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,789
I first met Elliot two years ago

563
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,069
and I knew right away all I
needed to know about him..

564
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,666
that he made my daughter happy.

565
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,551
I already feel you're like a son.

566
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,747
- Son?
- Baby.

567
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,866
Speech! Speech! Speech!

568
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,030
Come on!

569
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,989
Shelby, there's a life
that you deserve,

570
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,304
and I swear to you I'll do
anything to make that real.

571
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,150
Sir?

572
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,943
That gentleman over there, we're
gonna need to speak with him.

573
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,183
Got a few questions we need
to ask him. I'm sorry..

574
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,624
- All right. Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,544
We'll be waiting.

576
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,342
Son?

577
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,580
Park security, they want Michael.

578
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,182
They say he exposed himself
to a girl at the tennis court.

579
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,705
I told them you'll talk to them.

580
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,941
- Um, everyone..
- Michael?

581
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,671
Let's have our drinks outside
while we wait for our food.

582
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,666
Shall we? Thank you.

583
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,584
Let's just get the
folks outta here.

584
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,788
- What happened?
- I didn't touch her or anything.

585
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,102
I just wanted to show her it.

586
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,871
- OK? I just wanted to show it to her.
- It's OK.

587
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,624
They'll make me pee in a cup.

588
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,624
I haven't had my pill in
three days. In three days.

589
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,989
- It'll be OK.
- No. Horowitz will institutionalize him

590
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,346
if he can't trust him
to take his meds.

591
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,427
They'll make me go back to Bayview.
I don't want to go back to Bayview, OK?

592
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,628
They make me pee in a cup.

593
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,463
Michael, get ready to run.
I have an idea.

594
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,109
- Ready to run..
- Arise, ye workers, from your slumbers!

595
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,265
- Go home and take your pill.
- Sir, that's enough. Sir?

596
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,986
- Elliot!
- I'm buying him time.

597
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,461
What are you doing?!

598
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,626
Stay back! We don't want
anyone getting hurt!

599
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,941
- Put it down. Let's talk about it.
- Stay right there.

600
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,790
Look away.

601
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,750
I said look away..
look away right now!

602
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,224
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

603
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,424
- Easy.
- This one's goin' nowhere.

604
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,826
- Easy.
- This boy is mine.

605
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,266
Easy!

606
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,071
- Stop right there!
- Stop, you son of a bitch!

607
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,783
What the hell are you doing?
Open the door.

608
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,269
Mr. Brindle, you did complete
this last challenge,

609
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,311
but we've observed you're still far too
concerned with what people think of you.

610
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,704
You're still holding back, still
clinging to an old image of yourself.

611
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,823
- But I did it.
- So you did.

612
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,347
And now challenge 11 of 13

613
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,391
is to open that door and surrender
to the security guards.

614
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,430
- What?
- So says the golden toad.

615
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,942
A brave arm makes a
short sword long.

616
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,547
What am I supposed to do?

617
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,510
Is this a punishment or are
we still playing the game?

618
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,780
Guys, hold up. He's comin' around.

619
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,063
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

620
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,710
Cocksucker!

621
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,869
So.. things just got to you?

622
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,547
Oh, I understand how it is.

623
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,547
Things build up, all the shit a
person goes through during the day.

624
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,590
All the petty little humiliations.

625
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,868
I have no complaints.

626
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,742
Is it political? Do you have
feelings about the government?

627
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,870
Did someone order you
to do these things?

628
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,909
I didn't say that.

629
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,861
Tell me about the voice.

630
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,064
What?

631
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,544
I didn't say anything
about the voice.

632
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,704
Did it just start telling
you to do things today?

633
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,821
How did you know about the voice?

634
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,701
I want it on record I didn't
say anything about the voice.

635
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,511
It's probably been there for years.

636
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,188
A little whisper, and then
today it became a roar.

637
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,101
- You think I'm crazy.
- Is it a pure coincidence

638
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,501
that the voices directing
you told you to do

639
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,541
all the dark, secret little
things you wanted to do anyway?

640
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,708
What satisfaction did you get

641
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,021
from pushing that old woman
down that flight of stairs?

642
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,141
- I didn't do that.
- No?

643
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,587
And I guess you didn't burn
down the Hindu shrine, either!

644
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,789
No, I didn't do this.
I didn't do any of these.

645
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,989
So somebody else was having a bad
day, too? There's two of you out there?

646
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,827
I.. I..

647
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,427
I need to get out of here.
I want a lawyer.

648
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,548
Good answer.

649
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,863
Hm..

650
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,342
- I was just there.
- Yeah?

651
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,468
Captain, I'd love it if I could
have a moment with him alone.

652
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,022
- Is that so?
- That is so.

653
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,981
Hey, hey!

654
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,639
Mr. Brindle, you don't
want to do this.

655
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,424
I'm sorry, but I do.
I need my cell phone.

656
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,504
- Put the gun down.
- Easy, Officer. Easy.

657
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,860
Don't do nothing stupid here.

658
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,308
- Easy.
- Thank you.

659
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,741
I need a second, please.

660
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,829
Hold fire.

661
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,664
Watch him, watch him.

662
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,864
- Send 'em around the other side.
- He has a hostage!

663
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,102
- Cuff yourself.
- Mr. Brindle.

664
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,463
Uh.. cover your ears and hum
"The Star Spangled Banner."

665
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,226
Talk to us!

666
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,468
So there's another player? Is
somebody else playing the game?

667
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,622
There is one other player, yes.

668
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,465
That's a little wrinkle we were
going to spring on you later.

669
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,341
- You can't just change the rules!
- You knew there were time limits.

670
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,191
Your ultimate time limit
is the other player.

671
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,947
If he completes challenge 13
before you, he gets the prize

672
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,105
and you get 20 years for the remarkable
stunt you're pulling right now.

673
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,342
- Keep humming!
- Mr. Brindle, talk to us.

674
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,750
You should know your opponent is on
challenge 11, too. Right there with you.

675
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,902
What? I'm on 12 right now!

676
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,110
This is not a challenge. This
does not count as challenge 12.

677
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,984
But you rigged the
thing on the chair!

678
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,064
We assure you we had
nothing to do with that.

679
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,989
You're doing this on your own.

680
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,830
You don't have a lot
of time, Brindle.

681
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,426
OK, I'm doing this on my own.

682
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,629
I've been on my own all day.
I've been on my own my whole life!

683
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,066
- Mr. Brindle.
- The other guy,

684
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,110
he bust out of a police
station, too? No, he didn't.

685
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,786
He did not. But I'm gonna do it.
No matter what you throw at me,

686
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,544
I chew it up and I
spit it the fuck out!

687
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,789
Shit!

688
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,990
- It's just his foot!
- Go, go!

689
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,187
- Move, move!
- Get it open!

690
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,702
- I've got a clear shot!
- I said stand down!

691
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,861
Back alley!

692
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,705
- Go. Go get him.
- Go, go, go!

693
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,305
Brindle..

694
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,145
you gonna make me say "freeze"?

695
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,110
What are you doing?

696
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,821
You think this is a game?

697
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,863
You get shot, that's gonna
end the fun pretty quick.

698
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,119
Freeze!

699
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,263
No, I don't know.

700
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,344
Yeah, there's something going
on like right down the street.

701
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,780
No, I'm gonna check it out.
It's like.. Hey!

702
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,910
- Are you there? Are you watching?
- What the fuck?

703
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,506
- Why don't you give me my phone!
- Just walk away, man.

704
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,390
Walk away.

705
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,304
I know you're watching!

706
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,709
I got a phone! You can
call me on this phone!

707
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,351
I know you didn't just happen by.
They sent you, didn't they?

708
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,300
I know you're my next challenge!
Tell me, what am I supposed to do?

709
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,623
Oh, you just wanna go home.
OK, where's your home?

710
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,744
OK, come on, come on!

711
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,906
If you don't want to be found, you
can't just switch off your phone.

712
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,461
You gotta take the battery out.

713
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,224
Give us a minute.

714
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,029
So if I were a part
of this conspiracy,

715
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,587
why would I be even
asking you questions?

716
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,584
Even if you worked for them, they'd
probably keep you in the dark.

717
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,710
You probably know a
tenth of what I know.

718
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,187
Fair enough, but, um..

719
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,468
in that scenario,
you're dead already.

720
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,745
So, why not talk?

721
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,229
But if, on the other hand,

722
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,704
there is a, uh, a one in a hundred
chance that I'm a real cop

723
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,749
and you're holding back information

724
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,507
while there's a maniac
out there running wild,

725
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,870
well, that would make you
an accessory to, uh..

726
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,070
I don't know. Shall we start
tallying the charges?

727
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,587
I came home from work one day, and
found that my wife had left me..

728
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,744
and killed our dog.

729
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,141
And partially eaten him.

730
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,501
Now, you'll just have
to take my word for it,

731
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,583
that was completely
out of character.

732
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,906
You see, that's the true
objective of the game,

733
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,348
the spectacle of transformation.

734
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,744
To show that anyone can
be turned into a monster.

735
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,909
You don't know anything
about the game, do you?

736
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,904
You're just an old
woman, aren't you?

737
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,624
It's over. I'm so sorry.

738
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,423
You need help? You
want me to hang that?

739
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,665
OK.

740
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,941
That's it?

741
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,706
No.

742
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,306
Fuck.

743
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,828
Stop!

744
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,310
Stop!

745
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,545
Wait! Stop!

746
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,825
Whoo!

747
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,303
That was the easiest hundred bucks ever.
Anything else we can do for you?

748
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,464
No..

749
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,107
Wait! Stop! Stop!

750
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,342
Wait! Stop! Stop!

751
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,702
Stop! Stop!

752
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,665
Don't!

753
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,505
We're back! And we have a
very special announcement!

754
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,508
Elliot Brindle, as of four minutes
ago, you are a millionaire!

755
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,429
Congratulations.

756
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,341
We've now reached a point in the game
where we like to give our audience

757
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,989
the opportunity to ask our contestants
a few questions. Are you ready?

758
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,301
Saint Inna 57 says
he's very impressed

759
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,942
with how you have grown in
these last several hours..

760
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,541
I'm not playing anymore!

761
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,144
It was a game just for
someone's amusement, right?

762
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,828
Whose? I don't know.

763
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,468
But sometimes..

764
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,106
Sometimes I think about how
few people on this planet

765
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,989
really decide everything.

766
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,189
One percent of one percent.

767
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,824
They are the functional
equivalent of gods.

768
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,665
They must get.. bored.

769
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,944
How does it end? This game?

770
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,741
Thirteen is the end.

771
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,028
Thirteen never changes.

772
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:46,148
Some contestants think they can
walk away, but it's a snuff shell.

773
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,031
There's only one way those end.

774
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,068
Please be advised to expect delays
for the 342 train to New Orleans..

775
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,305
- Excuse me.
- Get your hands off me.

776
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

777
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,189
Did you hear that?
Do you have a phone?

778
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,183
Watch it.

779
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,749
- Who has a phone?
- Cell phone?

780
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,830
Shit. You crazy?

781
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,425
Hey!

782
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,264
What's your hurry, buddy?

783
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,062
You don't have to do this.

784
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:05,060
They're killing people.
Listen to me. I quit.

785
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,582
You could quit, too.

786
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,581
What are you?

787
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,107
You know, thwarting your
opponent's progress

788
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,025
could be interpreted as
interfering with the game.

789
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,387
Yeah? What's he gonna do, huh?

790
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,622
What's he gonna do that's gonna top
what happened back on that road?

791
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,919
Is he going to crash a plane?
Blow up a fucking school?

792
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,069
Thirteen is a bit more
intimate than that.

793
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,666
And it's the same for all
players, including you.

794
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,345
I told you I'm not playing anymore.

795
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,868
The final challenge is
worth four point..

796
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,864
Dad. Dad! You OK?

797
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,627
What happened to you?

798
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,545
I had an eventful day.

799
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,863
You look like you're
about to shit yourself.

800
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,545
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

801
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,700
You're here?

802
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,501
You're here, too.

803
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,150
My stomach's upset. I think I
ate something that was bad.

804
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,030
- How are you doing?
- Michael, what are you doing here?

805
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,224
I thought you said you were gonna
go home and take your pill.

806
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,270
Yeah, well, I had to do some stuff.

807
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:42,267
- What stuff?
- Well, I was with Marisol.

808
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,390
- Marisol from the Hot Dog Castle?
- Yeah.

809
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,464
What's it mean you were
"with" her? Like a date?

810
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,985
Yeah, like a date.

811
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:55,544
Like people go on to the
movies, OK? We.. OK?

812
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,863
- What movie did you see?
- I don't remember.

813
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,020
- You don't remember?
- It's not like science fiction, Elliot,

814
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,429
that I could go on a date
with somebody, ever. OK?

815
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,548
What's in the bag, Michael?

816
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,027
Michael, what's challenge 13?

817
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,947
You gotta tell me.
What's challenge 13?

818
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,991
You have to.. to
kill a family member.

819
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,068
That's what they said,
to kill a family member.

820
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,347
- Go home, Michael.
- Why? Why? So you can win?

821
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,668
No, no, I wanna win. I wanna
win something one time!

822
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,790
I wanna win one t..

823
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,630
Michael, I know you've been able
to do everything they've asked you

824
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,465
'cause you don't think about stuff.

825
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,384
But you're thinking now, right?

826
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,349
Remember when Dad used
a studded belt on me?

827
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,309
Yeah. I remember other things, too.

828
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,383
I remember how he used to dote
on you when you were little.

829
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,747
No, I don't remember
when I was little!

830
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,746
I remember when I was eight and
he hit me with a tennis racket.

831
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,221
So you're gonna shoot him?

832
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,624
Michael. Michael, he hit me, too.
Remember when I scratched the car?

833
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:29,423
It warms my heart a little to see the
two of you showing some initiative.

834
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,949
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

835
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,991
The game's not what it was in
my day, I'll tell you that.

836
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,267
Drafting idiots like you.

837
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,151
They turned it into a freak show.

838
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,429
- Jesus.
- You played the game?

839
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:52,461
- I won.
- You did all 13?

840
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,385
Thirteen is the tough one.

841
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,020
- Bit of a leap there.
- Who did you kill?

842
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,346
She was the only softness in me.

843
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,226
- Jesus!
- What is he saying, Elliot?

844
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,742
I'm saying your mother
never wore a seat belt.

845
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,868
Michael, wait in the other room.

846
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,547
- Elliot?
- Just wait in the other room.

847
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,630
For real?

848
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,904
OK.

849
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,866
That game ruined me.

850
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,109
I had everything before
and nothing after.

851
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,661
It poisoned me.

852
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,625
Every cell from that day to this.

853
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,390
But the thing is,

854
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,989
I know that even if I'd had somebody
telling me all these things then,

855
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,905
it wouldn't have mattered because
I wouldn't have listened

856
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,586
any more than you're listening now.

857
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:32,102
But there is one thing
I can do for you.

858
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,505
Yeah?

859
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,185
- I can keep you from winning.
- How are you gonna do that?

860
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,981
Oh.. oh.. oh..

861
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,869
OK..

862
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,464
Well.. what do we do now?

863
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,104
I.. I did some things.

864
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,747
Yeah, me, too.

865
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,026
How do I know that you
won't do something to me?

866
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,944
Why would I do something to you?

867
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,628
You're my family member,
I'm yours. So..

868
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,582
One of us could still
win, if we wanted to.

869
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,188
Do you want to?

870
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,507
No.

871
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,344
Let's go.

872
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,061
- What are you doing?
- Just getting my bag.

873
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,748
- Mikey, just leave it.
- I have to get my pills.

874
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,141
- Why are you doing that?
- Just have to get them.

875
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,541
Just zip it up. Just..

876
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,023
Mike! Jesus Christ!

877
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,227
You're gonna be OK.

878
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:40,742
Press really hard right there.
Press right here.

879
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,782
They said I could buy you a wedding
present if I had the money.

880
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,385
If I had the money I could..

881
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,950
I just want to win.

882
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,828
One time I want to win.

883
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,630
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

884
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,585
- It's OK.
- I'm so sorry!

885
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,509
- Come here.
- Ah!

886
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,229
Stop!

887
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,026
- I want to win.
- Ah!

888
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,701
Stop!

889
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,582
I'm sorry.

890
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,028
Yeah, the evidence trail
is taken care of.

891
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,945
My colleagues have nothing.

892
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,626
Nah, it's pretty much
Hamlet in here.

893
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,510
This is a violation of the
terms of the agreement.

894
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,109
You are forbidden to interfere with
or seek out the origins of the game.

895
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,069
That was explained to you.

896
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,827
Everything's been fixed.
No one is after you.

897
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,744
Now, if you'll just back away,

898
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,949
you can still go home a winner.

899
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,030
They'll take the money away.

900
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,621
I'm just an employee. I'm nothing.

901
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,821
You're here.

902
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:05,060
Elliot! My God! Where are you?
Did they release you?

903
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,109
Daddy said they were still
waiting to hear about bail,

904
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,349
but when I went to the station, they
didn't have any record of your arrest.

905
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,661
What's going on?

906
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,391
I'm on my way home right now.

907
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,941
Everything's been
straightened out. I just..

908
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,430
I wanted to hear your voice.

909
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,107
My God. That's all I
can think to say.

910
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,386
Yeah.

911
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,224
As if things weren't insane
enough, somebody called

912
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,748
and offered me $6,000 to eat a fly.

913
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,666
What did you say?

914
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,182
What did I say?

915
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,584
Are you kidding?

916
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,625
I said fuck off! That's vile.

917
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,551
I mean, could you imagine?

918
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,623
Anyway, I better get a move on.

919
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,431
Oh, and of course there's already another
detour we're gonna have to make.

920
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,060
We have to stop at my Uncle
Louie's and pick up his camera

921
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,747
because my father, who's so proud of
his photography, dropped his camera.

922
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,187
