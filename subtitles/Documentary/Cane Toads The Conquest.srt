1
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,877
Of all the words my father wrote,
and there were many,

2
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,137
l remember these most:

3
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:27,829
''Nothing in human progress
is achieved with unanimous consent.

4
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,940
Those enlightened before others''

5
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:34,776
must pursue that light
in spite of others.

6
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,340
There was a time
the New World didn't exist.

7
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,571
The sun set in the west,
where no man ventured.

8
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,020
And beyond that...

9
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:48,632
infinity!

10
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,728
Look.

11
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,768
Now...

12
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,219
half of the hull has gone.

13
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:58,056
Good.

14
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,349
And now?

15
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,806
Now, l only see the mast.

16
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,226
Close your eyes.
And don't cheat.

17
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:18,019
l'm watching.

18
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:25,589
Open them when l tell you.

19
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:31,476
Once l asked my father
where he wanted to go.

20
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,231
He replied:

21
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,852
''l want to travel over the seas.

22
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,761
l want to get behind the weather.''

23
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,645
Now.

24
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,062
lt's gone.

25
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:51,358
What does it tell you?

26
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,764
lt's round,

27
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,819
like this.

28
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,319
Round.

29
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,740
Come on, lad.

30
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,492
Good morning, Father.

31
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,452
Diego!

32
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,519
Kiss your brother, Diego.

33
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:19,918
l have something for you.

34
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,076
You'll be heard
at Salamanca University.

35
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,022
ln a week!

36
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:31,754
That's what it says.

37
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,775
How did you manage it?

38
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,172
With some difficulty.

39
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:46,529
l promised them
you weren't a total fool.

40
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,053
Marco Polo said he found Earthly
Paradise off the coast of China.

41
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,219
Do you believe this?

42
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:15,888
l believe in Paradise and Hell.
And l do believe both can
be earthly.

43
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:19,597
Now...
let's go through this again.

44
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,243
Why do you wish to sail west?

45
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,428
To open a new route to Asia.

46
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:33,963
Asia is the richest Kingdom.
The land of spices and gold.

47
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:37,988
There are two ways of reaching it...

48
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,695
By sea...
Sailing around the African continent,

49
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:43,904
which takes a year,

50
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:48,916
or by land. But the Turks
have closed the route to Christians.

51
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,277
There is a third way...

52
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,981
by sailing west
across the sea.

53
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,051
The distance is unknown...

54
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,271
lt's said to be infinite.

55
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:11,827
Superstition!

56
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:13,054
l believe the lndies

57
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:18,066
are no more than 750 leagues
west of the Canary lslands.

58
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:21,600
How can you be so certain?

59
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:25,563
The calculations of Toscanelli...
Marin de Tyr...

60
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,317
Esdras...
/Esdras is a Jew.

61
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:29,650
So was Christ!
/2 minutes...

62
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,235
and already you're a bad man.

63
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,277
For telling the truth?
/Yes.

64
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:37,191
They're burning people for less.

65
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,276
The man you're to confront

66
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,476
has no emotions.

67
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,522
Learn to control your passion.

68
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,407
Passion is something
one can't control.

69
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:50,547
You need their blessing.

70
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,490
lf they say no...

71
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,659
you would have to give up.

72
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,792
l will not give up.

73
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,076
ls it ambition?

74
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,744
We've been told lies
for so long...

75
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:07,522
The world is flat like this table...

76
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:10,452
Monsters guard
the edge of the world...

77
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:14,017
l will not be told what
and what not to be afraid of!

78
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,090
l want to find out for myself.

79
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:23,018
l just hope your passion
will be contagious, my son.

80
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:44,662
Look, father!

81
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:53,790
Fernando!

82
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,469
Do you repent your sins

83
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,426
in the name of the Father,

84
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,229
the Son and the Holy Spirit?

85
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,391
Burnings in the square...

86
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,406
They agreed to see me
in Salamanca.

87
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:07,323
lf they accept
l could be gone for years.

88
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,325
l know.

89
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:14,034
l haven't given you a real life.

90
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:18,651
Uh... that's true, l have a child
by a man who won't marry me...

91
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,207
Are you going to argue?

92
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:25,000
l'd love to argue with you
more often, but you're
never here.

93
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,294
Unfortunately, that is precisely
where our opinions differ.

94
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:05,421
You're familiar with Aristotle?
Eratosthenes? Ptolemeus?

95
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,295
l am, Your Eminence.

96
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:11,660
So you can't ignore their
calculations that the circumference

97
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:16,341
of the Earth is approximately
22,000 leagues or more...

98
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:18,967
making the ocean uncrossable.

99
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,174
But you...

100
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,956
may have found new evidence

101
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:27,363
proving these great
men mistaken!

102
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:34,635
You are aware of Marin de Tyr?

103
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,092
We are.

104
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:41,845
Then you are also aware that
his theories contradict Ptolemeus...

105
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:46,252
De Tyr believes the ocean to be
only 750 leagues.

106
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,804
Toscanelli...

107
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:52,181
and the French Cardinal D'Ailly,
both think De Tyr

108
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,846
is accurate in his calculations.

109
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,982
Therefore the ocean can be crossed.

110
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:01,888
Silence!

111
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:07,757
Gentlemen, are we here to examine
this man's proposal, or not?

112
00:15:08,892 --> 00:15:10,268
Let's suppose the moment...

113
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,267
Marin de Tyr is right.
ln your opinion,

114
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:16,849
how long would it take?

115
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,881
Seven weeks.

116
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:19,849
Six, during the summer.

117
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,479
De Tyr is wrong.

118
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,834
He's contradicted by the finest...

119
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:26,894
geographers.

120
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:30,792
Your voyage, Senor Colombus,
would take a year.

121
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:35,438
Suppose you cross the ocean
and reach Asia...

122
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,742
What would Spain do there?

123
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,523
Trade, Your Excellency.

124
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,811
According to Marco Polo,
the Kingdom of China

125
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:48,899
... is one of the richest
lands in the worlds

126
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,945
The meanest buildings
are roofed in gold.

127
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,902
lt's your only interest?

128
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,024
Gold?

129
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:56,983
No.

130
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,108
l'll bring these people to God

131
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:04,558
and make them subjects
of Castille and Aragon.

132
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,895
From a Realm,

133
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,486
Spain will become an Empire!

134
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:12,360
lf God intended
our proximity to Asia

135
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:16,528
do you believe he'd have waited
for you to show it?

136
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,070
He chose a carpenter's son
to reveal Himself to the world.

137
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,936
So you consider yourself
the Chosen One?

138
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,241
Asia can be found to the west...

139
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:36,816
and l will prove it!

140
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:54,527
The Treasurer of Spain honours us.

141
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:58,704
The State has an interest
in his proposition, Your Eminence.

142
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:02,249
With all due respect,
the judgement is ours.

143
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,373
Why not?

144
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:05,174
And if he were right?

145
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,793
l've always found
such independent minds dangerous.

146
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:16,322
lf he had wings
he'd return from the skies

147
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,692
and say heaven was empty.

148
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:26,378
l'd deplore the loss
of such an opportunity for Spain.

149
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,961
Especially over
a point of geography.

150
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:32,128
lt's not geography.
lt's about reality.

151
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,567
This man is a mercenary.

152
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,086
States often use mercenaries.

153
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:41,839
lf it is to the benefit,
the stability of Spain... No?

154
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:47,303
lt should be as much your concern
as it is mine.

155
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:54,008
You would use your
influence to assist this heretic?

156
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:54,965
Well...

157
00:17:57,093 --> 00:18:01,342
You know, your Eminence,
the fascinating thing
about power...

158
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,322
is that what can be given...

159
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:10,897
so easily can be taken away.

160
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:32,607
And therefore nothing could justify
Your Majesties' participation

161
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:36,612
in a venture that relies on
feeble assumptions,

162
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:39,291
and which any man of knowledge

163
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:43,662
would take to be impractical...
if not impossible.

164
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:47,623
They didn't listen.
They don't want to listen.

165
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:50,909
Don't give in. You must wait.
/Wait?

166
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,122
After seven years,
how much longer can l wait?

167
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,706
lf God intends you to...

168
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:57,330
Damn God!
/Christopher!

169
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:02,539
Damn all of you! You sit concocting
theories based on what?

170
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,374
You never leave your gardens.
Go out!

171
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:09,252
Well then, tell me something
l can accept.

172
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:13,831
These are full of assumptions!

173
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,168
Just lies!

174
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,792
All of it lies!

175
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,422
All of it lies!

176
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:53,259
Father?

177
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,385
Don't disturb a man

178
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:57,141
doing penance.

179
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,887
What can you do?

180
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,513
Nothing.
That's the point, Fernando.

181
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,387
Fernando!

182
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,706
Senor Colombus?

183
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,205
l've looked all over
Sevilla for you.

184
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:05,682
Never expected to find you
in a monastery.

185
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:08,668
l'm Pinzon.

186
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:12,957
Martin Alonzo Pinzon.
l'm a ship owner from Palos.

187
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:19,769
ls he a spy?

188
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,041
What is it?
Are you a Trappist?

189
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,134
Vow of silence?

190
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,545
Penance?

191
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,360
Just my luck.

192
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:36,795
l'll do the talking for us.

193
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,546
Just nod, agreed?

194
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,423
As with my wife.

195
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:43,667
l know the commission
turned you down, right?

196
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:46,044
What do you expect?
You're a foreigner.

197
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,234
And l want to help you.

198
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:52,044
Why do l believe in you?
l'm a seaman, too.

199
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:56,098
We don't like to be told
where to go or not to go.

200
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:00,800
l don't look much,
but l have friends,

201
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,270
important friends.

202
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,661
A banker, for example.

203
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,468
He finances me.
He's name is Santangel.

204
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,095
Heard of him?

205
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:12,261
He'll get you in to see the Queen.

206
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:13,722
You know why?

207
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:16,174
She owes him money.
That's for it.

208
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:20,690
You, me, the Queen, the world...
Everybody owes something.

209
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,307
What do you say?

210
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:25,883
Where can l meet him?
/Here.

211
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:27,016
Right there.

212
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,304
May l ask a question?

213
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:36,934
Yes.

214
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,811
Why do you want to help me?

215
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:43,517
Faith.

216
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,389
Hope.

217
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,353
Charity.

218
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:52,058
But greater than all these...

219
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,700
is banking.

220
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:35,953


221
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:00,506
Wait, Senores!

222
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,505
The Moors built Granada
centuries ago.

223
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:08,079
We've taken it back.

224
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,417
A tragic victory.
We're losing a great culture.

225
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:20,509
But l suppose there's a price
for every victory.

226
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,699
lsn't there Senor Colombus?

227
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,931
Don Luis de Santangel

228
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,638
to see Don Gabriel Sanchez.

229
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:47,681
Luis!

230
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:02,870
Senor Columbus, Senor Pinzon.

231
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,360
Rise...
Come forward.

232
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:56,859
l should not be listening to you
since my Council said not to.

233
00:25:56,985 --> 00:26:00,480
But Santangel says you're
a man of honour...

234
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:03,941
And Sanchez says
you're not completely mad.

235
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,009
No more than she who said...

236
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,236
she would take Granada
from the Moors.

237
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:13,291
They believe the ocean is...
uncrossable,

238
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,449
Senor Colombus.

239
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:18,734
What did they say about Granada?

240
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:28,280
That it was impregnable.

241
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:42,826
l can't ignore my Council's verdict.

242
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:45,745
Surely you can do what you want.

243
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,619
How little you know.

244
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,912
Why should l believe in you,
Senor Colombus?

245
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,895
May l speak freely?

246
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,831
You are not inclined
to speak otherwise.

247
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:06,439
l know what l see.

248
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,276
l see someone who doesn't
accept the world as it is.

249
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,485
Who's not afraid.

250
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,188
l see a woman who thinks...
/A woman?

251
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:20,849
Forgive me...

252
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:25,443
but you're the only Queen
l know.

253
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:30,383
That makes us equal,
you're the only navigator l know.

254
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,861
How old are you,
Senor Colombus?

255
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,159
Thirty-nine, Your Majesty.

256
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:42,653
And you?

257
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,450
l'm forty...

258
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,407
You will be informed
of our decision.

259
00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:12,313
l thought you were
younger than l.

260
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,979
The cost would be ruinous.

261
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,118
No more than the cost
of two state banquets.

262
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:44,155
Two banquets,
for new lands and spices...

263
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,400
and gold.

264
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,775
What are you saying, Sanchez?

265
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:55,341
That if he's right
we have everything to gain.

266
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,357
And if he's wrong...

267
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,376
we've so little to lose.

268
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:25,290
Tell me what he says.

269
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,457
He demands to be made a Knight,

270
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:31,369
with the right to wear
the Golden Spurs.

271
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,402
And that he will receive the title
Don Christopher Colombus,

272
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,583
which will be extended
to his descendants.

273
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:45,627
What else?

274
00:29:45,836 --> 00:29:48,872
He'll be named
Admiral of the Ocean Seas.

275
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:51,206
Viceroy of the West lndies...

276
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:55,411
Governor of all islands
or lands discovered,

277
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:58,787
or as will be discovered by him.

278
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:03,408
The highest titles of nobility,
Your Excellency.

279
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:06,951
To an immigrant sheltered
by monks!

280
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,319
Furthermore...

281
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,820
he'll receive one tenth

282
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:20,654
of wealth or monies,

283
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,159
precious gems,

284
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,449
pearls, metals, spices
and other lucrative sources

285
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,117
acquired under his jurisdiction.

286
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:36,538
You worry too much, Francisco.

287
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,342
He'll have to lower his demands.

288
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:42,618
Believe me...

289
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:46,205
He will.

290
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,911
l won't!

291
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:55,120
We have considered your proposal
carefully. lt is excessive.

292
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,996
The responsibility is excessive.

293
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,490
Consider the contract...
/No.

294
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,807
No?
/No.

295
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:07,503
And l thought he was an idealist.

296
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:10,627
ldealism and ambition
are not incompatible.

297
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:15,127
l've fought too hard.
Now you expect me to take
all the risks

298
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,791
while you take the profit.
/No...

299
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,336
l'm not a servant...
/Senor Colombus,

300
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:22,298
you are in no position...

301
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,881
to bargain with me.

302
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,341
l'm not bargaining.

303
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,474
Then you are too ambitious.

304
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,454
And where you never ambitious?

305
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:42,425
ls ambition a virtue among nobles
but a fault for the rest of us?

306
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:43,990
lf you won't accept we can

307
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:47,633
simply find someone who will.

308
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:51,263
lf you can do that, Excellency...

309
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:57,591
l'll become a monk!

310
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:25,393
Your Majesty.

311
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,409
He'll become a monk...

312
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,347
lt would be a pity,
wouldn't it?

313
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,312
Call him back.

314
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,597
She said yes.

315
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,273
lf l ever come back, l swear...

316
00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:01,776
l don't want you
to swear anything.

317
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,526
l don't want you
to wait for me.

318
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:08,318
That's something
you can't decide for me.

319
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:21,393


320
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,525
Forgive me Father, l have sinned.

321
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,327
l am listening, my son.

322
00:33:57,448 --> 00:34:01,162
Father...
l have betrayed my family.

323
00:34:02,204 --> 00:34:04,120
l betrayed my men,

324
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,123
and l betrayed you.

325
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:09,674
l lied.

326
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,051
The journey is longer than l said.

327
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:14,804
How long?

328
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,865
l'm not sure...

329
00:34:17,007 --> 00:34:21,696
How could anyone know.
lt could be twice the distance.

330
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,546
You must tell them.

331
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:26,909
You must tell your men.
/They wouldn't follow me.

332
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:30,221
You know l'm right.
You must trust me.

333
00:34:30,222 --> 00:34:34,891
You must speak to them.
lf you don't, l will.

334
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:38,135
You made an oath.

335
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:41,331
May God forgive you.

336
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:44,387
l believed in you.

337
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,190
Give me absolution.

338
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:55,396
Absolution, Father.

339
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:01,477
Ego te absolvo
a pecatis tuis.

340
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,640
Enter.

341
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:34,725
Mendez...

342
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,808
Sit down.

343
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:43,664
Wine?

344
00:38:53,855 --> 00:38:55,866
What is it, Mendez?
Speak!

345
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:06,661
They wonder how you know
our position with no sight
of land?

346
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:09,077
What do you think, Mendez?

347
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,401
l know you navigate by the stars
like the Moors...

348
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,913
but l don't know how?

349
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,361
Take this quadrant.

350
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:43,367
Find the North Star.

351
00:39:50,743 --> 00:39:51,952
Steady yourself!

352
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:58,035
Keep the plumbline vertical.

353
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:06,996
And don't move.

354
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:11,685
A mistake of one degree
and we'll be off 600 leagues.

355
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,581
What do you read?

356
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,080
28.
/That's it!

357
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,055
28th parallel.

358
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:22,280
And we'll follow it
until we reach land.

359
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:28,031
How do you know that
we'll find land of 28th parallel?

360
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,292
l don't.

361
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,725
Mark 26, Sir.

362
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,225
Mark 27, Sir.

363
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:11,728
Mark 28!

364
00:42:18,395 --> 00:42:19,857
Mark 29!

365
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,729
629!

366
00:42:27,898 --> 00:42:29,483
629, Sir.

367
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:32,399
l heard.

368
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:40,316
Captain, l don't understand.

369
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,441
l think l do.

370
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:09,469
We should've seen land.

371
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:15,638
We've been at sea nine weeks,
Alonzo. Can't be that far.

372
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:19,000
Can't be that near.

373
00:43:21,575 --> 00:43:24,451
l don't like the smell
of this sea around here.

374
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,828
Smells like a whore!

375
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:28,004
'Course it does.

376
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:31,391
That's why sailors go to sea.

377
00:43:32,578 --> 00:43:34,881
And why is that one at sea?

378
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:36,891
Nobody knows.

379
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,881
He never says a word.

380
00:43:41,623 --> 00:43:45,217
Captain Pinzon requests
permission to board.

381
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:57,186
You mislead me.
You lied to me.

382
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,915
We are way past 750 leagues.

383
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:03,073
Six days ago, yes.
/You must be mad!

384
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,166
Keep your voice down!

385
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:08,376
There'll be a mutiny!
/You think l don't know?

386
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:10,544
We're lost!

387
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:16,545
Land is there. l know it.

388
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:17,836
You don't know anything.

389
00:44:17,837 --> 00:44:21,953
Listen, these are my ships
and we are turning back.

390
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:25,962
And then what? Half of the water
has gone, the rest is putrid!

391
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,296
l shouldn't have listened to you...
You...

392
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:30,340
Listen, Pinzon! Pinzon.

393
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,081
All we can do...

394
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,028
is go forward.

395
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,425
The land is there...
The land is close.

396
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:45,073
You tell them that.
You must tell them.

397
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,390
God doesn't want us
to cross this ocean.

398
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:02,638
This voyage is cursed.

399
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:06,712
We set sail for greed.
God has abandoned us.

400
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:10,776
The voyage is cursed.
There are signs.

401
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:24,227
Juanito has the voice of an angel.

402
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:28,153
His mouth is blessed, but what

403
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:30,458
comes out of yours is cursed.

404
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:38,645
Listen...

405
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,343
We're all afraid at first.

406
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:46,637
But those who overcome fear
will rightly earn their reward.

407
00:45:47,854 --> 00:45:51,992
l don't know if it's God's will
that we should cross this ocean.

408
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:57,293
But l am certain it is you
who puts fear into our hearts.

409
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:05,524
We can't be lost if we keep faith
in God and in ourselves.

410
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:10,589
ln time...

411
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:14,556
they will talk of the
courage of the first

412
00:46:14,558 --> 00:46:18,026
men to cross this
ocean, and return.

413
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:20,736
And then you will be
able to say to them,

414
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,236
l was on the Pinta...

415
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:24,736
l was on the Nina...

416
00:46:25,778 --> 00:46:27,862
and the Santa Maria...

417
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:37,738
This jacket to he who sights land.

418
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:40,783
And 10,000 maravedis a year
for life!

419
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,492
l wanna get a man aloft
day and night!

420
00:46:59,412 --> 00:47:00,578
Alonzo...

421
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:04,381
don't let the wind escape us.

422
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:12,144
You lucky bastard!

423
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:09,562
Mendez...

424
00:49:10,478 --> 00:49:11,560
Mendez!

425
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:19,105
Land...

426
00:49:43,653 --> 00:49:45,780
25 fathoms!

427
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:53,487
24 fathoms!

428
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:58,337
23

429
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,348
22

430
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:09,978
21

431
00:50:13,237 --> 00:50:16,780
20

432
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:20,276
19

433
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,868
18

434
00:50:30,215 --> 00:50:32,066
17

435
00:50:35,795 --> 00:50:38,046
16

436
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,260
15

437
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:51,147
14

438
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:01,971
13

439
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:03,751
There...

440
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:17,160
Land ho!

441
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,799
Drop anchor!

442
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,879
Don Christopher...

443
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,512
Excellencia...

444
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:25,599
By the...

445
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:31,183
By the Grace of God...

446
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:39,727
ln the name of their
Gracious Majesties

447
00:55:39,895 --> 00:55:42,333
of Castilla and Aragon...

448
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:02,314
By all the powers vested in me...

449
00:56:04,438 --> 00:56:07,231
l claim this island and name it...

450
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:10,483
San Salvador.

451
00:59:03,313 --> 00:59:05,060
Don Christopher...

452
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,357
Muskets!
/No!

453
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,316
October 21 st, 1492.

454
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:07,225
l think We have returned
to Eden.

455
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:12,142
Surely this is how the world was
in the beginning of time.

456
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,892
lf the natives are to be
converted to our ways

457
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:21,062
then it will be by persuasion
and not by force.

458
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:25,769
l believe no man will ever see
this land again as we do...

459
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,395
for the first time.

460
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:31,217
We come in peace
and with honour.

461
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:35,298
They are not savages,
neither will we be.

462
01:03:35,299 --> 01:03:39,925
Treat them as you would
your own wives and children.

463
01:03:39,926 --> 01:03:42,187
Respect their beliefs.

464
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:46,865
Pillage will be punished by
the whip. Rape, by the sword.

465
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:37,645
You?

466
01:04:40,522 --> 01:04:41,481
Utapan.

467
01:04:42,772 --> 01:04:43,982
Utapan?

468
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,190
Columbus.

469
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:52,898
Co... Colum...
/Columbus.

470
01:04:53,983 --> 01:04:55,815
Co... lombus.

471
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:22,239
Where did you find this?

472
01:05:24,029 --> 01:05:25,697
Cuba!

473
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:24,354
Thanks...
l've got a river of gold to piss.

474
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,821
Here!

475
01:06:58,072 --> 01:06:59,041
ls it gold?

476
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:01,614
No, no.

477
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:03,030
No good, no.

478
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:47,852
Utapan!

479
01:07:50,289 --> 01:07:51,456
Utapan!

480
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:53,665
Alonzo! Alonzo!

481
01:07:57,539 --> 01:07:58,707
Help him!

482
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:01,845
Help him!

483
01:08:11,668 --> 01:08:13,294
Do something!

484
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,545
Pray for him.

485
01:08:37,269 --> 01:08:42,478
With Alonzo's death, l realise
how vulnerable we are
in these islands.

486
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,032
How much we have to learn.

487
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,815
On every island...

488
01:08:48,565 --> 01:08:53,400
the natives welcome us
with great generosity and trust.

489
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:59,150
Because of our appearance
we have been mistaken for gods

490
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:03,057
and are treated accordingly.

491
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:07,441
Despite the lndians' compliance
we have not found gold in quantity,

492
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:12,736
except for the few artefacts
they gave us as a sign
of submission.

493
01:11:26,054 --> 01:11:27,555
You will speak first.

494
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:32,437
Tell him we thank him
for his hospitality.

495
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,653
He knows.

496
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:39,446
Tell him some of my men
are staying here

497
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:41,448
to build a fort.

498
01:11:42,113 --> 01:11:44,613
l want them to be well treated.

499
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:46,783
Tell him...

500
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:49,545
we'll come back.
Many of us.

501
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:52,887
He said, how many?

502
01:11:56,658 --> 01:11:59,388
As many as the leaves
on that tree.

503
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,315
And many more will follow.

504
01:12:07,662 --> 01:12:08,454
Why?

505
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,725
To bring the word of God.

506
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,411
He says he has a God.

507
01:12:18,412 --> 01:12:20,652
And also to bring medicine.

508
01:12:28,872 --> 01:12:29,716
He says...

509
01:12:29,747 --> 01:12:31,333
...he has medicine.

510
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,501
Tell him...

511
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,878
we admire his people.

512
01:12:49,836 --> 01:12:53,848
He knows you like his women
and gold.

513
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,308
Pinzon is ill...

514
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:11,341
eaten up by a fever
that refuses to leave his body.

515
01:13:11,714 --> 01:13:14,277
We must return to Spain.

516
01:13:15,714 --> 01:13:20,050
39 men have volunteered to stay
behind to build a fort.

517
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:23,052
l name it...
La Navidad.

518
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:47,098
After 7 months,
l haven't seen a civilisation

519
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:50,933
that compares
with Marco Polo's descriptions.

520
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:56,264
No cities, no bridges.
No temples roofed with gold.

521
01:13:58,432 --> 01:14:00,724
The mainland still escapes me.

522
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:03,800
But l know it's there.

523
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:10,227
My ships are not filled with
the spices and gold l was
hoping for.

524
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:15,142
But this land intoxicates
my senses and my soul.

525
01:14:15,143 --> 01:14:20,063
And all l can think of
is to return to this untamed land.

526
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:22,252
This unexplored Eden.

527
01:14:22,521 --> 01:14:25,137
This is a chance for
a new beginning.

528
01:15:00,573 --> 01:15:04,986
Majestates conjuncta Hispania.

529
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:09,278
Reges Ferdinandus et lsabella

530
01:15:10,032 --> 01:15:13,364
executores voluntas Dei sunt

531
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:16,615
et cum vobis Regnum Domini

532
01:15:16,824 --> 01:15:21,242
per terras novas
ultra mares crescatur

533
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:24,660
et in eas Crux Cristi

534
01:15:25,075 --> 01:15:27,743
maneat semper.

535
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:29,375
lt won't be easy
to get rid of him now.

536
01:16:31,282 --> 01:16:32,866
On the contrary...

537
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:37,606
lt seems he is preparing
his own cross.

538
01:17:21,998 --> 01:17:25,406
Let the palate enjoy
the flavour of the tobacco.

539
01:17:26,504 --> 01:17:27,473
Try it.

540
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:47,278
You say this is
an lndian vice?

541
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:52,114
l don't see the pleasure
that would make it a sin.

542
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:57,649
The lndians
have no such word, Moxica.

543
01:17:58,961 --> 01:18:00,878
Have they such thoughts?

544
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:06,005
They come and go naked
as God created them.

545
01:18:06,505 --> 01:18:08,838
God? Which God?

546
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,997
Nature is their God.

547
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,154
lt's as if God and
Nature were one.

548
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:27,864
They see him in a leaf...
in a stone...

549
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:30,614
in a shell.

550
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:37,033
The islands...

551
01:18:37,991 --> 01:18:39,949
are covered with trees.

552
01:18:42,096 --> 01:18:44,420
Forgive me,
Don Cristobal...

553
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,670
What about gold?

554
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:53,987
lt's not the purest metal
l've seen.

555
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:55,446
ls there more?

556
01:19:59,906 --> 01:20:02,615
We are more than
gratified, Cristobal.

557
01:21:00,378 --> 01:21:01,587
Excellente.

558
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:15,351
You fence well.
/For a commoner?

559
01:21:17,362 --> 01:21:18,403
So...

560
01:21:19,945 --> 01:21:22,196
Your second expedition, hm?

561
01:21:23,571 --> 01:21:24,697
17 ships...

562
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:28,155
and 1500 men?

563
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:30,031
Thanks to you.

564
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:34,032
This is Don Francisco
de Bobadilla.

565
01:21:34,178 --> 01:21:36,304
He can be valuable to you.

566
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:40,700
He's very well acquainted
with our laws.

567
01:21:50,014 --> 01:21:53,041
l heard you'd be
appointing Governors.

568
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:56,012
Will you consider
my application?

569
01:21:58,642 --> 01:22:00,600
Forgive me, Don Francisco.

570
01:22:00,684 --> 01:22:03,122
The positions are taken.

571
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:06,435
May l ask by whom?

572
01:22:09,311 --> 01:22:11,374
By two very competent men.

573
01:22:11,519 --> 01:22:14,510
l trust their men
of quality.

574
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:21,470
Francisco is qualified
for high administration.

575
01:22:21,897 --> 01:22:23,022
Well...

576
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,003
we do lack notaries.

577
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,441
You should contact
my administration.

578
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,348
Francisco is a judge.

579
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:36,901
Good...

580
01:22:37,443 --> 01:22:39,277
we also need judges.

581
01:22:39,652 --> 01:22:42,141
Except, there are no crimes as such.

582
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:46,153
l see l was mistaken.

583
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:51,217
He has no need for my services.

584
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,154
Sanchez.

585
01:22:57,614 --> 01:23:00,739
You have a special talent
for making enemies.

586
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,198
Why do l have
so many already?

587
01:23:10,242 --> 01:23:16,024
Don't you think to rise so high
in so short a time is
dangerous occupation?

588
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:33,810
Beatrix...

589
01:23:36,018 --> 01:23:40,947
l can arrange for the Queen
to take the boys into her service.

590
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:43,990
lt's a great honour,
Beatrix.

591
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:48,493
-We couldn't hope for anything better.
-Anything better?

592
01:23:48,561 --> 01:23:52,689
-Better than being with their mother?
-lt's not what l meant.

593
01:23:52,911 --> 01:23:55,292
What do you mean?
 /l'll be gone...

594
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:58,628
for several years.

595
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:01,691
 l have powerful
enemies at the court.

596
01:24:01,858 --> 01:24:05,608
The boys bear my name
and bear my titles.

597
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,400
This way they'll be untouchable.

598
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:11,558
And you'll be free to see them
whenever you please.

599
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:19,362
-You don't know what you're asking.
-l do.

600
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:26,156
l wish l could give
you another life.

601
01:24:31,823 --> 01:24:33,386
l am sorry.

602
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:36,115
Don't say that,
because you're not.

603
01:24:36,116 --> 01:24:39,637
You lead the life you chose
for yourself...

604
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,331
and l chose you.

605
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:10,477
You might have given us a choice.
l'm a map maker!

606
01:25:10,478 --> 01:25:15,396
And now you're Lieutenant-General
of the West lndies, Bartolome!

607
01:25:15,563 --> 01:25:18,813
He's just out of seminary
and can't use a sword.

608
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,605
Never touched a sword!

609
01:25:21,522 --> 01:25:23,356
You have time to learn.

610
01:25:24,356 --> 01:25:26,065
What are you complaining about?

611
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:32,232
You can live the way we dream of.

612
01:25:32,233 --> 01:25:33,994
l don't share your dreams.

613
01:25:35,651 --> 01:25:37,474
Do you refuse to help me?

614
01:25:38,318 --> 01:25:40,380
To help your brother?

615
01:25:42,027 --> 01:25:44,027
Are you going to desert me?

616
01:25:49,237 --> 01:25:53,238
You bastard!
You always had your own way.

617
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:56,572
l have always supported you.
/l know.

618
01:25:56,739 --> 01:25:58,822
l went to Portugal...
/l know!

619
01:25:58,823 --> 01:26:01,906
l'm the eldest!
/How could we forget?

620
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:04,199
You've said it enough.

621
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:09,867
Let me show you something.

622
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:14,576
Excellency...

623
01:26:15,034 --> 01:26:17,035
lt's about my son...

624
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:43,083
See...

625
01:26:43,749 --> 01:26:46,729
Now, you tell me,
who can l trust?

626
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:51,304
We're brothers. A bloodline.

627
01:26:51,543 --> 01:26:54,210
l need you. Both of you.

628
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:55,585
Admiral!

629
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:59,399
The horses are here.
This pair's magnificent!

630
01:27:00,003 --> 01:27:02,296
Send them Back!
/What?

631
01:27:03,088 --> 01:27:04,483
They're like mules!

632
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:09,796
l hope you did better with men!

633
01:27:09,797 --> 01:27:11,548
Who did we take on today?

634
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:16,965
30 blacksmiths. 28 halberdiers.
20 carpenters.

635
01:27:17,174 --> 01:27:18,507
100 farmers.

636
01:27:18,924 --> 01:27:20,341
20 miners.

637
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,592
And Doctor Chanca,
the royal surgeon.

638
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:27,572
Then we can count on royal health.

639
01:28:28,899 --> 01:28:29,941
Fire!

640
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:32,775
Fire again!

641
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:41,318
Where are they?

642
01:28:50,987 --> 01:28:53,655
Drummers, sound the advance!

643
01:29:45,869 --> 01:29:46,994
Almirante!

644
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:08,374
Juanito.

645
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,503
ls this your New World,
Almirante?

646
01:30:23,837 --> 01:30:26,585
We will teach these
animals savagery.

647
01:30:26,586 --> 01:30:30,045
Three heads for every life taken.
No mercy before God!

648
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:31,005
Vamonos!

649
01:30:31,213 --> 01:30:32,588
No Moxica!

650
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:34,954
We'll be no revenge.

651
01:30:42,799 --> 01:30:47,508
These were our cousins, our
friends, our countrymen.

652
01:30:48,008 --> 01:30:50,613
But you say no revenge?

653
01:30:51,509 --> 01:30:54,239
We will wash this in blood
and now!

654
01:30:56,176 --> 01:31:00,605
lf you want to keep your head
do as l say.

655
01:31:01,553 --> 01:31:03,095
l lost friends, too.

656
01:31:03,596 --> 01:31:06,096
39 brave men who trusted me.

657
01:31:07,096 --> 01:31:09,346
You want war?
Fine.

658
01:31:10,722 --> 01:31:13,514
We are 1000.
They outnumber us by 10.

659
01:31:14,973 --> 01:31:17,285
Who will you kill?
Which tribe?

660
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,828
We don't need to know.
/Moxica...

661
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:23,921
Try to remember
who you are talking to.

662
01:31:29,747 --> 01:31:31,705
We came here to stay.

663
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:33,957
Not to start a crusade.

664
01:31:34,373 --> 01:31:36,801
So, we will swallow our anger.

665
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,885
And in the name of those who died,

666
01:31:40,749 --> 01:31:43,855
we will accomplish
what we came for.

667
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:18,238
They're here.

668
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:10,959
There.

669
01:34:15,932 --> 01:34:18,724
Guarionex!
Ricardo!

670
01:34:19,932 --> 01:34:21,141
Arquebuses!

671
01:34:22,975 --> 01:34:23,934
Preparen!

672
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:44,480
Ask him.

673
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,481
What happened to my men?

674
01:34:52,607 --> 01:34:54,898
Warriors come from the sea.

675
01:34:54,899 --> 01:35:00,421
Caribes. Guarionex says...
All fled to the hills.

676
01:35:00,525 --> 01:35:01,984
When they came back

677
01:35:02,067 --> 01:35:04,453
all the Spaniards... had gone.

678
01:35:04,776 --> 01:35:06,715
God's mercy on them.

679
01:35:12,695 --> 01:35:15,136
The monkey's lying.

680
01:35:17,071 --> 01:35:19,030
You talk too much.

681
01:35:19,946 --> 01:35:23,280
Here they are.
We should kill them.

682
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:27,213
No... You'll do it my way.

683
01:35:30,886 --> 01:35:34,012
Tell him
we will not harm his people.

684
01:35:34,846 --> 01:35:37,753
Even though we have
the power to do it.

685
01:35:40,118 --> 01:35:42,244
l'm prepared to believe him.

686
01:35:43,244 --> 01:35:46,600
We will work with them
and we want peace.

687
01:35:48,246 --> 01:35:50,270
Ask if he understands.

688
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,815
He understands.

689
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,835
Will he help?

690
01:36:03,003 --> 01:36:05,673
He says you know the answer.

691
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:53,582
Moxica...
l need your horses.

692
01:38:54,124 --> 01:38:57,307
My horse does no work.

693
01:38:57,333 --> 01:39:02,384
-We all have to work, Moxica.
-Not my horse.

694
01:39:08,429 --> 01:39:09,973
Forgive me, Moxica.

695
01:39:11,807 --> 01:39:15,350
But it was your horse
that l was talking about.

696
01:39:30,566 --> 01:39:32,025
Thank you, Moxica.

697
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:50,950
Now...

698
01:39:52,242 --> 01:39:53,284
Heave!

699
01:41:48,863 --> 01:41:50,510
My dear sons...

700
01:41:52,489 --> 01:41:57,451
ln unbearable heat, we are building
the first city of the New World.

701
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:02,568
l brought the plans
of a Florentine architect,

702
01:42:02,703 --> 01:42:05,121
Leonardo... da Vinci.

703
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:10,039
God willing,
we will build his ideal city.

704
01:42:12,248 --> 01:42:15,241
We are adapting to the lndian diet.

705
01:42:15,876 --> 01:42:18,794
Meat is only a memory for us.

706
01:42:19,919 --> 01:42:24,337
But in a week, the mill
will be ready to produce of flour.

707
01:42:26,213 --> 01:42:29,006
Soon, we'll be eating bread.

708
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:33,374
Never again l'll never
underestimate it again.

709
01:42:33,426 --> 01:42:36,041
Nor the simple comforts of home.

710
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:40,845
You are always in my thoughts.

711
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:44,429
As ever, your Father.

712
01:43:39,852 --> 01:43:41,786
You want her?

713
01:43:45,187 --> 01:43:47,971
Then you can have her.

714
01:43:49,147 --> 01:43:51,939
To the New World,
my friend.

715
01:44:00,778 --> 01:44:02,726
To the Governor...

716
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:05,613
of the mosquitoes.

717
01:44:22,058 --> 01:44:23,641
She's a good cook.

718
01:44:31,354 --> 01:44:32,865
What meat is it?

719
01:44:35,773 --> 01:44:36,773
lguana.

720
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,401
What's wrong?
lt's lndian dish.

721
01:44:44,402 --> 01:44:45,799
l'm not an lndian.

722
01:44:46,111 --> 01:44:49,164
You know Christopher,
l think Giacomo is right.

723
01:44:49,362 --> 01:44:51,696
We can't live on corn and pepper.

724
01:44:51,697 --> 01:44:55,573
For the plantation,
we need black slaves.

725
01:44:55,781 --> 01:44:58,824
Everything rots
before it can be harvested.

726
01:44:59,407 --> 01:45:03,130
Have you noticed?
The horses and pigs multiply.

727
01:45:03,786 --> 01:45:07,829
They keep mounting each other...
Must be the heat.

728
01:45:08,829 --> 01:45:12,601
l must confess that the heat
has a similar effect on me.

729
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,668
You're both right.

730
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:23,148
But the fort must be finished
before the rains.

731
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:26,077
We must rely on our strengths.

732
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,942
What do you mean?

733
01:45:28,734 --> 01:45:31,599
Every able man must work.

734
01:45:33,235 --> 01:45:36,280
All of us.
lncluding nobility.

735
01:45:41,282 --> 01:45:43,918
They're exempt, Christopher.

736
01:45:45,033 --> 01:45:48,159
Well... Now they won't be.

737
01:46:34,618 --> 01:46:35,577
Next.

738
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:37,202
Name?

739
01:47:09,134 --> 01:47:10,968
Name?
/Colpa.

740
01:47:14,804 --> 01:47:16,847
What's he saying?

741
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:18,889
He's found none.

742
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:22,489
Why? Ask him why!

743
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:26,204
Stop him! Bring him back!

744
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:35,101
Hasn't found any.

745
01:47:49,437 --> 01:47:51,834
He's lying. Tell him...

746
01:47:52,918 --> 01:47:56,873
to put his hand on the table.
Like this.

747
01:48:01,337 --> 01:48:02,483
Tell them...

748
01:48:04,255 --> 01:48:07,216
l know they are hiding
the gold from us.

749
01:48:13,593 --> 01:48:14,844
And tell them...

750
01:48:16,052 --> 01:48:19,052
this is how we treat
thieves and liars.

751
01:48:19,053 --> 01:48:21,692
Don Adrian,
you cannot do this thing.

752
01:48:21,723 --> 01:48:23,307
l can't?

753
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:29,309
l can.

754
01:48:41,403 --> 01:48:44,196
Your act of brutality
has created chaos.

755
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:51,042
All the tribes are now
joining forces against us.

756
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:55,493
All of that because of your
criminal savagery.

757
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:59,672
Savagery...
is what monkeys understand.

758
01:49:01,037 --> 01:49:05,662
You should have done the same
a long time ago, Don Cristobal.

759
01:49:05,663 --> 01:49:09,519
Your ways... don't work.

760
01:49:11,751 --> 01:49:15,783
You'll be put in detention,
deprived of privileges,

761
01:49:15,836 --> 01:49:19,764
until you are sent to Spain
for judgement.

762
01:49:19,795 --> 01:49:21,577
Have anything to say?

763
01:49:34,761 --> 01:49:37,220
For four years now...

764
01:49:38,262 --> 01:49:39,429
we've been here.

765
01:49:40,221 --> 01:49:44,555
We stayed here four years

766
01:49:45,725 --> 01:49:48,413
because we believed
your promises.

767
01:49:49,434 --> 01:49:51,435
But we find neither gold

768
01:49:52,227 --> 01:49:55,561
nor your earthly paradise.

769
01:50:11,944 --> 01:50:13,757
You and your brothers...

770
01:50:15,612 --> 01:50:17,320
have failed.

771
01:50:19,407 --> 01:50:23,700
Senor... Colombo!

772
01:50:45,334 --> 01:50:48,450
Don Giacomo, come at once!
/What's happening?

773
01:50:48,543 --> 01:50:51,471
ln the mine!
Get Don Christopher!

774
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:00,557
Cut him down!

775
01:52:05,329 --> 01:52:07,497
Cut the ropes!

776
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:15,449
Moxica's right.

777
01:52:15,689 --> 01:52:18,679
Your ways don't work.

778
01:52:18,836 --> 01:52:20,472
We have to find them.

779
01:52:21,545 --> 01:52:22,545
Did you hear me?

780
01:52:23,421 --> 01:52:25,057
You have to find them!

781
01:52:25,463 --> 01:52:26,797
You see what they did?

782
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:30,256
You did the same
to your God.

783
01:52:35,885 --> 01:52:37,427
You know them?

784
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:46,430
Goohooni. Goohooni.

785
01:55:33,986 --> 01:55:35,529
Charge!

786
01:56:07,564 --> 01:56:09,775
Stop!

787
01:59:59,128 --> 02:00:00,420
Fire!

788
02:02:27,267 --> 02:02:28,351
Moxica.

789
02:02:58,912 --> 02:03:00,121
You know...

790
02:03:00,746 --> 02:03:03,455
what will be said about this
in Spain...

791
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:06,289
don't you?

792
02:03:18,754 --> 02:03:20,754
You are nothing.

793
02:03:22,547 --> 02:03:26,967
Your bastards
will never inherit your titles.

794
02:03:27,175 --> 02:03:28,801
No...

795
02:03:30,426 --> 02:03:31,760
We...

796
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:36,220
We are everything.

797
02:03:39,763 --> 02:03:42,266
We are immortal.

798
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:14,280
Bastard!

799
02:05:58,886 --> 02:06:00,928
Don Christopher...

800
02:06:05,346 --> 02:06:07,410
l wish to return to Spain.

801
02:06:08,347 --> 02:06:10,431
l have no desire to remain...

802
02:06:11,057 --> 02:06:12,872
in this Godless place.

803
02:06:13,935 --> 02:06:15,268
They are criminals.

804
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:18,453
They have a debt towards Spain.

805
02:06:18,454 --> 02:06:21,353
Moxica paid. They will pay, too.

806
02:06:21,354 --> 02:06:23,938
l don't understand you,
Don Christopher.

807
02:06:24,897 --> 02:06:28,107
You treat Christians equally
with heathen savages.

808
02:06:28,108 --> 02:06:30,484
And what do you
offer in return?

809
02:06:33,777 --> 02:06:36,069
A New World, Buyl.

810
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:39,779
No one wants one.

811
02:06:40,862 --> 02:06:42,238
Only you.

812
02:06:42,613 --> 02:06:44,280
Not only me.

813
02:06:45,283 --> 02:06:46,199
Look at them.

814
02:06:46,866 --> 02:06:49,919
They could go back
to their families.

815
02:06:50,701 --> 02:06:51,910
But they stay.

816
02:06:52,243 --> 02:06:55,828
They want something new.
A new world.

817
02:06:58,912 --> 02:06:59,996
l'll be leave...

818
02:07:01,163 --> 02:07:02,999
on the next ship.

819
02:07:03,707 --> 02:07:05,833
Leave if you please but...

820
02:07:07,625 --> 02:07:12,960
your departure won't help me
make this place more Godly.

821
02:07:30,385 --> 02:07:34,136
Perhaps hope only exists
in the journey, Giacomo.

822
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:38,390
At beginning
everything's possible.

823
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:41,266
Every expectation, every dream.

824
02:07:42,099 --> 02:07:45,974
No one expected this to be easy.

825
02:07:45,976 --> 02:07:48,518
This isn't how l imagined
it to be, Christopher.

826
02:07:49,977 --> 02:07:52,938
Marchena was right, Bartolome.

827
02:07:59,149 --> 02:08:03,191
Paradise and Hell
both can be earthly.

828
02:08:03,192 --> 02:08:06,224
We carry them
wherever we go.

829
02:09:57,244 --> 02:09:58,286
Utopan!

830
02:10:00,954 --> 02:10:01,954
Speak to me!

831
02:10:02,829 --> 02:10:05,864
You never learned
to speak my language.

832
02:12:38,976 --> 02:12:43,373
Your Majesty, here are the true
facts concerning the island
of Hispaniola.

833
02:12:44,228 --> 02:12:46,991
The activity of your
servant Columbus,

834
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:49,417
Admiral of the Oceans
and Governor of the

835
02:12:50,292 --> 02:12:54,442
the truth he now presides
over a state of chaos,

836
02:12:54,608 --> 02:12:58,110
of degradation and of madness.

837
02:12:59,256 --> 02:13:04,320
From beginning He had shown
he was incapable of managing
the islands

838
02:13:04,674 --> 02:13:09,053
he appointed his brothers
very important positions,

839
02:13:09,094 --> 02:13:13,282
injuring the pride and dignity
of nobles.

840
02:13:13,283 --> 02:13:15,472
He promised to build a city.

841
02:13:15,492 --> 02:13:18,576
lsabel, after Your Majesty.

842
02:13:18,577 --> 02:13:21,285
A group of mud huts
in the wrong place,

843
02:13:21,286 --> 02:13:24,631
swept away
by the rains and mud.

844
02:13:25,308 --> 02:13:26,957
He promised gold,

845
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,706
not finding the amounts he promised.

846
02:13:29,707 --> 02:13:34,834
He has since commanded
the lndians to pay a tax...

847
02:13:35,834 --> 02:13:38,585
a monthly tribute of gold.

848
02:13:38,648 --> 02:13:43,547
Most being unable to, we find,
have been punished

849
02:13:44,548 --> 02:13:46,007
or massacred.

850
02:13:49,091 --> 02:13:52,811
Columbus forced nobility
to hard labour,

851
02:13:53,092 --> 02:13:56,259
treating them equally with lndians.

852
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:59,095
He reduced them into his slaves.

853
02:13:59,096 --> 02:14:02,556
When Adrian de Moxica
protested against this,

854
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:04,848
he was executed.

855
02:14:05,473 --> 02:14:07,348
ls this true, Brother Buyl?

856
02:14:07,349 --> 02:14:08,933
Yes, Your Excellency.

857
02:14:09,058 --> 02:14:14,133
These all true. All of it.
l saw it. With my own eyes.

858
02:14:15,313 --> 02:14:16,816
Well...

859
02:14:17,108 --> 02:14:18,879
He promised a Paradise.

860
02:14:24,527 --> 02:14:25,986
He failed.

861
02:14:27,611 --> 02:14:29,445
He must be replaced.

862
02:14:30,987 --> 02:14:32,446
lmmediately.

863
02:14:35,032 --> 02:14:39,117
And who would you think of
for such a task?

864
02:14:41,451 --> 02:14:43,473
l am thinking of a man.

865
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:48,068
A man devoted to Your Majesties.

866
02:14:48,474 --> 02:14:52,625
A man extremely motivated.

867
02:15:32,933 --> 02:15:34,433
Excellency, l'm sorry.

868
02:15:37,393 --> 02:15:40,396
Don Francisco de Bobadilla.

869
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:45,689
Yes... l remember.

870
02:15:46,731 --> 02:15:48,982
My letters of appointment.

871
02:15:57,653 --> 02:16:00,613
l am the new Viceroy
of the lndies.

872
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:02,572
Congratulations.

873
02:16:04,197 --> 02:16:07,000
Then l can search for
the mainland?

874
02:16:07,823 --> 02:16:10,657
The mainland was discovered
weeks ago.

875
02:16:10,658 --> 02:16:12,231
By another ltalian.

876
02:16:16,662 --> 02:16:19,110
Amerigo Vespucci,
Excellency.

877
02:16:31,419 --> 02:16:32,753
How far?

878
02:16:33,128 --> 02:16:38,609
l'm no seaman, but l heard
it's no more than a week at sea.

879
02:16:40,463 --> 02:16:43,131
l hope not too
disappointed.

880
02:16:46,384 --> 02:16:47,905
How could l be?

881
02:16:50,052 --> 02:16:55,262
The mainland has been found
exactly as l said it would.

882
02:17:00,555 --> 02:17:04,205
l'm afraid this isn't
the worst news.

883
02:17:15,409 --> 02:17:19,376


884
02:17:47,815 --> 02:17:48,815
Diego?

885
02:17:49,774 --> 02:17:51,191
Father.

886
02:17:54,111 --> 02:17:56,362
Fernando.

887
02:17:57,049 --> 02:17:58,008
Oh, my God!

888
02:18:00,821 --> 02:18:02,072
A man?

889
02:18:02,989 --> 02:18:04,135
How did this happen?

890
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:08,491
Diego.

891
02:18:17,902 --> 02:18:19,645
Don't worry.

892
02:18:19,646 --> 02:18:21,814
We're going to get you out.

893
02:18:21,815 --> 02:18:24,164
Santangel's going to the Queen.
/Good.

894
02:18:24,165 --> 02:18:26,207
Good.

895
02:18:27,751 --> 02:18:29,900
l'll go back when they free me.

896
02:18:29,901 --> 02:18:31,786
This time with me.

897
02:18:33,039 --> 02:18:35,753
ln your present state
it is madness, Father.

898
02:18:35,754 --> 02:18:38,974
You needn't come with us.

899
02:18:43,416 --> 02:18:44,610
Diego.

900
02:18:46,354 --> 02:18:48,213
Diego.

901
02:19:49,904 --> 02:19:51,810
Rise, please.

902
02:20:01,043 --> 02:20:02,260
Now...

903
02:20:03,356 --> 02:20:05,648
l do look older than you.

904
02:20:12,944 --> 02:20:18,916
l have looked for a reason why
l should allow you to go back.

905
02:20:18,988 --> 02:20:22,573
And though l tried
l could not find one.

906
02:20:24,355 --> 02:20:26,476
Help me find one.

907
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:37,286
All my life l have dreamed
of reaching the continent.

908
02:20:37,338 --> 02:20:41,921
l thought my dreams...
grandiose.

909
02:20:44,195 --> 02:20:48,981
But reality was beyond
my expectations.

910
02:20:49,039 --> 02:20:50,706
Far beyond.

911
02:20:54,276 --> 02:20:55,604
And now...

912
02:20:59,025 --> 02:21:02,174
l want to explore that land.

913
02:21:10,077 --> 02:21:12,369
Before l die.

914
02:21:27,612 --> 02:21:28,765
l allow you...

915
02:21:31,403 --> 02:21:33,712
to undertake another voyage.

916
02:21:34,632 --> 02:21:35,718
Thank you.

917
02:21:37,464 --> 02:21:39,524
But without your brothers.

918
02:21:40,805 --> 02:21:42,772
You can't go to Santo Domingo

919
02:21:42,824 --> 02:21:44,497
or the other colonies.

920
02:21:46,681 --> 02:21:48,336
The New World...

921
02:21:49,332 --> 02:21:51,624
is a disaster.

922
02:21:56,961 --> 02:22:00,023
And the old one...
an achievement?

923
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:39,699
l know...

924
02:22:40,081 --> 02:22:42,936
l shouldn't tolerate
his impertinence.

925
02:22:45,547 --> 02:22:47,006
Then why?

926
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:52,485
Because he's not afraid of me.

927
02:22:56,874 --> 02:22:58,207
Sanchez!

928
02:23:08,628 --> 02:23:11,130
You're a dreamer.

929
02:23:17,660 --> 02:23:19,744
Look out there.

930
02:23:23,746 --> 02:23:25,311
What do you see?

931
02:23:32,117 --> 02:23:37,271
l see towers.
l see palaces, l see steeples.

932
02:23:38,515 --> 02:23:40,599
l see civilisation.

933
02:23:42,238 --> 02:23:45,168
And l see spires that reach...

934
02:23:45,613 --> 02:23:47,178
to the sky!

935
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:55,949
All created by people like me.

936
02:23:56,865 --> 02:23:59,366
No matter how long you live,

937
02:24:00,750 --> 02:24:03,607
one thing will never change
between us.

938
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:07,304
l did it.

939
02:24:09,243 --> 02:24:10,809
You didn't.

940
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,312
You're so beautiful.

941
02:25:37,177 --> 02:25:42,035
l can't believe another man
has never taken you from me.

942
02:25:42,376 --> 02:25:45,919
They tried...
but l didn't let them.

943
02:25:52,353 --> 02:25:54,122
They took everything.

944
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:57,241
Not everything.

945
02:25:59,175 --> 02:26:01,165
You think l care?

946
02:26:02,546 --> 02:26:04,806
l'm a free man again.

947
02:26:06,459 --> 02:26:10,732
Riches don't make a man rich,
they only make him busier.

948
02:26:15,337 --> 02:26:18,064
God!
How much l've missed you.

949
02:26:21,341 --> 02:26:26,006
By the Grace of God
and Your Beneficient Majesty,

950
02:26:26,048 --> 02:26:30,155
a new continent has now
been found and claimed

951
02:26:30,181 --> 02:26:36,134
 in the name of the Spanish
Crown, in the year 1492.

952
02:26:37,392 --> 02:26:39,831
As Your Majesty is aware,

953
02:26:40,944 --> 02:26:43,094
the University of Salamanca

954
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:46,825
has always defended the theory

955
02:26:46,932 --> 02:26:51,641
of the existence
of unknown territories to the west.

956
02:26:54,019 --> 02:26:58,406
The surest route to the continent
is now firmly established.

957
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:04,399
West by south-west for 750 leagues
to Santo Domingo.

958
02:27:04,878 --> 02:27:05,993
From there...

959
02:27:06,383 --> 02:27:11,037
west-north-west from San Juan
to the north,

960
02:27:11,063 --> 02:27:16,658
reaching the island of Hispaniola
on the Cape of San Raphael.

961
02:27:17,059 --> 02:27:22,962
Then onto the mainland
at Cape Gracias A Dios.

962
02:27:23,474 --> 02:27:27,226
Spain, by Your Majesty's grace,

963
02:27:27,581 --> 02:27:31,174
has confirmed for all humanity,

964
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:34,567
the existence of a New World.

965
02:27:35,132 --> 02:27:39,414
Terra lncognita.

966
02:27:40,379 --> 02:27:43,863
lt was discovered by a mariner

967
02:27:43,864 --> 02:27:46,467
commissioned by Your Majesty.

968
02:27:46,468 --> 02:27:48,122
His name...

969
02:27:50,191 --> 02:27:54,089
Amerigo Vespucci.

970
02:28:32,646 --> 02:28:33,863
Sanchez...

971
02:28:44,731 --> 02:28:47,839
What a tragedy.
What a waste of a life.

972
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:50,827
A waste?

973
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:54,432
lf your name or mine
is ever remembered...

974
02:28:55,575 --> 02:28:58,972
it will only be because of his.

975
02:29:17,728 --> 02:29:20,143
Diego is at court
with Santangel hoping

976
02:29:20,144 --> 02:29:23,995
to get your privileges restored.

977
02:29:23,996 --> 02:29:25,569
But how is he?

978
02:29:26,958 --> 02:29:31,491
He wants to start a pearl trade
in Santo Domingo.

979
02:29:31,544 --> 02:29:35,388
He has received many letters
from your men.

980
02:29:35,389 --> 02:29:37,234
He sent some of them.

981
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:43,534
This one's from Mendez.
/Mendez?

982
02:29:43,551 --> 02:29:44,768
What does he say?

983
02:29:47,315 --> 02:29:51,274
He asks to visit you.
He left his address.

984
02:29:52,703 --> 02:29:57,382
He never had one.
Except aboard my ships.

985
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:04,532
l want you to tell me
everything you remember, Father.

986
02:30:04,533 --> 02:30:08,771
l wouldn't know where to start.

987
02:30:09,006 --> 02:30:12,706
Tell me the first thing
that comes to mind.

988
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:40,354
l remember...

989
02:31:01,862 --> 02:31:04,798
ln 1502, Columbus made a final trip
to the New World with Fernando.

990
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:07,769
They reached Panama where
the lndians told them of
the Pacific Ocean.

991
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:10,678
His son's biography gave Columbus
his rightful place in history.

992
02:31:10,679 --> 02:31:13,639
ln 1992, one of his descendants
is Honorary Admiral of
