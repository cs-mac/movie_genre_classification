1
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:52,618
     -A comic strip, to me,
           is a story

2
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,687
     And a real brief story.

3
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,290
It's like having the opportunity

4
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:03,629
          To get a peek
 into people, characters' lives.

5
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:07,800
  And they can make you laugh.
     They can make you cry.

6
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:11,070
They just have an impact on you.

7
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:15,507
 For the time that you read it,
    it's a world unto itself.

8
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,590
    -My mom was always trying
       to get me to read,

9
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:36,395
 And I wasn't really into books
   with "words," so to speak.

10
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,098
  -My dad brought home a couple
  of "calvin and hobbes" books.

11
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,701
  -And he showed me some comic
 strips of "calvin and hobbes,"

12
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,470
     And I was like, "whoa!"

13
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,839
       -And I can remember
         opening it up,

14
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,442
  I turned the page, and hobbes
     wanted me to have this.

15
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,545
     And from that point on,
 it was me, calvin, and hobbes.

16
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,815
    -I met calvin and hobbes
    in the paper, I think,
    the way most people did.

17
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,584
  -Looking through the comics,

18
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,619
     And "calvin and hobbes"
 was always one that stood out.

19
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,155
  -My grandmother is a huge fan
     of "calvin and hobbes."

20
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,492
   -My first and only crime --
     I shoplifted this book.

21
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,193
          [ chuckles ]

22
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,896
     -And I found this book
of "complete calvin and hobbes."

23
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,866
       It was in english,
   but I said, "I don't care.

24
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:17,202
 I'm gonna learn this language
 just to understand this book."

25
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,470
       -I was babysitting,

26
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,739
    And a couple of the kids
         that I babysat,

27
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,141
      They had some books.

28
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,542
 -All the books got passed to me

29
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,444
     And ended up in my room
           for awhile.

30
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,679
 You know, we'd be trading them
         back and forth.

31
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,214
-I hadn't seen the strip before,

32
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,183
       But I saw the book
         in a bookstore.

33
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,152
-And it was on sale. It was like
   $3 or something like that.

34
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,786
   So I was like, "all right.
        I'll look at it."

35
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,756
  Pulled it open, and the first
  thing I saw was the snowmen.

36
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,391
    -And I burst out laughing

37
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,760
 And proceeded to get in trouble
        in english class.

38
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,663
  -I remember just reading that
  thing over and over and over.

39
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,367
    -Even now, I reread them,
 and I continue to reread them.

40
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:53,372
 I discover so many layers now,
 and it's never boring or old.

41
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,806
 It's just like a living thing,

42
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,675
     And I just discover it
     and appreciate it more.

43
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,810
     -Calvin is like the kid
    you want to be, you know?

44
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,280
             Even if
  you're a 300-pound black kid,

45
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,549
             I mean,
  you still want to be calvin.

46
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,420
    -I   <i>di</i>want to be calvin.

47
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,889
    I felt like I <i>was</i> calvin.

48
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,892
   We were both six years old
            in 1985.

49
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,563
     We liked tigers, space,
      playing in the snow,

50
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,199
           Had fathers
  who loved building character,

51
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,767
  And I took pride in the fact

52
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,670
     That my first hairstyle
     was quite calvin-esque.

53
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,472
        But the truth is
  that I don't really remember

54
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,575
        When I first met
       calvin and hobbes.

55
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,277
I'd like to think I was a reader
          from day one,

56
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,213
 But I know that isn't possible.

57
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,782
  My hometown newspaper didn't
  even start carrying the strip

58
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,218
      Until spring of 1988.

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,787
       The earliest memory
  that I can stamp with a date

60
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,489
      Would be third grade
   in mrs. Smith's classroom,

61
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,825
           When I saw
a "calvin and hobbes" collection

62
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,594
 In the scholastic book catalog.

63
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,462
   But if I examine my books,

64
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,332
    I find that the only one
     with a scholastic logo

65
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,634
     Is "scientific progress
         goes 'boink,'"

66
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,670
    With a copyright of 1991.

67
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,306
      If I didn't discover
      "calvin and hobbes"

68
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,343
    Until that late in life,
    I'm secretly embarrassed.

69
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,545
        And I would also
        blame my parents.

70
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,948
        -That little boy
     seemed kind of naughty,

71
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,817
        And I didn't know

72
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,855
  If I wanted my son interested
  in a naughty comic character.

73
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,524
          -Apparently,
      no thanks to my mom,

74
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,594
        Calvin and hobbes
     were just always there,

75
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,964
And I don't really remember life
          without them.

76
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,571
 I may have fallen in love with
 "calvin and hobbes" as a kid,

77
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,439
         But it's one of
        those rare things

78
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,376
     That still holds great
 significance to me as an adult.

79
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:40,379
     I really can't think of
 anything else from my childhood

80
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,547
That has retained so much value.

81
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,617
  I don't claim to be an expert
          on comics --

82
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,818
       I'm not even close.

83
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,620
    I never read comic books,

84
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,757
  I haven't read the newspaper
  comics regularly for years,

85
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,593
 And I've only recently started
      to reacquaint myself

86
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,396
      With what the comics
       have to offer now.

87
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:00,999
But for years, I read and reread
  my "calvin and hobbes" books,

88
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,036
          Which always
     put a smile on my face.

89
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,904
          And the strip
       still holds meaning

90
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,340
    For so many other readers
        around the world.

91
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,542
             I know
  because I've heard from them,

92
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,644
       And they've sent me
         their stories.

93
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,781
     Many people have tried
  to track down bill watterson

94
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,349
         Over the years.

95
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,918
    But I'm not so interested
       in the man himself

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,322
 But why his simple comic strip
    about a boy and his tiger

97
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,490
 Could somehow have such meaning

98
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,027
  And have had such a personal
    impact on so many people.

99
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,630
         Just as people
    often find it a challenge

100
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,865
  To describe the strip itself,

101
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,867
             I think
 anybody would have a hard time

102
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,503
   Distilling the ingredients
    that made it what it is.

103
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,906
       But we can be sure
         of one thing --

104
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,575
      On November 18, 1985,

105
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,811
    Bill watterson's creation
             debuted

106
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,813
 In just a few dozen newspapers,

107
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,749
 And it left an enormous imprint
      on countless readers

108
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,051
     From across the globe.

109
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,024
      -Well, the very first
  "calvin and hobbes" strip --

110
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,927
           Calvin off
     to check his tiger trap

111
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,730
        That he rigged up
   with a tuna fish sandwich,

112
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,532
        And sure enough,
       in the last frame,

113
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,702
       We see that hobbes
    has fallen for the bait,

114
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,873
     And he has his very own
     tiger friend for life.

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,977
      And that is our intro
     to "calvin and hobbes."

116
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,379
     -I've never met anyone

117
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,114
        Who doesn't like
      "calvin and hobbes."

118
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,516
      So, I can't say that
     about any other strip.

119
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,618
   And there are other strips
  that are very, very popular,

120
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,819
        Very successful.

121
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,154
     Most people love them,

122
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,490
        But, invariably,
I'll run into someone that says,

123
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,858
 "I just don't get that strip,"

124
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,793
    Or, "I really don't like
          that strip."

125
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,028
    With "calvin and hobbes,"
         it's different.

126
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,931
   It just seems to appeal to
   all different audiences --

127
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,633
 Young and old and men and women

128
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,136
   And people in the country,
       people in the city.

129
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,471
         I mean, really,
     just all demographics.

130
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,874
  It seems to speak to people.

131
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,777
 -Everyone, you know, is united
 by their love for this strip,

132
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,579
   But everyone has a specific
  thing that they love about it

133
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,715
       Or specific things
    that they love about it.

134
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,183
          And it's not
     always the same thing.

135
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,652
        -Well, I grew up
   in a mexican neighborhood.

136
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,422
   I went to a white school,
   and I was like 300 pounds,

137
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,757
   So I didn't really fit in,
     but neither did calvin,

138
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,993
           And, like,
   it wasn't really a problem.

139
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,162
    He was just, "I'm weird,
    and that's the way I am,

140
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,830
       And that's the way
         I'm gonna be."

141
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,665
           And I think
    that's one of the things

142
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,967
That really kind of attracted me
        to the character.

143
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,469
  -What really resonated to me

144
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,204
Was the whole imagination aspect
              of it

145
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,573
   And how he just created it
          in his head,

146
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,742
     And he didn't even see
  his teacher or his principal.

147
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,745
     He just saw saw aliens,
   and he was spaceman spiff.

148
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,581
       -It's a very deep,
  very philosophical experience

149
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,683
             Reading
   a "calvin and hobbes" book,

150
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,919
  Even though, on the surface,
     they're just cartoons.

151
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,122
 -He's really created characters
         that, I think,

152
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,926
     Have a lot of depth and
 are interesting to read about.

153
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,062
      -"calvin and hobbes"
   is such a subversive comic.

154
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,666
    But it has a purity to it
     that most comics don't,

155
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,000
     Because it is so joyful

156
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,570
And very much in the imagination
          of this kid,

157
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,639
    And yet he is hyperaware
         of world events

158
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,909
   And pop culture and ironies
      and social concepts,

159
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,779
      And I just found that
    really, really exciting.

160
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,115
 -My mom died about 11 years ago
       of a heart attack,

161
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,719
  And my husband is a huge fan
     of "calvin and hobbes,"

162
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,120
         So he had a lot
  of the paperback collections

163
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,889
    Laying around the house,

164
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,992
  And I would just sit at night
     and look through those.

165
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,962
  And that's how I came to know
       "calvin and hobbes"

166
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,764
  Is through those first three
or four months after she passed.

167
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,901
    It's just finding a place
         to laugh again.

168
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,970
      -So I moved down here
    in this brand-new state,

169
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,072
     This brand-new house,
     brand-new neighborhood,
     and I knew nobody.

170
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,274
 So I was looking for something

171
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,544
      To gravitate towards
       or associate with,

172
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,881
 And "calvin and hobbes" became
   something I could bond with

173
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,783
        On a daily basis
 when the newspaper would come.

174
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,186
-I didn't understand, sometimes,

175
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,189
        The significance
       of his statements,

176
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,059
    But that really pushed me
          into research

177
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,963
    And go to the dictionary
 or really looking for meaning.

178
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,899
 -It's one of those things that,

179
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,568
        When you find it,
      you want to share it.

180
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,271
         And as soon as
     he could start reading,

181
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,606
 I wanted to give him the books.

182
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,808
     And just like I thought
           it would --

183
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,243
    I mean, there's times now

184
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,879
    Where he'll be reading it
         in his bedroom,

185
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,781
And I'll just hear him laughing.

186
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,551
    And just that simple act
      of hearing him laugh

187
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,754
  As I know what he's reading,
    it's like, "there you go.

188
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,023
 That's what I was hoping for."

189
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,059
    -I don't know if you know
  how israel was in 2002, 2001.

190
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,260
      It was pretty crazy.

191
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,762
    You opened the newspaper,

192
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,864
   And you saw another bombing
           every day.

193
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,198
     It was really intense.

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,868
       So I looked forward
       to the Sunday paper

195
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,070
             Because
    they would run the strip,

196
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,906
    And I'd cut them out and
 would hang them up on my wall.

197
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,909
        Even if there was
something horrible in the paper,

198
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,246
   I would still get my smile
and, you know, that good feeling

199
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,115
     From just reading that.

200
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:51,256
 It just relieves the stress of
 living in that kind of a world.

201
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,125
     When we need something
         to smile about,

202
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,095
        You just pull out
     one of the old comics,

203
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,299
      And you just read it,
     and it brings you back.

204
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,937
And that's the beauty of comics,
      especially "calvin."

205
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,739
          [ chuckles ]

206
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,611
        -For those of you
       who don't know him,

207
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,212
     Calvin is a 6-year-old

208
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,682
       Who some might call
    a bit of a troublemaker.

209
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,352
          But he's also
     extremely intelligent,

210
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:24,756
   With an endless imagination
and an incredible lust for life.

211
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,926
     Hobbes is his ballast,
      his voice of reason,

212
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,296
       His coconspirator,
      and loyal companion.

213
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:36,067
  There's mom and dad, susie,
  rosalyn, moe, mrs. Wormwood,

214
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,303
   And a few other characters.

215
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,839
      But nobody else sees
      and understand hobbes

216
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,273
      The way calvin does,

217
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:47,012
    And it seems the reverse
   is probably true, as well.

218
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,313
   -If I actually met someone

219
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,948
       Who had never read
      "calvin and hobbes,"

220
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,416
 Which does occasionally happen,

221
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,152
  I would probably immediately
       just go to my desk,

222
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,688
    Pull a book off, and say,
        "here, take this.

223
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,990
          [ chuckling ]
  this will change your life."

224
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,726
 It's so hard to just sum it up,

225
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:05,764
       Other than to say,
   "this is every one of us."

226
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,833
-Certainly, it's a family strip.
       It's a kids' strip.

227
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,670
         In some senses,
 it's a gag-a-day kind of strip.

228
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,271
            You know,
  there's always a punch line,

229
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,173
  Some kind of gag at the end.

230
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,942
  But in other ways, I think it
 transcends all of those things,

231
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,178
  Because there is a little bit
      of philosophy in it.

232
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,214
      There's a little bit
  of commentary about society.

233
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,916
           Certainly,
    there is a lot of humor.

234
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,384
            You know,
    it's a very funny strip.

235
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,455
     So it really, I think,
     defies categorization.

236
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,890
          [ chuckles ]

237
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,392
-There have been a lot of strips
            out there

238
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,960
     About younger people --

239
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,263
            You know,
     "dennis the menace" --

240
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,733
    A whole school of strips
    that try to recall youth

241
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:46,271
 And make it relevant to readers
     across different ages.

242
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,175
         But bill's take
   was so fresh and so simple.

243
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,711
   Here he just took this idea

244
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,181
    And just blew it up into
  this wonderful relationship.

245
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,083
       It's the only strip
       we've ever launched

246
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,952
 That we had editors who hadn't
seen it yet, calling us, saying,

247
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,888
     "hey, we've heard about
     this thing called
     'calvin and hobbes.'

248
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,724
       We want to be sure
       we get to see it."

249
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,492
     -I was just blown away
          immediately.

250
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,395
   It was one of those things
  that was so much fun to read.

251
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,930
    It drew me in right then.

252
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,065
           I remember
  getting to the end of the set

253
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,234
          And thinking,
    "where is the rest of it?

254
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,936
   I want more. I want more."

255
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,504
        -Here was a strip

256
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,407
   That was much better-drawn
  than anything in the papers,

257
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,809
            That had
   a really fresh perspective,

258
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,045
      And it just took off.

259
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,981
    Within less than a year,
   calvin was taunting susie.

260
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,250
         He was playing
    at being spaceman spiff.

261
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,519
I think it was within the first
year that he started g.R.O.S.S.,

262
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,490
 The get rid of slimy girls club
        in his tree fort.

263
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,992
      And when you look at
          other strips,

264
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,795
  It generally takes an artist
           much longer

265
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:48,066
 To reach that kind of maturity
 and that kind of understanding

266
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,903
   Of who his characters are,
   what their strengths are,

267
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,106
     What their potential is
 for humor and for interaction.

268
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,943
  And watterson just, you know,
   had the penning equivalent

269
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,045
 Of hitting the ground running.

270
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,901
      -This was my bedroom
        when I was a kid.

271
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,270
  When I was like 10 years old,

272
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,106
My brother moved to another room
          in the house,

273
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,175
    And this became my room,

274
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,545
           And my dad
   put in this corkboard wall.

275
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,881
     And I had it plastered
           with things

276
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,051
    That sort of represented
           who I was.

277
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,287
       And the main thing

278
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,256
     Was "calvin and hobbes"
         Sunday strips.

279
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,858
 I would get the Sunday paper --

280
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
          Dailies, too,
    but mostly the Sunday --

281
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,129
           And I'd go,
    and I'd get it right away

282
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,031
And cut out "calvin and hobbes,"

283
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,166
         And it would go
       right on the wall.

284
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,468
      And even at the end,

285
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,005
        Like the ceiling,
      like all along here,

286
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,042
    This was all comic strips
       like the whole way

287
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,444
   And even on the other side.

288
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,913
            Oh, man.

289
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,884
    Just plastered, plastered
    with "calvin and hobbes."

290
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,289
           -You know,
  calvin's world is just huge.

291
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,624
        It doesn't stop.

292
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,159
    There was spaceman spiff.

293
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,528
        There was susie.
     There were the snowmen.

294
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,929
   -I loved the snowmen stuff.

295
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,498
   I loved the dinosaur stuff,
            totally.

296
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,969
    -He turns into the t. Rex
        at recess a lot.

297
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,503
 And then he's going...[ roars ]

298
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,106
-Well, there were the snowballs,
     as well as the snowmen.

299
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,341
    -Oh, and then there were

300
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,642
    The mutant-killer-monster
           snow dudes,

301
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,177
   And that just cracks me up.

302
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,412
    -Oh, and then they're in
    the infamous red wagon.

303
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,214
  -There he was getting jumped
           by hobbes.

304
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,650
    -Monsters under the bed.
    -Tracer bullet.

305
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,152
       -And you see him in
black-and-white with the hat on,

306
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,321
    And, "the dame walked in.
      She was hysterical."

307
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,190
 -He'd go on a space adventure.

308
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,958
  -And the time-machine parts.

309
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,393
        -Stupendous man.

310
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,595
   -"safari al." [ chuckles ]

311
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,964
         -Then you have
       the transmogrifier,

312
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,499
   When he duplicates himself.

313
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,135
    -There was g.R.O.S.S.
    -Get rid of slimy girls.

314
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,604
 -Calvin going with his parents
 on vacation and going camping.

315
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,140
  -Those soap-opera-esque ones.

316
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,643
-He would draw like "mary worth"
      or "rex morgan, m.D."

317
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,578
  Or some ultrarealistic comic.

318
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,381
 -One of my favorites, actually,
        with the teacher

319
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,117
   Is, he's in the classroom,
      he's doing whatever,

320
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,485
    The teacher calls on him,

321
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,186
  And he's imagining, you know,

322
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,255
    That he's being sentenced
            to death,

323
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,225
And he runs out of the classroom
      and hides in a cave.

324
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,161
    And you see just his eyes
 and, you know, a black screen,

325
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,131
And he says, "what's the smell?"
     or "what's that noise?"

326
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,034
      And, all of a sudden,
 you just see the lights go on,

327
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,003
       And there are like
 10 hideous monsters behind him,

328
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,238
        And he runs out.

329
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,639
  Then it cuts back to reality,

330
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,975
       And he's snuck into
      the teachers' lounge,

331
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,476
  Which he thought was a cave.

332
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,279
And there's just a little quote,
    you know, a little bubble

333
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,515
   That says, "who was that?"

334
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:54,986
     That stuff cracks me up
    because it's so dramatic.

335
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:59,123
    Everything is so dramatic
        in calvin's mind.

336
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,392
    And to everyone outside,

337
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:05,730
         It's just like,
 "what's that little kid doing?

338
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,632
        That little kid's
         kind of weird."

339
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,506
 -So many of calvin's adventures
  take place in faraway worlds,

340
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:20,411
    But his everyday reality
    looked so familiar to me.

341
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,246
   His backyard and the woods
           he explored

342
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,515
 Probably looked just like home
      to a lot of readers,

343
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,151
   And they looked a lot like
         the small town

344
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,189
 That bill watterson grew up in,
      near cleveland, ohio.

345
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,157
       We're just outside
       of chagrin falls,

346
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,161
   And we're about to head to
     the fireside book shop,

347
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,631
      Where we are going to
   meet up with nevin martell,

348
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,469
    Who recently wrote a book
      about bill watterson.

349
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,772
     And if you look around,
   this is the type of scenery

350
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:51,209
          That you see
    in "calvin and hobbes" --

351
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:55,246
   The landscapes, the trees,
     the colors, the hills.

352
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,682
             I mean,
    these are the landscapes

353
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,552
  As you see calvin and hobbes
            sledding

354
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:07,692
    Or, you know, wagoneering
       in their backyard.

355
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,560
   It's just, you look around,

356
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,764
 And it's like this is the strip
          in real life.

357
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,599
           It's great.

358
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,201
       -When I first drove
       into chagrin falls,

359
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,405
    It was like walking into
  a "calvin and hobbes" strip,

360
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:23,341
    Because the road in which
    I happened to come in on

361
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,710
         Happened to be
    from the same perspective

362
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,578
Of the image of calvin rampaging

363
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,248
      Through the triangle
      at the center of town

364
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,383
 While holding the popcorn shop
            above him

365
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,152
   Like he's a giant godzilla.

366
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,788
   So when I drove into town,
   I knew exactly where I was,

367
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,489
 Because I had seen that before,

368
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,659
 Except I had seen it as one of
    watterson's watercolors.

369
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,462
        -The view is from
   above the clock tower here

370
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,765
    At the south end of town,
         looking north.

371
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,467
           Bandstand.

372
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,070
 Fireside is roughly right here.

373
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:56,274
        And popcorn shop,
which is just around the corner,

374
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,609
  On the same side as fireside.

375
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:02,180
         And, you know,
      as is usual for bill,

376
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:07,218
  He has almost completely done
    the architectural details

377
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,556
      Exactly as they are.

378
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,791
          I'm not sure
    what's on fire back here.

379
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,761
      But this is probably
 the most popular book we sell,

380
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,597
        Simply because of
 the local drawing on the back.

381
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:25,736
   -You came to chagrin falls,
 the hometown of bill watterson,

382
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,239
   As a part of your journey.

383
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,174
       What was that like?

384
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,776
  -When I had pitched the book,

385
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,378
     I had always pitched it
 with the trip to chagrin falls.

386
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,148
        And I always knew
     that I wanted to come.

387
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,550
     When I had pitched it,
    it was just kind of like,

388
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,786
     "and in a dream world,
   we'll go to chagrin falls,

389
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,255
    And we'll knock on doors,
    and we'll talk to people,

390
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,591
      And we'll see things
   that have never been seen."

391
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,160
   And so I didn't really know
      what I was gonna get.

392
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,462
       And it turned into
        a minor bonanza.

393
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,397
 I mean, it was a major bonanza,

394
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,833
   In terms of, like, insight
          and material.

395
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:00,638
    Like, the book would have
    been thinner without it.

396
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,840
          [ chuckles ]

397
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,443
  -We started the library here
     about three years ago.

398
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,778
  And I walked into my office,

399
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,815
     And turns out I've got
 an original "calvin and hobbes"

400
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,817
          About calvin
      going to the library

401
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,452
   And having an overdue book.

402
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,621
  I was very excited to buy it.

403
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,657
      And as you can tell,
 by looking at it really close,

404
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,893
    You can actually even see
         wite-out on it.

405
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:27,632
 -And this is the first original
         I've ever seen.

406
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,334
    -It's like the movement.
    -Mm-hmm.

407
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,170
   -He decided that he didn't
      want you to see that.

408
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,704
            -Mm-hmm.

409
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,574
   -The size is so much bigger

410
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,676
    Than how they're printed
       in the newspapers.

411
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,379
  You have no idea when you're
   reading them in the paper.

412
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,813
      And there are papers

413
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,582
  That would have printed them
       smaller than this.

414
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,317
        -Than that. Yeah.

415
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,687
  And there's some pretty cool
     stuff on the back, too.

416
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,290
        -"bill watterson
    grew up in chagrin falls.

417
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,425

      civic-minded parents

418

     bill's slothful habits

425
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,679
      And now it says $500.

426

  -We have the <i>chagrin herald.</i>

427

    They're bound newspapers
   from the '70s and earlier.

428
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,757
In the '70s, you'll find some of
 bill watterson's earlier work.

429
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,659
       We'll go back here

430
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:33,331
       And see what we can
   pull off the shelf for you.

431
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,505
          So down here
in the catacombs of the library.

             -1976.

433
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,611
              -Yes.

434
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,656
              -Oh.

435
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,924
               -Oh.

436
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,792
     -It's a very early one.
     -Yeah.

437
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,561
 -Well, "Thursday, August 26th."

438
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,529
            -The kids
   were going back to school.

439
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,598
 -So going back to school. Yep.

440
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,468
 Coming straight from vacation,
     squealing into school.

441
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,836
           I got you.

442
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,971
     Calvin would be headed
      the other direction.

443
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,373
          -[ chuckles ]

444
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,608
     -So this is January...

445
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,943
              -'78.

446
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,679
     -...To December of '78.

447
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,653
          -Oh.
          -There we go.

448
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:29,920
       -Oh, look at that.

449
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,889
   -"watterson on watterson --

450
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,026
 The <i>herald sun's</i> award-winning
   cartoonist, bill watterson,

451
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,428
      Turns his satiric pen
          on himself."

452
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,663
     Much longer hair then.

453
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:39,864
            -Mm-hmm.

454
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,400
         -Ink all over.

455
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,735
         And "peanuts."

456
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,705
     And then his signature.

457
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,642
    That almost looks gothic
     in a way or something.

458
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,645
      Do you have any 1982?

459
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,913
             -Yeah.

460
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,529
        -Oh. There we go.

461
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,863
         -There you go.

462
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,832
      -They pop out to you.

463
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,069
 "he knew the risks when he put
 the garbage out early, ma'am."

464
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,638
    This actually reminds me
       of the Sunday strip

465
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,942
When the deer pop in with rifles

466
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:30,815
     And shoot bill or phil
          or some guy.

467
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,419
       His signature here

468
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,356
Is a lot more like his signature
    with "calvin and hobbes."

469
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,690
            -Mm-hmm.

470
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,564
  -In the early '80s, watterson
  did have a few opportunities

471
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,867
 To showcase his drawing skills
    for various publications

472
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,404
    While he endured repeated
 rejection from the syndicates.

473
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:56,807
But while he worked hard to make
    a living as a cartoonist,

474
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,044
  His talents were often wasted
    on laying out advertising

475
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,480
   In order to pay the bills.

476
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,516
     Within months, however,
      of quitting that job,

477
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:08,552
     Watterson was becoming
     one of the cartoonists

478
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,955
     Who other professional
    and aspiring cartoonists

479
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,824
       Were looking up to.

480
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,594
       -It's probably hard
        to name an artist

481
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,397
  Who came along in the 1990s,
            onward --

482
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,766
     A comic-strip artist --

483
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,769
      Who wasn't influenced
           in some way

484
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,638
     By "calvin and hobbes."

485
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,508
     -You can definitely see
   his impact in comics today,

486
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,677
   And it's not that anyone is
 copying his comic specifically

487
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,780
         Or trying to do
      exactly what he did.

488
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:39,950
  But you can clearly see that
  the creators who are younger

489
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,120
           And who are
  introducing new comic strips,

490
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,956
    You can clearly see that
they've read "calvin and hobbes"

491
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,459
   And are influenced by that.

492
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,761
         -I can tell you
      when I saw calvin --

493
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,697
    I saw the very first day
       in the <i>l.A. Times.</i>

494
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,500
 I liked it, and you don't like
        strips very often

495
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,068
 From the, you know, first day.

496
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,838
  -I remember looking at comics
        in the newspaper

497
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,606
    And thinking, "you know,

498
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,142
 I could probably write and draw
     as well as these guys.

499
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,912
   I should give a comic strip
            a shot."

500
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,114
    After "calvin and hobbes"
            came out,

501
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,749
    I sort of modified it to,

502
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,451
     "well, I could probably
         write and draw

503
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,085
 As well as most of these guys."

504
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,755
   -I had sort of written off
 the comic strips at that point.

505
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,090
  And when "calvin and hobbes"
    came fresh on the scene,

506
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,694
        It was brand-new,
        and it was funny.

507
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,062
        It captivated me
       right off the bat.

508
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,497
  I knew that was a good strip.

509
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,032
             I said
  I knew it was a funny strip.

510
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,768
     I couldn't wait to read
  that strip every single day.

511
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,706
-There was a unique perspective,
      a unique voice to it,

512
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:40,644
         That it wasn't
   generic formula-gag stuff,

513
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,781
         Which permeates
     most of the comic page.

514
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:46,250
    -And in every way, shape,
    and form, on every level,

515
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,652
           It was like
     comic-strip perfection.

516
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,020
        And it still is.

517
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,623
    -One of my favorite lines
    came from lynn johnston,

518
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,658
          Who was doing
   "for better or for worse."

519
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,260
          And she said,

520
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,629
"you know, he inspires all of us
   to do a little bit better."

521
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:02,233
        And I think that,
        on the one side,

522
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,869
     Was a beneficial impact
          that he had,

523
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,038
   Not only among the artists
  who were working at the time,

524
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,808
      But on younger people
    who were reading comics,

525
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,277
 That there was this opportunity

526
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,646
     To do different things
          with the art

527
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,148
 And try to push the boundaries
          a little bit.

528
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,684
     -My initial impression
       when I saw him was,

529
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,287
  "the guy is making it harder
      for the rest of us,"

530
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:24,722
      'cause he is setting

531
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:26,891
    This ridiculous standard
          of excellence

532
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,559
      That hadn't been seen
     since the "pogo" years,

533
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,194
           In drawing.

534
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,963
  -Most of the time, I was just
   trying to meet my deadline.

535
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,599
   For bill, it wasn't enough
   to just meet the deadline.

536
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,903
  You had to sort of, you know,
    move the bar a little bit

537
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,871
Over what you'd done previously.

538
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,207
             -It was
 a completely different approach

539
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,609
       To the traditional
       four-panel strip.

540
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,278
            There was
     just something about it

541
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,246
          That was just
      very, very magical --

542
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,315
     The way he drew trees,
     the way he drew water,

543
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,017
    The way he drew movement.

544
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,753
         -The brushwork
   just continues to amaze me,

545
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,055
        And his writing,
       which is so concise

546
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,257
         And yet so deep
       and philosophical.

547
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,860
           -You know,
   his approach at philosophy

548
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,796
    And sort of representing
       the human condition

549
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,965
          Was something
     that was always bigger

550
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,767
 Than just a little comic strip.

551
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,904
        The conversations
 had so many layers of meaning.

552
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,173
 And if I could even come close
            to that,

553
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,975
 I would be absolutely thrilled.

554
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,612
    -Bill watterson showed me

555
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:24,148
   That a great, amazing comic

556
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,318
        Is great writing
    that can stand on its own

557
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,087
        And great drawing
   that can stand on its own.

558
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,790
     You know, you take out
       either one of those

559
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,892
              From
  a "calvin and hobbes" strip,

560
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:37,194
      And it's still great
           to look at.

561
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,996
    It's still funny to read.

562
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,698
       Put them together,

563
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,968
And you have one of the greatest
    comic strips of all time.

564
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,770
      -"calvin and hobbes,"
  as far as a comic strip goes,

565
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,007
 Was such a huge influence on me
 wanting to become a cartoonist.

566
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,309
        It was everything
    a comic strip should be.

567
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:55,079
 It's very dynamic. It's funny.
    It's got a strong voice.

568
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,914
            You know,
    the artwork is fabulous.

569
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,183
      There wasn't anything
      not to like about it.

570
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:02,019
          -If he's not
    the most cited influence,

571
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:05,089
     He's certainly second,
  behind schulz and "peanuts."

572
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,924
       But he's up there.

573
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,326
   And I think we get so many
 submissions that say, you know,

574
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,261
   "I've always been a big fan
     of 'calvin and hobbes,'

575
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,030
So I wanted to try and do this."

576
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,398
      -I think you can see

577
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,067
          An influence
     of "calvin and hobbes,"

578
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,071
     To a degree, in "zits,"
    a strip I like very much.

579
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:24,008
       There is a kind of
       calvin-esque feel

580
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,311
   To the way that jim borgman
         and jerry scott

581
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:32,816
    Will play jeremy duncan's
 fantasies against the reality.

582
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,152
 -As a professional cartoonist,
         I read it now,

583
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,354
        And you just see
     a master at his craft,

584
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,658
     You know, someone that
  [chuckles] puts you to shame

585
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,394
As far as what you're able to do
         in comparison.

586
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:47,297
-I actually have a comic that I
had to do for a class in college

587
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,133
  At the school of visual arts.

588
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,403
     So we had to do a comic
  about our biggest influence.

589
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:55,172
  Of course, what else would I
  pick but "calvin and hobbes"?

590
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,008
  One of the things that I feel
     that I gained the most,

591
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,210
        As a cartoonist,
    from reading this strip,

592
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:04,114
      Is learning how to do
such wild and crazy expressions.

593
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,450
          And sometimes
   it's not just the writing.

594
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,852
            It's just
   the simplest, crazy drawing

595
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,156
   That will make you laugh or
 smile and really influence you.

596
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:15,426
       So I was very happy
    to get my inner calvin on

597
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:18,429
           [chuckles]
   while working on the strip.

598
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,966
    -I got a lot of attention

599
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:26,370
        For a resemblance
     to "calvin and hobbes."

600
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,139
         And some of it
   was very, very flattering,

601
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,442
         And some of it
      was less flattering,

602
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,977
 And some it was flat-out mean.

603
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,213
             I tried
   not to take it personally.

604
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,382
             I mean,
  the people who were outraged

605
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,751
    That my strip might bear
         any resemblance

606
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,219
     To "calvin and hobbes,"

607
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,788
  I think that was done mostly
    out of a passionate love

608
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,390
    For "calvin and hobbes."

609
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,992
  And anything that you write
  is gonna be autobiographical

610
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,427
          At its heart.

611
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,129
       Same with "frazz."
     you know, frazz is me.

612
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:55,099
     He's cooler than I am,
because I can make him that way,

613
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,433
          But he's me.

614
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:59,436
         And, likewise,
   if I learned a whole bunch

615
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,873
    From "calvin and hobbes,"
      from bill watterson,

616
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,274
  I'm not gonna cover that up.

617
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,910
            Honestly,
    I think it would be rude

618
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,246
    To try and say, "oh, no,
    I did this all on my own.

619
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,015
    This is all me. I didn't
    learn this from anybody."

620
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:16,253
    No. We're all standing on
    the shoulders of giants.

621
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:21,859
  -Watterson certainly left us
    a legacy of great ideas,

622
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:25,763
         Great drawing,
      great, great comics,

623
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,831
 But he was last in a long line

624
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,301
  Of really amazing cartoonists
     from the 20th century,

625
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,973
     Since the real blooming
  of the comic-strip art form.

626
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,443
And he very much valued the work
         of walt kelly,

627
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:44,014
  One of the cartoonists that I
 loved to read when I was a kid.

628
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,349
     If you look at "pogo,"

629
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,785
        You can see that
   he very strongly influenced

630
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,052
     Not only bill watterson

631
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,155
      But also jeff smith,
        who does "bone."

632
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:55,092
  "pogo" was this world similar
   to what watterson created,

633
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:58,862
 Where there were these animals
      and these characters,

634
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,297
   And they spoke about things

635
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,199
   Much bigger than the swamp
       that they lived in.

636
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:07,471
They were possums and alligators
and chicks and all these things,

637
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,507
    But they were politicians
        and philosophers,

638
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,811
   And they commented heavily
           on society.

639
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,312
        So I can imagine

640
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,048
   Why watterson found "pogo"
     fascinating to look at,

641
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,450
   And it's beautifully drawn,
        and walt kelly --

642
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,888
 You know, just no end of genius
    in how he created "pogo."

643
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,356
     -Schulz is, of course,

644
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,526
  Such an important cartoonist
      and such a great one

645
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,129
         That, I think,
   pretty much any comic strip

646
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:36,200
 That began after the early '50s
      was influenced by it.

647
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,436
    The scale of the stories
         he would tell,

648
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:43,240
    The intimacy of the strip
      and of the settings,

649
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,543
        The observations
      of children's lives,

650
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,345
       All I think, again,

651
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,316
    Can be seen as influences
     on "calvin and hobbes."

652
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:57,187
  Just the notion of the world
  from a child's point of view

653
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,890
 Was something that schulz took,

654
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,393
     And while other artists
 had done things with it before,

655
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:07,564
  Schulz did it so much better
    and had so much influence

656
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,167
That, once again, you can see it

657
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,003
          Flowing into
      "calvin and hobbes."

658
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,005
             -Well,
  I don't know bill watterson,

659
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,207
       So I don't want to
      speak to his motives,

660
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,509
      But it appears to me,
      in reading his essays

661
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,079
     And seeing some of his
  interviews about "krazy kat,"

662
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,883
   That "krazy kat" set a bar
 that he judged his own work by

663
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,952
   And would not be satisfied
        with his own work

664
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:32,556
 If it wasn't as idiosyncratic,
         as imaginative,

665
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,226
 As personal as "krazy kat" was.

666
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,328
         Watterson said,
      in his first hiatus,

667
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,130
He started paying more attention

668
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,633
   To what herriman was doing
      on those full pages,

669
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:45,202
     When the newspaper page
       was a blank canvas

670
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,071
     And he could have form
     be dictated by content

671
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,640
Instead of the other way around,

672
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,075
       Instead of saying,
 "you've got eight panels here.

673
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,311
            You know,
that's gonna be your narrative."

674
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,247
            Instead,
   he could blow it wide-open,

675
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,182
 Have the panels not be panels,

676
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,219
  You know, have the adventure,
       the narrative flow

677
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,388
     Follow whatever course,
          artistically,

678
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,456
     That he wanted to take.

679
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,927
  All that stuff that herriman
   gave himself license to do

680
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,495
   Is right there on the page.

681
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:14,665
  So I think, for a cartoonist,
     it represented freedom.

682
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,035
    It represented personal,
  artistic, visionary freedom.

683
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:23,040
   I think he saw that and saw
 this was what he could do, too.

684
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,157
 -There is something else deep
 in the basement of the library

685
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,192
        In chagrin falls.

686
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,494
            Watterson
   lent his photography skills

687
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,263
  To his high-school yearbook,

688
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:50,300
        And his cartoons
    are scattered throughout.

689
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,668
       One of his drawings

690
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,504
        Is a depiction of
the four photographers on staff,

691
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,206
      As the caption reads,

692
00:32:56,208 --> 00:33:00,477
      "watterson is the one
  on the far right, blinking."

693
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,648
Perhaps this drawing foreshadows
  watterson's future reputation

694
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,018
 For being a man who shied away
       from the spotlight

695
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,089
      And very much desired
          his privacy.

696
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,991
      -I think, initially,
         he was pleased

697
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,759
       That so many papers
        were signing on.

698
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,662
       He started getting
       a lot of fan mail.

699
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,131
He got a lot of press attention,

700
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,500
    And he realized, I think,
        pretty quickly on

701
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,569
   That he had done something
            special.

702
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,271
           And I think
     it didn't take him long

703
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,708
   To become a little unnerved
     and taken aback by it.

704
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,312
           -Even with
    a tiny amount of success,

705
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:40,450
It's a little daunting how much
feedback and comment and request

706
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,153
You get from the general public.

707
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,023
      So I can only imagine
      if I'm bill watterson

708
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:51,028
And I have millions and millions
  and millions of adoring fans.

709
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,096
  -Nobody knows bill watterson.

710
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,631
     There's like three
     people on the planet
     who have ever seen him.

711
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,333
    He won't talk to anybody.

712
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,635
       He's the sasquatch
         of cartoonists.

713
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,670
            You know,
 people have seen his footprint,

714
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,806
       But nobody has ever
    gotten a picture of him.

715
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,175
         -He just wanted
    to draw his comic strip.

716
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,344
        He didn't really
       want to be famous.

717
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,746
He didn't want all the trappings
       that went with it.

718
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:13,250
 He just wanted to do a good job
     drawing a comic strip.

719
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:17,754
      -Cartooning attracts
        solitary people,

720
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,657
  Quiet people, insular people.

721
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,393
   Because, if you were gonna
spend time at your drawing desk,

722
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,796
 You weren't the kind of person
 that dated well in high school.

723
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,197
      You know what I mean?

724
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,565
 You weren't the kind of person

725
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,233
      That was the captain
      of the football team.

726
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,803
       For the most part,
 it's people that use their art

727
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:35,372
       To make their voice
     to the world, you know?

728
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:41,478
    So it doesn't surprise me
 that he errs on the shier side,

729
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,781
      The introverted side,
       the reclusive side.

730
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:48,351
Because that's probably what his
  life framed him as, you know?

731
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,555
   He was probably always shy
 and introverted and reclusive,

732
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,757
    Or else he wouldn't have
        spent the decades

733
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,293
     Crafting his abilities
     as an artist, you know?

734
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,195
          He would have
      been out socializing

735
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,830
           And become
    a regional sales manager

736
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,565
 For midas car parts, you know?

737
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:05,402
   I mean, it would have been
   a different path in life.

738
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:09,239
   -Luckily, watterson didn't
    end up selling car parts

739
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,242
        And he did create
      "calvin and hobbes."

740
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:15,212
           By the end
 of its decade-long syndication,

741
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:18,181
 It was in over 2,400 newspapers
           worldwide,

742
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,617
     With a daily readership
          of millions.

743
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,487
 Watterson won the reuben award
   for cartoonist of the year

744
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,889
        In 1986 and 1988,

745
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,792
        The harvey award
 for best syndicated comic strip

746
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,227
      Seven years in a row,

747
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:31,495
     And "calvin and hobbes"

748
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,763
Was loved by readers and critics
             alike.

749
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,299
     18 "calvin and hobbes"
        book collections

750
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,201
Have been published in the u.S.,

751
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,604
   Selling 45 million copies,

752
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,540
    And dozens more have been
    published internationally

753
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,209
In at least two dozen languages.

754
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,312
   There are frequent homages
 and spoofs on the comics pages,

755
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,281
          And the strip
       has been referenced

756
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,782
 In numerous american tv shows,

757
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:56,186
     Including "family guy,"
     "the big bang theory,"

758
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,156
      "parks and reaction,"
          "portlandia,"

759
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,891
      And "robot chicken."

760
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,760
       But bill watterson
  doesn't seem to care too much

761
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,696
 About the numbers or the awards
        or the accolades.

762
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,499
            His focus
 was on the comic strip itself,

763
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,434
 Which, despite being something

764
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,837
     That watterson has said
       he did for himself,

765
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,474
    Had become very important
      to readers worldwide.

766
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:20,710
      -Bill watterson saved
 almost all of the original art

767
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,379
    From "calvin and hobbes,"

768
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,381
Both the dailies and the sundays

769
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,716
     And all of the book art
          that he did,

770
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,452
  And he put it on deposit here

771
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,888
      At the billy ireland
    cartoon library & museum.

772
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,590
   So were are the caretakers,

773
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,293
      And we make sure that
  it's preserved and kept safe

774
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:40,230
 And, also, that it's accessible
  to researchers and scholars.

775
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,899
So if somebody wants to come and
 actually see the original art,

776
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,335
      They can come to our
  reading room and request it,

777
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,537
    And we'll bring it out,
    and they can look at it.

778
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,240
           So this is
    what we call the stacks,

779
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,210
   And this is obviously where
 we keep all of our collection.

780
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,345
           We operate
     like a rare-books room,

781
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:56,746
     So nothing circulates,

782
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,448
     Nothing actually leaves
      the cartoon library.

783
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,217
           If anybody
     wants to use something,

784
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,352
 They have to actually come here
         and request it,

785
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,588
    And then we bring it out,
     and you can look at it.

786
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,792
           So we have
 over 400,000 original cartoons,

787
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,528
 Including, of course, the bill
 watterson deposit collection.

788
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,997
    We have many, many books
  about cartoons, periodicals.

789
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,765
      We have comic books.

790
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,767
 We also have archival material,

791
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,238
    So we collect the papers
   and letters of cartoonists

792
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,906
        And other people
    related to the business.

793
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,576
     This is gonna be all of
   your books about cartoons,

794
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,646
   Anthologies, reprint books,
          how-to books,

795
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:34,251
Journals like <i>pokk</i> or <i>judge</i> that
have a lot of cartoons in them.

796
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,587
      And then, over here,
     we have our flat files,

797
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,457
            Which is
    all of the original art.

798
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,859
           So, this is
   one of my favorite drawers.

799
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:46,463
    This is our "little nemo"
        by winsor mccay.

800
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,366
          And these are
  just absolutely spectacular.

801
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,867
        -That is massive.

802
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,636
              -Yes.

803
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:55,505
 Of course, the newspaper pages
     were bigger themselves,

804
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,407
          At the time,

805
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,442
 But it would have been smaller
 than he did it as the original.

806
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,945
   "little nemo," of course,
   is a wonderful comic strip

807
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,481
       About a little boy
 who goes to sleep every night,

808
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,583
   And he goes to slumberland

809
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,585
             And has
  all these amazing adventures.

810
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,688
        And then, always
 on the last panel, he wakes up

811
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,024
     And is back in his bed
    and is back into reality,

812
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,826
   And so you can see how this
    influenced bill watterson

813
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,395
    With "calvin and hobbes."

814
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,530
    There are a lot of strips
       that are like that,

815
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,931
          Where he's in
    kind of a fantasy world,

816
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,566
  And then, in the last panel,
           he wakes up

817
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,003
    Or comes back to reality.

818
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,780
     -If you had the chance
       to view a selection

819
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,082
     Of "calvin and hobbes"
           originals,

820
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,318
       How would you pick
      which strips to see?

821
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,389
Would you pick specific examples
         of panel layout

822
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,526
    Or use of black-and-white
       or line techniques?

823
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:52,962
   Maybe a daily and a Sunday
         from each year?

824
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:57,067
Or would you just narrow it down
   to your absolute favorites?

825
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,805
            No matter
    what you finally decide,

826
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:05,575
Once you put on the white gloves
  and sit down with the strips,

827
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,977
      I don't really think
        you can go wrong.

828
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,382
         It's admittedly
      a strange experience.

829
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,118
         You can examine
      each line and letter

830
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,387
   And mistake and alteration.

831
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,522
           And you can
      compare the originals

832
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,025
    To the printed newspaper
        or book version.

833
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,994
      The dailies look much
      as you might expect,

834
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,897
      But the Sunday strips
       are another story.

835
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:32,135
   You can explore watterson's
      lush watercolor art,

836
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,939
    But the Sunday originals
      are black-and-white.

837
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,776
   They're incredible to see,
   despite the missing color.

838
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,644
       But the experience
         got me thinking

839
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,446
          About the art
       of the comic strip.

840
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:46,483
             Comics
  are a bit of a unique medium

841
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,652
   In that it can be difficult
            to define

842
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:53,623
  Exactly what the final piece
       of art actually is.

843
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,159
      Watterson's originals
       are probably worth

844
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,728
  Tens of thousands of dollars
             apiece.

845
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,430
       But it isn't until

846
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:03,099
  The Sunday strips are printed
    in the paper or in books

847
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,902
  That they reach their final,
         intended state.

848
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:10,073
 If you think for just a moment
 about how prevalent comics are

849
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,977
 And how many millions of prints
       of each daily strip

850
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,780
         Are distributed
       across the planet,

851
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,848
 It might be easy to understand

852
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,452
    How comics might be often
     categorized as low art,

853
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,955
      But it's hard to deny
       their high impact.

854
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:35,198
  -I think he very quickly grew
              from,

855
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,135
 "let me get a package together
 that a syndicate will pick up,"

856
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:42,872
   To, "gosh, I got picked up,
  and I'm gonna be syndicated,"

857
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:45,508
To, "now I have this opportunity

858
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,679
    To kind of explore these
  different artistic options."

859
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,482
But I think he quickly picked up
        the opportunities

860
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,484
     With color on sundays,

861
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,986
           The ability
   to push out the boundaries

862
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,756
     On that piece of canvas
         on the sundays.

863
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,224
   And, also, on the dailies,

864
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,093
   He tried so many different
      things in the dailies

865
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,897
  As just from the perspective
          of an artist.

866
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,167
   -Cartoon art and comic art
  is something that, you know,

867
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:15,004
 Was originally seen as kind of
     trashy, populist stuff,

868
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,507
      Almost very childish.

869
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,809
            And then,
   as the years have gone on,

870
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,712
  You know, people have started
     to see the worth in it.

871
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:27,217
 And that's because comic strips
 have tackled heavier subjects.

872
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:31,654
The artwork has been elevated to
a massive degree in some cases.

873
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,557
     -I don't understand the
  distinction that people make.

874
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,192
    So you can have fine art.

875
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,928
   You can have these amazing
 images that people acknowledge,

876
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,731
            You know,
    can speak about any topic

877
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,967
      And say great things

878
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:48,771
           And reflect
what the artist is trying to do.

879
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,040
     You can have literature
      that does that, too.

880
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,942
   You can have a great novel
       that people respect

881
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,644
      And they understand.

882
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,714
  But, somehow, if you combine
    the words and the images,

883
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:01,017
  All of a sudden, all you get
     is something for kids.

884
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,685
        And why is that?

885
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,088
       If you read through
   all of "calvin and hobbes,"

886
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,558
 You'll see that he really has
 very interesting things to say

887
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,828
 About society, about humanity,

888
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,697
      About relationships,
        about the world.

889
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,800
  And there's no reason why he
 can't do that in a comic strip.

890
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,570
 That's a perfectly valid form.

891
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,305
        And I'm thrilled
    that he chose that form,

892
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:24,807
  Because I think he could have
     done probably anything.

893
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,276
       He could have been
       just a fine artist.

894
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:27,877
  He could have written books.

895
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,179
 But he actually chose to do it
        as a comic strip,

896
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,081
     And I'm grateful to him
            for that,

897
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,650
   Because he did it so well,

898
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:38,688
          And he showed
  how it could really be done.

899
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,157
    My favorite strip, which
 probably doesn't surprise you,

900
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,826
     Is the one where calvin
 and hobbes are looking at art,

901
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,296
    And they're talking about
        comics versus art

902
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:49,098
 And how you can have high art,
        like a painting,

903
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,101
   And then you have low art,
   which is the comic strip,

904
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,604
       And it's commercial
       and it's hack work.

905
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:57,941
    And then he kind of shows
       how absurd that is

906
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:01,711
     By saying, "a painting
    of a comic strip panel --

907
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,947
  That's sophisticated irony,
  philosophically challenging.

908
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,582
        That's high art."

909
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,183
    And so then hobbes says,

910
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:10,019
"well, suppose I draw a cartoon
of a painting of a comic strip."

911
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,255
  And, you know, at that point,
        it's just absurd,

912
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,657
        But calvin says,
     "no, that's sophomoric.

913
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,993
  It's intellectually sterile.
         It's low art."

914
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,762
     So he's commenting here
    exactly on this debate --

915
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,065
   You know, what's high art?
         What's low art?

916
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:25,301
   And why, just because it's
   printed in a newspaper
   and it's a comic strip,

917
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,337
  Is it automatically low art?

918
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:30,340
   I don't think anybody would
   look at "calvin and hobbes"

919
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,209
    And say that it's not art
    or say that it's low art.

920
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,144
      But that seems to be
          a distinction

921
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,313
      That comic-strip art
      has been stuck with.

922
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,016
  -Comics are self-expression.

923
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,185
     Self-expression is art.

924
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:45,288
        I don't give a...

925
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,025
    About what an art critic
        might say art is

926
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:55,098
         Because I know
  that I'm creating something.

927
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,036
          Art is about
 creating something -- the end.

928
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,405
        -If you actually
   still have a subscription,

929
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,008
     You can probably tell
     newspapers are hurting

930
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,844
     Simply by stepping out
   on your porch to get yours.

931
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:10,079
    Nearly 100% of the time,

932
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,348
     It isn't the front page
         that greets me

933
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,119
       But a full-page ad
for a sports-equipment retailer.

934
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:19,355
Then, the state of the perceived
  value of the comics is clear

935
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,824
      When you try to find
      the comics section.

936
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,860
     When I was growing up,

937
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:26,329
 Depending on how your paperboy
    put together your paper,

938
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,166
    The Sunday comics section
    was often the front page
    of the Sunday newspaper

939
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,201
  When it arrived at your door.

940
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,337
 It was the first thing you saw.

941
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,841
Now it takes me a couple minutes
       just to locate it.

942
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,144
         In looking back
 at comics sections of the past

943
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,845
         In comparison,

944
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,015
    It's clear just how much
  the comics are being trimmed.

945
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,785
  A typical "calvin and hobbes"
         from the 1990s

946
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:51,721
        Wouldn't even fit
    in todays Sunday funnies.

947
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,890
            Watterson
   had more space on the page

948
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,159
       Than "stone soup,"
       "in the bleachers,"

949
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:01,130
"candorville," "frazz," and half
   of "non sequitur" combined.

950
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,766
 -The comics page was shrinking
          in the 1980s.

951
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:06,235
     It was getting smaller
    and smaller and smaller,

952
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:07,970
 And cartoonists were rebelling.

953
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:10,273
     It was getting tougher
           and tougher

954
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:13,342
  To fit really quality content
        into the strips.

955
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:16,045
      -I typically avoided
     looking at comic pages

956
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,716
       Because I so hated
   how mine looked on a page.

957
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,852
  Your strips look so beautiful
        as they head out.

958
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:25,988
     You know, you draw them
 this big, and they're gorgeous.

959
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,192
  And you see them, especially
  25 years ago, 30 years ago,

960
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:31,494
       Reproduced this big
        on bad newsprint,

961
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,297
     Often out of alignment,
     and it was depressing.

962
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,933
          It was like,
  "why am I in this business?"

963
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,769
    -The smaller and smaller
          reproductions

964
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,472
   Meant there was less chance
          for visuals,

965
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,941
    Less chance to draw well,

966
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:48,077
  Less chance for the audience
          to appreciate

967
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,180
          Good drawing
    and imaginative visuals.

968
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:56,185
       If you are working
   to create a graphic entity,

969
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:59,889
   A pictorial representation
          of something,

970
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:02,959
    You don't want to see it
 shrunk down to a postage stamp.

971
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:06,262
 -Some of the first comic strips
 in america in the early 1900s,

972
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,531
          Some of those
   were like full-page comics.

973
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:11,968
  And, like, those artists had
just huge palettes to work with,

974
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,270
           And the art
  was really, really important.

975
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,873
    Whereas now, some people
  are working with, like, this,

976
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,808
    And it's black-and-white,

977
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,244
         And everything
 is about the simplicity of it.

978
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:23,312
            -Clearly,
  his focus was on the sundays.

979
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,847
  So he approached the sundays

980
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,016
        As an opportunity
    to do some dynamite art,

981
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:30,253
  Which in the comics, has been
   a dying thing for decades.

982
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:33,122
    -You almost cry a little
when you look at the old comics,

983
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,858
    When they had a full page
   to do whatever they wanted.

984
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,060
        You know, again,
   the "nemo" in slumberland,

985
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:40,163
      I mean, good heavens,
       it was just unreal.

986
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:43,366
        -When you look at
  the great strips of the past,

987
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:49,438
   Not only mccay and herriman
 and milt caniff and walt kelly,

988
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,208
      The general standard
        of draftsmanship

989
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,943
     Used to be much higher.

990
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:56,412
        You couldn't have
     "terry and the pirates"

991
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:59,982
      The same way you did
      in the '30s and '40s.

992
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:03,386
  -The biggest and most popular
  strips were the story strips.

993
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:07,590
     They needed that space
    to move the story along.

994
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:12,028
Well, as they shrunk the comics,
there wasn't that space anymore

995
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,430
        For both the art
        and the dialogue.

996
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:18,868
 -Bill's particular problem was
 that, with the Sunday format,

997
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,171
     It could be chopped up
    to fit different sizes --

998
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:26,609
Either a half page or a third of
a page or a quarter of a page --

999
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,178
           And he felt
     trying to configure it

1000
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,614
         So that it fit
      into all those sizes

1001
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:35,084
           Was really
     an obstruction for him.

1002
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:38,454
 So he came back with one-sized
   proposal, and that was it.

1003
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,891
 -Once the sundays were totally
     in watterson's control,

1004
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:44,293
  They didn't get moved around
         or chopped up,

1005
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,362
        Or they wouldn't
        lose the top bar.

1006
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,031
      That really opened up
       a whole new world,

1007
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,401
  In the sense that the artwork
   could go to another level,

1008
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,438
     Because he was working
   with a really huge palette

1009
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,908
   Where it was uninterrupted,
     unbreakable half pages.

1010
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,443
    That was amazing to watch

1011
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:03,379
  Because it really allowed him
        to work in a way

1012
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,382
       That just freed up
         his creativity.

1013
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,253
       -Every three years
    at ohio state university,

1014
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,588
  The cartoon library & museum

1015
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,324
              Hosts
  the festival of cartoon art,

1016
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:19,095
 Which brings together scholars,
       cartoonists, fans,

1017
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,964
   And industry professionals
      from around the world

1018
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:25,234
   To celebrate comic creators
         and their work.

1019
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,937
     In 1989, bill watterson

1020
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:30,273
     Was a featured speaker
        at the festival,

1021
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,141
   And he took the opportunity

1022
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:35,411
     To talk about the power
   and possibilities of comics

1023
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,281
   And how the current climate
         for cartoonists

1024
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:40,917
    Was failing the art form.

1025
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,219
    -He gave a speech titled
 "the cheapening of the comics,"

1026
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:47,023
    Which was really his way
  of drawing a line in the sand

1027
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:49,692
     And saying, "if we are
to take this art form seriously,

1028
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,227
   If we are to serve it best,

1029
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,329
      These are the things
      that we should do."

1030
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:56,365
 And it was sort of a series of
 seven or eight or nine points

1031
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,167
           That says,

1032
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,969
  "look, you cheapen the comics
   when you commercialize it.

1033
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,405
You cheapen the comics when you
take the artist of the equation.

1034
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,941
     You cheapen the comics
     when you let it go on

1035
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:08,110
          A life beyond
  what it was intended to do."

1036
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,079
     "you cheapen the comics
  when you give the syndicate,"

1037
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,581
 Which is the publisher and the
 distributor, "too much power."

1038
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,951
         "and if we are
  to truly serve this art form,

1039
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,620
 The artist has to come first,
 their voice has to come first,

1040
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,089
   And the art before commerce
       has to come first."

1041
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,224
       He was essentially
   throwing down the gauntlet

1042
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,126
        And said, "look,
      we've lost something

1043
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,128
      "from the early part
      of the 20th century,

1044
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,597
   "where, you know, the art
   was beautifully displayed,

1045
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,100
    "the artists were given
    this truly unique voice,

1046
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,536
     "and we need to go back
      to a different time,

1047
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,571
       To a different way
         of cartooning."

1048
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:39,308
 -I think he took a very lofty,
at times even philosophical look

1049
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,077
        At the art form.

1050
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,545
There's nothing wrong with that,

1051
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,014
     Because he held himself
     to those own standards,

1052
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:47,416
   And I have a lot of respect
     for him for doing that.

1053
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,352
            -I think
  it was kind of a brave speech

1054
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:51,087
       Because mort walker
   took it very personally --

1055
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,989
   Of "beetle bailey" fame --

1056
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,624
 And a few other bigger names in
 cartooning took it personally,

1057
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:58,027
     Because they viewed it
    as a shot across the bow

1058
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,729
           Of the way
  they handled their business,

1059
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,630
      The way they handled
        their cartooning.

1060
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:05,034
       -Within the crowd,
       my recollection was

1061
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:11,374
  That there was a strong split
      among those who were,

1062
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,110
       "yeah, go get them.
   Go tell them the way it is"

1063
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,345
      And the other side,
      which was, you know,

1064
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,714
        "who is this kid
   to tell me how to do my art

1065
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,484
       And do what I want
 with my life and my business?"

1066
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:24,353
  -Watterson was coming out of
 more of the artistic tradition

1067
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,522
        And just, "look,
   we can raise this art up."

1068
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,225
  And others were coming from,
    "look, it has always been

1069
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,260
        This intersection
      of art and commerce,

1070
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,029
    So you cannot deny that."

1071
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:35,297
    You know, I've talked to
 jeff smith of "bone" about it,

1072
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:38,434
 And he said he literally walked
   out of that hall and said,

1073
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:41,570
"I realize that 'bone' cannot be
      what I want it to be

1074
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,072
     In a comic-strip form.

1075
00:50:43,074 --> 00:50:44,640
  I have to forge my own path.

1076
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,043
      I have to take 'bone'
           elsewhere."

1077
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,452
   -My relationship with bill
       was one of letters.

1078
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:59,388
       And it's not unique
         to cartoonists

1079
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,258
          That we draw
  in our letters to each other.

1080
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,693
  But it's unique that he would

1081
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,596
  Spend as much time as he did
        on his drawings,

1082
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,365
     Which is just like him.

1083
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,534
      He didn't do anything
           like I did,

1084
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,736
            Which was
    by the seat of the pants

1085
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,638
     And extremely quickly.

1086
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,440
The source of much of the energy

1087
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:19,442
        With the letters
        and the drawings,

1088
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:23,446
    To me, was at my expense.

1089
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,581
            He and I
    were the yin and the yang

1090
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,450
Of the comic strips in the '80s,

1091
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:33,355
   Because I was making these,
         and he was not.

1092
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:36,592
    And as he would draw me,

1093
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,462
     I was taking the money
   and buying gasoline with it

1094
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,497
         And pumping it
       into my speedboat,

1095
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:43,232
        Which he used to
        put on the bottom

1096
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,234
  Almost of each of the letters
          he wrote me.

1097
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:48,604
  And the person handing me the
  money was the syndicate boss,

1098
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,539
 Who he had no appreciation for.

1099
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:54,243
  So that's how he saw me, and
 it's how he saw the syndicate,

1100
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:57,546
    And that's how he saw the
exploitation of one's characters

1101
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:58,848
        In a comic strip,

1102
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,418
     All nicely personified
         in one drawing.

1103
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,386
          -We realized
    that "calvin and hobbes"

1104
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:05,788
 Was gonna be huge in licensing.

1105
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,590
    'cause we could just tell
          by the signs,

1106
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,391
  The response from the public.

1107
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:12,661
  But bill made it clear that
  he was just not gonna do it.

1108
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,698
     -Watterson, obviously,
    had very strong feelings

1109
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,769
       About merchandising
and the commerce side of comics.

1110
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,205
             I mean,
    he participated in a way,

1111
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:27,176
   Just being in a newspaper,
        as part of that.

1112
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:30,179
       But he clearly had
       very specific ideas

1113
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:34,884
     About how merchandising
    can change the characters

1114
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:36,485
        Or change the art

1115
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,256
      Or change the creator
    and what their vision is.

1116
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,591
     -The idea of, you know,

1117
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,761
        A stuffed hobbes
  sitting on a shelf somewhere

1118
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,830
         Would basically
      answer that question

1119
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,232
          That's always
    hanging over the strip --

1120
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,768
    You know, is hobbes real?
      Is he a stuffed toy?

1121
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,204
  Well, there's a stuffed toy,
            you know?

1122
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,439
          -We have seen
   many comic-strip characters

1123
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,342
    Go from being, you know,
  figures you see in the paper

1124
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,710
   That may give you a laugh,

1125
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,712
        To being kind of
        a national blight

1126
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,315
           In the case
   of something like garfield,

1127
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:09,251
   That at one point was on, I
think, 5,000 different products.

1128
00:53:09,253 --> 00:53:12,288
       And the character
       becomes ubiquitous

1129
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,958
 And begins to feel like a pest
 or something you can't escape,

1130
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,562
    Rather than something you
  look forward to encountering.

1131
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:22,498
          In a society
    that is as media-obsessed

1132
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,668
       And money-obsessed
    as ours is and was then,

1133
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,738
  His decision seemed strange,
   if not almost un-american.

1134
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,909
  He walked away from literally
   tens of millions of dollars

1135
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,444
        In merchandising,

1136
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,846
       Because everything
       that snoopy was on,

1137
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:40,316
     I'm sure he was offered
           for hobbes.

1138
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,818
  -"sparky" did feel protective

1139
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,488
     About being criticized
         for licensing,

1140
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,923
        Because he said,

1141
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:51,360
"people don't realize, you know,
       how it all started

1142
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,963
       And that everything
   was somebody coming to me,

1143
00:53:53,965 --> 00:53:56,298
 Wanting to use the characters.

1144
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,733
      I drew it for them."

1145
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,536
      And it had an aspect
         of kind of fun,

1146
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,638
 An entrepreneurialism about it

1147
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,940
       That was not to do
         with business.

1148
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:08,844
        It was to do with
       extending your art,

1149
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,513
   Extending your sentiments.

1150
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:14,984
 -When "sparky" did what he did,
    "sparky" had no template,

1151
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:17,519
      And I'm talking about
         the licensing.

1152
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:19,455
       Like, percy crosby
     had licensed "skippy,"

1153
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,457
         And, you know,
  "blondie" had been licensed,

1154
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:23,492
     But nobody -- nobody --

1155
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:25,794
        Had been licensed
         anywhere close,

1156
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:27,663
        Before or since.

1157
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:32,868
    You know, you're talking
   $40-million-a-year empire.

1158
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,371
   In so far as that includes

1159
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:38,807
         A snoopy plush
     that a kid could hold,

1160
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,809
     That looks like snoopy

1161
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:44,313
        And doesn't have
    sort of a bullshit smile

1162
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,048
    That snoopy doesn't have,

1163
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,916
           It's great.

1164
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:52,855
   In so far as the "peanuts"
  characters speak for metlife

1165
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:56,425
       Or any corporation,
        I always cringe.

1166
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:58,627
    It just strikes me wrong.

1167
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,430
   I don't want to see snoopy
      selling me insurance.

1168
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,699
   It's sort of like a cousin
   who got really close to you

1169
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,401
   And you spent all this time
            together

1170
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,069
          And you think
      you really know him,

1171
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:09,605
And then you're fishing with him
one day, and he says, "you know,

1172
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:13,876
I never said this to you before,
   but I sell life insurance."

1173
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:16,545
        And your stomach
        would just drop,

1174
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:18,414
    Because you'd say, "god,

1175
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,649
   Has the whole relationship
       been based on that?

1176
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,351
              Like,
were you building to this point?

1177
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:23,552
        Was it all b.S.?"

1178
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,521
 Something strikes you as false,

1179
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:27,956
        And you question
      the whole friendship.

1180
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,659
           And I think
  when a character advertises,

1181
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,961
      Sells you insurance,

1182
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:37,366
     I think that hurts your
 relationship to the character.

1183
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,705
 When watterson did what he did

1184
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:46,041
           And he said
    no licensing whatsoever,

1185
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,776
     To the extent he meant,

1186
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,079
   "I don't want my characters
     speaking for everybody.

1187
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,613
   I don't want my characters

1188
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,415
     To be on every lunchbox
        and every shirt,"

1189
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,983
      I totally understand.

1190
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:58,954
   That makes a lot of sense,
'cause it lessens the character.

1191
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:03,125
 In so far as he took the stand,
 "there can't be a hobbes doll,"

1192
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:05,094
  I will never understand that.

1193
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:07,796
   If they made a hobbes doll
  and he had control over it --

1194
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,099
      It could look exactly
  like he wanted it to look --

1195
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:12,401
     Every kid in the world
      would have loved it.

1196
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:14,036
 Has there ever been a character

1197
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:17,072
Who was more built for licensing
          than hobbes?

1198
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,007
      It's a stuffed animal
          in the strip,

1199
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,643
    And the kid's imagination
    can make it come alive --

1200
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:22,945
    You know, the whole bit.

1201
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,781
       What would the harm
       have been in that?

1202
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:28,417
       And I can't see it.

1203
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:29,818
     This leads to my theory

1204
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,920
          Of what it is
 that watterson might be doing,

1205
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:37,459
  And I suspect that some of it
        is about control.

1206
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:39,962
          Comic strips
     are all about control.

1207
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:44,633
      It's the one art form
  where you have full control.

1208
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:47,069
     It's not collaborative
          like a film.

1209
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,871
     It's not collaborative
        even like a book,

1210
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:50,472
        Where your editor
         changes things.

1211
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,408
    I really don't even have
    an editor. It's just me.

1212
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,743
     It's not collaborative
         like a tv show.

1213
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,712
     It's not collaborative
      like a record album.

1214
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,915
   It's you -- it's just you.

1215
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,886
 When you wander into licensing,
   it becomes a collaboration.

1216
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,989
   Somebody at your syndicate
       has to approve it.

1217
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,458
   Somebody at your syndicate
       gives suggestions.

1218
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,127
Somebody at your syndicate says,
     "you know, that's nice,

1219
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,963
 But it'd be better if he smiled
     on the package, right?

1220
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,899
      Smiling sells more."

1221
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,734
    Then it gets in the hand
        of the designer.

1222
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:21,003
The designer has their own ideas
 how the character should look.

1223
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,005
       The designer knows
      what material sells.

1224
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:25,107
       The designer knows
    what materials are safe.

1225
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,809
              Then
  there's the designer's boss,

1226
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,043
  Who may have different ideas,

1227
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,812
       'cause they gave it
        to the salesman,

1228
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:31,447
    And it didn't sell well.

1229
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,081
     So I've just introduced
    seven people into my life

1230
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,583
 That weren't in my life before.

1231
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,885
    I don't particularly like
          any of them.

1232
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:38,687
 They're not my kind of people.

1233
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,456
   They're commercial people,

1234
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,459
 And they make your stomach hurt
     when you're with them.

1235
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,661
  So I've introduced an element
          into my life

1236
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:47,763
   Of a whole bunch of people
          I don't like.

1237
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,198
 I've got to overcome them all,

1238
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,166
      Even if it's so much
         as just saying,

1239
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,068
         "I don't think
       we should do this,"

1240
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,038
 And they say yes, I still have
   to do that to seven people.

1241
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,507
         And that's all
       a loss of control,

1242
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:01,577
        A loss of control
 that I never had before, right?

1243
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,879
           And imagine
    if he started licensing.

1244
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:07,783
  The first lunchbox would have
    sold nine billion, right?

1245
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:11,620
    The minute that happens,
  everybody is gonna be on him

1246
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:15,123
  For all the more, like this,
     that, and the other --

1247
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,493
         All represents
       a loss of control.

1248
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,194
 Then they all sit in your head.

1249
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,196
         Rather than go,
       as he probably did,

1250
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,499
   And walk through the forest
            that day,

1251
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,801
     He took six phone calls
  that he didn't want to take.

1252
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,069
    They interrupted his day.

1253
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,737
     They're floating around
          in his head.

1254
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,573
         That's all bad.
    You know what I'm saying?

1255
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:32,841
       And that's control.

1256
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,577
        That's not about
        artistic purity.

1257
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:38,714
             No, no.
      That's about control.

1258
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,115
      -Well, contractually,

1259
00:58:40,117 --> 00:58:43,051
        We had the rights
 to license "calvin and hobbes"

1260
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,554
     To anything and anyone
          in the world.

1261
00:58:45,556 --> 00:58:49,291
  We had calls from, you know,
  people like steven spielberg

1262
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,860
       And disney studios
       and george lucas.

1263
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,296
  I can go right down the line.

1264
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:58,267
   The potential for products
   worldwide, internationally

1265
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:01,603
        Was, again, huge,
     and we recognized that.

1266
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,539
           Certainly,
   it would have been up there

1267
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,141
   With the licensing revenues
 from "garfield" and "peanuts."

1268
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:08,176
 That was not money just for us.

1269
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,947
    I mean, all the revenues
 would be split 50/50 with bill.

1270
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:14,216
    So the fact that we were,

1271
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:18,086
            You know,
 turning down huge opportunities

1272
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:22,090
 Also meant that he was turning
 down huge opportunities, too.

1273
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:24,126
          -Everyone has
      a different opinion,

1274
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:26,995
  But I think the number is --
     oh -- very, very high,

1275
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:30,198
 Depending on who you're talking
  to and what mood they're in.

1276
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,102
   I've heard many people say
  $300 million to $400 million.

1277
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,871
    I wouldn't be surprised.

1278
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,673
        It could be more,

1279
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,976
 Depending on how far, you know,
     bill was willing to go.

1280
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:46,748
   -Our discussions were very
 involved and sometimes heated.

1281
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,917
   It weighed heavily on him,

1282
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,320
 And I think it became apparent

1283
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:55,657
  In some of the ways in which
the script was being worked out,

1284
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,660
     Some of the story lines
       that bill employed,

1285
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:01,029
   And, you know, the question
   of commercialism versus art

1286
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,798
       And all this stuff

1287
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,666
   That it was clear that bill
   was sending some messages.

1288
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:08,604
 And, you know, we realized that
  we've got to make a decision

1289
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:13,041
   As to, "are we gonna try to
accommodate him and his interest

1290
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:18,313
 "in a reasonable way within the
 context of running a business,

1291
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:22,784
  "or are we gonna, in essence,

1292
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,821
         "beat up one of
 the most important cartoonists

1293
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:28,056
       Of his generation?"

1294
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:30,025
   And we did what we could do

1295
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,794
       To try to work out
    the business arrangement,

1296
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:37,065
      And the good news was
 we got some more time from him.

1297
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:40,268
        But I do believe
        he did come close

1298
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,171
    To just calling one day
    and saying, "that's it."

1299
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:04,092
     -The clichÃ© of building
   an entertainment franchise

1300
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,727
          In any medium

1301
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:08,263
             Is that
   you have to merchandise it.

1302
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,900
 Since he wasn't gonna do that,
 he had to confront the notion

1303
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,103
That people were gonna be making
     their own merchandise.

1304
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:18,240
   -My friends and I even made
 a personal bootleg calvin shirt

1305
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,042
       Just for ourselves.

1306
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:24,980
   And then you started seeing
        calvin being used

1307
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:28,450
  In both religious iconography
  on the back of gang vehicles,

1308
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,885
            I guess,

1309
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,154
        Where it's calvin
    like mourning the cross,

1310
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:34,156
        Pouring some out
       for my dead homies

1311
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:38,260
        Or calvin peeing
     on whatever import car

1312
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:40,862
    The driver doesn't like.

1313
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,731
       But I just thought,
    "who has licensed this?"

1314
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:44,032
   And, of course, no one had.

1315
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,034
 -I remember when I was younger,
            thinking,

1316
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,103
   "I'm really kind of bummed
        that there aren't

1317
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,405
  Any 'calvin and hobbes' toys
     that I can play with."

1318
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,474
    And I remember thinking,
         "I'm a genius.

1319
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:54,443
      People could actually
         make some money

1320
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:57,045
If they made 'calvin and hobbes'
        action figures."

1321
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,880
  And, obviously, at the time,

1322
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,283
  I didn't understand that mr.
  Watterson had made a decision

1323
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,785
    To not license and market
      "calvin and hobbes,"

1324
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:06,188
      And as I've grown up,
      I've respected that,

1325
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,990
       And I realize that
  it would probably cheapen it

1326
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:12,327
 If calvin and hobbes' face were
  on my toothpaste or whatever.

1327
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:15,397
      Because now, for me,
  it exists solely in my books

1328
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,200
    And with me and my hobbes
        in the backyard.

1329
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:21,470
           And I think
that's one of my favorite things

1330
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:25,507
    Is that it's alive to me
 like hobbes is alive to calvin.

1331
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:29,878
   -He made a point of letting
   the comic stand on its own.

1332
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,780
       I know the colors.
       I know the sounds.

1333
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,215
   I have that all in my head.

1334
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:39,020
   And I do really appreciate
    that it's remained that.

1335
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:41,289
          -It won't be
  in the public consciousness,

1336
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,058
 Particularly with young people,

1337
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:48,897
    As much as we older folks
        think it should.

1338
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:55,070
    But it will be remembered
      in the "proper" way,

1339
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:56,972
   Which is based on the work

1340
01:02:56,974 --> 01:03:00,809
    And not because there are
  still hobbes dolls for sale,

1341
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,444
      You know, at target.

1342
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,045
      -I definitely think,

1343
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,515
   By him not allowing anyone
       to merchandise it,

1344
01:03:06,517 --> 01:03:08,116
    The mystique of it grows

1345
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,552
         And the desire
    for those kinds of things

1346
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:13,355
           Or the care
with which it's taken by people.

1347
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:15,957
  You know, people preserve the
  memory of "calvin and hobbes"

1348
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,560
   As something very precious
          and personal,

1349
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:21,363
And I think that has a lot to do
     directly with the fact

1350
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:25,167
   That it wasn't exploited --
    stuffed toys or cartoons

1351
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:27,903
        Or post-it notes
  or sleeping bags or anything.

1352
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:30,405
 -It's pure in it's purest form.

1353
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,175
       It's just his lines
          and his words

1354
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:36,178
             And not
 somebody else's interpretation

1355
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,215
Of how it should look in plastic
      or plush or anything.

1356
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:42,083
            -I think
   it strengthened the strip,

1357
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:43,485
           And I think
     the legacy of the strip

1358
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,353
 Wouldn't be as strong as it is

1359
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:48,957
 If he hadn't focused everything
   he had on making that strip

1360
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:52,327
     The absolute best strip
       that he could make.

1361
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,095
   -The fact that there isn't

1362
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:57,032
    "calvin and hobbes" stuff
 all over the place is really --

1363
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:59,301
  I think that's the reason why
           this strip

1364
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,436
       Is still as popular
         as it is today.

1365
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,208
       -There are two ways
        to look at bill,

1366
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,511
      And I try to keep it
    as objective as possible

1367
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,912
          In the book.

1368
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:13,181
       There's the people
        that look at him

1369
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:17,252
         As a curmudgeon
    and somebody they resent

1370
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,988
     For not sharing himself
      when he was so famous

1371
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,558
    And somebody who did not
   give them what they wanted.

1372
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,360
   That might be like the fact

1373
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,562
That he never made a, you know,
Saturday-morning cartoon special

1374
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:29,130
 That they really wanted to see,

1375
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,166
      Or they didn't allow
    a hobbes doll to be made,

1376
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,934
   And they always wanted one
            as a kid.

1377
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,502
  There's that group of people.

1378
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:36,538
   And then there's the group
   of people that look at him,

1379
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,440
   And, you know, they respect
    his choices that he made

1380
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:40,909
  When it came to merchandising
         and licensing.

1381
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:44,512
   They love him as a writer.
 They respect him as an artist.

1382
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,615
  And those are the two people

1383
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:49,050
       That I was chasing
       at the same time.

1384
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:52,287
  You know, there was somebody
 who was incredibly principled,

1385
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,955
        Who stuck to it,

1386
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:56,124
      And who also happened
   to be incredibly talented.

1387
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,526
 And then there was a guy that,
   like, really turns his back

1388
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,296
          On this whole
     public-persona machine

1389
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,899
    That we've come to expect
          as americans.

1390
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:05,567
               So,
 over the course of the journey,

1391
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,103
    I was rooting for the guy
     that was so principled,

1392
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:10,205
 And yet I was peeved at the guy

1393
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:12,974
     That was not giving me
         what I wanted.

1394
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:16,111
       It was frustrating,
   and yet, at the same time,

1395
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,446
         I couldn't help
        but root for him.

1396
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,383
        You know, I think
   that he made his decisions,

1397
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:23,518
   And I totally respect them.

1398
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,288
     And any personal wants
      that I have from him

1399
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,623
    Are selfishly motivated,

1400
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,192
    And so that's up to him.

1401
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,314
 -I would say my favorite strips
         are on my arm.

1402
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:54,649
 I made sure I got some snowmen
            in there,

1403
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:57,185
      Making fun of girls,
         the silly ones,

1404
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,321
 Some of the imagination stuff,
         where he thinks

1405
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,423
     He's a crocodile here,
     and he's just swimming.

1406
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:04,693
  I try to get a little bit of
  everything -- stupendous man.

1407
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:07,128
 When I was getting this tattoo,

1408
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,331
          I knew a guy
  that could get phone numbers,

1409
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,433
            And I got
 bill watterson's phone number.

1410
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,702
   I wanted to get permission
        to get the tattoo

1411
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:16,304
  So I wouldn't be just as bad
       as the bootleggers.

1412
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:21,076
       But [clears throat]
he didn't return my phone calls.

1413
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:23,011
      I did get it anyway.

1414
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:26,081
         But I feel like
       it's not a bootleg.

1415
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,316
   It's just a labor of love.

1416
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,187
   [ up-tempo bluegrass music
             plays ]

1417
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:02,077
     [ cheers and applause ]

1418
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:06,681
       -People talk about
 kind of the death of cartooning

1419
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:09,851
      Because of, kind of,
   the passing of newspapers.

1420
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:12,087
          But, really,
    we're in a time right now

1421
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,289
 Where it's not just newspapers.
           It's media.

1422
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,723
    Like, media is changing,

1423
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:18,726
    And the way we make money
     from media is changing.

1424
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,563
 Newspaper comics are especially
      interesting, though,

1425
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:24,599
Because they used to be unified.

1426
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,202
 Like, every day, you'd open up,
    and your paper would have

1427
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:30,171
        One or two pages
  devoted to newspaper comics.

1428
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,340
 And, first of all, those pages

1429
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:35,777
 Are getting cut down and shrunk
  more and more as time goes on

1430
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,613
    And as newspaper budgets
        keep getting cut.

1431
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:42,517
So you're not coming to the same
   collective space every day

1432
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:45,286
   To experience the newspaper
           and comics.

1433
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,455
  You know, you can go online,
      if you're interested,

1434
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,125
   And either find the strips
      that you already like

1435
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:51,392
    Or go discover new ones,

1436
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,394
          But it's not
     the kind of same thing.

1437
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,296
   You have to go to one page
           on gocomics

1438
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:56,865
    For "calvin and hobbes,"

1439
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:59,134
   And then you go to another
  independent artist's website

1440
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:00,735
      For their web comic,

1441
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,872
   And then you go to another
 website for another web comic.

1442
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:06,274
 And, you know, you're surfing.

1443
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:07,842
        But you're never
       going to one place

1444
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,744
        To get all those
     different perspectives.

1445
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,713
   And that was the cool thing
          about comics.

1446
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:14,182
  Whether you liked "garfield"
       or "family circus"

1447
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:16,384
      Or the "wizard of id"
     or "calvin and hobbes,"

1448
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,520
   You could come to one page
        in the newspaper

1449
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:20,288
    And experience them all.

1450
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,825
     And because that medium
  is disappearing or shrinking,

1451
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,461
That experience is disappearing,
            as well.

1452
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:30,498
 -There is sort of a high point
   for mass distributed arts,

1453
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,168
        Somewhere between
         the postwar era

1454
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,904
     And probably somewhere
        in the mid '90s.

1455
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:41,509
  And it's been a diminishment
 for tv, for films, for albums,

1456
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,212
   For cartooning, for novels
        ever since then.

1457
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,915
   Because the basic fact is,
          as a culture,

1458
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:50,552
   The means of distribution
   have been so filtered out,

1459
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:53,288
    And the means of creation
    have been so filtered out

1460
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:55,790
     That we're now getting
   tens of thousands of blogs,

1461
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,892
Tens of thousands of web comics,
tens of thousands of small bands

1462
01:09:57,894 --> 01:09:59,727
  That can distribute directly.

1463
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:03,932
   -There simply is no way to
 concentrate people's attention,

1464
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:07,368
  And when it gets concentrated
          on something,

1465
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,904
    It gets concentrated for
  a very short period of time,

1466
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:11,739
    Probably very intensely.

1467
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:15,543
 Everybody is tweeting about it
   and watching it on youtube,

1468
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:19,347
   And then it's gone, because
 the next thing has come along.

1469
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,316
         -You're getting
 all of these incredible voices

1470
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:22,917
         That you never
    would have gotten before,

1471
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:25,386
  But you no longer have those
  water-cooler pieces of art,

1472
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,654
   Where everyone would know,

1473
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:27,922
         Everyone would
      gather around at work

1474
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,624
       And say, "ah. Yeah.
        That's the one."

1475
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:34,462
  -There will no longer ever be
    a, like, rolling stones.

1476
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,798
   There won't be the beatles.

1477
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,400
         There won't be
        an elvis presley

1478
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,704
 For the same reason there won't
 be another "calvin and hobbes."

1479
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:47,609
   The market is digitalizing,
       and it's atomizing.

1480
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:52,347
    So it's being spread over
       a far wider surface

1481
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:55,250
  But in a much thinner layer.

1482
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,751
   -If the "far side" started,

1483
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,487
     Or "calvin and hobbes"
  started today in newspapers,

1484
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:01,823
   It would probably do well,

1485
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,759
        But I don't think
    it would have the impact

1486
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,928
  That it had in the late '80s.

1487
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,397
       -If you can name me
       a cartoon character

1488
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:15,303
That's been invented since 1985,
          that's new --

1489
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:19,841
        From comic page,
      not on television --

1490
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,343
       If you can name me
       a cartoon character

1491
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:24,746
    That is a household term
            or a name

1492
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:26,781
 Throughout this country, truly,

1493
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,484
    That my mother would know
      and that I would know

1494
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:31,319
   And that my kids would know

1495
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:33,755
    And anyone through canada
           would know,

1496
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,456
    I would be very shocked.

1497
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,493
        And I don't think
    it's gonna happen again.

1498
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,894
  So I think calvin and hobbes

1499
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,996
       Are the last great
       cartoon characters.

1500
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,765
       So he nailed that.

1501
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:47,669
     It's great to be first,
 but it's also good to be last.

1502
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:49,537
      -"calvin and hobbes"
         was of its age,

1503
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,906
 And you couldn't transplant it
      elsewhere, you know?

1504
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:53,641
        And, thankfully,
       it <i>was</i> of its age,

1505
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,443
      Which is another way
        of looking at it.

1506
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,512
  Thank god that it <i>did</i> appear
        when it appeared,

1507
01:11:57,514 --> 01:12:00,882
  And thank god that it <i>did</i> run
  when it ran and where it ran,

1508
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:04,385
 Because I don't think it would
   have been near the success,

1509
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:07,822
  Artistically or financially,
     for its worthy creator

1510
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:10,625
   Had it run any other time,

1511
01:12:10,627 --> 01:12:13,494
  Which is both sort of amazing
        and kind of sad,

1512
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,563
       In a way, you know?

1513
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:37,485
     -If you were to ask me
   the question 10 years ago,

1514
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:41,622
"how would his lack of licensing
       affect the strip,"

1515
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:44,992
       I would have said,
       "it's ridiculous.
       It's gonna fail.

1516
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,362
         It's gonna hurt
      the long-term legacy.

1517
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,597
  People will forget the strip
            quickly."

1518
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,533
       Because, you know,
part of snoopy's enduring legacy

1519
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:56,404
     Is that your 4-year-old
     can have a plush snoopy

1520
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:59,107
      And then learn about
   the cartoons and the strip.

1521
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:01,843
        They fall in love
  with the merchandising first

1522
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:05,847
     And then the characters
  and the content and the art.

1523
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:08,015
      So I would have said,
     "it's never gonna work.

1524
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:10,952
 "the strip is gonna go, vanish.
 We'll never hear from it again.

1525
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:13,821
    "and there will be people
   like me, 40 years from now,

1526
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:15,890
       "talking about it
       the same way we do

1527
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:18,793
"about 'krazy kat' and 'pogo' --
      brilliant, wonderful.

1528
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:20,528
 The public has forgotten them."

1529
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,598
  Not with "calvin and hobbes."
         it's universal.

1530
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,768
  It has maintained its quality
          and integrity

1531
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:30,705
  To the point that kids today
 coming up are still reading it.

1532
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:34,475
  How did they learn about it?
 It's in their school libraries.

1533
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:36,744
            That was
    one of the breakthroughs,

1534
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:40,882
   Is that "calvin and hobbes"
 was <i>encouraged</i> by the teachers.

1535
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:43,918
   Teachers spotted the child
         who was calvin

1536
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,655
    And said, "you're calvin.
    I want you to read this."

1537
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:50,958
    And it got them reading.
 And parents encouraged it, too.

1538
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,562
  So I think that that made up
 for a lot of the merchandising

1539
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,898
     That would have helped
          carry it on.

1540
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,168
 That made up for the animation
      that never happened,

1541
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:03,037
       Is that the comic
       was just that good

1542
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,740
      That it could survive
           without it.

1543
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:09,076
        I don't know that
    there is a lot like that.

1544
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:12,847
 -I've lost track of the number
      of 6- and 7-year-olds

1545
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:16,984
  Who list "calvin and hobbes"
 as their favorite comic strip.

1546
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:19,720
       And they know about
       the transmogrifier,

1547
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,989
         They know about
        the time machine,

1548
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,558
      And they know how to

1549
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,561
      Turn a cardboard box
    into absolutely anything.

1550
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,964
     I think there's even a
 generation of kids named calvin

1551
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:34,469
      Because people my age
 are starting to become parents.

1552
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:39,740
    And all it takes, really,
  is seeing that dog-eared copy

1553
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:43,578
   Of "something under the bed
   is drooling" or "yukon ho!"

1554
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:47,181
     At your public library
  or on your school bookshelf.

1555
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:50,551
-I've heard questions like, "why
are people still reading that?"

1556
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,653
      Or "why are the books
       still so popular?"

1557
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,222
      You know, "he hasn't
 been in newspapers in 15 years.

1558
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,790
         Why are people
    still talking about him?"

1559
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,559
         And it's like,
   "'cause it's transcendent."

1560
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,961
    That's the beauty of it.

1561
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:01,529
      And that's, I think,

1562
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:04,532
    Why calvin will be around
    10 years from today, 25,

1563
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:07,535
     Because he talks to us
        on a deeper level

1564
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,704
     Than just a punch line.

1565
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:11,539
     -It's kind of reflected
           in the fact

1566
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,741
     That people can go back
     to "calvin and hobbes"

1567
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,910
   And read them over and over
    and over and over again,

1568
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:17,545
   And they're always joyful.

1569
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,647
       Even when you know
what the punch line is gonna be,

1570
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,249
        It's still funny.
          [ chuckles ]

1571
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,886
  -I feel inspired when I read
  a "calvin and hobbes" strip.

1572
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:27,288
   You know, as a human being,
         I'm just like,

1573
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:29,156
"calvin's enjoying life so much.

1574
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:31,759
        I want to go out
    and enjoy life that way."

1575
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:36,931
  -It can't really be contained
       by print or panels.

1576
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:42,537
 It's a living, breathing thing,
 and I think it always will be.

1577
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:45,806
     He used ink and brushes
      and some watercolors,

1578
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,910
         But, you know,
   he created life with that,

1579
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:53,781
      Which I think is what
  every cartoonist aspires to,

1580
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:56,918
       But not many of us
     ever get to achieve it.

1581
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,889
-"calvin and hobbes" -- there is
   not a single element in it

1582
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:05,059
  That isn't kind of as current
   as it was when it came out.

1583
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,829
   It's all about being a kid.
   It's all about imagination.

1584
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,232
Every single thing's referenced.

1585
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,668
     I don't have to explain
     the context to my kids.

1586
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,803
     They actually live it
     in the same way I did.

1587
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:17,872
       It's not changing.

1588
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:19,640
         And, you know,
      to read "doonesbury"

1589
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:21,876
    Or to read "bloom county"
     or the other, you know,

1590
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,945
   For me, the most important
       things growing up,

1591
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,880
        You need to have
     a sense of the history.

1592
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:28,282
     You need to understand
   the pop culture of the time

1593
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,585
     In a very specific way.

1594
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,286
     And "calvin and hobbes"

1595
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,056
      Just kind of requires
       that you're alive.

1596
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:39,126
          [ chuckles ]
 and it is quite an achievement.

1597
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:40,861
 -You know, I've been fortunate

1598
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:43,130
          To work with
   some wonderful cartoonists,

1599
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:46,100
And, you know, certainly, at the
top of that list has to be bill,

1600
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,236
  Because he was so different,
         so challenging.

1601
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:53,240
He really caused us as a company
     and me as an individual

1602
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:56,777
  To rethink the ways we dealt
         with cartoonist

1603
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,980
And, you know, what our role was

1604
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:02,717
 In helping them get their work
      out into the public.

1605
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,822
         His creativity
  and the result of his efforts

1606
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:10,691
    Were, you know, up there

1607
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:12,627
 With probably the two or three
     or four greatest strips

1608
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:13,961
          Of all time.

1609
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,298
        I think "calvin"
  is something that will last.

1610
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,933
       And, heaven forbid,

1611
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:22,036
          If newspapers
   were to disappear tomorrow

1612
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:24,171
            And books
     were not to be printed,

1613
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:27,208
 There would be some way people
   would want to find his work

1614
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,909
       And read it again,

1615
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,778
Because I think it's that strong

1616
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,980
        And that enduring
        and that special.

1617
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,155
        -Over the years,

1618
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:44,191
 My favorite "calvin and hobbes"
       strip has changed.

1619
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:46,994
         When watterson
 was still writing and drawing,

1620
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,929
My favorite might change weekly,

1621
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,297
   Especially as he continued

1622
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,099
           To put out
    some of his greatest work

1623
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,801
     In the last few years.

1624
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,270
      I have my collection
  of "calvin and hobbes" strips

1625
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,973
           That I love
   for one reason or another.

1626
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:01,108
   But looking back at it all,

1627
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,744
        As much as I love
some of the strips for the humor

1628
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,680
        Or the adventure
       or the amazing art

1629
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,883
    Or the imaginative place
    that the strip took me,

1630
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:11,252
            The strip
   that I can't really forget

1631
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,988
    Is one that nobody else
    has ever mentioned to me

1632
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:16,891
          As a favorite
     or even a notable one.

1633
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:19,060
     When I've described it
         to other fans,

1634
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,328
        I don't often get
     a look of recognition.

1635
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:27,034
 But for me, it's unforgettable,
  and it has a special meaning.

1636
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,770
  I'll never know exactly what
bill watterson's intentions were

1637
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:31,238
        With this strip.

1638
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,873
           I, myself,

1639
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,109
     Can see a few different
    possible interpretations.

1640
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:36,944
 But I can no longer look at it

1641
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:39,380
      Without feeling like
I've glimpsed beyond the surface

1642
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:42,183
        Of a comic strip
     filled with imagination

1643
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:45,352
        And magic and joy
  and adventure and friendship

1644
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:49,090
     And seen instead a hint
  of tremendous disappointment

1645
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:51,892
            And loss.

1646
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,161
       Watterson conceived
         of this strip.

1647
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:56,464
      He wrote it, drew it,
          and inked it

1648
01:18:56,466 --> 01:18:58,766
              Using
    the simplest of tools --

1649
01:18:58,768 --> 01:19:04,238
   Bristol board, 2h pencils,
  a sable brush, and india ink.

1650
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,407
        He handed it over
        to his syndicate

1651
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,009
         For publication
    in newspapers worldwide.

1652
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:11,312
     And millions of readers
          discovered it

1653
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:13,447
          In the paper
      or in one his books,

1654
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,183
      Where we all brought
   our individual experiences

1655
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:19,920
        And perspectives
       into the equation.

1656
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:25,159
 And bill watterson has repeated
    this process 3,160 times.

1657
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:28,229
      Each of these strips
      holds the potential

1658
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:33,100
   To touch someone somewhere
  in a unique and personal way.

1659
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:37,972
   Many of watterson's strips
  mean something special to me.

1660
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,441
     Some bring a huge smile
           to my face,

1661
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:45,846
   Some challenge me to think,
 and a few are more melancholy.

1662
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:49,416
  I see some strips differently
    now than I did as a kid.

1663
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:51,252
    And for me, looking back,

1664
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:55,790
     This strip foreshadows
 the end of "calvin and hobbes."

1665
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,513
        -I just remember
        the announcement.

1666
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:21,882
       I remember reading
        the final comic.

1667
01:20:21,884 --> 01:20:25,386
       I remember knowing
  that that was going to be it

1668
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:30,324
         And that it was
 a really poignant way to end it

1669
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,160
     And true to everything
    he'd built up before it.

1670
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,563
     -I certainly remember
     opening the comic page

1671
01:20:35,565 --> 01:20:37,998
        That last Sunday
     in the <i>chicago tribune</i>

1672
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,501
  And seeing it and being like,
        "wow. It's over."

1673
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,270
    You just weren't used to
    comics ending, you know?

1674
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:46,907
     Like, they kept going.
   That was part of the deal.

1675
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:52,246
        -The final strip
       was the last draw.

1676
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:56,317
   All the elements that made
 the strip wonderful were there,

1677
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,421
      Including the drawing
 that was so much a part of it.

1678
01:21:00,423 --> 01:21:02,489
   There were very few words.

1679
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:04,959
        -Everyone who was
    a "calvin and hobbes" fan

1680
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:07,127
      Remembers two strips.

1681
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:10,097
         One is that one
 that spoke to them individually

1682
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:13,500
       And the last one --
      "let's go exploring!"

1683
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:16,503
 And it was just a wonderful way
       for him to end it.

1684
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,973
     -The way he handled it
        was so wonderful

1685
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:21,075
         With, you know,
       the toboggan ride,

1686
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:24,011
       Which was very much
     a staple of the strip,

1687
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,881
 Going off into just wide-open.

1688
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:29,617
     It wasn't nothingness,
          as I saw it.

1689
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:32,319
     It was everything-ness.

1690
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:34,922
     You know, white is not
     the absence of color.

1691
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:36,891
      White is all colors.

1692
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:40,227
       And you could make
       whatever you wanted

1693
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,429
   Out of that final episode.

1694
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:43,964
         And, honestly,

1695
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:46,233
    How else is a cartoonist
    going to see the world?

1696
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,435
          It has to be
     a big, wide-open world,

1697
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:53,440
     Because until you draw
     your very last strip,

1698
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,577
     You've got to come up
     with a brand-new story

1699
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,580
        Out of that world
        every single day.

1700
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:05,319
    -You know, it was an end
posed as a beginning, basically.

1701
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:08,289
 -There's just something magical
  about that particular strip,

1702
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,590
  Where, you know, it really is

1703
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,492
    Just looking at the world
             afresh.

1704
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:14,428
    I imagine that's what
    bill watterson must have
    felt like, you know,

1705
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,297
        When he finished
       that last strip --

1706
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:19,033
    "it's a magical world.
    Now I can move on.
    What's next in my life?"

1707
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:20,634
   -He's trying to show us all

1708
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:23,404
  That, you know, there's more
  to life than a comic strip,

1709
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:25,039
            I think,

1710
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:27,241
   And trying to make us feel
      a little bit better,

1711
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:28,509
      But it doesn't work.

1712
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,110
     It doesn't work at all.
          [ chuckles ]

1713
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,679
     -It gave the impression

1714
01:22:31,681 --> 01:22:34,949
     That he was going to be
 exploring [laughs] new things,

1715
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,217
       And he probably is
      exploring new things,

1716
01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:39,353
          But he's not
     sharing those publicly,

1717
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:43,090
        And so [chuckles]
         that's too bad.

1718
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:45,259
    -The final strip, for me,

1719
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:48,195
   Is bittersweet in the sense
      that it was the end,

1720
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,998
      But the thought that,
        at the end of it,

1721
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,634
       You're being told,
      "let's go exploring,"

1722
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,602
       Which is something
      I think watterson did

1723
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:57,338
       Throughout his time
          in the strip,

1724
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,373
   Whether it was making leaps
         in the artwork

1725
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,308
   So you had to kind of think
       what was happening

1726
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,644
    In the little white space
       between the panels,

1727
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,279
   Or whether it was the fact

1728
01:23:05,281 --> 01:23:08,015
    That an adventure didn't
   necessarily end succinctly

1729
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:09,216
      At the end of a strip

1730
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:10,684
  So you had to kind of imagine

1731
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,753
    What might have happened
           afterwards,

1732
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:16,023
          He was always
 telling his readers to explore.

1733
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:18,258
      -There is still magic
        in everyday life

1734
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,660
   If you know where to look.

1735
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,329
      And maybe if we look
      in the right place,

1736
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:26,033
   There is something else as
wonderful as "calvin and hobbes"

1737
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:29,703
 Or something that will give us
        that daily magic.

1738
01:23:29,705 --> 01:23:31,605
     But we have to find it.

1739
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:34,641
    It may well be out there,
         as calvin said.

1740
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:38,312
  It's up to us to look for it
       and to discover it.

1741
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:47,588
 -There is that saying that all
good things must come to an end,

1742
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,523
 But I'm not sure I believe it.

1743
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,625
As long as there are new readers

1744
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:54,261
        Being introduced
     to "calvin and hobbes,"

1745
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:56,563
Watterson's legacy will live on.

1746
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:58,599
And with those final three words

1747
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:01,068
      That almost every fan
           can recite,

1748
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:04,138
     So many new adventures
           will begin.

1749
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:16,950
     -So here is a question
           for you --

1750
01:29:16,952 --> 01:29:20,454
    Have you guys or have you
 written a letter to watterson,

1751
01:29:20,456 --> 01:29:23,857
      And if so, you know,
  what was the experience like?

1752
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:26,760
        -I never have --
not when I was younger, not now.

1753
01:29:26,762 --> 01:29:28,028
            -Mm-hmm.

1754
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:31,631
       -I have a word file
         on my computer,

1755
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:33,967
    And it's one line so far.

1756
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:36,603
         All it says is,
      "dear mr. Watterson."

1757
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:38,939
           -[ laughs ]
          very fitting.

1758
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:41,074
     -There is nothing else.
     -Very fitting.

1759
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:42,776
       -Not another word.
