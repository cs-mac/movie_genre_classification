00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,333
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

5
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>I love drinking solo.</i>

6
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:45,768
<i>Since my job entails talking all day,
having this time when I don't have to...</i>

7
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,868
<i>this solitude...
is the best.</i>

8
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:53,169
<i>I have a couple of rules for myself
when I drink solo.</i>

9
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,169
<i>First: I have to drink in a place
with a luxurious atmosphere.</i>

10
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,768
<i>Second: I have to snack on
something luxurious while I drink.</i>

11
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:15,569
<i>Third: I have to drink
with some class.</i>

12
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,069
<i>I must never allow my blood alcohol level
to get above 0.08 percent.</i>

13
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,569
<i>That's the legal
blood alcohol limit.</i>

14
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,968
<i>That's the sweet spot. That's how much
I can drink without feeling cruddy.</i>

15
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,368
Hey!

16
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,669
<i>I hate people like this who
drink too much and black out.</i>

17
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:39,768
<i>A time just for myself.
A time of healing.</i>

18
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:43,868
This is the reason why
I love drinking solo.

19
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:52,368
Wow!

20
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:55,169
Professor Jin! You acted so cold
and yet you're considerate enough

21
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,368
deep down inside to let
me into the joint class!

22
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:05,082
Wow, he's having some
delicious beef tripe, eh?

23
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,135
Looks delicious.

24
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,468
I'm going to eat that too!

25
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:16,468
It looks similar enough, so I'll just
think that it's tripe and eat it.

26
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,169
All right... one.

27
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,368
And here's a huge one!

28
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:29,368
How about a whole ton?

29
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:52,469
Having beer with tripe is the best!

30
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,068
Wow, we even have similar
tastes, Professor Jin!

31
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,436
Shall we have a toast together since
we're in the same joint class now?

32
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,269
Clink!

33
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:10,469
<i>A morpheme is the smallest
linguistic unit that carries meaning.</i>

34
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:14,368
She gets cuter and cuter
the more I look at her.

35
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,969
Hey, Jin Gong Myung.
What are you doing?

36
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,068
Huh? I'm having a drink
while studying hard.

37
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,669
Studying hard, my ass!

38
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,169
How the hell are you going to get
any studying done while drinking?

39
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,769
Also, who told you that you
could touch my alcohol? Huh?

40
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,368
Come on, stop being so petty!

41
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,469
I'm warning you.
Never touch my alcohol again.

42
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:39,769
No, not only that.

43
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,169
Don't touch any of my
things at all! Got that?

44
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,469
All right, already!
Just turn off the lights.

45
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:45,868
I'm going to sleep here.

46
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,368
What do you mean you're sleeping?
Clean this up right now!

47
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:53,068
As you can see, I had two
entire bottles to myself.

48
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:56,269
I'm so dizzy that I can't do anything!

49
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,068
My bad.
I'll clean it up tomorrow.

50
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,169
Oh, I can barely move my body!

51
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,169
Really now?
Don't clean it then.

52
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:07,368
I'll do it.

53
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:09,068
You will?

54
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:13,068
Yeah. It'll be hard for you to go help
out at the orchard starting tomorrow.

55
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,269
This is the least I can do.

56
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:16,568
I'll clean it!
I'll clean it, okay?

57
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,068
Give that here.

58
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:25,469
You're not going to the academy
tomorrow since it's the weekend, right?

59
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,769
I'm going out of town
because of work

60
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,868
so don't you dare cause
any trouble until I get back.

61
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:29,868
So the house will be
empty this weekend?

62
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:31,169
Don't cause any trouble!

63
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,669
If the house looks just
like this when I get back

64
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,368
I'm shipping you over to
the orchard. Got that?

65
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,568
Okay. Go on upstairs.

66
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:38,868
Go on!

67
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,469
So that means that I'll be
the only one here, right?

68
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,469
This is going to be a hell
of a great weekend!

69
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:55,669
If you cause any trouble whatsoever,
I'll straight-up kill you!

70
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,368
Yes, sir.

71
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,078
"I'll straight-up kill you!"

72
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:09,068
Jin Yi, why are teachers
from Seoul going to lecture

73
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,568
at a new academy that opened
outside of the city this weekend?

74
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,769
The instructors teaching in
Seoul are famous nationwide

75
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,368
so it's to help with
marketing, basically.

76
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:19,068
About 1,000 kids will be
gathered together there.

77
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:23,769
So we can promote our academy
and ourselves there too!

78
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,368
So it'll be great
for you too!

79
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:28,969
Yeah, of course! If a teacher from
Seoul visits one of these things once

80
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,068
their street cred goes up and
they are eligible for bigger bonuses!

81
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,669
Wow, you're so lucky!

82
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,269
Yeah. It'd be nice if you
could come with us too!

83
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,969
Too bad it's just me, Professor Jin,
and Professor Min.

84
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,769
It would've been so nice if
the director gave you a chance too

85
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,269
since you're in
the joint class now.

86
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,568
You know, I really don't
like that director of ours.

87
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:50,969
No, it's fine.
I'm just a newbie after all.

88
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,269
Just going to watch you
all is an honor in itself!

89
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,169
Yeah, this is exactly
why I like you.

90
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,769
Because of your
ever-flowing positivity!

91
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,169
Oh yeah, Jin Yi.

92
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,769
Soy fermented crab is
in season right now.

93
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,368
Want to have some
with a little bit of soju?

94
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:07,368
Yeah, I really want to.

95
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:09,568
But I can't drink alcohol
for the time being.

96
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:12,469
To tell you the truth,
I might be pregnant!

97
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,469
What? Oh no!

98
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,476
What do you mean, "oh no"?
I'm so happy right now!

99
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:21,169
You're not even married though!

100
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,169
What could possibly be
good about that?

101
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,068
Exactly. Since I'm not married,
this will definitely lead to marriage!

102
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,969
My darling Min Ho kept
pushing marriage back

103
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,068
because he said he didn't
feel financially secure enough.

104
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:33,969
So I just went
and pounced on him!

105
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,469
Hey, who cares about that
kind of nonsense at this age?

106
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,320
Being childless is an even bigger
issue than financial insecurity!

107
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,469
Are you... sure that
you're pregnant?

108
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,469
Yeah. My menstrual cycle
is always predictable.

109
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:46,068
But it's three days late now!

110
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:49,368
So I thought it was strange
and looked up symptoms.

111
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,269
And... the results
were positive!

112
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:54,068
I've been irritable
because of that, and look.

113
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:58,469
My chest got even
bigger than usual, right?

114
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,769
- Oh, Jin Yi!
- What?

115
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:06,435
I'm going to see a doctor as soon
as I get back from Yeosu.

116
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:10,169
Then... maybe the dream I had last
night was a baby-related dream?

117
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,169
A baby-related dream?

118
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,769
Oh my gosh! No, it's because
I had a dream last night

119
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,468
and I was collecting tons of
clams from the seashore.

120
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,669
Oh! Does that mean it'll be
a daughter since I saw clams?

121
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:22,769
Oh my gosh!

122
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:25,968
Oh, just a second.

123
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,369
Yes, Director?
Where are you again?

124
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,269
Yes, Chief Kim.
So you've arrived?

125
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,568
Okay. Watch over the part-timers and make
sure the preparations go okay.

126
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,369
We'll be leaving
in 10 minutes or so.

127
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:38,568
Okay.

128
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,968
Why isn't Professor Min here yet?
It's almost time for the train!

129
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,269
Oh my gosh!

130
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,769
What is this now?

131
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,169
Oh, Director.
Youse tired, aren't 'cha?

132
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,269
- Huh?
- What is this?

133
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,169
Are you Lee Byung Hun
from "Inside Men" today?

134
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:56,269
Wow, you're right
on the mark!

135
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,468
Wait, so you're going to go
to Yeosu looking like that?

136
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:02,169
You go to Yeosu, Professor Hwang.

137
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:06,369
I'm going to Moil Island
and have me a drink.

138
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,769
Oh, really, now?

139
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:13,568
I reckon the train for Moil Island
is over there, so don't follow us.

140
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,500
You're embarrassing us, damn it.
Come on. Let's go.

141
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,568
Oh, Professor Jin isn't here yet.

142
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,269
He said he'd come by
himself in his own car.

143
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,369
Figures. He even drinks alone.
Let's all go, then.

144
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:29,068
What the hell are you doing?
Move this arm of yours!

145
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,468
Hey! Move!

146
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,468
I think Mr. Lee Byung Hun
is asking for a tip.

147
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,468
Geez, you're so ridiculous.

148
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,468
Let me see here.

149
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,169
Stop it already!

150
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,769
- Stop it!
- I'll end you!

151
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,068
Excuse me.

152
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:56,269
Here we go.
This is the spot.

153
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:58,769
We should've just gotten
a cab. What is this?

154
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,968
Hey, I barely managed to
get these seats, okay?

155
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,568
There aren't any seats
because it's the weekend.

156
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,968
Hand that over.
I'll put it up.

157
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,468
What the heck is in there?

158
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:16,269
Wait a second.
Where's my laptop?

159
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,369
Where's my laptop?

160
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,169
- It's not in there.
- Did you leave it in the café?

161
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,369
Oh, yeah! The café! I asked them
to charge it and forgot to get it back!

162
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,769
I'll be right back.

163
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,769
Wait! The train leaves at 10:00 a.m.
sharp! We only have five minutes!

164
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:36,068
Really? Oh no! I have all of the
information about our academy there!

165
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,068
Ha Na, you go.

166
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,068
You can go there and get
back within five minutes, right?

167
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,269
- What?
- Really?

168
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,769
Of course! You can run 100
meters in 17 seconds, right?

169
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,568
And you were always the
best at running back in school!

170
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,269
That was a long time ago!

171
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,769
What are you doing?
Run, damn it!

172
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,269
- What?
- Run!

173
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:51,769
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

174
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,968
- What's going on?
- Run, Professor Park! Run!

175
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:56,769
Run!

176
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,968
Our director... no. A man in his forties
asked you guys to charge his laptop.

177
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,468
Oh!

178
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,068
- Is this it?
- Yes! Thank you!

179
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,068
There's one minute
before it leaves!

180
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,792
No! No!

181
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:57,769
No!

182
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,468
Oh no!
Damn it!

183
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,468
No!

184
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:12,369
Excuse me, can you get me a KTX ticket
for Yeosu? The earliest one possible.

185
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,968
The earliest one is
the 4:00 p.m. train.

186
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,468
Isn't there one that leaves
any earlier that that?

187
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,468
I'm sorry, but the trains before
that one are all booked.

188
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,068
Man, but the lecture starts
at 4:00 p.m.! What do I do?

189
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,769
Yes, Director?

190
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,269
Yes, but the earliest train
is leaving at 4:00 p.m. What do I do?

191
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,169
Yes, Director?

192
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:53,568
I was just about to leave.

193
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:57,568
What?
What do you...

194
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:02,669
No thank you. Why should I
have to take No Geu Rae in my car?

195
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:05,968
It's not like she's lecturing.
Just send her home.

196
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,468
Your laptop has
nothing to do with me!

197
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,968
At any rate, I won't be
driving her down to Yeosu with me.

198
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,769
Just be aware of that.

199
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,968
Take No Geu Rae and diminish
my own quality? No thanks.

200
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,468
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,369
I know you wanted to drive
down there leisurely

202
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:35,468
which is why you
didn't take the train

203
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,369
so I'm sorry to be a nuisance.

204
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:42,468
Whatever. To be precise, the one
who was a nuisance was the director.

205
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,068
How could he leave his laptop
behind? He's so careless.

206
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,769
But still, I'm sorry.

207
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,169
At any rate, I'll be totally silent.

208
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:56,568
Well, that's that, but...
why didn't you tell me the truth?

209
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,769
Excuse me?
What do you mean?

210
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,369
About the promotional wet wipes
and the gift certificates.

211
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,468
It seems like you were
not aware of either.

212
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,169
So why didn't you say anything,
when I got angry at you?

213
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,369
Apologize.

214
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:08,369
What?

215
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:13,169
Why do I need to apologize for that?

216
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,369
Of course you need to!

217
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:19,669
Thanks to you, I was made out to be the
crazy one who had one-sided assumptions!

218
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:25,568
Oh, um, sure.
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,068
- Is that why?
- What?

220
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,769
What do you mean?

221
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,568
Did you let me into the joint class
since you yelled at me for no reason?

222
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,169
I was actually quite curious.

223
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,769
Why did you change your mind when
you were so adamantly opposed to it?

224
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,068
There's no other reason.

225
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:46,169
Shall I just say that I saw
a sliver of potential in you?

226
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,669
What?
Wait, really?

227
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,068
What's with that expression?

228
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:55,968
I'm just so happy!

229
00:14:55,968 --> 00:15:00,169
I've just been getting
insulted by you all this time.

230
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,769
So to hear you say that you
saw a sliver of potential in me

231
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,968
I'm so touched!

232
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,269
Stop overreacting!

233
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,369
I didn't say "potential."
I said "a sliver of potential."

234
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,369
A sliver.

235
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,169
So what? The important thing is
that you saw any potential in me at all!

236
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,169
I told you to stop overreacting!

237
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,269
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:27,068
But... I can't help it.
My mouth keeps smiling on its own.

239
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:46,769
Wait right here.
I'm going to get some coffee.

240
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:51,269
Um, Professor Jin!

241
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,369
You must be tired. Please get some
rest. I'll go get the coffee.

242
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:55,968
No thanks.

243
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:59,269
I have no intention of having you
buy me coffee when you earn so little.

244
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:02,468
Come on! I may only be earning
30,000 won per hour now

245
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:04,769
but I have the potential
to earn more later on!

246
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,468
I'm grateful to you for letting me into
the joint class and for the ride, too.

247
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:11,468
I, who has a sliver of potential, really
want to buy you a cup of coffee.

248
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,769
What would you like to drink?

249
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,968
An Americano like how chic you look?

250
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:18,769
Or a caffé latte
like how smooth you are inside?

251
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,369
Just get whatever.

252
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:24,369
Yes! I, who have a sliver of potential,
will go and buy some right now!

253
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,569
What should I eat?

254
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,629
Yeah, Gong Myung?

255
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:57,069
What? Why a drive
all of the sudden?

256
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,169
Oh... your Big Bro's car?

257
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:02,069
Okay. Come to the front
of my student hostel, then.

258
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,369
Okay.

259
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,169
What manners!
I wanted it first.

260
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,567
I picked it up first.

261
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,669
It's still mine, though!

262
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,468
No, it's not!
It's mine!

263
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,368
Why, you little--

264
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:33,768
Wow.

265
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,768
Hey! Go halfsies with me.

266
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:40,169
Let's be fair. Share.

267
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:44,468
Wow. Hey, Jung Chae Yeon!

268
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:49,468
You think you're hot because guys
are throwing themselves at you here?

269
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,768
Get it together, all right?
You're totally ugly!

270
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:57,368
You're... you're uglier
than this scrubber, here!

271
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,067
You're uglier
than this damn scrubber!

272
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:05,768
Yeah, wait. No.
You're uglier than this crushed can.

273
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,468
You're not the top beauty.
You're like the top beast!

274
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:10,968
Shut it. Go back to your room
and study or something.

275
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,968
It seemed like you're going
on a drive or whatever.

276
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:16,468
But if you came all the way to
Noryangjin to study, then study.

277
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,669
Why is it any of your business what I
do, whether it may be a walk or a drive?

278
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:23,468
Also, is "If you came all the way to
Noryangjin to study, then study"

279
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:24,768
all you know how to say?

280
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:28,169
Ugh, you're more like
the "Top Despicable Person!"

281
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,868
Geez. Just you watch,
Top Despicable Person.

282
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,268
If that ever happens again, I'll put
the ramen packet in my underwear!

283
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:50,468
Man... I'll bet that Dong Young is locked
up in here and won't come out.

284
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,268
What a pathetic guy.

285
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,768
What the...

286
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,468
He didn't lock it?

287
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,268
This bastard.

288
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:09,567
Looks like he's still stealing food
out of the hostel's cabinets as usual.

289
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,169
Now, let's see here...

290
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,169
<i>Joo Yeon, I truly loved you.</i>

291
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:24,067
<i>You should completely forget
about a guy like me and be happy.</i>

292
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:29,669
<i>Mom, Big Sis, older brothers... thanks
for looking out for me all this time.</i>

293
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,067
<i>I really wanted to repay the
money you lent me after I passed</i>

294
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,768
<i>but it looks like I'm leaving
you without being able to do so.</i>

295
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:36,368
What the hell is this fool up to?

296
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:38,368
<i>My friends
Gong Myung and Ki Bum...</i>

297
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:41,169
<i>I'm sure that it was tough on you to
look after a pathetic guy like me.</i>

298
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:46,485
<i>I'll be reborn as a rich guy in my
next life and buy you tons of alcohol.</i>

299
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,669
<i>I don't know who will discover
this letter, but don't look for me.</i>

300
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:54,067
<i>I'll already be eternally
slumbering in the ocean.</i>

301
00:19:56,468 --> 00:20:00,669
What does he mean eternally
slumbering in the ocean?

302
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,368
Why are you watching
someone else sleep?

303
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:14,067
Just because.
You look pretty when you're sleeping.

304
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,768
What the hell are you saying, you
crazy bastard? It's too early for this!

305
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:18,268
You can have this.

306
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:20,169
You know that this is my
favorite shirt, right?

307
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:22,968
What's with this cruddy gift
that I never asked for?

308
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,169
Do you want me to use this
as a rag or something?

309
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:28,468
Take this and go away
before I kick you!

310
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,067
You damn idiot.

311
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:36,567
Fine. Just keep making
funny jokes like that

312
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,067
and live your life as
a good, earnest person.

313
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,968
What kind of craziness are you
spouting so early in the morning?

314
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,268
Ki Bum. Let me hug you, just once.

315
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:48,567
What are you doing?
Why are you acting like this?

316
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,868
Seriously, what's with you?

317
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:54,567
Didn't you say you were heading to Yeosu
for your part-time job at the academy?

318
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,768
I'm going to get going
now to Yeosu.

319
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:01,567
To the ocean.

320
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:05,169
So he was planning to
drown himself in the ocean?

321
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,468
After leaving behind
a suicide note?

322
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:11,368
Damn it, I should've noticed
when he was acting up before!

323
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,067
He's probably not
dead already, right?

324
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:17,268
Oh yeah. This bastard
doesn't have a phone.

325
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,868
Damn it!

326
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:25,567
Yes, Director.
Yes, we're on our way now.

327
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:30,067
Yes. Yes.

328
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:32,169
Oh my!
Oh my!

329
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:34,067
What are you doing?

330
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:37,567
Yes, Director. I'll give you
a call once we get there. Yes.

331
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,768
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you
because I was on the phone.

332
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,567
But why are you sitting on this side?

333
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,209
You drive from this point on,
Ms. No Geu Rae.

334
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,209
What? Me?

335
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:48,768
Is there another No Geu Rae here?
Of course I mean you!

336
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:50,768
I'm tired, so I need
to get some rest.

337
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,169
Why are you standing there like that?
You're not going to do it?

338
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,468
Well, um... I'm afraid I'll get into
an accident with your expensive car.

339
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:08,968
So are you telling
me that you can't right now?

340
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:13,368
Um, no! I, who have
a sliver of potential, will try!

341
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,968
A person with potential
can overcome any obstacle!

342
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,169
Yes! I'll do my best to drive!

343
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,067
Yes, me, who have potential!

344
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:24,468
You would think that I asked
her to cover for a Formula One driver.

345
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,067
Such a low-quality human being...

346
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,368
Ms. No Geu Rae.

347
00:22:38,368 --> 00:22:40,368
You're driving a bit too
slowly, don't you think?

348
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,768
Do you think we'll be able to make
it to Yeosu today at this rate?

349
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:44,368
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

350
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,567
Ms. No Geu Rae!
Aren't you driving too fast?

351
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,567
I said we're going to Yeosu,
not the afterlife!

352
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,169
Are you trying to kill us?

353
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:58,468
Oh, yes! I'm sorry!

354
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,169
Geez... are you serious?

355
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,968
Are you trying to get revenge
on me for asking you to drive

356
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:05,968
with this shoddy driving?

357
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,468
No, of course not!
Why would I do that to my mentor?

358
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:10,772
- Mentor?
- Yes!

359
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:13,268
Just like Oh Geu Rae in
"Misaeng" had Manager Oh

360
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,567
I, the Oh Geu Rae of Noryangjin,
have you, Professor Jin!

361
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,468
You even said that I had potential!

362
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:21,067
So I'll consider you
my mentor from now on.

363
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,968
No thanks. Just drive
properly, please.

364
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:26,468
Geez. Having you drive is making me
more tired than driving myself.

365
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:28,468
Just stop at the next rest stop.
I'll drive the rest of the way.

366
00:23:28,468 --> 00:23:32,468
No, it's fine! I, who have potential,
will get it together and drive well!

367
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:34,268
Trust me, who has potential!

368
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:45,968
Dong Young...
please be alive! Please!

369
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,468
Step on it, man!
Let's go!

370
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,968
Hey, what if I get into
an accident doing that?

371
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:53,768
Big Bro loves this car!
If he knows I took it out, I'm dead!

372
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,067
If I run into him in Yeosu,
I'm really done for.

373
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,868
Why would we run into him there?

374
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,468
I told you, there's a reason why!

375
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:01,669
He can't be dead already, right?

376
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,268
Dong Young! You can't die!

377
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,268
Stop overreacting, man!
He wouldn't die!

378
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,169
How could you say that
after reading this?

379
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,868
Want me to read it
for you again?

380
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:12,468
"Joo Yeon, I truly loved you."

381
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:15,768
"You should completely
forget about a guy like me and..."

382
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,768
Dong Young!

383
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:19,567
Geez, seriously?

384
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,468
If I knew things would end up like this,
I would've given him a huge hug!

385
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:24,768
I would've accepted
his shirt that said "Kick"

386
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:28,268
instead of telling him to
go away before I kicked him!

387
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,968
Hey, stop crying, already!

388
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:34,169
If I knew things would end up like
this, I would've been nicer to him!

389
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,768
I cursed him out like crazy the other day
for drinking all the soup in the ramen

390
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,567
and said that he was a
bastard without a conscience!

391
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:40,768
I shouldn't have done that!

392
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:45,268
And when he said he'd poop in my room
because the hostel's toilet was clogged

393
00:24:45,268 --> 00:24:49,567
I shouldn't have told him to piss off
and let him poop in peace!

394
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,968
Dong Young!

395
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,169
Damn it, this crazy bastard!

396
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:55,567
I told you, stop crying!

397
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:10,968
I'll get out here, so come
upstairs after you park.

398
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,968
And make sure you park in a wide spot
so my car doesn't get scratched.

399
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,768
Wait! I'm not good at parking.

400
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:17,567
So are you telling me that you can't?

401
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,968
What?

402
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:25,768
Um, no. I, who have potential,
will park this car well.

403
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:29,567
People with potential don't
give up on anything easily!

404
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,968
I, who have potential, will do
my very best to park!

405
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,768
Oh, darn.
What do I do?

406
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:08,169
Wow.

407
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:11,768
She loves the word
"potential" that much?

408
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:15,669
I thought she was a wily fox, but
she's actually a sucker for compliments.

409
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:21,768
I thought he'd refuse until the end,
but he went to pick you up?

410
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:23,067
Wow! How uncharacteristic
of that premium trash.

411
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,768
I'm not going to call him
premium trash anymore.

412
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:29,567
He's not premium trash to me
anymore. He's something else now.

413
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,089
- He's my "Premium Savior."
- What?

414
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,218
- "Savior?"
- Yes.

415
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,368
At first, he treated me like trash
because of my credentials

416
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:38,468
but he ended up putting me
in his joint class too.

417
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:39,768
Yeah, I know! He said he wouldn't
allow it over his dead body.

418
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,067
I wonder why he changed his mind?

419
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:45,368
Well... he said that
he saw my potential!

420
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:49,268
Wow, you must be so happy!

421
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:54,169
Oh, what's wrong, Jin Yi?
Does your stomach hurt?

422
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,968
No. I think the baby is stressed out
because of the long train ride.

423
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,968
Were you tired,
my poor Cherry?

424
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:04,968
Cherry?

425
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:06,368
That's her name for
when she's in the womb.

426
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,768
- Cherry.
- Oh.

427
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,169
You said that you think it'll be
a girl based on your dream too.

428
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:11,468
Do you really want a girl?

429
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:14,768
No, it's because my honey
and I conceived her at Cherry Hotel.

430
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,968
Oh man! How embarrassing!

431
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:22,868
What? Oh, you.

432
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:29,067
Yes? Yes, I'll be right there.

433
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,067
It's starting soon!

434
00:27:32,468 --> 00:27:35,567
If my belly gets bigger,
it won't be long

435
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,968
before I can't lecture with
this perfect body anymore, right?

436
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,768
How do I look?
Do I look good?

437
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:43,268
You look amazing!

438
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,368
They said that we'll be giving
autographs after the lecture too.

439
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,468
Hello, everyone!

440
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,169
We can do it!
English grammar.

441
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:55,368
My name is Hwang Jin Yi.

442
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:03,268
All right, everyone.
English is so, so hard

443
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:05,567
that your chests were
filled with worry, right?

444
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,567
Don't you worry about
a thing anymore.

445
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,768
After all, I, Hwang Jin Yi, am here!

446
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:17,567
Even those whose grades
have dropped like this...

447
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:21,768
can have them go up like this.

448
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,868
Oh, my hip.

449
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:27,468
I'll get your grades up like this!

450
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:31,169
Just trust me!
Follow me.

451
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,468
Thank you!
Thank you!

452
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:39,368
Aw, geez.

453
00:28:39,368 --> 00:28:41,268
Are all of youse good today?

454
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:43,968
I'm our academy's Lee Byung Hun,
Min Jin Woong.

455
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:45,768
Hey there.

456
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:51,968
So you want to know what makes me
our academy's Lee Byung Hun, eh?

457
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:55,169
I'm an "inside man," you see.

458
00:28:55,169 --> 00:29:01,368
So I'll expose all of the "insider" top
secret information to you in my classes!

459
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:03,768
Hey, you. Yeah, you.
The one falling asleep.

460
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,268
Go to a deserted island and get
yourself a drink of water or somethin'.

461
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:07,768
Naw, naw.

462
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:11,368
Go have some cold noodles, instead

463
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:16,468
Wait, no. Don't yawn. Go to bibimbap
and have a bowl of Jeonju!

464
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:20,368
All right, everyone. Korean History
is all about memorization.

465
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:24,169
You must not memorize
things in a foolish way.

466
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:26,768
Then how must you
memorize things, you may ask?

467
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,968
First, understand the flow.
Then, memorize things.

468
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,368
You must understand
the flow of things first

469
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:34,468
and then memorize
things after that.

470
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:39,169
I'll tell you how to understand the flow
and what you must memorize.

471
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:40,968
I don't drone on.
I only talk about the heart of things.

472
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:42,968
As for the questions...

473
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:46,368
<i>Wow. Look at that charisma.</i>

474
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,768
<i>He really isn't a top-level
instructor for nothing!</i>

475
00:29:48,768 --> 00:29:51,067
<i>To think that someone like that
acknowledged my potential!</i>

476
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:54,268
<i>Yeah. I'll only walk on
a nice path from now on.</i>

477
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:56,880
Therefore, if you just take
my classes diligently

478
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,169
you can get top scores
in Korean History without a problem.

479
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,169
I hope that you will
put your trust in me.

480
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,067
<i>Yes, I trust you.
I completely trust you!</i>

481
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,468
Can I take a photo?

482
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:15,468
Go ahead.

483
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:18,768
Thank you!

484
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,468
Can you hug me just once
so that I'll do well on my exams?

485
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:25,768
Oh, sure.

486
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:29,169
I hope you pass!
Good luck!

487
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,067
Autographs only, okay?

488
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:34,968
Here's Professor Min who teaches Public
Administration! Anyone taking that?

489
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,669
Professor Min is here!

490
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,968
Yes, yes, come.

491
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:44,468
Oh, Student! You must be so
tired from all your studying!

492
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,169
Sit. Have a seat.

493
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,468
Here. I'll massage you before
I give you my autograph, okay?

494
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:51,368
- Oh, geez.
- Ow.

495
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,067
- I'm not even massaging you that hard.
- That's not it!

496
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:56,968
I want to get Professor Jin's
autograph, but I don't have a pen.

497
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,567
Can you lend me one?

498
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:03,768
- Just take 'em all.
- Thank you!

499
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:06,968
Looks like my style is
being cramped a bit, eh?

500
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,669
What the hell? I feel like
we're just leftovers.

501
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,468
Yeah. Aw, man.

502
00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:15,968
Maybe I shouldn't have done
the Lee Byung Hun impression?

503
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,768
Maybe I should've chosen
something younger and more popular?

504
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:19,468
Now you're blaming
Lee Byung Hun of all people?

505
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:27,468
Hey! Would a guy who said he'd die
just be working here calmly?

506
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,268
He said that he'd be eternally
slumbering in the ocean

507
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:30,768
so shouldn't we look there first?

508
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:32,968
Hey, how are we going to search
that huge ocean in such little time?

509
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,368
Let's just search the other places first.

510
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:36,169
And if he's dead, he won't be here.

511
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,768
Hurry! Go look!

512
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:39,468
Got it.
You look over there.

513
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:41,067
- I'll look here!
- Okay.

514
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,368
Damn it all... he has to be
here somewhere.

515
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:53,567
Who does he think he is, a celebrity?

516
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:59,567
Huh? Wait a second.
Someone get Professor Jin some water!

517
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,768
- Hey, part-timer!
- I'll get it.

518
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,567
- Okay, then. Go.
- Korean teacher!

519
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,468
- It's a shame--
- Ow!

520
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:06,468
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:07,768
- Oh, are you all right?
- Yes.

522
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:09,067
- You're not hurt, are you?
- No, I'm fine.

523
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,067
Are you okay,
Professor Park?

524
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,468
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm fine. Are you really okay?

525
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,427
Hey! I found Dong Young!

526
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:21,468
- Huh?
- Hurry!

527
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:25,169
That bastard.
Why, I ought to--

528
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,368
- Hey!
- You!

529
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,768
What the.. what are
you doing here?

530
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:37,067
How could you ask that when you
disappeared after writing a suicide note?

531
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:38,468
- You think we'd just sit still?
- How could you think about dying?

532
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:39,768
Who the hell cares
about some damn woman?

533
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,968
What do you mean, some damn woman?
She was my everything.

534
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:46,268
I don't have any desire to live
on without her in my life.

535
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,768
Shut up. Why would you be
working part-time here then?

536
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:52,316
I may be leaving,
but I can't be irresponsible.

537
00:32:52,316 --> 00:32:53,569
I'm going to tie up all my
loose ends before I go.

538
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,168
And just where the hell do
you think you're going?

539
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:56,768
Don't be like that, you bastard!

540
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,569
- Dong Young.
- Yes, sir?

541
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:02,968
Good work. I have to go
back to Seoul, so I'll pay you now.

542
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,468
This is the something special
that I mentioned last time.

543
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:06,569
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, good work.

544
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,968
Um, sir?

545
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:09,968
Yeah?

546
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:12,868
You're short 10,000 won.

547
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,368
Oh, really?

548
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:16,121
Here.

549
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:19,281
- Keep up the good work.
- Goodbye.

550
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:29,368
Even though I may be leaving,
I don't want to go empty-handed.

551
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:31,569
And just where do you
think you're going?

552
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,968
Stop saying such scary things,
you pitiful bastard!

553
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:38,568
I thought you were dead!

554
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,273
<i>[Yeosu Briefing Session]</i>

555
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:50,068
All right, then.
Good work, everyone.

556
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:54,030
Unpack your things at our accommodations
and let's have a drink.

557
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,568
We're all the way
in Yeosu, after all.

558
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:56,968
No thank you.

559
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,968
Why? Are you going to drink by yourself
again even though we're here?

560
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:02,117
Yes. I'll drink alone.

561
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,329
I like it that way.

562
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,550
Then.

563
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,608
Get home safely.
Rest well!

564
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:10,209
Gosh, he's being so difficult.

565
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:14,168
Oh well, we will just go
drink without him then.

566
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,106
I will go change
into something comfortable first.

567
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,693
Director Kim.

568
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:19,488
Hey, Directer Choi!

569
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:21,668
Including Professor Jin

570
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,059
you came all the way here
with good instructors.

571
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,178
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.

572
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:28,159
We're one family,
so we should help each other.

573
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,477
I appreciate that.

574
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,588
Ah, I almost forgot.
For your efforts today

575
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,428
it's not much, but please take this.

576
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,809
Why are you doing this?

577
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,439
Don't do that and please take it.

578
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,088
Come on, it's okay.

579
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,979
Thank you then.

580
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:45,008
I wish the Yeosu academy
all the best. Good luck!

581
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:46,409
Good luck!

582
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:50,159
By the way, the Korean professor
Choi Yoon Hee was supposed to come.

583
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,209
- She didn't come, huh?
- Professor Choi?

584
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,448
She recently quit.

585
00:34:54,448 --> 00:34:55,546
What?

586
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,439
She's the Korean instructor
working on the eighth floor.

587
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:02,718
Until recently, she wanted
to join our joint class.

588
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:04,048
She quit her job?

589
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,119
You didn't know that?

590
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,448
Her husband is being
transferred overseas.

591
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:07,769
She's following him, so she quit.

592
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:11,258
That's how Professor Park
got in instead of her.

593
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:14,289
If not, why would
Professor Jin take her in?

594
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:15,697
- What?
- What?

595
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,488
Gosh, why are you doing this?

596
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,048
I said I want to be alone.

597
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:27,428
What do you mean you want to be alone?

598
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:28,798
You'll jump in the water, won't you?

599
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:30,269
You can't go anywhere today.

600
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,269
Stay with me at all times. Got that?

601
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:35,079
Hello.

602
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,010
Please have a look and order.

603
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,928
Let's just eat first.
What would you like to eat?

604
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,229
The least expensive dish.

605
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,780
Then it's halibut and squid.

606
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,896
I will order it then.

607
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,704
Seriously, what should we do with him?

608
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,914
Hey, what's the most expensive dish here?

609
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,119
- The most expensive dish?
- Yes.

610
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,159
It's a croaker.

611
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,514
- A croaker?
- Yes.

612
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,360
Excuse me, please bring us
a large croaker sashimi.

613
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,639
Are you crazy?

614
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,608
Don't worry. I got it.
Who knows?

615
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,968
If he tries something expensive
and delicious that he hasn't tried

616
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:05,331
he might be motivated to go on.

617
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,999
Don't do anything stupid.

618
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,648
I really have no desire to live.

619
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,209
You punk, seriously.

620
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,139
Hey.

621
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,209
Don't do that.

622
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,418
When the dish comes out, just try it.

623
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:18,485
I'm okay.

624
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,329
He wanted to die earlier,
but now he has a big appetite, huh?

625
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:32,394
Don't do that.

626
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:38,389
This will be the last sashimi
I will try on this earth, right?

627
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:39,689
Is that why?

628
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:41,229
It's better than I expected.

629
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,988
Hey, stop talking and live it up.

630
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:46,959
Joo Yeon isn't
the only woman in the world.

631
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,369
Hey, you said
her boobs were a size C cup.

632
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:50,968
Now that you two broke up

633
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:56,508
it opens the possibility of you
finding women with a D or E cup.

634
00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:58,729
It means nothing if it's not Joo Yeon.

635
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,383
I will end my life.

636
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,970
Excuse me,
can you bring us the fish stew now?

637
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,428
When you're about to end your life,
you ask for a fish stew?

638
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,488
Be quiet.

639
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,726
It's all good as long as he eats well.

640
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:11,639
Excuse me, please make it spicy.

641
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,639
No, make it clear and not spicy.

642
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:18,729
My stomach has been
bothering me recently.

643
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:20,954
My doctor told me not to eat spicy food.

644
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,709
When you're about to die,
you worry about your stomach?

645
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,490
Stop it, punk.

646
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:30,977
I will go to the bathroom.

647
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,229
Sure, do that.

648
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:34,771
- Go.
- Okay.

649
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,599
Why do you keep questioning him?

650
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,278
What if he really ends his life?

651
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:40,428
Hold on.

652
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:42,758
Is it okay to send him
to the bathroom alone?

653
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:45,159
What if he bites his tongue and dies?
I will go check.

654
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,405
Hey, it's okay.

655
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:48,398
If he were thinking about dying,
would he order a fish stew?

656
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:51,189
He wouldn't kill himself
because he wants to eat the stew.

657
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:53,048
Gosh, I can't even drink because of him.

658
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:54,439
What's this about?

659
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,678
He wanted to die earlier, but he's
the one who is having most fun now.

660
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:03,697
Be quiet.

661
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,073
You're right.

662
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,318
This will be the last ride I will enjoy.

663
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:11,970
Is that why?

664
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:13,238
This is more fun than I thought.

665
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:15,358
Why do you keep saying
it's the last time?

666
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,008
Please change your mind.

667
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,439
I told you.

668
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:21,262
My life without Joo Yeon is meaningless.

669
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,878
I will fly away like this.

670
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,309
High and above.

671
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:29,249
Don't do that, Dong Young.

672
00:38:29,249 --> 00:38:30,789
Where would you fly away to?

673
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:31,869
Ki Bum.

674
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:33,659
Don't try to stop me.

675
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,278
God, please forgive me for making
the wrong decision to end my life.

676
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:40,599
But I can't go on without Joo Yeon.

677
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,329
Stop it and sit down. It's dangerous.

678
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,079
Gong Myung, I have nothing to fear.

679
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,028
I have nothing to
look forward to in this world.

680
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:48,885
I said, just sit down already.

681
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:50,782
Hey!

682
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:55,776
I almost died!

683
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,418
What was that? You said you'd die.

684
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:04,619
Now you're scared?

685
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,148
Well, what do you mean I'm scared?

686
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,577
Park Ha Na.

687
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,599
Do you still feel grateful
to Jin Jung Seok?

688
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,999
He's your premium savior?

689
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,349
I take it back.

690
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:33,849
He's undoubtedly premium trash.

691
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,702
So...

692
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:39,088
when he made you fill in for the
Korean instructor on the eighth floor

693
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:41,389
he went on and on
saying you had potential and all

694
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:43,818
he made you all happy.

695
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,878
Can he play someone like this?

696
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:48,394
He's a bastard and premium trash.

697
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:52,468
Oh my, I should use only nice words.

698
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:55,010
Oh my, it's not good for my baby.

699
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,548
I'm sorry, baby.

700
00:39:58,553 --> 00:39:59,811
Mommy is very sorry.

701
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,126
You must be furious.

702
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,742
I wish I could drink with you.

703
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,749
Now I can't drink when things are sad.

704
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:10,896
I can't drink when things are good.

705
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:14,713
Becoming a mom isn't something
that happens every day!

706
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,793
Gosh, I need to pee.

707
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,046
What do I do now?

708
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,068
Seriously, the premium trash
is an asshole.

709
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,090
Seriously.

710
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:38,608
What's wrong, Jin Yi? Jin Yi!

711
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:41,448
What's wrong? What is it? Jin Yi!

712
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:43,206
Jin Yi! Jin Yi!

713
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,296
What do I do now?

714
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,302
I just got it.

715
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,789
What? What did you just get?

716
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,246
I just got my period.

717
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,010
I wasn't pregnant.

718
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:05,365
What do I do?

719
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:23,358
Professor Hwang, you're
drinking so much and so fast.

720
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,488
Too much.
We have our rooms to stay in tonight.

721
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:26,909
We will be drinking all night.

722
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:29,068
You don't want to
get wasted all by yourself.

723
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:30,349
Please leave me alone.

724
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:33,168
Eat in between drinking.
It won't be good for your stomach.

725
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:35,148
True. Eat something.

726
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:36,928
If you've come to this area

727
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,358
you should try this.

728
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:39,890
Stop it already.

729
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,343
You should know when it's appropriate.

730
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,988
What is that?

731
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:46,439
Why did the alarm go off
when it's only 6:00 p.m.?

732
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,608
Isn't it supposed to go off
at 10:00 p.m.?

733
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,218
It's just that to be able
to get home by 11:00 p.m

734
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,400
I should get going now.

735
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,008
So I set it for earlier.

736
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:55,159
So you're saying you're going home now?

737
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,378
Yes...

738
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:59,659
I don't have classes to teach tomorrow,
so I don't have to stay here.

739
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,358
My wife is scared of going to bed alone.

740
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:02,409
Please enjoy.

741
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:03,582
I will leave first.

742
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,579
Director Kim.

743
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,126
- I love you.
- Forget it.

744
00:42:08,977 --> 00:42:11,209
It's all good that you're
the only one who is worried?

745
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,269
Good for you that you're married!

746
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:16,128
What's going on with her?
Sorry. Sorry.

747
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:18,142
I think she's drunk.

748
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,389
No, I'm not.

749
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,269
By the way, I hate the ones who take off
first in the middle of drinking.

750
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:26,668
We should never let
people like him drink with us.

751
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,553
It's so irritating.

752
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,874
Hey, President Lim.
Nice to hear from you.

753
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,088
Your business is doing well?

754
00:42:35,088 --> 00:42:36,238
You didn't answer my call earlier.

755
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:38,148
What do you mean why I called you?

756
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:39,718
I came down to Yeosu and all.

757
00:42:39,718 --> 00:42:41,240
So I thought I'd give you a call.

758
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:43,742
Where?

759
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:48,450
Are they pretty?

760
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:51,948
How old are they?

761
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,834
Wow, jackpot!

762
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,119
Okay, I will be right there.
All right then.

763
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:01,999
Gosh, what should I do?

764
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,539
It was a friend of mine
who lives down here.

765
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:06,200
His family member just passed away.

766
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,198
I will have to go and pay my respects.

767
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:09,389
Just hang here.

768
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,608
Wow, seriously?

769
00:43:11,608 --> 00:43:14,798
Men are all the same.

770
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,662
They are all after
young and pretty ones. Don't you agree?

771
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:20,108
The reason why my Min Ho
hasn't asked me to marry him is

772
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,869
not because he's too busy with work.


773
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,298
Isn't that because he wants
to meet a younger woman?

774
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,568
Maybe he's just making
an excuse with his work?

775
00:43:26,568 --> 00:43:29,193
- Why are you doing this?
- You don't know how I feel.

776
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,834
You really have no idea how I feel.

777
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:39,829
I wonder what
Joo Yeon is doing right now.

778
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:41,499
Is she getting ready to leave work?

779
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,530
Or having some drinks with her coworkers?

780
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,142
Gosh, I really don't
want to live any longer.

781
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:47,628
Hey.

782
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,289
If you don't want to live,
what would you do?

783
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,468
Just pull yourself together
and go back to studying.

784
00:43:51,468 --> 00:43:53,898
So you can have your revenge
on Joo Yeon who's left you.

785
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,171
What revenge?

786
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,648
I will just leave this world.

787
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:00,497
There is no hope for me to go on.

788
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,869
When you're thinking about dying

789
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,448
you sure want a lot of things.

790
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,758
Are you sure you want to die?

791
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,548
- What?
- When you were thinking about dying

792
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:21,668
you devoured the sashimi and stew.

793
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:23,508
And you put on a seat belt
to be safe in the car?

794
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:24,718
I agree.

795
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:26,298
He's not thinking about dying.

796
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:28,988
Why is he making us
worry and go to all this trouble?

797
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:30,211
What did you say?

798
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,479
Guys, do you want me to really die?

799
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,229
What are you talking about?

800
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:41,209
- You're just acting ridiculous.
- I agree, man.

801
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:43,329
How long are you going
to play that card on us?

802
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:44,885
Fine, you punks!

803
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:48,177
I know how ridiculous I am right now!

804
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:51,579
I was serious about ending
my life and came here.

805
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:54,448
True. When I came,
it was scarier than expected.

806
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:56,709
So I was making excuses to stall...

807
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:58,633
I must have looked
ridiculous to you guys.

808
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:00,200
I agree!

809
00:45:00,553 --> 00:45:01,999
I even think I'm pathetic.

810
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,338
I deserve to die.

811
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:04,566
Now...

812
00:45:05,673 --> 00:45:08,142
Do not try to stop me, seriously.

813
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,885
I will definitely end my life.

814
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:17,349
Goodbye, guys!

815
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:19,068
Goodbye, Joo Yeon!

816
00:45:21,503 --> 00:45:24,059
Hey, what if he really dies like that?

817
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,206
Don't worry.

818
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:28,889
Help!

819
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,789
Go help him, will you?

820
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,428
- Oh man.
- Gosh.

821
00:45:33,428 --> 00:45:34,896
Help!

822
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:37,818
Help!

823
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,528
Go help him, will you?

824
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,148
- Oh man.
- Gosh.

825
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:43,626
Help!

826
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,298
I don't want to die! I don't!

827
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:48,814
Help me!

828
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,809
You loser.

829
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,249
What do you think you're doing?

830
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:05,014
Just stand up.

831
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:06,979
I have a cramp in my legs.

832
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:10,030
I can't straighten my legs.

833
00:46:12,351 --> 00:46:13,789
You're something.

834
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:15,238
Save me.

835
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:16,717
Hold me, please.

836
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,889
Let's get him.

837
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,945
I have a cramp.

838
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:40,128
I'm all wet, bastard.

839
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:44,213
We've been going out for five years now.

840
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,814
If I've been waiting for him this long,
he should ask me to marry him.

841
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:54,477
Why? Why has he taken this much time?

842
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:59,619
He made me want to be pregnant like this.

843
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:03,128
Why is he making me feel so pathetic?

844
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:07,334
Jin Yi, please stop drinking.

845
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:09,329
You will get really sick if you continue.

846
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,028
I don't care.

847
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,948
I can't even get pregnant.

848
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,389
I will just let my body get sick.

849
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,693
I will let it get as sick as it can.

850
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,448
Jin Yi, oh my, are you okay?

851
00:47:24,448 --> 00:47:25,939
Did it get in your eye?

852
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:34,043
You know the dream
I had about clams last night.

853
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,396
Conception dream, my butt!

854
00:47:39,414 --> 00:47:44,329
He's a bastard who deserves
to be eating clams crying.

855
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:47,950
Don't worry.

856
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:51,106
I know how much Min Ho loves you.

857
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,099
Does he really?

858
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,659
Do you really think so?

859
00:47:55,659 --> 00:47:57,151
Of course.

860
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:00,068
When I don't have a boyfriend

861
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:01,869
are you bragging in front of me?

862
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:06,218
But because you're here comforting me

863
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:08,030
I really like that.

864
00:48:09,026 --> 00:48:12,329
Anyway, premium trash is so weird.

865
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:14,668
Why? What about him?

866
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:16,829
When it comes to drinking

867
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,269
we should drink with others

868
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:23,459
talking about our deep thoughts
and releasing stress.

869
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,209
That's how it should be done.

870
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:27,298
He doesn't want to hang out with others.

871
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:29,409
What fun is it to drink alone?

872
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,876
I agree.

873
00:48:30,934 --> 00:48:33,059
I wonder why he drinks alone.

874
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,026
<i>Why am I drinking solo?</i>

875
00:48:40,026 --> 00:48:42,534
<i>The reason why I drink solo is...</i>

876
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:07,470
<i>I don't have to
see something unnecessary.</i>

877
00:49:20,546 --> 00:49:23,550
Gosh, can you walk at all, Jin Yi?

878
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:27,709
<i>I don't have to waste
my energy unnecessarily. </i>

879
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,079
Hold on, Jin Yi.

880
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,119
You shouldn't throw up again. Here.

881
00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:34,831
<i>I don't have to spend
my money unnecessarily. </i>

882
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,258
<i>It's time for myself only.</i>

883
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,088
<i>It's my healing time.</i>

884
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:42,202
<i>That's why I drink solo.</i>

885
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:47,048
Wow, is this the place
our academy got for us to stay?

886
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:48,459
We will have a room there, right?

887
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:50,108
I think so.

888
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:52,289
Hurry up. I'm freezing to death.

889
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,539
Good then.

890
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:55,068
You can freeze to death then.

891
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,588
You punk, I hate you to death.

892
00:49:57,588 --> 00:49:58,668
Good then.

893
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:00,579
Since you want to die,
you can hate me to death.

894
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:02,892
- Stop it, man.
- You stop it!

895
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:04,468
If you say you want to die ever again

896
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,180
I will personally kill you myself.

897
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,791
Wait up, man.

898
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:14,510
I will make him hate me to death.

899
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,698
Ah, that's right.

900
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,430
- Aren't you hurt?
- No.

901
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,871
I wonder if
she's applied any ointment yet.

902
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:37,436
Jin Yi, here.

903
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:47,276
What's wrong with my life, seriously?

904
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:53,380
Jin Yi, stop being upset
and get some sleep.

905
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,265
I'm in no position
to comfort anyone right now.

906
00:51:09,894 --> 00:51:13,894
I'm as upset as she is.

907
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,550
Hi, Gong Myung.

908
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:26,099
What? A question?

909
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,534
Can I explain it later?

910
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:34,385
I'm down in Yeosu for work.

911
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,414
What? You're in Yeosu too?

912
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,785
Here it is.

913
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,682
So?

914
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,548
You came down here with your friend
who works at the academy?

915
00:51:50,548 --> 00:51:51,836
You gave up studying?

916
00:51:51,871 --> 00:51:53,026
What do you mean I gave up studying?

917
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,019
I came to just get some air.

918
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:57,019
But here I am thinking about studying.

919
00:51:57,019 --> 00:51:58,854
I came to ask you a study question too.

920
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,905
Fine. What is your question?

921
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:05,769
I already had a few drinks
with the other teachers.

922
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:08,615
I wanted to give you
the answer next time, if possible.

923
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:11,008
So what is the question
you were dying to ask?

924
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:13,666
Well, it's just that...

925
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:19,338
It's about Gae Mang Mae Ga that
you talked about in class last time.

926
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:22,260
What? Gae Mang Mae Ga?

927
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:24,945
It's not Gae Mang?

928
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:28,213
- Was it Pok Mang?
- It's Jae Mang Mae Ga.

929
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:31,789
When you don't even know the title,
how can you possibly have a question?

930
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:33,403
Actually...

931
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:37,082
I saw you get hurt earlier,
so I came to ask.

932
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:44,099
I came to give this to you.

933
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:47,403
Really?

934
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,827
Thank you.

935
00:52:51,827 --> 00:52:53,253
You're touched, aren't you?

936
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:56,178
I'm the only one who cares about you.

937
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:58,477
I agree. You're the only one.

938
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,209
By the way, Teach

939
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,769
do you have a boyfriend?

940
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,869
I don't.

941
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:07,108
I'm too busy making a living.

942
00:53:07,108 --> 00:53:08,778
- No need for a boyfriend?
- Come on.

943
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:11,508
Because you're too busy making a living
you should have a boyfriend.

944
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:14,430
Then you will have something
to look forward to in your busy life.

945
00:53:17,209 --> 00:53:19,106
Come on, you give me no choice.

946
00:53:19,106 --> 00:53:21,099
I should set you up with someone.

947
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:25,139
You're here. Say hi.

948
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:27,139
What? Didn't you come alone?

949
00:53:31,197 --> 00:53:33,979
Hello, I'm Jin Gong Myung.

950
00:53:33,979 --> 00:53:36,316
Shall we start going out from today?

951
00:53:38,956 --> 00:53:40,539
You!

952
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:42,729
How dare you play
a trick on your teacher?

953
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:45,108
Do you want me to hurt you?

954
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:48,157
Come on, I wasn't playing.

955
00:53:48,282 --> 00:53:50,110
You really want to get smacked or what?

956
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,146
I do want to get smacked.

957
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,648
How would you do it?

958
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,008
You... stop playing around.

959
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:06,066
Go back to Seoul
and get back to studying. Got it?

960
00:54:15,573 --> 00:54:18,122
As I get to know her,
she's my type more and more.

961
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:27,242
What have I done today?

962
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:33,425
What a bastard premium trash is!

963
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:36,066
I'm someone's replacement?

964
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:38,439
I'm filling in for someone else?

965
00:54:38,439 --> 00:54:40,008
Damn it!

966
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:43,059
He should've told me the truth.

967
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:46,499
He took me in after seeing my potential?

968
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:48,229
Bullshit!

969
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:51,579
<i>Do you want to eat spoon worm?</i>

970
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,740
Spoon worm?

971
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:55,746
That's not what I said.

972
00:54:57,738 --> 00:55:03,168
Wait, if he took me in
to fill in for someone else

973
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:07,189
It's better to say straight up
that I'm filling in for someone else.

974
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:10,338
<i>Do you want to eat octopus?</i>

975
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:12,939
Why suddenly octopus?

976
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:14,762
That's not it.

977
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:17,642
By the way...

978
00:55:18,546 --> 00:55:20,660
I feel like having octopus.

979
00:55:23,175 --> 00:55:26,677
<i>Love is a lie...</i>

980
00:55:26,677 --> 00:55:31,646
<i>Laughter is also... a lie...</i>

981
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:12,479
- What do you want?
- You look pathetic.

982
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:14,668
What are you doing here alone?

983
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:16,238
Have a drink with me.

984
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:18,057
No thank you, No Geu Rae.

985
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,318
Don't interrupt my free time.

986
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,468
Don't do that!

987
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:24,468
Have a drink with me, okay?

988
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,731
I have something to tell you!

989
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:28,519
Excuse me!

990
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:32,209
Can I have one more glass
and raw octopus?

991
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:33,689
I'm sorry.

992
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:35,439
We're all out of octopus.

993
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,439
Can you just have squid instead?

994
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,668
The squid is really good today.

995
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,479
Since there is no octopus

996
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:46,099
you're saying eat squid
as the replacement, right?

997
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:48,880
Fine, I will have squid.

998
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:58,673
Here is the raw squid.

999
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,718
Squid, I will be upfront with you.

1000
00:57:04,718 --> 00:57:06,809
You're not what I wanted at first.

1001
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:08,968
What I wanted was octopus.

1002
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,249
But she's out of it.

1003
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:14,320
You came out as the replacement.

1004
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:20,829
What are you doing right now?

1005
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,736
What do you mean?
It needs to know the truth.

1006
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,851
Squid, don't get all excited.

1007
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:33,633
I didn't order you
thinking about your potential.

1008
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,628
I couldn't order octopus.

1009
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:38,217
I had to order you as the replacement.

1010
00:57:38,423 --> 00:57:40,568
If you get all excited

1011
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:42,409
it will make you look pathetic

1012
00:57:42,409 --> 00:57:43,610
just like me.

1013
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:48,048
I asked what you were doing.

1014
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:53,474
Seeing the squid
come out to replace octopus

1015
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:55,468
is like seeing myself.

1016
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,776
I... heard everything.

1017
00:57:59,553 --> 00:58:02,273
Because the Korean teacher
on the eighth floor quit

1018
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,896
you took me in your joint class
to fill in for her.

1019
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:11,668
I'm... just like this squid.

1020
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:14,599
But what did you say to me?

1021
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,577
You said you took me in
after you saw my potential?

1022
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:21,269
Why did you lie? Why?

1023
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:24,628
Are you happy that you made a fool of me?

1024
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:27,479
You're seriously... such a jerk.

1025
00:58:27,479 --> 00:58:30,400
You're just like your real name, jerk!

1026
00:58:32,582 --> 00:58:34,376
This lady, seriously.

1027
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,829
If you're that bothered, then quit.

1028
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:46,354
What is this?

1029
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,309
Aren't you going to let me go?

1030
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,057
Are you mad? I'm sorry.

1031
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,139
I forgot my place again and acted rashly.

1032
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,697
Whether I'm the replacement or not

1033
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:01,336
I should be just honored
to get into your joint class.

1034
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:03,119
I was wrong.

1035
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,709
I'm sorry.

1036
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:06,479
I was wrong.

1037
00:59:06,479 --> 00:59:07,968
I'm sorry.

1038
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:09,736
I was wrong.

1039
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:17,063
Excuse me, No Geu Rae.

1040
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:19,086
Excuse me.

1041
00:59:23,668 --> 00:59:24,890
This lady, seriously.

1042
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:28,126
I really can't deal with her.

1043
00:59:30,057 --> 00:59:31,928
How can you just leave?

1044
00:59:31,928 --> 00:59:34,269
- You should take your girlfriend.
- What do you mean my girlfriend?

1045
00:59:35,394 --> 00:59:36,738
This low-quality woman is my girlfriend?

1046
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:37,738
Am I crazy?

1047
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,936
I have nothing to do with her.

1048
00:59:42,023 --> 00:59:43,628
Tell her to find a way home.

1049
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:45,039
I have no reason to care.

1050
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,648
Gosh, seriously...

1051
00:59:59,793 --> 01:00:01,909
I can't just toss her here.

1052
01:00:06,959 --> 01:00:08,331
What is this?

1053
01:00:10,697 --> 01:00:12,731
Everything about her
reeks of subpar quality.

1054
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:15,909
Oh my.

1055
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:19,530
Professor Jin is carrying me on his back.

1056
01:00:20,137 --> 01:00:21,599
No way.

1057
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,456
Am I dreaming?

1058
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:32,102
That's right. This is a dream.

1059
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:37,577
I'm saying this because this is a dream.

1060
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:40,148
Even if it was brief

1061
01:00:40,148 --> 01:00:41,874
I was happy.

1062
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,090
After I moved to Noryangjin

1063
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,548
I felt very insignificant.

1064
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,811
And it was tough.

1065
01:00:56,182 --> 01:00:59,450
I felt like someone
was recognizing my talent.

1066
01:01:01,211 --> 01:01:04,251
Hearing that I had potential...

1067
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,456
I was very happy even if it was brief.

1068
01:01:44,983 --> 01:01:47,968
Gosh, I'm hot. Hot!

1069
01:01:47,968 --> 01:01:49,336
Hot.

1070
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,238
Gosh, I'm cold.

1071
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:59,918
Give me a blanket. Blanket!

1072
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:02,289
I'm saying I'm cold. Blanket.

1073
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,008
Blanket.

1074
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:06,354
I'm cold. Cold.

1075
01:02:19,622 --> 01:02:22,617
What was that?
She asked for it a minute ago.

1076
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:25,474
I'm saying it's cold. Blanket!

1077
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,468
Blanket!

1078
01:02:29,336 --> 01:02:31,726
Gosh, you No Geu Rae, seriously.

1079
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,178
Am I a replacement?
I'm filling in for someone else?

1080
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:44,285
What did she hear?

1081
01:02:44,697 --> 01:02:48,023
You're Professor Choi Yoon Hee
who teaches Korean, right?

1082
01:02:48,023 --> 01:02:49,778
Yes, this is Jin Jung Seok.

1083
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:53,782
It's just that I heard you
applied to join my joint class.

1084
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:56,838
I'm sorry, but you won't be
able to join us at this time.

1085
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:58,528
<i>Ah, is that right?</i>

1086
01:02:58,528 --> 01:02:59,959
<i>It's okay.</i>

1087
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:03,448
<i>I actually couldn't join your joint
class for a personal reason.</i>

1088
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:05,142
<i>My husband is being transferred overseas.</i>

1089
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:07,139
<i>I am going to have to quit.</i>

1090
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:08,668
Ah, are you?

1091
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:13,073
<i>By the way, which instructor
are you thinking about working with?</i>

1092
01:03:13,809 --> 01:03:16,198
She's a new instructor named Park Ha Na.

1093
01:03:16,198 --> 01:03:19,809
<i>Ah, she's the one
who came from a prep school.</i>

1094
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:21,048
True.

1095
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:22,776
<i>What is she like?</i>

1096
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:25,858
Well, she has potential.

1097
01:03:25,858 --> 01:03:29,702
She's a good enough instructor
to join in my joint class.

1098
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,668
I'm cold...

1099
01:03:34,726 --> 01:03:35,726
Blanket!

1100
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:48,773
For Gong Myung.

1101
01:03:58,494 --> 01:03:59,494
Please.

1102
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,441
Sleep already.

1103
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:09,356
She's a woman after all.

1104
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:11,997
She looks best when sleeping.

1105
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:02,684
<i>[Let's Drink]</i>

1106
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:04,758
<i>I like drinking solo.</i>

1107
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:07,409
<i>Since my job entails talking all day</i>

1108
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:10,682
<i>having this time
when I don't have to is the best.</i>

1109
01:05:16,709 --> 01:05:18,282
<i>Is she perhaps the Korean teacher?</i>

1110
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:19,896
<i>Professor.</i>

1111
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:21,479
<i>You're mistaking me with somebody else.</i>

1112
01:05:21,479 --> 01:05:23,389
<i>Come on. You're Professor Park Ha Na.</i>

1113
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:24,974
<i>You're my favorite student, Gong Myung.</i>

1114
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,639
<i>Can I be your boyfriend
rather than your favorite student?</i>

1115
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:27,948
<i>- Ki Bum, let's stop being friends.
- Sure.</i>

1116
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:28,948
<i>What? Stop being friends?</i>

1117
01:05:28,948 --> 01:05:30,202
<i>Go tell Gong Myung also.</i>

1118
01:05:30,229 --> 01:05:31,648
<i>You've never had a crush
on an idol, have you?</i>

1119
01:05:31,648 --> 01:05:34,028
- <i>I had a crush on SHINee.</i>
- <i>Was it Minho from SHINee?</i>

1120
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:35,729
<i>Didn't they go to school together?</i>

1121
01:05:35,729 --> 01:05:37,329
<i>- Did they really?
- Get up.</i>

1122
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:38,389
<i>- Who are you?
- Who am I?</i>

1123
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:39,588
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1124
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:41,682
<i>There you go.</i>

1125
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:44,238
<i>Use your waist.</i>

1126
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:45,878
<i>He must be furious with me.</i>

1127
01:05:45,878 --> 01:05:47,128
<i>Gosh, this is crazy.</i>

1128
01:05:47,128 --> 01:05:48,718
<i>After finding out that
he took me in as a replacement</i>

1129
01:05:48,718 --> 01:05:51,209
<i>I can't believe that I did that.
I can't avoid him tomorrow.</i>

1130
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:52,508
<i>Now she's trying to see how I feel.</i>

1131
01:05:52,508 --> 01:05:53,758
<i>Why did she act that way then?</i>

1132
01:05:53,758 --> 01:05:55,918
<i>I think it will be better to have
No Geu Rae next to me.</i>

1133
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,988
<i>Before I told Professor Jin
that I wouldn't be able to join his class</i>

1134
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,559
<i>he contacted me that Professor Park
would take over the Korean class.</i>

1135
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:07,479
<i>To him, it's very unfair.</i>

1136
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:09,776
<i>The boss thinks he might
have feelings for you.</i>

1137
01:06:09,776 --> 01:06:12,309
<i>Stop being so flexible
just to try and make me happy.</i>

1138
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,021
<i>Be confident and say what you want.</i>

1139
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:18,881
<i>"Be confident and say what you want!"
Does he really have feelings for me?</i>
