I equate films with sandcastles.

14
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,691
You get a bunch of mates
and you go down and say,

15
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,544
oh, let's build this great sandcastle.

16
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,361
And you build it.

17
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:37,783
And if the tide comes in in 20
minutes it's just smooth sand

18
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,912
and that structure you made
is in everybody's memory

19
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,204
and that's it.

20
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:28,167
What does it mean?

21
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,710
Fearless.

22
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,775
I grew up in Kansas City.

23
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,445
When I was 18 I became a ﬂier

24
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,365
and I went overseas to the South Pacific.

25
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,537
I started writing letters
and I wrote a letter

26
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,210
to a cousin of mine who was a
woman who I didn't know really,

27
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,756
but she was the secretary
to Myron Selznick.

28
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,552
Who was one of the big agents,
David Selznick's brother.

29
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,846
And I'd written her this kind of funny,

30
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,392
cute letter and she wrote
me back and she said,

31
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,520
oh, Bobby, you wrote such a nice letter

32
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,981
you should be... you're a writer.

33
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,317
And I thought, well, yeah,
that's what I'll do.

34
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:44,618
When I got out of the air force
my dad was living in California.

35
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,913
He rented a house in
Malibu, up in the hills.

36
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,457
And so I move into my father's house.

37
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,922
A guy named George W. George
had the downstairs apartment.

38
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,091
I told him, I said, I'm a writer,

39
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,427
and he said, oh I'm gonna be a director.

40
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,999
We should do something together.

41
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,975
So we wrote a story and we sold it to RKO.

42
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,380
They wouldn't let me write the screenplay.

43
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,456
I said well can I come and
watch the film being made?

44
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,748
No.

45
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,876
So I decided I'd be a playwright.

46
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,419
I wrote a play.

47
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,756
And I got in a car and I
was driving to New York

48
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:43,177
and I stopped in Kansas
City, which is my hometown.

49
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:49,808
And I ran in to a guy I had
known slightly in a bar

50
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,560
and he said what are you doing?

51
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,562
I said well I'm a film... film writer.

52
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,399
I'm writing screenplays
and I lied quite a bit.

53
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,735
I said I'm on my way to New York.

54
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,403
I'm doing my [ﬂay-

55
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,695
What are you doing?

56
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,740
And he said I'm directing movies.

57
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,283
I said where?

58
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,095
He said well there's this place
here called the Calvin Company.

59
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,121
It's an industrial film place.

60
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,665
So I went over and I was introduced

61
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,086
and lied about what I had done
some more and they hired me.

62
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:25,461
Morning, Mr. Jones.

63
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,928
Morning Charlie.

64
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,721
You want me to fill 'er up today?

65
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,516
Yeah, and one more thing,
I'm in kind of a hurry

66
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,519
but I'd like to get an oil
change and a lube job.

67
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,443
My film school was working
in this industrial films.

68
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,446
I mean, I had to shoot, edit the films.

69
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,823
I learned all the tools.

70
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,077
When I was at the Calvin Company

71
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,538
a guy who's father owned a bunch of...

72
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,377
a chain of theatres in
the mid-west, in Roden,

73
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,421
wanted to make a movie.

74
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:05,300
And, uh, delinquents, a delinquents movie.

75
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,512
And that's what it was
called "The Delinquents".

76
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,597
So I wrote it in about three nights.

77
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,143
I stayed up all night
and wrote this script.

78
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,694
Golly, do we have to go in?

79
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,946
Well let's just go in for a little while.

80
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,449
If we don't like it we
can always leave, okay?

81
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,211
We made it for $65,000 and
it was really terrible.

82
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,546
Ah!

83
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,838
Where you going?

84
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,051
But Hitchcock saw that film,
he was impressed with it.

85
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,222
So he called me in for a meeting

86
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,975
and he offered me a "Hitchcock Presents".

87
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,185
Hello.

88
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,104
Mrs. Gould.

89
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,063
This is...

90
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:00,939
Hello.

91
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,524
What do you think you're doing?

92
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,277
I'm going to call her and
tell her we're in love

93
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,070
and you're not going to stop me.

94
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,622
Hello.

95
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,417
Hello?

96
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,178
Hello?

97
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,971
What number are you calling?

98
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,681
I did two of those.

99
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:39,728
So then I got an agent and they
got me this job on Whirlybirds.

100
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,357
Two boys robbed the store
and slit the owner.

101
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,109
Could be the same ones
who killed the old man

102
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:46,902
at the garage.

103
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,194
Killed!

104
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,279
Could you intercept? Over.

105
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,739
We'll try, Greendale.

106
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,880
We shot them in two and a half days.

107
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,008
Every five days we would
shoot two episodes.

108
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,388
Tommy Thomson, who was my AD,
would pick me up in the morning

109
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,475
and I'd get in the car
and I'd drive out to...

110
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,978
way out in the valley in California

111
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,522
where we were shooting those things.

112
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,984
I'd say what are we doing today?

113
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,529
He'd say oh this is the thing,
and the two guys are doing this,

114
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:34,533
and there's a woman who's
cheating on her husband

115
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,453
and she's shot this guy, and
there's some baby chickens,

116
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,956
and they have all these
eggs that are gonna die

117
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,409
unless the helicopter gets
them and there's a dilemma.

118
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,582
Do they take the chickens?

119
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,835
Do they solve the murder?

120
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,588
And I'd say okay, I got it.

121
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,264
I was born and raised in California

122
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,683
and spent a lot of time at the beach.

123
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,354
One day a movie company put out a
call for girls who could swim.

124
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,649
So I tried out and ended
up getting the part.

125
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,535
I started getting work

126
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,538
and one day I got a call to
play a nurse on Whirlybirds.

127
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,590
The director was Robert Altman.

128
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,259
He looked a little hung-over.

129
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,095
When we were introduced
he didn't say hello,

130
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,306
he just said how are your morals?

131
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,976
And I said a little shaky, how are yours?

132
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,311
That was the beginning.

133
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,525
We went right into a fulltime relationship.

134
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,195
I never worked again after Whirlybirds.

135
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,110
He had already been married twice,

136
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,795
but those marriages didn't last very long

137
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,964
and he had three kids...
Christine, Michael, and Steven

138
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,092
from those earlier marriages.

139
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,718
And I had Konni from mine.

140
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,930
When they got married we moved

141
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,058
and my new school was having
this big father daughter dance

142
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,478
and I was so new and completely terrified.

143
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,231
Even though Bob and I didn't
know each other that well,

144
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,692
he came with me as my father.

145
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,194
He was so sweet about it.

146
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,321
He just wanted me to be happy.

147
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,661
Soon after we were married we had Bobby.

148
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,543
We bought a house, it was a great house

149
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,545
and we had lots and lots of parties.

150
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,507
Bob loved to throw a party.

151
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,975
I started in "Bonanza"
and "The Roaring 20's"

152
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,436
and a lot of those series.

153
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,689
And I became one of the
top television directors.

154
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,660
The more television he did

155
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,663
the more he realized all these
TV scripts he was given

156
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,334
were just the same old
thing over, and over.

157
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,921
<i>A'.</i>

158
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,756
By the time he was doing "Combat"

159
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,258
he tried to use his own
experience in the war

160
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
to make the show more true to life.

161
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,931
He did one episode where Vic
Morrow was shell-shocked,

162
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,141
but that got him into trouble.

163
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,899
Joey?

164
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,833
Medic!

165
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,385
That's my brother, my brother Joey.

166
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,555
And he's, he's dead.

167
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,682
It's all my fault.

168
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,433
Geeze is this guy out of it.

169
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,485
Walking down the road
carrying a dead German

170
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,104
and thinking it's his brother.

171
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,898
A man named Selig Seligman
produced that series

172
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,650
and he forbade me to make that.

173
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,902
He said I don't want you to do that.

174
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,696
Then he went out of town and...

175
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,614
and, uh,

176
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:29,578
I didn't have a decent script
to go in with and so we did it.

177
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,498
And when he saw it I was fired.

178
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,127
And to edit the show the
editor would come...

179
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,338
there was a bar there over there
on... on Washington Boulevard,

180
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,840
over by MGM.

181
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,633
I would go sit in the bar

182
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,635
and Vic Morrow would go to the editor

183
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,387
and then come and sit with me

184
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,180
and he says here's what he's doing.

185
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,475
I said well tell him do 'so
and so' and 'so and so'.

186
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,604
Then Vic would go back and...

187
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,148
And then that episode got
quite a bit of attention.

188
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,649
I think it won an Emmy.

189
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,506
He continued to push for more realism

190
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,363
in all of his shows, but the
producers wouldn't go for it.

191
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,784
In an episode of "Kraft Suspense Theater"

192
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,580
he wanted to cast the black
actor as a convict on the run.

193
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,958
And when the sponsor refused
the idea of a black character

194
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,545
he quit television and
bad-mouthed the sponsor.

195
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,429
I felt I had just done all
I could do in television,

196
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,934
and I felt I'd better leave.

197
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,062
What does Altmanesque mean?

198
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,482
Playing the long shot.

199
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,578
After burning his bridges in television,

200
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,914
Bob wanted to write and
direct his own films.

201
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,750
He thought that would give
him more creative freedom.

202
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,339
Around that time we adopted
Matthew and our family grew.

203
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,302
But we were running out of money.

204
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,930
When you have six children
and can't pay the milkman,

205
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,222
that's pretty bad.

206
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,276
It was our fifth anniversary and
he told me for our anniversary

207
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,612
we're flying to Las Vegas for the weekend,

208
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,904
so get ready.

209
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,782
I'm just going to run out to the racetrack

210
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,201
and I'll meet you at the airport at six.

211
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,788
Later, I found out he had
our last $200 in his pocket

212
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,125
and he'd bet it all on a
twenty-to-one long shot

213
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,417
and he won.

214
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,839
When we landed in Las Vegas he
went directly to the craps table

215
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,966
and won another $6000.

216
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,680
But if it had gone the other way

217
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,224
I might not be here to tell you this story.

218
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,317
My first film I did after
years of television

219
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,903
was a thing called "Countdown"
with Warner Brothers.

220
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,365
They sent it to me and I liked the story.

221
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,951
It was about going to the moon,

222
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,537
but Jack Warner was very
reluctant to hire me.

223
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,165
He thought I was a bit of a smartass.

224
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,457
He told me so.

225
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,419
I went up to his office and
sat there and he said listen,

226
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,391
everybody wants to put you on this picture

227
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,923
so I told them they can do what they want,

228
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,967
but I gotta tell you, you're gonna fail.

229
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,220
He says I don't like your work,
I don't think you get it

230
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,557
and I don't think you'll
do a good job on this.

231
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,019
But I'm going to let you do it and so.

232
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,855
I said well I hope I can prove you wrong.

233
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:50,570
Five, four, three, two, one, fire.

234
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,256
Lee, this is Chiz, do you read?

235
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,968
What's the story?

236
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,429
You'll be awhile.

237
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:21,226
Now listen, we believe that...
some arc... at the launch.

238
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,977
Repeat.

239
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,230
At the launch there was some arching

240
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,107
and you're losing electrical power.

241
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,319
There's no way to repair without
a risk of the retros firing

242
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,613
and sending you out of trajectory.

243
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,365
You'd never get back.

244
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,657
What?

245
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,246
Jack Warner was out of town

246
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,249
and the last day of shooting he came back

247
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,626
and the phone rang and it was Bill Conrad.

248
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:52,882
It was the producer of this
little movie and he said listen,

249
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,177
don't come in Monday because Jack...

250
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,096
They won't let you in the studio.

251
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,976
Jack Warner called for your
dailies and he ran them,

252
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,268
uh...

253
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:08,439
Sunday and he's barred you from the lot.

254
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,070
And I said what do you mean
he's barred me from the lot?

255
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,443
I have the Directors Guild.

256
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,282
I get my first cut.

257
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,285
He says you can do any of
that legal stuff you want

258
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,830
and they'll let you do it, if
that's what you want to do.

259
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,291
But nobody's going to look at what you do

260
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,002
and it's all going to be changed.

261
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,756
He said, if you want to hear
what he said that fool,

262
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,384
meaning me, has actors
talking at the same time.

263
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,179
Two days more and we could
of had an unbeatable edge.

264
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,054
I know...

265
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,431
Those men should of been brought in...

266
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,975
I couldn't bring them all
in, they don't trust me.

267
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,981
Mr. Nogritty's calling from Washington.

268
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,067
I was just trying to get
the illusion of reality

269
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,612
and so I got fired from that

270
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,823
because of the overlapping dialogue.

271
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,708
Making your own rules.

272
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,548
Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau

273
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,201
speaking with church leaders today

274
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,011
said U.S. Conscientious
Objectors to the war in Vietnam

275
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,804
have his complete sympathy

276
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,096
and that Canada should be
a refuge for militarism.

277
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,653
Somehow Bob found backing
for an independent film

278
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,656
to be shot in Canada, "That
Cold Day in the Park".

279
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:40,948
Action.

280
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,326
He loved Canada and talked
about moving there.

281
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,329
He was mad at America
because of the Vietnam War.

282
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:47,955
Cut. Print that.

283
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,540
So I get the documents together

284
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,334
and was trying to sell the house,

285
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,336
but then lngo came into the picture.

286
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,743
Lngo Preminger was a talent agent

287
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,884
that had a script he wanted to produce.

288
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,970
Lngo thought Bob would be perfect for it

289
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,807
after he saw a short film that
Bob had made about smoking pot.

290
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,718
Everyone in town had turned it down,

291
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,679
but Bob saw something in that
script that noone else saw.

292
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,559
I talked to lngo Preminger for two hours

293
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,062
and I said if you want to make
the picture I want to make,

294
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,022
I'll do it.

295
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,857
Here's what I want. Here's what I see.

296
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,276
And he said okay, let's go.

297
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,973
Fox did not want it to be a Vietnam thing.

298
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,017
The war was still going on in Vietnam.

299
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,145
So they did not want to,

300
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,523
the studio did not want to come
out with that kind of picture.

301
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,741
I don't think I would of
gotten away with this,

302
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:51,579
except Fox at the time had two
other war films going on.

303
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,582
So they were concerned about
those and I was aware of that

304
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:59,587
and I said I've got to
go on the back lot there

305
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,758
and keep a low profile
and not draw attention.

306
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,094
Let nobody pay attention to me.

307
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,471
Elliott Gould.

308
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,763
How do you do?

309
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,808
This is???? who is the cameraman.

310
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,725
How are you?

311
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,769
You'll be playing what, Hawkeye?

312
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,646
We were a little minor film.

313
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,481
We didn't have any stars in it.

314
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,609
I went up to San Francisco.

315
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,403
There was a theater company up there,

316
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,822
one of those improvisational companies

317
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,534
and I hired most of them
as incidental players.

318
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:33,863
Radar!

319
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:34,497
Yes sir.

320
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,350
Why don't you get ahold of Major Burns?

321
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,168
Tell him we're going to have
to hold a couple of surgeons

322
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,212
from the day shift onto the night shift.

323
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,424
To the surgeons,

324
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,384
we're sure gonna need them.

325
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:53,307
It was taking an ensemble cast
and doing it in a humorous way.

326
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,822
I think you will find these accommodating,

327
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
they're quite dry.

328
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,186
Don't you use olives?

329
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,481
Olives? Where the hell do
you think you are, man?

330
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,893
Dear God, protect our Supreme
Commander on the field.

331
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,069
Frank, were you on the
religious kick at home

332
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,863
or did you crack up over here?

333
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,865
I'm married, I'm happy, I love my wife.

334
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,159
If she was here I would be with her,

335
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,451
there is no question.

336
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,203
I wonder how a degenerated person like that

337
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,955
could have reached a
position of responsibility

338
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,665
in the army medical core.

339
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,957
He was drafted.

340
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,380
We had a script which
we used as a blueprint,

341
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,632
and as we would rehearse it would evolve.

342
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,844
If something occurred to
us that seemed to work,

343
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,136
we would do it.

344
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,586
Now when German starts coming
over here like he's hurt...

345
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,516
hey Scotty when he gets over to you,

346
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,060
we'll give you a spot and
you're going to say,

347
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,855
"For god sakes Gorman, this
is... get back in the game".

348
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,523
He says, "I've got the ball".

349
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,860
And then you say, "you've
got the ball, well run".

350
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,905
And then you say, "you've got
the ball, he's got the ball"!

351
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,784
<i>Go, gm.!</i>

352
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,787
What's the matter with you?
Get back in the game!

353
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:57,954
I've got the ball!

354
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,290
You've got the ball, well run!

355
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,167
Run! Run!

356
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,591
We were working for the laughs

357
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,676
and yet there was a reality to it.

358
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,762
People died.

359
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,684
Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps,

360
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,520
if you have them.

361
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,772
Give me some big hunks
of sponge or something.

362
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,273
We're all out of big sponges.

363
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,067
You'll have to use these for now.

364
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,819
Oh that's bleeding nice, oh,
that can't come out of there.

365
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,571
I can't stop that bleeding.

366
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:32,948
I can't really see,

367
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,835
It's like the Mississippi River down there.

368
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:38,954
Ready?

369
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,121
I'm ready.

370
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,583
Nurse, you got a clamp, please?

371
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,875
Yes, yes sir.

372
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,089
Scratch my nose.

373
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:49,799
Just on... there.

374
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,676
There, a little harder please.

375
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,446
Scorch, I need some more sponge clamps,

376
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
if you have them.

377
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,394
Darryl Zanuck, who was the head of Fox,

378
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,063
was in Europe while this was being made.

379
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:10,027
He came back and we had a screening for him

380
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,613
and within this screening he
had come back from Europe

381
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:18,953
and he had two young European
girls that were friends of his.

382
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,000
And he... They came to the screening

383
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,502
and at the end of the screening

384
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,006
he said all that blood has to come out.

385
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,468
And I thought, oh, Christ, we're sunk.

386
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,848
And those girls said, oh Darryl,
that's the best part of it.

387
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:43,519
And they just supported that in such a way

388
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:48,232
that we were allowed to leave
them in for a preview.

389
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,860
And that audience went nuts.

390
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,904
And Zanuck said we're not
going to mess with this.

391
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,958
The picture was such a
hit it was phenomenal.

392
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,128
I mean, you know, with the war going on,

393
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,463
the timing worked.

394
00:27:55,257 --> 00:28:02,014
Um, life, liberty, and
the pursuit of truth.

395
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,229
Now, we welcome the fifteenth
man asked to direct MASH,

396
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,855
Mr. Robert Altman.

397
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,411
My son wrote that song.

398
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,704
Your son wrote that song?

399
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,540
When he was fourteen, Suicide is Painless.

400
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,166
Now he's got too much money.

401
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,337
He's sixteen, living with a 20
year old girl in Venice and...

402
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,255
Shocking.

403
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,465
Do you get any kick now out of the fact

404
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,634
that you're a hot director

405
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,303
and there's all those years
that people wouldn't...

406
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,888
wouldn't expectorate on you?

407
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,223
Oh yeah.

408
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:44,932
Yeah.

409
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,225
How does it come out?

410
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:46,934
It's fun.

411
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:47,727
Yeah.

412
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,018
It's nice.

413
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,254
Bob became the hottest
director in Hollywood

414
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:19,800
and we built what I called our
movie star house in Malibu.

415
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,221
It was a new life for our family.

416
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,599
Everyone wanted Bob to do "MASH 2",

417
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,976
but Bob refused to repeat himself.

418
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,979
Instead he surprised everyone
by making a far out little film

419
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,439
called "Brewster McCloud".

420
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,944
It was an important time in the 70's

421
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:43,199
because this studio turned
filmmaking back to the artist

422
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,868
so I go to do a lot of stuff

423
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,037
that was certainly not the formula

424
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,538
that had existed before.

425
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,304
The McCabe script was given to
me right after I made "MASH".

426
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:09,391
The reason I like it was it was
the standard western genre.

427
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,811
We just twisted it a little bit.

428
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,792
McCabe and Mrs. Miller

429
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,378
is a beautiful pipe dream of a movie.

430
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,547
A ﬂeeting, almost diaphanous vision

431
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,049
of what frontier life might of been like.

432
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,302
It's not much like other westerns.

433
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,721
It's not really much like other movies.

434
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,601
The fact is that Altman is
dumping square conventions

435
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,186
that don't work anymore.

436
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,274
All those threadbare remnants
of the well-made play,

437
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,442
which American movies have clung to.

438
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:06,448
What this movie reveals is that
there's poetry in Robert Altman,

439
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,826
and he's able to put it on the screen.

440
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,581
The question is always asked...

441
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,542
why aren't there American
Bergmans and Fellinis?

442
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,713
Here is an American artist who
has made a beautiful film.

443
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,475
We were in Canada.

444
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:34,768
We went to Ireland.

445
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,022
Bob liked to shoot as far away
from the studios as possible

446
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,595
so he wouldn't have executives
looking over his shoulder.

447
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,110
Yeah?

448
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,196
I just stopped here because it's
a good wide place in the road

449
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,032
and I figured we can rendezvous here.

450
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,952
Also it looks like there's
bad weather over there.

451
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,829
I think we gotta go some place.

452
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:54,830
Well either direction here,

453
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,291
I thought while they're mounting the car

454
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,543
I'll drive up this way, drive up that way,

455
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,086
see where the weather is worse.

456
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,840
I got out of that damn car so
they could get it up the hill

457
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,468
and I said I would walk.

458
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,971
And they took it, so I ran
up that fucking hill.

459
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,810
You remember last night?

460
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,773
Now the kiss again.

461
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,401
That's when... just as long as
you do and lean right into it,

462
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,861
and that's when you respond,

463
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,738
'cause now you're going to trick him.

464
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:29,822
Yeah, that's it.

465
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,033
Stand by.

466
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,325
Slate.

467
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,870
Hello, is your name Mrs. Altman?

468
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,788
Yes it is.

469
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,918
Oh, well I'd like to ask you a
few questions about filming.

470
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:46,006
Um, how did you meet your husband?

471
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,093
I met him in Hollywood
on a television series

472
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,427
called Whirlybirds.

473
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,719
Oh.

474
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,430
He was directing it at the time.

475
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:58,394
And, uh, oh...

476
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,898
How do you like being
married to a film director?

477
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,590
Oh, find it very, very interesting.

478
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,112
Very unusual life and very
full of surprises day-by-day.

479
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,574
Yeah, and also I hear that
your children are making...

480
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,187
they're starting to like filming.

481
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,619
Yeah, they're getting very involved.

482
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,955
I may end up with four
little boy directors.

483
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:19,956
Action.

484
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,341
Bob was constantly innovating,
and in the 1970's

485
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,261
he developed a casual style
that was radically different

486
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,346
from Hollywood filmmaking at the time.

487
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,154
Mr. Marlowe the lights on your car are on.

488
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,907
Oh yeah, thanks a lot.

489
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,409
Excuse me I don't see any
Coury Brant cat food.

490
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,701
Some what?

491
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,662
Coury Brant cat food, it
happens to be the only...

492
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,206
Can you spell it for me please?

493
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,917
Yeah, Coury Brant, c-0-u-r...
Oh, we're all out.

494
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:48,212
Why don't you get this, Mr. All
this shit is the same anyway.

495
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:51,215
You don't happen to have a
cat by any chance, do you?

496
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,051
What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

497
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:54,968
Well...

498
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
haha.

499
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,017
On 'The Long Goodbye' the
camera never stopped moving.

500
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,436
Dollying, zooming.

501
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,231
He wanted the action to be
caught as if by accident.

502
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,109
He hated things being mastered, two-shot,

503
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,027
hit your mark, say your line.

504
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:16,281
He wanted the feeling to be
natural and more relaxed,

505
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,573
observational.

506
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,536
Okay, Eileen,

507
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,080
what was Marty Augustine
doing here the other night?

508
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,372
How did you know?

509
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,874
I followed him here from my place.

510
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,627
He dropped by to have a word or two with me

511
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,131
and I was just curious to see
who else he wanted to talk to.

512
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,758
Oh, Roger owed him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something.

513
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,176
He owes Marty?

514
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,595
You know what he told me Marty owed him.

515
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,430
We all heard what Dr. Verringer said.

516
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,057
He hates to part with money.

517
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,549
Yeah, what Dr. Verringer said.

518
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,853
I heard a lot of people
said that Terry Lennox

519
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,521
was working for Marty Augustine.

520
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,813
I don't believe it.

521
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,691
Yeah, well, that's what I heard.

522
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,663
Your husband ever talk about the Lennox's?

523
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:53,193
No.

524
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,806
He ever talk about Sylvia Lennox.

525
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,903
No.

526
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,448
Is your husband having an
affair with Sylvia Lennox?

527
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,741
Mr. Marlowe,

528
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,535
I don't wish to continue this
conversation about my husband.

529
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,148
Was your husband having an affair

530
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,449
with somebody you don't know

531
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,415
who just might of been Sylvia Lennox?

532
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,791
Definitely not.

533
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,403
Where was your husband the night
Sylvia Lennox was killed?

534
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,968
Bob's other big innovation was in sound.

535
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,364
The traditional way of recording sound

536
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,473
was to have a single boom mic
over the main actors heads.

537
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,142
But that didn't work very well

538
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,561
when you had a big ensemble cast.

539
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,853
God dammit, Denis!

540
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,856
That card went off the
table with the joker.

541
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,608
That's why you wouldn't give it up!

542
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,400
You are ridiculous.

543
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,902
You said it wasn't even close.

544
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,695
That's yesterday's news.

545
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:37,988
You are working together.

546
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
You're partners.

547
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:47,531
You two mother-fucking creeps...
Stop with all the language.

548
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,335
Anymore fighting you guys go out
of here for good, all right?

549
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,707
They've been consistent
winners and I'm a big loser.

550
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,672
You know I know how to play poker.

551
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,883
Oh sour grapes, honey, sour grapes.

552
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,385
All right, all right. Let's
get it back to normal.

553
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,677
Lousy punk.

554
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:02,803
You're not that good.

555
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,014
Oh up yours.

556
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,560
In "California Split" he
invented a way to use radio mics

557
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,020
and 8 track recorders

558
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,689
to simultaneously record each actor's lines

559
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,859
on separate channels so that he
could patrol them in the mix.

560
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,904
He wanted to give the audience the feeling

561
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,405
they were in a real place

562
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,978
and force them to choose which
conversation to listen to.

563
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,163
A dollar says you don't
know who Glenn Riggs is.

564
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,541
Uh, what's your name?

565
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:33,752
Vince, the name's Vince.

566
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,296
Vince, can you get me $30
from the cash register?

567
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,798
What do you want $30 for?

568
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,549
I need $30". In the bathroom.

569
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,051
Renee, I'm only the bartender

570
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,262
and I don't go in the cash register.

571
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,553
Where's Jack?

572
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,764
Jack went to a funeral.

573
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,558
Look, I've been working
here for one year, right?

574
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,061
Just give me a piece of
paper, chit $30 Renee.

575
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,562
Okay, just give it to me.

576
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,108
If I give you $30 and I come
up short, it'll be your ass.

577
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,652
Baby you were born short
and it's always my ass.

578
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,904
Captain midnight!!!

579
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,741
Now everyone records that
way, but he was the first.

580
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,787
His films just didn't look
or sound like anyone else's

581
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,079
and they still don't.

582
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,416
Doc. That's one.

583
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,209
Dopey. That's two.

584
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,503
Snoopy. There is no Snoopy.

585
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,046
There ain't no Snoopy.

586
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,676
Altmanesque.

587
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,849
Showing Americans who we are.

588
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,673
He was working on "Thieves Like Us"

589
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,051
in Mississippi, a beautiful little film

590
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,053
that Joan Tewkesbury wrote for him.

591
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,723
Joan had worked as a script
supervisor on "McCabe".

592
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,267
Bob, you know, would always discover talent

593
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,977
and give people opportunities.

594
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,563
Anyway, after she wrote "Thieves Like Us"

595
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,398
Bob asked her to go to Nashville

596
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,817
and keep a journal of what she saw.

597
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,413
Well, she landed at the
airport, got into a car

598
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,666
and the first thing she saw was
a car crash on the highway.

599
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,752
It kept her stuck for two hours

600
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,629
and that's how Bob opened the picture.

601
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,823
It was a multi-layered
story with characters

602
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,234
who crisscross each other
in the country music scene.

603
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,404
But Bob thought it lacked something.

604
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:12,702
Country music radiates
a love of this nation.

605
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:14,913
Patriotism.

606
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,335
Country music therefore
has those combinations,

607
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:24,381
which are so essential
to America's character

608
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,258
at a time that America needs character.

609
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,763
At the time the whole water
Watergate thing was happening

610
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,725
and he hated Nixon, so he
added a political angle.

611
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,271
On the first Tuesday of November

612
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,441
we have to make some vital
decisions about our management.

613
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,193
Let me go directly to the point.

614
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,863
I'm for doing some replacement.

615
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,830
For mom and daddy.

616
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,122
Thank you.

617
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,802
Come on get up off your...

618
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,804
Wait a minute Mayor, watch your head.

619
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,473
Ya'll take it easy now.

620
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,475
This isn't Dallas it's Nashville.

621
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:17,225
This is Nashville.

622
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,977
You show them what we're made of.

623
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,271
They can't do this to us here in Nashville.

624
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,356
Somebody sing, sing.

625
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:25,650
Sing.

626
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,737
Come on, I think you've been hurt.

627
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,114
Oh, oh.

628
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,616
Come on, easy, easy.

629
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,952
Oh man, I can't stop that blood, man.

630
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,244
Come on everybody sing.

631
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,373

639
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,196
have a tendency to explode
American myths and genres

640
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,539
and I just wondered, what's your
perception of American society?

641
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,500
She thinks, she says am
I exploding the myths

642
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:29,089
and are taking shots at
America and our culture.

643
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:33,885
Uh, I, if that's the result
of it that's what I,

644
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,470
that's the result of it.

645
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:41,393
But what I'm doing is simply
reflecting what I see and feel.

646
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,855
I live here, I was born
here, I love this country,

647
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:49,234
I love, uh, this is all I
know, it's my culture.

648
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,988
And, uh, I just try to show what I see.

649
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,781
If it's ugly, that's what I see.

650
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,413
Altmanesque what does it mean?

651
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:07,919
Creating a family.

652
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,179
By the mid 70's Bob was
riding his own wave.

653
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,056
He had gathered so many talented people

654
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,600
that he set up Lion's Gate,

655
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,269
a studio that would
produce independent films

656
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,479
to keep the people he cared about working

657
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,356
in between his own movies.

658
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,653
The first director he worked
with was Alan Rudolph.

659
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,323
Alan started with Bob back as the second AD

660
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,657
on "The Long Goodbye".

661
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,077
He co-wrote Buffalo Bill
and became a close friend.

662
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:46,958
And Lions Gate produced his
first film "Welcome to L.A.".

663
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,337
Bob's only instructions to Alan were

664
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:53,590
keep the budget low and
don't make a chase movie.

665
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:02,057
The way Bob did it, making films
was always collaborative.

666
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,226
His process was to bring
his friends together

667
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,853
and let the film evolve.

668
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,774
He encouraged everyone to contribute,

669
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,318
but for him the most important
thing was the actors.

670
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,200
I think the actors are the
main artistic element

671
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,035
in any film.

672
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,495
They're more important than the script.

673
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:25,705
They're more important
than the photography.

674
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,598
They're more important than the director

675
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,292
because they're the ones that do it.

676
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:33,630
So the more you can make
them your collaborator

677
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:35,674
then you're getting the best of all worlds.

678
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,769
I encourage actors to feel comfortable

679
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,480
and to know they can go further.

680
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:54,609
They can step over the edge
and I've got a safety net.

681
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,237
I won't let them make a fool of themselves.

682
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:04,994
I spent a lot of effort in
trying to make a family

683
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,289
so that the actors become a part of it.

684
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:18,800
Everybody comes to the
dailies, nobody's taking notes

685
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,135
and there's booze

686
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,430
and you find these actors
start rooting for each other.

687
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,183
Okay, let's go.

688
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,313
Your beautiful wife Antoinette

689
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:36,443
tells me that you are an art collector.

690
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,408
You certainly don't look
like an art collector.

691
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,537
You know if you're walking down the street

692
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,915
and somebody pointed you out and
asked me what I thought you did

693
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,333
and I didn't know you

694
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,253
I would never in a million
years guess art collector.

695
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:00,091
You could go on what's my
line and stump the panel.

696
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,491
I remembered we'd have these
big thanksgiving dinners

697
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:27,535
and dad made it a lot of fun for all of us.

698
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:30,872
But that and Christmas

699
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:33,750
were the only times we'd be
alone with him as a family.

700
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,376
Kathryn was always there for us,

701
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,337
but dad was always working.

702
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,465
For the most part, we
were not his priority.

703
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,133
His movies were his priority.

704
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,178
He loved us, but it was hard.

705
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,813
I did five films at Fox.

706
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:57,774
They were done almost
like independent films.

707
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:04,656
Alan Ladd was running the studio
then and he was very supportive.

708
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:09,661
He really stood up for
me and I owe him a lot.

709
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,667
Grace Kelly was involved in the studio.

710
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,169
And they had a board meeting

711
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:23,216
and she said how could you
let this Altman person

712
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:27,345
put my friend, Paul Newman,
in such a dreadful film.

713
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:31,307
And Ladd-y just said oh shut up, I quit.

714
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,142
And he got up and walked out

715
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,436
and that was the end of him over there.

716
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,111
"Quintet" came out, which
the critics hated.

717
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,822
And a week later "A Perfect
Couple" was released,

718
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:47,657
which the critics hated even more.

719
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:52,662
So he was having a pretty
bad run at the box office

720
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,122
and then came "health".

721
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,006
I never stepped into one of these things;

722
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,340
I hope there's a bottom.

723
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:09,095
Mr. Altman, I thought I'd
ask you a couple things

724
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,763
about the making of this film.

725
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,140
Uh the title is health...

726
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,975
What?

727
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:17,353
I said the title is, the
title of the movie is health

728
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,606
and I was gonna ask you

729
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,567
if that's a particular
pre-occupation of yours

730
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,029
or just what they call a
property you were interested in?

731
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,157
No, I make lots of movies.

732
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:33,661
Uh huh and the whole subject
of health, of course,

733
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,204
involves a certain amount of controversy

734
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,166
because there are stories, exposes,

735
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,877
and so on about the food additives.

736
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,010
The sort of thing that
where things advertised

737
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,298
aren't what they claim to be and so on.

738
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,674
Will that be a point

739
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,886
that you'll be trying to take
satiric thrusts at in the movie?

740
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:51,930
Think you could talk about that a bit?

741
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,223
Uh, well, we don't have a script yet.

742
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,020
All right, action.

743
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,898
♪ I'm having a sugar fit ♪

744
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,025
♪ Ooo ♪

745
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,902
By the time we completed health

746
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,404
there was a different management at Fox,

747
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,176
they believed it wouldn't make money.

748
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:14,577
We got in a little argument,
so the film was buried.

749
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,545
Altmanesque?

750
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,218
Expect the unexpected.

751
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,231
Robert Evans saw Annie on Broadway

752
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,233
and he wanted to do the movie version,

753
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,402
but he couldn't get the rights.

754
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:50,014
He found out that Paramount
owned "Popeye" the comic strip

755
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,240
and he decided to make a big budget musical

756
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:53,700
of "Popeye" instead.

757
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,539
After a lot of directors turned it down,

758
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,125
for some reason, Evans
sent the script to Bob.

759
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,168
I remember seeing the script on his desk

760
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,337
and saying to him Popeye?

761
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,725
It was Robin Williams' first movie

762
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:21,519
and Bob convinced the studio
to hire Shelley Duvall.

763
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,985
And Paul Dooley, who was in
six or seven of Bob's films.

764
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,778
He found the Pickle Family Circus,

765
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,572
who were all clowns and jugglers.

766
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,325
And Sweet Pea was played
by our grandson, Wesley.

767
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,702
Christine's son.

768
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,083
Wesley was born with
kind of a crooked smile.

769
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,711
One day, Dad noticed when Wesley smiled

770
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,463
he looked a lot like Popeye.

771
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,382
He said "See, this is
where the pipe goes in."

772
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,844
He was about 10 months old, he
hadn't even learned to walk yet,

773
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,430
and Bob had him cast as Sweetpea.

774
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,892
It was just one of those magical
moments in how he cast people.

775
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,896
Okay, everybody, stand by.

776
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,438
Action.

777
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,986
The production spent
millions building a village

778
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,946
into a barren hillside

779
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:18,326
and about 3 minutes into the
film things started to go wrong.

780
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,590
After losing 21 days of
shooting to bad weather,

781
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,717
going several million dollars over budget,

782
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,970
and the studio threatening
to pull the plug,

783
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,015
Bob wasn't even sure he
could finish the film.

784
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,064
Tonight in Hollywood, Paramount and Disney

785
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:51,818
unveil their highly anticipated
Christmas Blockbuster "Popeye",

786
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,694
and what a scene it was.

787
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,414
Good morning and welcome
to the critic's corner.

788
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:06,706
For years "Popeye"

789
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,417
has been one of my favorite
comic strip characters.

790
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,962
So, I and millions of others
have been looking forward

791
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:14,173
to the big Hollywood "Popeye"
movie with joyous anticipation.

792
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,467
The cast look perfect for the parts,

793
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,594
the writer was the estimable Jules Feifier

794
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,366
and the director was the imaginative,

795
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,038
though inconsistent, Robert Altman.

796
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,474
What could go wrong?

797
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,101
Well just about everything.

798
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:26,644
And the disappointing news this morning

799
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,938
is that "Popeye" is a debacle

800
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,940
with the characters left in ruins.

801
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:34,026
First of all, Feifier fails.

802
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:35,879
His script that shot is undistinguished

803
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,697
and it is without humour, but above all,

804
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,110
the culprit is Robert Altman

805
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,200
whose direction and editing are ponderous,

806
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,119
hesitant, and almost incoherent.

807
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:44,411
The members of this cast,

808
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,414
who almost seem born to play these rolls,

809
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,958
have been subverted by their director.

810
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,170
Paul Dooley who plays the
hamburger loving Wimpy

811
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,005
with such relish is giving nothing to do.

812
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:54,839
I mean nothing.

813
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,967
Zilch, zero, gornish, nada, zip.

814
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,178
Robin Williams has the
cartoon character down,

815
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,305
but much of his dialogue is unintelligible

816
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,516
and much of what is intelligible
is incomprehensible.

817
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,060
The songs by Harry Neilson are calamity.

818
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,355
His music is tuneless and
his lyrics are moronic.

819
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,065
Shelley Duvall is just wonderful,

820
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,942
thank goodness for Shelley Duvall.

821
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,320
Just think of this, for
years and years "Popeye"

822
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:18,946
has been chugalugging spinach

823
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,741
and when he finally gets
something to go with the spinach

824
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,743
it turns out to be a turkey.

825
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:30,041
The critics trashed it and
Bob took most of the blame.

826
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,733
It was nowhere near the blockbuster

827
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:35,630
the studios were hoping for.

828
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,055
The films that they want to make now,

829
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,933
the major companies, um, are not,

830
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,935
they're films that I don't want to make.

831
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,227
Also, I can't make.

832
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,272
I can't make "Superman", and
"Raiders of the Lost Arc"

833
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,442
and, uh, and I don't want to.

834
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,821
And the films I do want to
make and feel that I can make,

835
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,114
they don't want to make.

836
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,242
They want movies now that will...

837
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,245
there's a magic number that they
use, a hundred million dollars.

838
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,915
And, um, I just can't do that.

839
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,126
It's just the time to split, that's all

840
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,462
and by splitting I mean separate.

841
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,690
It was pretty rough, the
phone stopped ringing.

842
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,692
I said well where should I cut back,

843
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,151
or what should I do?

844
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,443
We can sell the house.

845
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:41,695
Move to New York.

846
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,240
He was pretty down.

847
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,368
He worried his luck had run out.

848
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,538
You ever bet $10,000 on a football game?

849
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,163
Oh yeah.

850
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:51,872
You have?

851
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,249
Mmhmm.

852
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,541
Do you win much?

853
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,253
I'm behind.

854
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,423
This has not been, the last
three years has not been good.

855
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,098
What does Altmanesque mean?

856
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,390
Uh...

857
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,560
I would say it means never giving up.

858
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,486
The fact that Bob couldn't
get any movie deals

859
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,446
didn't stop him.

860
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:24,739
Pretty quickly he found something

861
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:27,658
he really wanted to do, live theater.

862
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,165
You know I still don't like
being touched or held?

863
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,418
When you extend your hand,
when you really give,

864
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,170
you lay your heart on the table

865
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,005
and hand someone else the hammer.

866
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,759
Now there might be some people

867
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,762
who feel this is somewhat of
a fall from grace for you

868
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,181
after directing major
films for so many years,

869
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,433
to direct a couple of small plays.

870
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,086
Not saying they're not good plays,

871
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,312
but small plays in a small theater,

872
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,314
off Broadway so to speak.

873
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:00,691
Well I think it's a step up.

874
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,117
I did four or five theater pieces.

875
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:13,120
And when I'd do one I'd say
oh, let's do another one.

876
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,456
So, to me, that was a very important,

877
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:18,125
big time, "I" time in my life.

878
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,417
I was experimenting.

879
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,430
I went to the University of Michigan.

880
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,142
I had done an opera there
a couple years before

881
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,895
and I didn't have the
money to produce a film,

882
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,690
but I came up with a scheme
of making it a course.

883
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,569
And so all of the crew,

884
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,988
except for a couple of us, were students

885
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,074
and they got a credit for doing this.

886
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:53,702
Yeah, let's just take this, open
it up from where he gets up

887
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,497
and walks out of the frame on the set.

888
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,583
Start on the monitors.

889
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:05,089
Now, when he gets up to leave
make your pan to the door.

890
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,427
My little dog, Checkers, he... PFT.

891
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:24,267
What?!

892
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:25,568
No, mother.

893
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,655
I did not elect myself,
they elected me not once,

894
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,991
not twice, but all of my goddamn life,

895
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,994
and they would do it again
to, if they had the chance.

896
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,830
Oh, sure, they said they didn't trust me.

897
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:41,292
They said let Dick Nixon
do it and I did it.

898
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:43,836
They said they wouldn't
buy a used car from me,

899
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:47,173
but they gave me the biggest
vote in American history.

900
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,509
And they ﬂushed me down the toilet

901
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,386
and they wanted me to stay down.

902
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,723
They wanted me to kill myself.

903
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,642
Well, I won't do it.

904
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,604
If they want me dead,
they'll have to do it.

905
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,650
Fuck them! Fuck them!

906
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,069
Fuck them! Fuck them!

907
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,280
Fuck them!

908
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,994
I never met Richard Nixon in my life,

909
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,872
but I did have a couple
of exchanges with him

910
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,164
more than once.

911
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,084
He wrote a book called "Leaders",

912
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,170
which was a really big book.

913
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,008
And I was living in California at the time

914
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,013
and in the mail this
book, heavy book, comes.

915
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:42,394
And it was from the Ex-President
and it was inscribed in there,

916
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,896
it says to Robert Altman,

917
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,190
thank you for your years of loyal support.

918
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,693
What?

919
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,321
And I thought, shit, I gotta burn a book.

920
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,909
And I really had a dilemma.

921
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,497
I could of torn out that page,

922
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:02,998
which ultimately I did

923
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:08,963
because I didn't want it
to be found in my archives

924
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:13,509
by one of my great
grandchildren and they say oh,

925
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,970
grand daddy was a big Nixon supporter.

926
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,907
After "Secret Honour" we sold the house

927
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,325
and moved to Paris.

928
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:42,454
He felt appreciated there, as
so many American Artists do.

929
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,835
Bob, remember that shower scene in MASH

930
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,670
where you made me get naked?

931
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:50,962
You get naked.

932
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,767
For a while now, dad had been hiring me

933
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,894
and my brother, Bobby, to work with him.

934
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,397
I started out in props

935
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,530
and eventually became his
production designer.

936
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,028
This is our ace prop man, Steve Altman.

937
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,561
Steve, do you have anything
to say about the production?

938
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:17,822
Hi mom.

939
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,470
And Bobby became his camera operator.

940
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:24,747
Working with him, it was good, I
got to see him and I got paid.

941
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,344
Working out of Paris he shot anywhere

942
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,095
he could get a deal.

943
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:43,474
Mostly small films, financed
with European money

944
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:46,101
or by the new U.S. cable channels

945
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,686
who gave him total freedom.

946
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,621
Come on right around here
and just fill in here,

947
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,913
make this pretty.

948
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:09,833
Give me as many people
on this side as I can.

949
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,960
Michael, Cynthia.

950
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,587
Tighten on in, everybody.

951
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,340
You got enough ﬂoor ground;

952
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:18,384
We will need some people now over here.

953
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,762
Kathy, come on up in here everybody.

954
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,723
We need people in here, around this area.

955
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,350
Okay stand by please.

956
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,642
Okay, action Michael.

957
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,188
Let there be no mistake about it,

958
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,358
as the people of conscience, we cannot,

959
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:41,115
we must not settle for anything
less than a comprehensive,

960
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,951
global boycott of South Africa.

961
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,243
Yes.

962
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:46,370
Ya!

963
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,415
Michael, that was terrific, I
just want to do one more please.

964
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,920
HBO wanted to do something
about the election.

965
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,755
So Garry Trudeau and I said

966
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,300
let's just run a guy for
President, so we did.

967
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,682
We took Michael Murphy,
who played Jack Tanner,

968
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:08,517
and we created a staff

969
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,770
and we infiltrated them
in to actual situations.

970
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,482
Pat, how are ya?

971
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:17,025
<i>HEY-</i>

972
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:17,985
Nice to see you.

973
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,317
This is my daughter, Alex.

974
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:19,695
Hi.

975
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:20,320
How are you?

976
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:21,612
Good, how are you?

977
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,323
Sure stirring them up in my home state.

978
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,325
Well Michigan is a strong one for me,

979
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:26,617
you know that Jack.

980
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,829
I'll say it made me glad to be a democrat;

981
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,831
I wouldn't want to be up against you.

982
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,333
Well the Republicans are
going to be tough this year

983
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,835
but we wish you the best.

984
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:36,287
Looking tougher all the time.

985
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,215
Let's go over the ground rules now.

986
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,009
The panel will give direct questions

987
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,301
to specific candidates.

988
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:45,804
What we're doing is, we
don't know what to call it

989
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:50,601
because it's not a documentary,
it's not fictional,

990
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:53,729
um, I call it experimental television.

991
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,191
We must stop the flow of
drugs in this country.

992
01:02:57,483 --> 01:03:00,235
The number one threat on the
streets of our nation today.

993
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,113
Our borders are militarily inferior

994
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:06,033
in terms of being protected
from drugs trafficking...

995
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,368
Jesse... Jesse... As you may recall,

996
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,121
it was former President Nixon
who started the war on drugs,

997
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,748
the same former President Nixon

998
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,542
who couldn't seal off South
Vietnam from North Vietnam

999
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,586
with 500,000 troops.

1000
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,548
America's tired of being
dragged into wars it can't win

1001
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,801
and a war on drugs is a loser.

1002
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:28,472
And any law that makes 25
million Americans criminals

1003
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:29,764
is a loser.

1004
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,141
It's time to get real.

1005
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,186
The only way to get drugs off our streets

1006
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,479
is through legalization.

1007
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:36,104
Ho-ho!

1008
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:36,772
What?

1009
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:39,107
He said it, he said it.

1010
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,193
Did he say legalization?

1011
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,237
There goes the street value of my stash.

1012
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,405
I think the people, with all do respect,

1013
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,075
are more than ready to
elect a black President,

1014
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,244
I just don't think they're ready for you.

1015
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:51,536
Whoa!

1016
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,419
What did they put in his
oatmeal this morning?

1017
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:54,957
This is going ballistic.

1018
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:00,587
Okay, what kind of spin do we put on that?

1019
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,718
"Tanner '88" I think is probably
the best work that I've done,

1020
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,304
I think it's the most inventive.

1021
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,099
Because we really did change television.

1022
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,278
This is WNBC New York, I'm Larry Stack

1023
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,446
and here's what's happening at 2 o'clock.

1024
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:27,938
President Bush proposed to add

1025
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,784
an additional 1.2 billion
dollars to the budget

1026
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,704
for the war on drugs
including a 50% increase

1027
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:35,372
in military spending.

1028
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,792
You've moved back to America

1029
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,210
after being based in Paris.

1030
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,623
Do you think you've changed?

1031
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:43,964
I don't think I've changed.

1032
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,508
I think I just keep doing the same thing

1033
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,011
and occasionally what I do

1034
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,806
crosses with the general
attitude of the public

1035
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:56,810
and it becomes very successful
and then I'm a failure,

1036
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,396
and a has been, and then
I cross back again.

1037
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,524
But I'm going straight... to me
I'm going in a straight line.

1038
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,484
Everybody else is just going like this.

1039
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,864
Altmanesque.

1040
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,367
Kicking Hollywood's ass.

1041
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,668
Most of the scripts that they
send me are studio scripts.

1042
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:25,255
I mean, I'd be embarrassed
to be associated with them.

1043
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,758
I don't think there's anything I could do

1044
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,885
other than radically change them,

1045
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,887
which these people don't want.

1046
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:35,515
I make gloves and they sell shoes.

1047
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,397
David Brown, the producer, told Bob

1048
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,275
that he had a project that
Bob was born to direct

1049
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,027
because it struck at everything

1050
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,029
that was wrong with Hollywood.

1051
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:57,871
And it was true, nobody but Bob
could of pulled off "The Player"

1052
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,289
the way he did.

1053
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,209
It gave him the chance to

1054
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,253
crucify forever Hollywood's
entire way of making movies.

1055
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,845
Griffin, Griffin hi.

1056
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:14,513
Griffin hi.

1057
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:15,805
A-A-Adam Simon.

1058
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,683
I know we're not supposed to
meet until next week but...

1059
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:19,695
I didn't realize we were meeting next week.

1060
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:22,688
Well, yeah, I just wanted to
plant a seed in your head...

1061
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
Sorry, I'm booked up,

1062
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,143
Okay, but just picture this.

1063
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,776
Okay, it's a planet in the
far future with two suns.

1064
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,068
Who plays the sons?

1065
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,070
No-no-no, suns, large solar disks.

1066
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,322
Listen, you gotta run this
idea by Bonnie Sherow.

1067
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:35,409
The pictures they make these
days are all MTV, cut cut cut.

1068
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,421
The opening shot of Welles' "Touch of Evil"

1069
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:39,162
was six and a half minutes long.

1070
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:40,706
Six and a half minutes, Walter?

1071
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,079
Well three or four anyways,

1072
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,543
he set up that whole picture
with one tracking shot.

1073
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:51,466
"The Graduate" Part ll.

1074
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,758
Oh good, good.

1075
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,923
Now listen, the three
principles are still with us...

1076
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:58,390
Dustin Hoffman, Anne
Bancroft, Katharine Ross.

1077
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,682
Mmhmm.

1078
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,268
Twenty-five years later and
so are the characters.

1079
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,897
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

1080
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,108
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

1081
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,277
They live in a big, old, spooky house

1082
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:12,612
up in northern California somewhere.

1083
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,949
And Mrs. Robinson lives with them.

1084
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,911
Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...

1085
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,284
Mrs. Robinson had a stroke?

1086
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,457
Mrs. Robinson had a stroke,
so she can't talk.

1087
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,000
Is this going to be funny?

1088
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:26,292
Yeah, it'll be funny.

1089
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,002
With a stroke?

1090
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,135
Dark, and weird, and
funny, and with a stroke.

1091
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,557
It's a T.V. star and she goes
to the safari, to Africa.

1092
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:43,310
Are you talking about a T.V.
star in a motion picture?

1093
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:44,811
No, not a real T.V. star.

1094
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,813
It would be played by a movie star.

1095
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,666
A movie star playing a television star.

1096
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:50,020
Julia Roberts would be good.

1097
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,231
Dolly Parton would be good.

1098
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,028
Dolly, Dolly, yeah.

1099
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,320
I like Goldie.

1100
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,655
Goldie, great, because
we have a relationship.

1101
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:58,700
Goldie goes to Africa.

1102
01:07:58,992 --> 01:07:59,992
Goldie goes to Africa.

1103
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:01,283
And she becomes worshipped.

1104
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,585
Political doesn't scare me.

1105
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:10,003
Radical political scares me.

1106
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:11,495
Political political scares me.

1107
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,026
This is politely politically radical.

1108
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:13,924
Is it funny?

1109
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:14,716
It's funny.

1110
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,168
It's a funny political thing.

1111
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,969
It's a funny, and it's a thriller too.

1112
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:18,804
It's a thriller.

1113
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:20,096
It's all at once.

1114
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,097
So, uh, what's the story?

1115
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,306
Well I want Bruce Willis.

1116
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:22,974
Mmhmm.

1117
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,351
I think I can talk to him.

1118
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,145
It's a story about a senator,
a bad-guy senator at first.

1119
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,877
And he's travelling around the
country on the country's dime,

1120
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,900
you know, uh, like that Sununu guy used to.

1121
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:34,232
It's sort of a cynical,
political, thriller comedy.

1122
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,696
Yeah, but it's got a heart,
uh, in the right spot

1123
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,240
and anyways he has an accident.

1124
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:39,533
An accident?

1125
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:42,577
Yeah, and he becomes
clairvoyant, like a psychic.

1126
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,995
Oh, I see.

1127
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,287
Yeah.

1128
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,832
So it's kind of a psychic,
political, thriller, comedy

1129
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:47,624
with a heart.

1130
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:50,001
With a heart,

1131
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,795
and not unlike Ghost meets
Manchurian Candidate.

1132
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:53,296
Go on, go on, I'm listening.

1133
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,308
Anyway, he can start to read people's minds

1134
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,300
and when he gets to the president's mind

1135
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:58,592
it's completely blank.

1136
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:05,517
Mr. Altman, is "The Player"
your revenge against Hollywood?

1137
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,770
No, it's a very, very mild indictment.

1138
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,523
Things aren't really like
that, they're much worse.

1139
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,494
Mr. Altman, I have to ask you,

1140
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,330
do you think Hollywood has
lost its' objectivity?

1141
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,666
No, I think that Hollywood

1142
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:33,920
has always maintained its' objectivity,

1143
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:37,716
which is greed and making
as much money as it can

1144
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:40,385
and trying to get rid of all the artists.

1145
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,220
Of course they can't succeed in that,

1146
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,390
so since they can't really get rid of us

1147
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,767
we just keep popping up and going along.

1148
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,606
And now we have the presentation

1149
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:55,609
of the Palme D'or for Best Director.

1150
01:09:56,735 --> 01:10:01,281
The Palme D'or for Best
Director goes to Robert Altman

1151
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:02,199
for "The Player".

1152
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,992
"The Player" Robert Altman!

1153
01:10:18,173 --> 01:10:19,299
Thank you.

1154
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,431
"The Player" was a huge hit in Cannes.

1155
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,266
Everyone wanted to meet with him

1156
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,268
and he finally found backers for a film

1157
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,312
he had been wanting to do for years.

1158
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,786
In "Short Cuts" Bob took a collection

1159
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,935
of Raymond Carver's short stories

1160
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:14,980
and adapted them into one
multi-layered story.

1161
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,999
I think Bob connected with Carver's stories

1162
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,283
because they were about the
lives of ordinary people.

1163
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,868
The frailness of human behavior.

1164
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,663
The randomness of things
that happen in life.

1165
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,333
It's coming.

1166
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,795
I know, I know, come here.

1167
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,800
<i>Jerry“.</i>

1168
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,096
Okay, look, look it.

1169
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,474
What's happening Howard?

1170
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:53,852
Howard?

1171
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,645
We have to get under the table.

1172
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,107
Gene, earthquake!

1173
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,900
Get under the door, come on!

1174
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,192
Quick!

1175
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:03,945
Get underneath the door!

1176
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,613
This is Officer Gene Shepard

1177
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,699
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

1178
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,327

experiencing an earthquake.

Ralph!

1184
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:26,168
Jesus.

1185
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:27,576
This is bigger than the one in '71.

1186
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:28,803
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1187
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,221
It's not the big one.

1188
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:30,889
Earthquake!

1189
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:32,302
Mommy, get over here, quick!

1190
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:33,516
Get down.

1191
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,226
Just lay down, Mommy.

1192
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,686
Just lay down.

1193
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:40,648
This is it, baby! We're going out together.

1194
01:12:43,068 --> 01:12:44,569
This is the big one, baby.

1195
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:50,866
Wasn't the big one.

1196
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:57,957
If we were able to explain
any of these characters

1197
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,544
it's the very fact that
things happen to them

1198
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,546
and they are inexplicable

1199
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,383
because I think that's more truthful

1200
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:07,967
to the way life really is.

1201
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,638
Jerry!

1202
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,439
Altmanesque, what does it mean?

1203
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,069
How vulnerable we are.

1204
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,826
Talking with Robert Altman.

1205
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:36,121
Well what's left of you from
the success of your diet?

1206
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,413
Thank you.

1207
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:41,084
I'm glad that you mentioned
that, people think I'm sick.

1208
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,544
He's ill, he's lost weight.

1209
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,754
I've lost about 35 pounds and I'm,

1210
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,507
I got about a few more to go.

1211
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:53,179
I just figured it'll add
some longevity to the...

1212
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,099
I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

1213
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,731
The doctor said you have an enlarged heart.

1214
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,568
You shouldn't do this or that
and you shouldn't drink.

1215
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,661
But it never stopped him
from doing anything.

1216
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,078
I heard him yelling,

1217
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,539
he's like, I think we have a problem here.

1218
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:23,460
So I ran downstairs and he
couldn't remember my name.

1219
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,339
I called the doctor and as I
was helping him get dressed,

1220
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:32,469
he looks up at me and
says Konni if this is it,

1221
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
it's been great.

1222
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,932
It was a micro stroke.

1223
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:46,274
He gave up drinking, that was hard.

1224
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,736
He says the only thing I miss
about drinking is the alcohol.

1225
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:51,778
He was great.

1226
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:54,491
He was still fun and
funny, but he was thin.

1227
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,049
Pret-a-Porter was difficult.

1228
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:57,387
That he managed to make that
movie was an accomplishment,

1229
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,721
but he kept on working.

1230
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,608
Start the music and we're
bringing them through.

1231
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:21,327
As soon as... As soon as these
kids who are going through

1232
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:26,040
get right under here, as soon
as you lose sight of them

1233
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,584
you're going to move on over.

1234
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:39,012
"Kansas City" came out of his
memories of growing up there.

1235
01:16:39,304 --> 01:16:41,806
Especially of jazz music, which he loved.

1236
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,144
But he barely made it through that film.

1237
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:49,355
It was his heart, it was giving out.

1238
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:57,530
The doctor said I think
you need a transplant.

1239
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,490
And Bob said what are the odds?

1240
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:25,558
He rested for a whole year.

1241
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,935
Learning how to live with a new heart

1242
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,562
and handle possible rejection,

1243
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:32,357
and medication and a whole regimen.

1244
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,239
I kept it quiet

1245
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:43,743
because I was afraid nobody would hire me,

1246
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,995
because there's such a stigma to it.

1247
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,671
By his 71st birthday he looked terrific.

1248
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,216
He was really with it and
excited to get back to work.

1249
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,267
I love what I do.

1250
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:12,480
I love the actors and what they do.

1251
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:16,484
And it's just such a delight

1252
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:19,821
to sit there and watch
people create something

1253
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:22,699
and know that you're a part of it.

1254
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:26,536
It's just... I don't ever want to stop it.

1255
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:37,380
Storytelling.

1256
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:40,842
Masterful storytelling.

1257
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,309
All right, well, what do you want to do?

1258
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,104
Should we just shoot one
and see how bad it is?

1259
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,396
Let's shoot one.

1260
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,107
I mean, see how good it is.

1261
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:57,817
Let's waste film.

1262
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,737
I have a lot of stock in Eastman.

1263
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:02,905
All right, let's do it.

1264
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:06,451
Action servants.

1265
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,790
"Gosford Park" was one
of Bob's masterpieces,

1266
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,459
but it almost never got made.

1267
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:18,906
We couldn't line up the financing.

1268
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,423
It just kept falling apart.

1269
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,340
What scared the investors

1270
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,802
were the exact things he loved about it.

1271
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,555
Big ensemble cast, unresolved ending.

1272
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,433
One guy said he'd finance the film

1273
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,101
if Bob would rewrite the ending

1274
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,438
to make it a traditional
murder-mystery, but Bob refused.

1275
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,319
With zero funding and no investors

1276
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:43,362
he called up every A-List actor in London

1277
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:45,865
and said we're making this movie.

1278
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:48,618
They were like absolutely
I'd love to work with you.

1279
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:55,500
We were close to shooting, the
producers are freaking out

1280
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,293
and Bob is totally cool,

1281
01:19:57,585 --> 01:20:01,130
like he knows everything
is going to work out.

1282
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,299
And then we got the call.

1283
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:06,803
The British Lottery fund
agreed to back the film.

1284
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,094
He won the lottery.

1285
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,226
Mr. Weisman?

1286
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:15,435
Mmhmm, yes.

1287
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,196
Tell us about the film
you're going to make.

1288
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:18,355
Oh, sure.

1289
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:21,046
It's called "Charlie Chan in
London", it's a detective story.

1290
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,485
Set in London?

1291
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:25,863
Well, not really, most of it
takes place at a shooting party

1292
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,116
in a country house, sort of
like this one, actually.

1293
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,118
A murder in the middle of the night,

1294
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,663
a lot of guests for the
weekend, everyone's a suspect.

1295
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:36,332
You know? That sort of thing.

1296
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:37,667
How horrid.

1297
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:40,795
And who turns out to have done it?

1298
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:42,088
I couldn't tell you that.

1299
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,549
It would spoil it for you.

1300
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,801
Yeah, but none of us will see it.

1301
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,093
Aha!

1302
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,101
Isabelle? Isabelle?!

1303
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:02,358
Jennings?

1304
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:16,664
Robert Altman's film "Gosford Park"

1305
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,791
is a virtuoso ensemble piece

1306
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,377
to rival the director's
Nashville and Short Cuts,

1307
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,171
that's masterly interweaving
of multiple characters

1308
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:25,463
and subplots.

1309
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:27,413
It is a contemporary equivalent

1310
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,553
of Jean Renoir's classic
"Rules of the Game".

1311
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:33,898
What makes the achievement
of "Gosford Park"

1312
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,809
all the more remarkable is that Mr.
Altman is 76.

1313
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:40,479
But the movie's cool assessment
of the human condition

1314
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,024
implies the dispassionate overview of a man

1315
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,525
who has seen it all.

1316
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,418
The energy that crackles from the screen

1317
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:48,529
suggests the clear sighted joie DE vivre

1318
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,115
of an artist still deeply
engaged in the world.

1319
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,043
I had done six... seven films

1320
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,046
and I was so smug and proud of myself

1321
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:09,300
because I thought none of these
films are alike and then,

1322
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,969
ten... twelve films more.

1323
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:14,180
I look at these things and I think,

1324
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:19,852
hmmm, these really are all just
chapters of the same book.

1325
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:21,562
They're just different chapters.

1326
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,058
With "A Prairie Home Companion"

1327
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,072
Bob was doing two things.

1328
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:34,533
Returning to his youth when
he absolutely loved radio

1329
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,661
and contemplating death.

1330
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,080
He was joining both ends of the circle.

1331
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:40,372
What are we doing?

1332
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:41,999
You're on in the power milk segment

1333
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,126
doing gold watch and chain with him.

1334
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,836
We haven't done that for years.

1335
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:51,175
♪ Oh I'll pawn you my gold
watch and chain, love ♪

1336
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:55,012
♪ And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring ♪

1337
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,304
Excuse me;

1338
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:58,509
I gotta get a head start on
getting pie eyed tonight.

1339
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,519
♪ I will pawn you this heart in my bosom J”

1340

♪ Only say that you'll love me again ♪

1341
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,275
How about Red River Valley?

1342
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,610
Fine, whatever you like.

1343
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,905
Well this really isn't going
to be your last show, is it?

1344
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:14,318
Every show's your last show.

1345
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:15,241
Oh my god.

1346
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:16,826
That's my philosophy.

1347
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,118

1352
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,690
A lot of people are
wondering what you meant

1353
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:50,943
with the end of the film when
the angel goes into the diner

1354
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:54,238
and a lot of people go back and
forth about what it means,

1355
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,530
what she was there for.

1356
01:23:55,781 --> 01:24:00,286
Well I felt it was about leaving
it open who was gonna die next.

1357
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:05,791
Obviously, this film is
about death and, uh...

1358
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:17,595
She was the angel of death and
she showed up for one of them

1359
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:21,265
and um,

1360
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:25,686
we just closed the film
before we told you which one.

1361
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,063
Sort of like real life.

1362
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:52,088
Death is the only ending that I know about.

1363
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:55,382
People will come in and say oh,
does this have a happy ending?

1364
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,468
And I say well, no.

1365
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,137
But we can make a happy stopping place.

1366
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:23,786
Right now, I'd like to toast you all,

1367
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:24,495
Happy Thanksgiving.

1368
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:25,787
Yeah!

1369
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:26,830
Happy Thanksgiving!

1370
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:47,226
And it's a turkey that has never
been genetically encoded.

1371
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,402
Big Family gathering here tonight

1372
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,320
and makes me very weepy.

1373
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,911
He became very enamored of his family

1374
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,706
in the last few years of his life.

1375
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:10,319
We would have these get togethers

1376
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,501
and I would catch him sitting in the corner

1377
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,212
just looking at everybody
with that grin on his face.

1378
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,089
It was like one of his movies.

1379
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,884
Like he became aware that
he was in his own movie.

1380
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,594
And he loved the cast.

1381
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,814
What does it mean to you?

1382
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,984
It's inspiration.

1383
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:51,665
Live from Hollywood it's the
78th Annual Academy Awards.

1384
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,546
Maverick filmmaker Robert Altman

1385
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:00,257
has been nominated five times for an Oscar

1386
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,967
without ever winning one.

1387
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:05,179
Today, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences

1388
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:08,265
is giving Altman a
lifetime achievement award

1389
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,267
in recognition of a career

1390
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,279
that has repeatedly reinvented the art form

1391
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:15,022
and inspired filmmakers
and audiences alike.

1392
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,761
Thank you.

1393
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:52,142
No other filmmaker has gotten
a better shake than I have.

1394
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,520
I'm very fortunate in my career.

1395
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:58,023
I've never had to direct
a film I didn't choose.

1396
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,817
I love filmmaking.

1397
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:03,570
It has given me an entree to the
world and to the human condition

1398
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,823
and for that I'm forever grateful.

1399
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,743
Finally, I would like to thank my family,

1400
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,203
which are all right there.

1401
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,495
All of them.

1402
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,415
For their love and support
through the years

1403
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,125
and most importantly

1404
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:21,297
I want to thank and applaud
my wife Kathryn Reed Altman,

1405
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,300
without whom I wouldn't be here today.

1406
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:27,803
I love you.

1407
01:28:29,631 --> 01:28:30,631
Thank you.

1408
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,183
Oh, one more thing.

1409
01:28:34,018 --> 01:28:38,856
I'm here, I think, under false pretenses

1410
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:44,403
and I think I have to
become straight with you,

1411
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:52,328
uh, ten years ago... 11 years
ago I had a heart transplant.

1412
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,330
A total heart transplant.

1413
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:56,081
I got the heart of, I think,

1414
01:28:56,373 --> 01:29:00,544
a young woman who was
about in her late 30's.

1415
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:04,757
And so by that kind of calculation,

1416
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:08,302
you may be giving me this award too early

1417
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:12,514
because I think I got about
40 years left on it.

1418
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,476
And I intend to use it.

1419
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:17,144
Thank you very much.

1420
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,666
He was in preproduction on a film called.

1421
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:42,086
"Hands on a Hard Body", scouting locations.

1422
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,881
He'd been diagnosed with cancer

1423
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:48,050
and he wanted to keep on working.

1424
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,635
Chemo or no chemo.

1425
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:54,014
It would have been his 40th movie.

1426
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:06,110
One day, years and years
ago, just after the war,

1427
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,862
Bob had nothing to do and
he went to a theater

1428
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:12,116
in the middle of the
afternoon to see a movie.

1429
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:14,785
Not a Hollywood movie, a British movie.

1430
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:35,431
He said the main character
was not glamorous.

1431
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:37,891
Not a babe, and at first he wondered
