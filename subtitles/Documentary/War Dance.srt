MAN: The defeat and breakup
of the Soviet empire,

2
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,172
culminating in the crumbling of the Berlin Wall,

3
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,425
is one of the great events of world history.

4
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,385
There were many heroes in this battle,

5
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,556
but to Charlie Wilson must go this special recognition.

6
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,978
Just 13 years ago,
the Soviet Army appeared to be invincible.

7
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,982
But Charlie, undeterred,

8
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:34,946
engineered a lethal body blow
that weakened the Communist empire.

9
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,993
Without Charlie, history would be hugely
and sadly different.

10
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,246
And so, for the first time,

11
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,708
a civilian is being given our highest recognition,

12
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,794
that of Honored Colleague.

13
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,631
Ladies and gentlemen of the Clandestine Services,

14
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,967
Congressman Charles Wilson.

(SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

16
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,451
- It'd be like Dallas.
- CRYSTAL: That's right.

17
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,246
- You know what I'm saying?
- Like Dallas but set in Washington.

18
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,123
- Yeah.
- And you should say it just like that.

19
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,707
- When I pitch it.
- You should say it just...

20
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,294
"Oh, this is fucking great."
You should say it just like that.

21
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,045
Dallas set in Washington D.C.

22
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,464
You know, with the intrigue and the power plays

23
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,634
- and the overt natural sex.
- The glamour, the power.

24
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,595
CRYSTAL: Do you know what I'm saying?
PAUL: It's fucking Dallas.

25
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,929
CRYSTAL: Or, or Falcon Crest.

26
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,265
- Yes.
- That's set in Washington.

27
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,933
Say it to Charlie like that.

28
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,145
The resistance fighters disguised us as one of them.

29
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,646
Charlie.

(CLEARS THROAT)

31
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,151
It's like Dallas but in Washington.

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,403
- With Crystal in the starring role.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,947
You tell me when to watch.
I'll make sure I'm home.

34
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,616
You don't think I can make it happen?

35
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,784
I don't know anything about how any of that works.

36
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,995
- I do.
- You said that you would listen to him.

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,246
That's why we're here.

38
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,790
Do they routinely give starring roles on network programs

39
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,084
to people who haven't acted professionally before?

40
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,378
She was just on the fucking cover of Playboy, Charlie.

41
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,172
Well, I guess that's just the same thing.

42
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,007
Would you take this seriously, please?

43
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,301
I am taking it seriously, hon,
but can you all tell me something?

44
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,303
What is...
What is Dan Rather wearing right now?

45
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,930
- What?
- Dan Rather.

46
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,015
- What is he wearing?
- You're watching TV?

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,517
- Why hasn't he shaved?
- Well, who gives a damn?

48
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,938
Excuse me! Hey!
Excuse me, could you turn that up?

49
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,899
Could you just turn up the volume on the TV?

50
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,442
Oh, I'm completely high.

51
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,069
Yeah. Okay.

52
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:42,698
Still, could you just grab the remote there
and find the volume button?

53
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,325
Charlie, are we gonna do business?

54
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,495
Dan Rather is wearing a turban, Paul.
Don't you want to know why?

55
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,873
He's doing a thing from India.

56
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,375
No, that's Afghanistan.

57
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,709
- Got it.
- Appreciate it.

58

WOMAN TRANSLATOR: We got it...
We captured it from the Afghan,

59
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,337
- the Afghan army.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,964
Does he have ammunition for this?
He has three.

61
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,007
But does he have ammunition?
A lot of ammunition?

62
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,759
Well, he's talking about the mujahideen.

63
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,136
WOMAN: No, we don't, we didn't capture any.
PAUL: Priests?

64
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,807
No, mujahideen means, like, holy warriors.

65
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,476
- Priests!
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

66

Paul.

67
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,273
And he was... He is saying that,
you know, America seems to be asleep.

68
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,402
It doesn't seem to realize that if Afghanistan goes

69
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,529
and the Russians go over to the Gulf,

70
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:26,242
that in a very short time, it's going to be
the turn of the United States as well.

I'm not a police officer, if that's what you're asking.

75
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,797
No. We just... We don't meet a lot of guys
here who both, you know,

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,717
- know about the world and like to party.
- (CLEARS THROAT) No.

of the U.S. House of Representatives.

- I'm sorry?
- I'm a Congressman.

- Are you kidding?
- No. No, I'm absolutely serious.

I'm Charlie Wilson. I represent
the Texas Second Congressional.

What are your names?

- Stacey.
- Stacey.

- Kelly.
- Kelly. Well, it's nice to meet you both.

85

If you are a Congressman should you be
in here with strippers and blow?

Hey, I'm not a stripper.

- I am a stripper.
- I'm a stripper.

Yes, see, they were talking about themselves.

89
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:24,508
You know, you do have a point there.
I really should get going. A little pruney.

90
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,636
Look, Charlie, I need $29,000 to make it happen.

91
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,473
And you know I can make it happen,
and you know you want in on this.

Hey, who wants to take a ride with me to the airport?

93

- Oh, me!
- Paul?

00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,854
Okay.

DAN ON TV: ...a holy war against the Soviets.

96
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,027
A war they say that, if they get weapons,

97
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,739
from us or anyone else in the free world, they will win.

- From Texas.

Has there ever been a show about Washington?

- I don't think there has.
- Me, neither.

Thank you.
We got the suite another night. Comped.

- No.

- You can't stay another night?
- No. No.

106

- Stay another night.
- I can't. I have a vote.

107
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,718
What, an important one?

108
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,720
- Yes.
- What is it?

109
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,516
Well, it's a non-binding resolution
expressing the sense of the Congress

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,644
that the Department of Defense
should continue to exercise its authority

111

to support the Boy Scouts of America.

- that Crystal and I want to do.
- First off, I'd appreciate it

if you didn't throw my name around quite so much,

117
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,619
'cause, from time to time, I use it myself,
and I need it in good condition.

118
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,871
Second, I'm from Lufkin, Texas.

119
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,748
I'm the son of an accountant for a timber company.

120
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,710
I take home about 700 bucks a week, and I pay alimony,

121
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,756
so the idea that I got $29,000
in the bank is pretty hysterical.

122
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,925
That said, I love your idea.

- Bye. We love you!
- We love you!

- That Dairy Queen guy, Larry Liddle,

133
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,281
- is sitting in your office.
- Hey.

134
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,907
Yeah, I told him he could come in.

135
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,784
He wants to talk to you about a crèche.

What, a nativity scene with baby Jesus?

137
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,038
Yeah, it's on public property,
and the city's making him move it.

138
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,665
Shit. I thought he was just coming in

139
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
- to get his picture took, you know?
- Congressman.

140
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,710
- Yeah?
- You're exactly who I need to speak to.

141
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,961
- You have a moment?
- Sure.

142
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,838
- Tip asked me to talk to you.
- Okay.

143
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,798
He wanted me to talk to you about John Murtha.

144
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,467
- Go ahead.
- The prosecutor's gonna go after him.

145
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,969
Well, they ain't gonna find anything.

146
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,305
John Murtha's as clean as my mother's kitchen floor.

147
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,391
Yeah, but Tip would like to put you
on the Ethics Committee just the same.

148
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,185
- You're kidding.
- No.

149
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,395
Well, Jesus, Donnelly, everyone in town knows

150
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm on the other side of that issue.

151
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,982
- Ethics?
- Yeah!

152
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,943
Well, the Speaker would like to put you
on the committee anyway.

153
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,530
Okay. Well, if anyone asks what the hell
I'm doing on the Ethics Committee,

154
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,325
we'll just tell them I like chasing women
and drinking whiskey

155
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,535
and the Speaker felt we were underrepresented.

156
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,287
- One man, one vote.
- Exactly.

157
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,705
Tip's gonna want to return the favor.

158
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,707
- Tuesday, right?
- That is Tuesday, yes.

159
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,501
So if anything comes up that you'd like me
to speak with him about, please...

160
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,669
Yes.

161
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,171
Yes!

162
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,341
I'd like to be on the Board of Directors
of the Kennedy Center.

163
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,508
- Charlie.
- I'm sorry?

164
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,553
Turns out Congress appoints the
Board of Directors of the Kennedy Center.

165
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:18,557
It's a great place to take a date,
and I can never afford the tickets.

166
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,517
- Consider it done.
- Excellent.

167
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,519
Go vote.

168
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,564
Another few minutes.
Let's see what's on the wires.

169
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,359
Why can't you wait for newspapers like everybody else?

170
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,694
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

171
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,322
And it makes me one day smarter than you,
which I enjoy as well.

172
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,865
I know you do.

173
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,408
You don't think that's a little crazy?

174
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,661
Pan Am and Eastern are lowering their fares.

175
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,579
- 'Cause of Braniff.
- What's a little crazy?

176
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,081
Joining the Board of the Kennedy Center

177
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,083
so you can get free tickets to the Royal Ballet of...

178
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,251
- Hold on.
- What?

179
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,044

180
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,504

181

Afghanistan.

182
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,385
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

183
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,303
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

184
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,308
Jim Van Wagenen's our point man on black approps

185
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,726
for the Defense Subcommittee?

186
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,894
Yeah.

187
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,188
Have him come to my office as soon as possible.

188
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,731
- How am I voting on this?
- BONNIE: Yes.

189
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,941
- You sure?
- Yes.

190
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,526
The Boy Scouts?

191
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,195
Jim Van Wagenen.
Get him and show him that wire story.

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,072
- Yes, sir.
- You are the man I wanted to talk to.

193
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,035
The Congressman will be here in a moment.
He's just coming up from a vote.

194
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,705
- I'm sure it's an important one.
- No. Not really.

195
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,082
SUZANNE: So, Marla, can you fit this
into his schedule next week?

(PHONE RINGING)

Good morning.

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,588
It is? How are you?

BONNIE: Suzanne,
can you help me with this?

201
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,591
SUZANNE: Okay. I'll be right back.
RECEPTIONIST: I'll have him do it.

202
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,759
Okay, bye-bye.

- LARRY: Miss?
- Yes, sir?

204
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,724
It seems to me, looking around,
that it's almost all women working here,

205
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,184
and that they're all very pretty.

206
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,603
- Is that common?
- (LAUGHS) Well,

207
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,897
Congressman Wilson, he has an expression.

208
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,610
He says, "You can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits."

209
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,237
Well, that's charming.

210
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,989
- Larry!
- Congressman!

211
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,909
No, no, no. For $5,000 every two years
you get to call me Charlie.

212
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,830
And for 10,000, you can call me Betty Sue
and I'll clean out your rain gutters.

213
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,956
This is my daughter, Jane.

214
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,959
- Well, now I remember Jane. Two-L at SMU.
- Charlie Wilson's office. Good morning.

215
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,627
Welcome to the United States Congress.

216
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,047
Hey, I'm gonna talk to your daddy
for a couple of seconds.

217
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,299
Larry, can we get you a drink?

218
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,802
- It's 10:00 in the morning.
- Well, fair enough, I guess.

219
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,138
Grab a seat.

220
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,725
Now, this situation with the crèche,
I want to know all about it.

221
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,934
Well, sir,

222
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,061
(CLEARS THROAT)

223
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
every single year since the world was young,

224
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,194
the firehouse in the Nacogdoches Township
has displayed a crèche.

225
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,697
Now, the ACLU has filed suit against the township

226
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:42,284
for displaying a religious symbol on public property.

227
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,495
It's Christmas time. It's a crèche.

228
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,331
I could understand
if we were in gosh-darn Scarsdale,

229
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,001
but this is east Texas,
and I want to know who we're offending.

230
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,920
Except two lawyers from the ACLU.

231
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,423
That is a terribly interesting and complicated question.

232
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,342
Let me make this suggestion, though.

233
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,220
There's a church about a block and a half

234
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,223
from that firehouse, First Baptist Church of Nacogdoches.

235
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,933
They've got a beautiful rolling lawn

236
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,852
- out there in front.
- No, no. This is a Christian country, Charlie,

237
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,896
- founded on Christian values.
- Sure.

238
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,023
We welcome other faiths to worship as they wish,

239
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,484
but when you can't put a nativity scene

240
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,654
in front of a firehouse at Christmas time
in Nacogdoches Township,

241
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,155
something's gone terribly wrong.

242
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,324
Well, that's not really true, Larry.

243
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,993
You could move that crèche over to that church

244
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,329
- and everything's just fine.
- That's not the point!

245
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,541
Okay. Why don't we just start back
at the beginning?

246
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,792
What can I do for you?

247
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,044
You can intervene in the case
against the crèche committee.

248
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,295
Intervene? How?

249
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,257
- You appointed the judge.
- I don't appoint judges.

250
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,301
I just made a recommendation to the President.

251
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,594
I think you and I both know what that means.

252

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

253
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,682
I cannot just call up a judge and tell him what to do.

254
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,642
- Why?
- Well, 'cause it's against a shitload

255
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,978
of really good laws, Gary.

I got to go talk to this guy out here
for a second. Will you excuse me?

258
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,821
By the way, I love Jesus Christ
and his mother Mary as much as anybody.

About 38 churches you could move
that crèche to, everybody lives.

- All in?
- All in.

272
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,557
It's 5 million.

273
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,312
Well, they can't shoot down helicopters
for $5 million, Jim.

274
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,773
Though they're trying to.
Which is more than I can say for us.

I was the best officer he ever served at sea with,

Now follow it around to the right.

308
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,912
The Jefferson Memorial.
The Arlington Bridge.

309
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,915
And there's the Pentagon.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,585
- Oh, that's the Pentagon.
- That's the Pentagon.

311
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,547
How about I show you the second best view
in the District?

312
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,674
Why, Jane, would you like...

313
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,050
(PHONE RINGING)

314
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,635
(SIGHS)

315
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,887
Well, that was predictable.

316
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,140
Just give me one second.

317
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,268
- Hello?
- WOMAN: That was an extraordinary thing

318
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,853
you did today.

319
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,439
- Who is this?
- It's Joanne.

320
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,982
Joanne!

321
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,820
Why, gosh, how nice to hear from you.
Could I call you back in a little bit?

322
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,031
Is Ronald Reagan in your bedroom right now?

323
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,158
- No.
- Then I'm considerably more important

324
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,201
- than whoever is.
- Is anything wrong?

325
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,996
This is gonna take just a second or two.

326
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,624
Okay, I'm all yours.

327
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,961
What did I do that was so extraordinary?

328
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,171
"Double it."

329
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,048
'Cause I was told you didn't have a girlfriend.

330
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,176
- What?
- You told Jim Van Wagenen to double it.

331
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,554
Well, shit, Joanne,
I don't know what you're talking about,

332
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,973
and if I did, it'd be classified,

333
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,600
and I'd wonder where you got your information

334
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,809
on the Subcommittee.

335
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,186
Oh, what do you care, hon?

336
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,981
It's a little matter of national security
and I can't help but think...

337
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,150
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

338
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,818
- Hold on.
- I am sorry,

339
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,904
but I was told you didn't have a girlfriend.

340
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,991
I don't. This isn't my girlfriend.
It's the sixth wealthiest woman in Texas.

341
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,826
Which is still pretty good.

342
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,119
Okay, so, hi.

343
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,789
A friend of mine has made a terrific movie about the need

344
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,999
for American aid to Afghanistan.

345
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,626
- He's made a movie?
- Yes.

346
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,505
I'm gonna run this movie Friday night
at my house at a fundraiser.

347
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,840
You know, you've never been to my house, Charlie.

348
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,843
You want me to come to Houston and see a movie?

349
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,055
There'll be women and wealthy donors.
See you Friday.

350
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,515
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,022
Hey.

352
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,108
Hey.

353
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,699
Thank you, Joanne.

354
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,870
Okay. I know it was difficult for you
to come in here, hat in hand.

355
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,874
That's not the kind of upbringing, I guess,
is the word I'm looking for.

356
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,711
It's not the kind of man you are.
I understand that.

357
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,964
I'm not looking to humiliate you
or exact a price in any way,

358
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,966
so why don't you just apologize?

359
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
We'll call it water under the dam,
and we'll go about our business.

360
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,595
Excuse me, what the fuck?

361
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,557
- What?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

362
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,559
Clair George said you were coming in here to apologize.

363
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,145
No, I'm supposed to come in here
so you could apologize to me.

364
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,980
- According to whom?
- Clair George.

365
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,066
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize to you?

366
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,236
Also, water goes over a dam
and under a bridge, you poncy schoolboy.

367
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,573
Clearly there's been a miscommunication
between Clair George and somebody.

368
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,824
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

369
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,250
- Does this look all right?
- It's fine.

370
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,326
- Thank you.
- I can sand it down a little.

371
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,579
I, I don't know.
I have no fucking idea who this guy is.

372
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,415
He is here to fix the glass that you broke
the last time you were here.

373
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,499
Could you just excuse us

374
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,834
- for a second there?
- Yes.

375
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,085
You tell me to go fuck myself

376
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,837
and I'm supposed to apologize?
You break my window,

377
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,705
- I'm supposed to apologize?
- The Helsinki job was mine!

378
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,425
The Helsinki job was not yours.
If it was yours, you'd be in Helsinki.

379
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,976
- Alan Wolfe stood in this office!
- Alan Wolfe

380
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,511
- is no longer the Director.
- Yeah, it was on the books!

381
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,347
Alan Wolfe is no longer
the Director of European Operations.

382
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,766
He does not make those appointments. I do.

383
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,601
- Promises were made.
- Not by me.

384
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,936
I've been with the company for 24 years.

385
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,938
I was posted in Greece for 15.

386
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,776
Papandreou wins that election
if I don't help the junta take him prisoner.

387
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,780
I've advised and armed the Hellenic army.
I've neutralized champions of Communism.

388
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,116
I've spent the past three years learning Finnish!

389
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,118
Which should come in handy here in Virginia!

390
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,204
And I'm never, ever, sick at sea.

391
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,624
So I want to know why I'm not gonna be
your Helsinki station chief.

392
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,542
- You're coarse.
- Excuse me?

393
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,212
For Helsinki, I need someone with diplomatic skills.

394
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,496
- You don't have them.
- Is that right?

395
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,632
That is right. And I don't know
why the hell I didn't fire you

396
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,718
- when you broke my fucking window!
- Oh, yes, sure you do, Cravely.

397
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,804
- Look, Gust...
- Yeah, you're fucking Roger's fiancée

398
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,222
and you know I know.

399
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,975
I'm not... I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

400
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,977
Yeah, yeah, you're dignifying her in the ass

401
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,979
at the Jefferson Hotel, room 1210.

402
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,982
But let me ask you.
The 3,000 agents Turner fired

403
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,235
was that because they lacked diplomatic skills as well?

404
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,153
You're referring to Admiral Stansfield Turner?

405
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,321
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

406
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,324
Each and every goddamn one of them
first or second generation Americans.

407
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,910
Is that because they lack the proper diplomatic skills?

408
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,412
Or did Turner not think it was a good idea to have spies

409
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,833
who could speak the same language
as the people they're fucking spying on?

410
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,418
Well, I'm sorry, but you can hardly blame the Director

411
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,505
for questioning the loyalty to America
of people that are just barely Americans

412
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,590
- in the first place.
- Yeah, well, I'd like to take a moment

413
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,259
to review the several ways in which you're a douchebag.

414
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,344
- Get the fuck out of my office!
- Yes, sir.

415
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,847
- Before I end your career, asshole.
- Yes, sir!

416
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,058
Yeah, my friend, I'm gonna need you for a second.

God damn it!

419
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,188
My loyalty?

420
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,692
For 24 years, people have been trying to kill me.

421
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,110
People who know how.

422
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,196
Now, do you think that's because
my dad was a Greek soda pop maker

423
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,615
or do you think that's because I'm an American spy?

424
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,243
Go fuck yourself, you fucking child.

425
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,792
How was I?

426
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,878
Thank you.

427
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,382
There's a woman in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, named Nitsa.

428
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,634
And she thinks she's a witch.

429
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,137
Yeah, she offered to put a curse on Cravely for me.

430
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,305
Yeah?

431
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,723
And she...

432
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,102
She asked me do I want a professional curse
or a health curse.

433
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,065
"If it's a health curse, I can do it right away,
but a professional curse takes longer."

434
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,152
Well, I'm living proof she's right about that.

435
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,571
- Did you get the brownie?
- Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

436
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,947
I got you.

437
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,244
I'm reading transcripts of phone conversations

438
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,996
between French and German generals

439
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,416
arguing over office space at NATO headquarters

440
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,253
and analyzing wiretaps out of Mercury Bay, New Zealand.

441

You know, historically, a hotbed
of anti-American activity.

442
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,802
Yeah, nobody will come near me.
I'm in the weeds.

443
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,264
You know, a typical case officer

444
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,269
doesn't walk into his boss's office
and tell him to go fuck himself. Twice.

445
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,022
I just told you, I paid a witch in Pennsylvania $80

446
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,816
to put a curse on Henry Cravely for me.

447
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,611
- Do I sound like a typical case officer?
- No.

448
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,364
Well, then, let's assume I'm not.

449
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,616
Listen. If you're really not doing anything,

450
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,284
why don't you come upstairs and work with us?

451
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,995
- What are you doing?
- Killing Russians.

00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,645
(CROWD CHEERING)

460
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,564
I have 10,000, who'll give me 11?
11, 11, I got 11.

461
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,483
I got 15 right here. Thank you very much.

462
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,819
Oh, my God, she is a Minute Woman.

463
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,737
No, she's a Tri-Delt.

464
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,825
- No, she is a Minute Woman, Charlie.
- Oh. Joanne.

465
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,745
Yeah, she's a direct descendant
of George Washington's sister.

466
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,665
Says she had a great uncle who was killed at the Alamo.

467
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,835
Former Miss Cotton Bowl.
Had her own local television talk show.

468
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,088
Look. Pakistan's Honorary Consul
to Houston, Texas.

469
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
How's that for a title, huh?

470
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,759
This is an ultra-right wing group
of anti-Communist fanatics.

471
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,179
- They're not ultra-right wing.
- What are they?

472
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,015
Well, they're ultra-right wing.

473
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,434
What are you doing hanging around this woman?

474
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,187
Did you hear me say she was a former Miss Cotton Bowl?

475
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,690
- You are unbelievable.
- Oh, come on. You're gonna love her.

476
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,692
And, you know, one of the things
she's trying to do over there

477
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,277
is liberate the women.

478
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,196
And what better way than through a slave girl auction?

479
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,531
JOANNE: Charlie.

480
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,619
So sorry for keeping you waiting.

481
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,788
Oh, it's no problem, Joanne.

482
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,208
- This is Bonnie Bach.
- So nice to meet you.

483
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,716
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Herring.
This is a wonderful party.

484
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,553
Why don't you give us a few moments?

485
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,972
Yes, sir.

486
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,311
Oh, Bobbie, if you could ask someone
for a Bombay martini up, very dry?

487
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,480
Oh, I'm not a slave girl, actually.

488
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,732
I'm the Congressman's administrative assistant.

489
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,401
- Isn't that wonderful for you.
- Yes.

490
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,404
Two olives, please.
Tell them it's for me, they'll know.

491
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,781
Certainly.

492
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,409
She doesn't like me.

493
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,079
- Everybody likes you.
- She's a liberal.

494
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,914
Well, I'm a liberal.

495
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,124
Not where it counts.

496
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,918
Have you seen the house?

497
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,088
Well, I've seen the downstairs, what's upstairs?

498
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,506
Fourteen bedrooms.

499
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,007
I should have a look.

500
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,927
- What did you think of the movie?
- What, that thing we just saw?

501
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,012
The reason for the party, yes.

502
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,848
Well, I'm not an expert in the field or anything,

503
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,768
but the production quality seemed amateurish to me.

504
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,605
Yeah, I'm not submitting the thing
for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie.

505
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,941
You know what I'm talking about.

506
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,693
Well, as a member of the Defense Subcommittee,

507
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,112
did you think I wasn't aware

508
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,364
that the Soviet Union's invaded Afghanistan?

509
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,366
Yes, I believe my government is aware,

510
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,952
but I was wondering if they were thinking
of doing anything about it

511
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,205
other than boycotting the Olympics,
which I think you'll agree,

512
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,790
was a fairly impotent response

513
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,544
to the greatest national security threat
we've faced since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

514
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,797
Well, I don't think making more movies
about it is gonna do the trick,

515
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,465
if that's what you're asking.

516
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,842
It's not.

517
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,804
Exactly how much power do you have
as a member of the Subcommittee?

518
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,557
- Which one? I'm on two.
- Foreign Ops.

519
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,810
Eight members and myself hand out
11 billion in foreign assistance.

520
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,062
And what about the Defense Subcommittee?

521
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,230
Our budget is hidden.

522
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,233
- It is also unlimited.
- Yeah.

523
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,820
Would you like to see my room?

524
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,988
Yeah.

525
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,156
(WHIMPERING)

526
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,243
So, unless I'm wrong, and that would be unusual for me,

527
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,163
you sit at the intersection of the State Department,

528
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,248
the Pentagon and the CIA.

529
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,668
You meet in a soundproof room underneath the Capitol,

530
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,088
and you preside over a secret and unlimited budget

531
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,842
for the three agencies you would need
to conduct a covert war.

532
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,510
Isn't that right?

533
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,846
I also have seats at the Kennedy Center.

534
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,266
Isn't that how you were able
to double the CIA budget for black approps

535
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,768
in Afghanistan just by saying so?

536
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,439
Why are you only asking me questions
you already know the answers to?

537
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,358
Why is Congress saying one thing and doing nothing?

538
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,402
Well, tradition mostly.

539
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,076
Come here.

540
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,786
Okay.

541
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,966
I do not understand the energy women have after sex.

542
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,886
You're dancing around, you're baking a pie.

543
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,763
- JOANNE: Charlie?
- Yes, ma'am?

544
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:00,058
Why is the CIA running a fake war in Afghanistan?

545
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,143
They're doing everything they can.

546
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,103
They're doing it badly.

547
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,648
The CIA is arming the mujahideen.

548
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,899
Where do you think they're getting their weapons?

549
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,319
They're arming them
with 12.7 millimeter Dishukas

550
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,071
which would be good,

551
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,241
except the Soviets have specifically
amour-plated their Hind helicopter

552
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,244
to resist a 12.7 millimeter shell.

553
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,496
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

554
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,250
but didn't give them
the look-down/shoot-down radar.

555
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,417
If this were a real war,

556
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,920
State would issue a white paper
outlining the Communist threat

557
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,172
the way they did in El Salvador.

558
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,093
If this were a real war,
there'd be a National Bipartisan Commission

559
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,764
on Afghanistan, headed by Henry Kissinger
the way they did in Central America.

560
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,018
If this were a real war,
Congress would authorize $24 million

561
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,355
for covert operations the way you did in Nicaragua.

562
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,774
If this were a real war...

563
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,860
You may be the sexiest woman ever.

564
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm not kidding. You are Helen of Troy.

565
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:59,117
- Are you patronizing me?
- What do you want me to do, Joanne?

566
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,286
This is what I want you to do.

567
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,497
I want you to save Afghanistan for the Afghans.

568
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,793
I want you to deliver such a crushing defeat
to the Soviets that Communism crumbles,

569
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,212
and in so doing, end the Cold War.

570
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,380
I'll tell you, I'd do it, too,

571
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,966
but I got this Dairy Queen problem in Nacogdoches.

572
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,012
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.

573
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,472
What exactly do you want me to do?

574
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,309
- Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.
- CHARLIE: Zia?

575
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,519
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

576
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,646
He's the President of Pakistan.

577
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,231
I've already arranged it.

578
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,067
You've arranged a meeting
between me and the President of Pakistan?

579
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,319
Yes.

580
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,405
You're going to Israel next week
to meet with Zvi Rafiah about the Lavi jets.

581
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,408
I want you to tack Pakistan on the end of your trip.

582
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,659
And meet with the President?

583
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,912
Let him convince you that it's a Christian imperative

584
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,207
to let the Afghans rid their country of Communism.

585
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,837
Okay. It's not likely
the President of Pakistan is a Christian,

586
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,506
but I'm gonna do this for you, Joanne,

587
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,343
'cause you saved my ass once
with the pro-lifers

588
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:02,680
and I owe you my seat in Congress
and because you look very good naked.

589
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,768
But I have to tell you, I'm elected by Jews.

590
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,187
How many Jews do you have in your district?

591
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,355
Seven.

592
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,941
But congressmen aren't elected by voters,
they're elected by contributors,

593
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:17,028
and mine are in, well, New York, Florida, Hollywood,

594
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,614
because I'm one of Israel's guys on the Hill.

595
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,451
And I don't know how they're gonna feel
about me taking up the cause of Muslims.

- Yes, it is.

- Thank you.

You must be thirsty.
Can we get you a drink?

and any kind of whiskey.

- Okay.
- Brigadier?

630
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,943
So you understand the situation on our border?

631
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,863
Yes, sir, I think I do. And I think it's terrible.

632
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,700
And I know I speak for all the people
in the Texas Second Congressional District

633
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,286
when I say our thoughts and our prayers are with you.

634
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,872
All the people
of the Texas Second Congressional District,

635
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,290
- you say?
- Yes, indeed, sir.

636
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,378
Three million Afghan refugees
are living like poorly treated livestock.

637
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,213
Another two million have fled into Iran.

638
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,798
And two million more angry men

639
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,883
is just what the doctors ordered for Iran,
don't you think?

640
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,553
People are dying by the tens of thousands.

641
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,639
And the ones that aren't are crossing
into Pakistan every day.

642
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,224
MAHMOOD: Would you
like to know how many?

643
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:37,728
One fifth of Afghanistan now lives
in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province.

644
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,814
ZIA: So, what I have been wondering is

645
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,067
why your State Department would send someone here

646
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,319
who thinks he understands the problem.

647
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,906
'Cause I don't think the prayers
of the Texas Second Congressional District

648
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,324
are going to turn the trick.

649
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,411
Well, now, I wasn't sent here
by the State Department, Mr. President.

650
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,496
I was asked to come here by our friend in Houston.

651
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,748
So this is a courtesy call.

652
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,669
I don't need courtesy.
I need airplanes, guns and money.

653
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:06,090
Well, we just doubled the CIA budget

654
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,925
- for covert ops...
- From 5 million to 10 million.

655
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,261
- That's right.
- Is that a joke?

656
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,514
- No.
- Is that meant to be a funny joke?

657
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,434
- No, sir.
- ZIA: Congressman, what they're saying is

658
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,146
$10 million from the U.S.
to fight the Russian Army

659
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,858
is such a low figure that it can be mistaken for a joke.

660
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,653
I caught up to the sarcasm there, sir.
Let me be clear.

661
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,781
The United States is eager to assist you.

662
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,949
- No, you're not.
- You're not.

663
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,701
- Absolutely not.
- I went to Oxford

664
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,119
and I know what that word means.

665
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,371
The U.S. is not eager to assist us.

666
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,291
Well, now it's my understanding
that we offered to sell you F-16s.

667
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,127
- You didn't want them.
- Because you refused to sell us the radar.

668
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,462
RASHID: So to hell with that.

669
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,840
ZIA: And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

670
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,467
when it comes to fighting the Soviets.

671
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,470
- To hell with it!
- You sell us the planes but not the radar.

672
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,681
You offer Afghans rifles from the First World War

673
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,393
while Soviet helicopters
are killing everything they can find,

674
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,063
- people, animals, food supplies.
- So to hell with it!

675
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,398
- Yeah.
- You sell the Israelis the radar,

676
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,484
so that's why he says, "To hell with it."

677
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,694
Again, I understood. Yeah.

678
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,323
Also, the arms and funding should flow through us.

679
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,244
- I'm sorry?
- That's been part of the problem.

680
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,830
The arms and the funding should flow through us.

681
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,541
We have experience with warfare of this kind.

682
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,544
And your CIA has an unimpressive track record.

683
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,797
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

684
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,759
They missed 130,000 Soviet soldiers
walking into Afghanistan.

Okay, we blew that call.

686
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,013
I would say so.

687
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:46,065
Well, I don't want to use up anymore of your hospitality,

688
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:51,028
so I will take your message back
to my committee chairman,

689
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,864
and we will give it our fullest attention.

00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,708

you cannot deliver.

No, I don't, Mr. President.

698
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,803
Then promise me this.

00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,557
with Enfield rifles.
That's basically what Davy Crockett used.

770
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,477
The Soviet Hind gunship is especially amour
plated to resist bullets.

771
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,523
Yeah, I know, I know. So you tell me
what you need to shoot them down.

772
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,400
- What do you mean?
- Tell me what you need.

773
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,745
Do you understand what I'm saying?

774
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,657
You tell me what you need,
and I will go about getting it for you.

775
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,076
Congressman, I appreciate your generosity,

776
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,997
but a sudden influx of money
and modern weaponry would draw attention.

777
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,417
- What?
- A sudden influx of money and modern...

778
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,587
- Wait, it would draw attention?
- Yeah.

779
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,174
Why, I don't even know what that means.

780
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,009
This is the Cold War.
Everybody knows about it.

781
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,136
Should I continue with the briefing?

782
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,306
Have you been to these refugee camps?
Have you heard these stories?

783
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,601
Congressman, I am required to give you a briefing.

784
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,603
Should I continue?

785
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,438
No. Thank you.

786
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,827
(SIGHING)

787
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,124
You know, I had a neighbor, growing up,
with a name right out of Dickens.

788
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,460
Mr. Charles Hazard.

789
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,965
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighborhood dogs

790
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,134
messing up his flower beds.

791
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,611
One day, I heard a bunch of yelling
from across the street,

792
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,054
so I ran on over to Mr. Hazard's,

793
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,892
and there were about 15 grown-ups
standing around my dog, Teddy,

794
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,854
who was writhing on the ground in obvious agony.

795
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,273
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.

796
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,650
Mr. Hazard had ground up a glass bottle

797
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,987
and put it in a bowl of dog food and fed it to him.

798
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,324
What did you do?

799
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,952
Well, I got some gasoline
and burned down his flower beds.

800
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,455
But that wasn't satisfying enough.

801
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,210
And then I remembered,
Mr. Hazard was an elected official.

802
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,629
He was the head of the town council.

803
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,590
His reelection every two years was a foregone conclusion.

804
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:36,094
So come Election Day,
I drove over to the black section of town.

805
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,473
Now, these people hadn't voted
in any of these elections, so...

806
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,434
I was only 13, but I had a farmer's license

807
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,813
and I filled up my car with black voters
and drove them to the polling place

808
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:51,193
and then waited, then drove them on home.
But before they got out of the car to vote

809
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:56,406
I said, "I don't mean to influence you,
but I think you should know

810
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,077
"Mr. Charles Hazard
has intentionally killed my dog."

811
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,207
About 400 ballots were cast in that election.

812
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,876
I drove 96 of them to the polls.

813
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,046
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

814
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:18,136
And that's the day I fell in love with America.

815
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,475
What time do we land?

816
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,144
7:30 a.m. in D.C.

817
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,439
I want the CIA in my office at 10:00.

818
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,776
Assistant Deputy Director or higher.

819
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,862
Tell them that if I don't see
someone at 10:00,

820
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:40,867
I'm gonna start docking their allowance
at a rate of $1 million a minute.

821
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,327
Yes, sir.

822
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,079
And get me another one of them, would you?

823
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,247
(CLEARING THROAT)

824
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,416
Yes, sir.

825
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:50,127
AGENT PATRICK: The AKs,
RPG-7 grenade launchers

826
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,170
AGENT PATRICK: The AKs,
RPG-7 grenade launchers

827
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,465
and 82 millimeter mortars are coming
into Pakistan by air and sea,

828
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,217
and then trucks take them to the Afghan border.

829
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,177
AGENT WELLS: Then we
take them across on mules,

830
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,887
which are running a little more than we thought.

831
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,639
- The mules?
- They're 2,400 a piece,

832
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:04,683
- plus we got to get them checked out.
- For what?

833
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,020
Diseases. Foot and mouth.
Plus they have to have their ears cleaned.

834
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,439
The mules are getting better health care
than the Afghans.

835
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,817
AGENT WELLS: Plus, they're gonna cost
a little extra if we want them pre-trained.

836
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,444
- To do what?
- Walk over a mountain

837
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,611
with ammunition on their back.

838
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,030
Aren't they born with that instinct?

839
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,782
I mean, isn't that something they want to do naturally?

840
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,119
You think Afghanistan might, one day,
think about building some fucking roads?

841
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,954
- Gust.
- Yeah?

842
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,956
I got something for you.

843
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,334
I need you to be specific...

844
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,878
MARLA: The whole thing has changed.
Get your diary. I'll show you.

845
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,046
Okay.

846
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,174
RECEPTIONIST: No problem. Thank you.

847
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,637
- He should be here any moment.
- Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

848
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,891
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Congressman.

849
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,601
- Welcome back.
- Yeah. Marla.

850
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,102
- Welcome back.
- Suzanne.

851
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,645
Welcome back.

852
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,274
- Who are you?
- RECEPTIONIST: This is Gust Avrakotos.

853
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,160
He's come up from Langley to bring you the information

854
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,153
- that you wanted.
- Bonnie!

855
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,323
- Yes, sir?
- I said Assistant Deputy Director or higher.

856
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,374
- I know, sir. I called...
- No, Assistant Deputies don't come

857
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,493
to the Hill without a subpoena.

858
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,245
I'm the guy you want to talk to,
Congressman. I'm on the Afghan desk.

859
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,206
- You're on the Afghan desk?
- Yeah.

860
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,875
Well, I wouldn't be too proud of that.
I just got back from there.

861
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,294
Oh, I know. And that's a hell of a flight, too.

862
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,171
That nine hours flying time against the jet stream.

863
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,382
Probably had to stop in Brussels,
plus the time difference.

864
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,510
- I'd be a little grumpy myself.
- I ain't grumpy because of the plane.

865
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:25,722
We want to give you this
'cause we know you like single malt.

866
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,265
It's called Talisker,

867
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,351
and it's mentioned in a Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

868
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,228
The Scotsman's Return from Abroad.

869
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,188
"The king o' drinks, as I conceive it,

870
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,732
"Talisker, Isla or Glenlivet!"

871
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,318
- Who are you again?
- Gust Avrakotos.

872
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,739
- Have Bonnie come into this meeting.
- MARLA: Yes, sir.

873
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,200
What's the gift for?

874
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,120
It's from the Afghan desk
for doubling the budget for the mujahideen.

875
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,914
Oh. Well, thank you.

876
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,083
It was nothing.

877
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,877
Well, it's a nice bottle of Scotch.

878
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,548
- Must've been hard to get.
- No, doubling the budget was nothing.

879
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,634
I mean, $10 million for covert ops
against the Russian Army is meaningless.

880
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,220
- What are you, an infant?
- Now, you hang on just one second.

881
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,681
- I don't remember your name.
- Gust Avrakotos.

882
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,808
- Gust Avrakotos.
- Yeah.

883
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,560
Okay, you mind if I call you Gus?

884
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,062
Yeah, well, my name's Gust with a "t," but I don't care.

885
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:19,568
Fifteen hours ago, I offered Harold Holt
the keys to the safe, okay?

886
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,656
I stood there in the office in Islamabad,
and I said, "How much do you need?"

887
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,241
And I was apparently annoying him.

888
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,077
Well, Harold Holt's a massive tool,
Congressman. He's a cake-eater.

889
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,871
He's a clown. He's a bad station chief.

890
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,999
And I don't mean to cast aspersions
on a guy, but he's gonna get us all killed.

891
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

892
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,211
Well, how does he expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...

893
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,338
- He said, "A sudden influx of money..."
- Yeah, an influx of money

894
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,756
and new weaponry would draw attention.

895
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,301
He's not trying to defeat the Soviets, Congressman.

896
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,469
What the hell are you talking about?

897
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,595
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

898
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,847
Excuse me.

899
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,683
I'm the Congressman's aide, Bonnie Bach.

900
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,934
Gust Avrakotos.

901
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,686
Gus, I need the room for a second.

902
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,438
- Sure.
- Jailbait!

903
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,777
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Whoa, all right.

904
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,070
Just tell me what's happening.

905
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,364
A Justice Department task force that was formed last year

906
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,617
to investigate reports of sex
between members of the House

907
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,496
and their male interns has recently widened
to include the use of recreational drugs

908
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,498
by senators and congressmen.

909
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,832
Do you know a man named Paul Brown?

910
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:16,958
BONNIE: He doesn't have
to answer that. Keep going.

911
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,084
Oh, shit.

912
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:22,172
Paul Brown, under investigation
by federal prosecutors for fraud.

913
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,634
He wanted me to invest in some TV show for Crystal.

914
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,094
Well, he's saying he witnessed
you doing cocaine nine times

915
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,096
in a fantasy suite in Las Vegas.

916
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,891
Brian Ross at NBC is breaking the story.

917
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,978
All right, guys. I was in Las Vegas
with Crystal and Paul Brown,

918
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,356
because she wanted me to talk to him about this thing.

919
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,107

Well, he wants to bleed them.
Payback for Vietnam.

the way we did.

00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,052
You mean to tell me
that the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan

934
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,137
is to have the Afghans keep walking into machine gun fire

935
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,589
- till the Russians run out of bullets?
- That's Harold Holt's strategy.

936
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,475
- It's not U.S. strategy.
- What is U.S. strategy?

937
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,144
Well, strictly speaking, we don't have one.
But we're working hard on that.

that I'm in no mood

to Jim Baker. Which do you want?

Charlie. He trained with the SEALs.

1071
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,910
- No one's trying to fuck with you!
- MAN: Mike?

1072
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,913
- Yeah, what was your move?
- Knight to queen's bishop 5.

1073
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,581
All right, queen to king's rook 3.

1074
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,667
Guy on the right, you don't want to trade queens with me.

1075
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:15,835
Shit.

1076
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,671
All right, I apologize.

1077
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,757
- Okay.
- Everybody friends?

1078
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:24,218
As a former naval officer myself, Mike,
I should've known better.

1079
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,220
As a former naval officer,
I'd have been surprised if you had.

1080
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,388
- Now, what the fuck?
- Hey.

1081
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,349
- He said he was sorry.
- Hey.

1082
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,892
What can I do for you, sir?

1083
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,811
All right, he wants to make
a recommendation to his Subcommittee.

1084
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,898
Now, the Swiss made Oerlikon S.T.A.
antiaircraft cannon, that's what you'd use

1085
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,442
to shoot down the MI-24 Hind gunship
in the mountains, right?

1086
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,660
Well, the Oerlikon's a good start,

1087
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,904
but the Russians will just start flying
higher altitude missions.

1088
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,072
So what else do they need?

1089
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,908
Same thing you give us.
AK-47s, AK-74s, AKMS.

1090
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,077
The Soviets didn't come into Afghanistan
on a Eurail Pass.

1091
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,620
They came in T-55 tanks.

1092
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,414
The fighters need
RPG-7 anti-tank grenade launchers,

1093
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:57,919
Katyusha 107mm rockets, wire mines,
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

1094
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,420
ammunition for all the above

1095
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,255
and frequency-hopping radios
and burst transmitters

1096
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,925
so these guys aren't so fucking easy to find.

1097
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,969
Well, I've written it all in a report you can read.

1098
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,346
You'd be the first one who did.

1099
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,808
Send a copy of it to me by secure courier right away.

1100
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,102
- I will. All right.
- All right.

1101
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,649
- There was a report?
- It's not that simple.

1102
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,735
- Why not?
- Well, for one thing it's covert.

1103
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,445
When an Afghan freedom fighter gets captured,

1104
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,947
it can't be with
an American-made weapon on him.

1105
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,907
That's how a cold war turns into an actual war,

1106
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,909
and that's something you want to keep a good eye on.

1107
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,953
So anything we give them has to look like

1108
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,956
it could have plausibly been captured from the Soviets.

1109
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,740
- Yeah, that's right.
- You know who's good at that?

1110
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,127
- Israel and Egypt.
- That's right.

1111
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,130
You know what Vickers just described back there

1112
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:44,632
could cost as much as $40 million.

1113
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,552
- I can get the appropriation.
- But how?

1114
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,596
I want to know how are you gonna get
the approval of Congress

1115
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,348
when they're saying no to the Contras for nothing,

1116
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,101
for $5 million, a request made by the President?

1117
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,228
When a black approp makes it through this Subcommittee,

1118
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,522
the full body has to vote on it blind.

1119
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,774
They know the dollar amount,
but they don't know what it's for.

1120
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,862
So, theoretically, your $10 million can become 40 million

1121
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,989
without anyone ever noticing but the Russian Army.

1122
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,907
Because Congress wouldn't know what it was voting on.

1123
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,034
That's the beauty of it!

1124
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,885
All you need are the nine other Subcommittee members.

1125
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,495
All I really need is the Committee Chairman.

1126
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,330
- Doc Long.
- Doc Long.

1127
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,625
And with Doc's backing, you'll get the votes
of the other Committee members.

1128
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,835
- Yep.
- I don't believe you.

1129
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,045
I don't care.

1130
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,715
And until the phone rang this morning,
Charlie, I didn't know I'd never heard of you.

1131
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,425
Well, ask around.

1132
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,677
- I did.
- And what'd you find out?

1133
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:33,181
That your greatest legislative achievement
in six terms was getting reelected five times.

1134
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,390
Anything else?

1135
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:36,768
That you hold more IOUs than any member of the House.

1136
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,894
(LAUGHING)

1137
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,520
How about that?

1138
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:43,316
I represent the only district in America
that doesn't want anything.

1139
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,319
They want their guns, they want low taxes, that's it.

1140
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,197
I can do favors. I get to vote yes a lot.

1141
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,577
Now, me and three other guys are killing Russians.

1142
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,912
I mean, is it possible

1143
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:59,791
that I've met the only elected official in town
who can help?

1144
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,003
Give me a week to set things up.

1145
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:07,799
Go pack a bag.
I have a friend, an arms dealer in Israel.

1146
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,218
He's who we need for this, God help us.

1147
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,512
- Should be interesting.
- Yeah.

1148
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,430
All right.

1149
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,225
CHARLIE: We need you, Zvi.

1150
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,519
You're gonna be our man inside the Israeli Parliament.

1151
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,648
- ZVI: I'm not in the Israeli Parliament.
- That's what's gonna make you so effective.

1152
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,067
No one has your pull with the 10th Knesset.

1153
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,236
No one has your relationship with the Speaker.

1154
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,530
And we are gonna... We're gonna need
your arm around Menachem,

1155
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,492
when he finds out that we're working
with Egypt and the Saudis.

1156
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,787
Tell him. Tell him why we need him.

1157
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,873
- GUS: I'm not saying anything.
- Why not?

1158
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,835
I don't know who the fuck these two other guys are.

1159
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,003
- Well, ain't they bodyguards?
- Not ours.

1160
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,171
Zvi?

1161
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:54,011
Now, just to sum this up in a nutshell.

1162
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,181
You want me to move Israel

1163
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:02,436
toward a partnership
with Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

1164
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,105
And Saudi Arabia.

1165
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,651
Well, just a couple of problems I can foresee
off the top of my head.

1166
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,861
Look.

1167
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,028
- Charlie...
- I know.

1168
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:15,283
...Pakistan and Afghanistan don't recognize
our right to exist.

1169
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:19,203
- Calm down.
- We just got done fighting a war with Egypt

1170
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:22,623
and every person who has ever tried
to kill me and my family,

1171
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,709
has been trained in Saudi Arabia.

1172
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,003
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

1173
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,505
I mean, some of them were trained by us.

1174
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,048
CHARLIE: Gus, come on.

1175
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:35,136
It's his sense of humor.
It's a bit of an acquired taste.

1176
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,263
Now, Zvi, look at me.

1177
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,641
This is the front of the Cold War.

1178
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,686
It's not in Berlin, it's not in Cuba,
it's not in Czechoslovakia.

1179
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,314
It's in a pile of rocks called Afghanistan.

1180
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,983
These are the only people
who are actually shooting at the Russians.

1181
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,861
Now, you and I know
we have to get Soviet-made weapons

1182
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,279
into the hands of the mujahideen.

1183
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,072
And you and I know where the largest stockpile

1184
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:58,034
of Soviet weapons outside the Soviet Union is.

1185
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,702
I can't tell you offhand how many

1186
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,038
and what kind of weapons we've confiscated.

1187
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:06,417
I can. These are Keyhole-11 satellite photos.

1188
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,296
They've been degraded so I can show them to you.

1189
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:14,800
All right, that's a five-wheeled chassis tank.
That's not the Mk. 1, that's the T-55.

1190
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,845
And it and four others are about 12 miles from here.

1191
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,181
What do you want tanks in mountains for?

1192
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,683
Oh, we don't. I just wanted you to know
I know you got them.

1193
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:26,145
- $35.5 million.
- Which you'll be able to appropriate.

1194
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,396
Yeah.

1195
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,398
Without the press asking questions about it.

1196
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,524
GUS: You know, there's good news there,

1197
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,402
because the press is going to be busy
asking about a weekend in Vegas

1198
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,863
and his pending arrest on charges
of narcotics possession.

1199
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,950
- Oh, Gus.
- Shit, Charlie.

1200
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,077
- It's nothing.
- Is this true?

1201
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,246
GUS: No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

1202
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,997
- Thank you.
- I was just explaining to him

1203
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,249
that as long as the press sees
sex and drugs behind the left hand,

1204
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,992
you can park a battle carrier behind the right hand

1205
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,294
and no one's gonna fucking notice.

1206
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,504
What the hell happened?

1207
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,422
It's not germane.
It's not germane to these people

1208
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,926
who are fighting and dying,
and being massacred in their homes.

1209
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,054
Now, for the love of Christ, will you help us help them

1210
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,682
shoot down these fucking helicopters?

1211
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,769
I love you, Charlie,

1212
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,605
but you are a grown man

1213
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:14,735
who still hasn't learned to look both ways
before he crosses the fucking street!

1214
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,702
Yes, I'm in.

1215
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:28,082
- But I don't like this guy.
- I know how you feel.

1216
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,628
- ZVI: What happens now?
- You come with us to Cairo.

1217
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,964
- This meeting's gonna be run professional?
- Oh, absolutely.

1218
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,091
We'll be talking to the Deputy Defense Minister

1219
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,469
while his boss gets a belly dance
from a friend of Charlie's.

1220
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,596
- What?
- A good friend of mine back in Texas

1221
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:43,806
is a well-known belly dancer.

1222
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:47,476
It's always been her dream to perform
in Egypt, so she's our way in.

1223
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,480
While she's dancing for the Defense Minister,
we'll be talking to the Deputy.

1224
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,899
- Oh, my God.
- No, she's supposed to be good.

1225
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:57,570
(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1226
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,772
- That's an extraordinary woman.
- Oh, yeah.

1227
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,695
That's not any belly dance I'm familiar with.

1228
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,074
That's why I wanted the Defense Minister to see her.

1229
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:46,869
- This is your girlfriend?
- Carol's a friend. She's an old friend.

1230
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,539
I understand her father didn't allow dancing
because of the religion?

1231
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,376
Yeah, that's correct.

1232
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,921
- And what religion is that?
- You know, she's a Baptist.

1233
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:03,219
As I was saying, the Russians will learn,
I'm quite afraid the hard way,

1234
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,721
to fear God's vengeance upon those

1235
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:09,558
who oppress his humble servants
who submit to him in Islam.

1236
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,645
Their skulls will hang from the treetops.

1237
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,315
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

1238
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:22,405
What has Gus here concerned is
a SA surface-to-air missiles you all have.

1239
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,240
For some reason, he thinks they were stored poorly.

1240
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,742
No, no, no, the SA-7s were stored properly.

1241
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:30,579
Excuse me.
What about the oppression of my people?

1242
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,248
- Oh, Zvi.
- I beg your pardon?

1243
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,833
Fellows, we have to do this now.

1244
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:38,421
I am about to arrange for $35 million worth of guns

1245
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,089
to be put into the hands of Muslims!

1246
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,509
- I meant no disrespect.
- Oh, really?

1247
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,095
CHARLIE: Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

1248
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,181
You have Soviet-licensed factories
that can put out Kalashnikovs

1249
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,183
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

1250
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,353
- That's correct.
- What about city warfare devices?

1251
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,439
- What kind?
- Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

1252
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,773
plastic, tripwire mines?

1253
01:02:57,858 --> 01:03:00,025
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

1254
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,113
CHARLIE: We can't improve the price now,

1255
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,658
but when we come back for more, we'll make it up to you.

1256
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,993
I agree.

1257
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,036
All right.

1258
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:25,050
Hey, you did good back there ignoring the religious shit.

1259
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,887
'Cause these people are totally fucking unspooled,

1260
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,890
and I'm not just talking about the Muslims.

1261
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,851
- Zvi's all right.
- Oh, I know he is.

1262
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,311
He is Mossad, by the way.

1263
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:38,564
What I'm talking about is your friend in Houston.

1264
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,902
Now, she's got to stop throwing fundraisers
and she's got to stop doing press.

1265
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,488
Joanne is raising awareness.

1266
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:46,989
(CHUCKLES)

1267
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:52,745
She's using a non-secular vocabulary

1268
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,581
and framing this as a religious war.

1269
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,001
And America doesn't fight religious wars.

1270
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,169
(SIGHING)

1271
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,671
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's why I like living there.

1272
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,549
FLIGHT CAPTAIN: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain.

1273
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,426
We will begin our initial descent

1274
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,846
- into Washington Dulles Airport.
- I got to go down to Houston, so...

1275
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,015
...I would like to thank you and hope...

1276
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,935
- Well, talk to her.
- Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1277
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,941
You want me to go into business with the Israelis?

1278
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,276
Just for this one purpose, yes,
Mr. President.

1279
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:28,864
The Israelis have the largest stockpile
of Soviet-made weapons in friendly hands.

1280
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,407
I know that.

1281
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,537
I need to trust that this arrangement will remain secret.

1282
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:38,874
Pakistan and Israel would have to appear
to be enemies in the public eye.

1283
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:41,460
Yeah, I don't think that's a tough sell.

1284
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,212
You have authority to do this?

1285
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,382
None whatsoever. In fact, I'm pretty close
to violating the Logan Act.

1286
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,384
Well, I don't know what that is.

1287
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,802
- But, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

1288
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,805
If I see one fucking Star of David on a crate...

1289
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,640
You won't. I promise.

1290
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,643
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

1291
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,479
You want me to take a look at those remarks?

1292
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,565
- Why?
- Just... Well, your introduction,

1293
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:06,986
- want me to look it over?
- It's an introduction, Charlie. I'll be fine.

1294
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:18,497
Today we honor President Zia ul-Haq
of Pakistan.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1296
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:35,848
Before we go any further,
I would like you all to know this,

1297
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,642
President Zia did not kill Bhutto.

1298
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,478
In the time that he's been President,

1299
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,481
the fortunes of Pakistan have changed radically.

1300
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:45,816
I've asked you all here today...

1301

(CROWD CHATTERING)

(CUTLERY CLINKING)

1303
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:58,454
- You disappeared.
- Well, they weren't selling alcohol in there.

1304
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,998
It's a traditional Pakistani gathering.

1305
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,875
You think they might be a lot happier over there

1306
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:06,295
if they could just get women and booze
in the same room at the same time?

1307
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,172
I think they'd be a whole lot happier over there

1308
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,715
if the Communists got out.

1309
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,384
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

1310
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:16,305
That's not something you usually hear
in introductory remarks.

1311
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,808
He didn't, Charlie.
Bhutto had a trial and was found guilty.

1312
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,560
Shocking verdict.

1313
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,022
What did you need to talk to me about?

1314
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:29,568
Joanne, darling, dial down the religion.

1315
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,196
- What?
- It could alienate people

1316
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,989
whose support we need.

1317
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,784
It's luncheons like this
that are raising the money we need.

1318
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,703
This thing is not gonna get done
by ballrooms full of people

1319
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:40,996
in the Houstonian Hotel.

1320
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:44,458
It's gonna get done by the CIA,
Israel, Egypt and Pakistan,

1321
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,168
and it's gonna get done quietly.

1322
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,586
Now, you start making people think

1323
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,130
we're trying to convert everybody to Christianity.

1324
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,384
I was saved by Jesus Christ, Charlie,
and I am not ashamed of it.

1325
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,679
My fervor is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion,

1326
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:57,846
which we have, they want,

1327
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,182
and the Communists are slaughtering them for.

1328
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:03,560
And I get it. Just tamp down the fervor.

1329
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:07,439
Well, I can't modulate God's will, sweetie.

1330
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,108
You can try.

1331
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,570
Now, I got to get back to D.C.
They've set up a briefing for me at Langley.

1332
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,073
- On what?
- On getting the guns.

1333
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,452
Afghanistan's barely a country.

1334
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,788
There's no phones or roads outside the cities.

1335
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,289
It's likely that a villager would live his life

1336
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,917
without having contact with another village
just three miles down the road

1337
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,044
unless he was going to war against them.

1338
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,755
Now, my thinking is instead of 400,000 sloppy guys,

1339
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,551
we concentrate on several elite forces
totaling about 150,000.

1340
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,094
Give these guys real training,

1341
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,097
20 different courses
covering irregular warfare disciplines.

1342
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,724
GUS: And do you have anybody in mind?

1343
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,893
The most successful rebels today
are in the Panjshir Valley.

1344
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,479
They're called the United Front
of the Council of the North.

1345
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,565
We've earmarked them for 10 million in weapons

1346
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,234
and 10 to 15 agency advisors for training.

1347
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,404
- CHARLIE: Who's their leader?
- Ahmed Shah Massoud.

1348
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,949
He's Tajik, so he's not well liked by the Pashtun.

1349
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,161
CHARLIE: So the... What, the Tajiks
have a problem with the Pashtuns?

1350
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,413
Well, they say when a Tajik wants
to make love to a woman,

1351
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,332
his first choice is always a Pashtun man.

1352
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:11,211
It's funnier in the original Pashto.

1353
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,215
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

1354
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,843
All right, don't fuck us up now.

1355
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,803
Awesome pep talk.

1356
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:24,141
Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,

1357
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,977
these are all totalitarian dictatorships.

1358
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:31,482
And they'd like to blow the only democracy
in the region right into the Mediterranean.

1359
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:34,651
Now, you heard me say that Israel's gonna be on board.

1360
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,404
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's out of his mind.

1361
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:41,742
These people are draconian thugs,
and in an evil and twisted derby

1362
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,161
between the Communists and the Fundamentalists,

1363
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,912
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

1364
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,290
No, you're wrong about that, Doc,
and you know you don't mean it.

1365
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:52,169
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets raped,
but there's a witness.

1366

willing to shoulder the risk

Now, the Saudis are matching any funding from Congress?

1374
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,817

- So when you say 40 million to me,

1375
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:16,201
you're really talking about 80 million.

You want to put $80 million in the hands of these people?

1378
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,698
No, see, Doc, now, if you took a trip with me
to the border,

1379
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,450
you'd stop calling them "these people."

And everybody in the village says,
"How wonderful! The boy got a horse."

And the Zen master says, "We'll see."
