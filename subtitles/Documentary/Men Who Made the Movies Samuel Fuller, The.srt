1
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,737
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,241
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:23,111
And I would expect you, of all people,
would understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,276
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,981
When are you going to stop lecturing me?
When you start listening.

6
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,491
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,255
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,196
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,262
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,929
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,975
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,443
Illness?
John.

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,775
You think your daughter
is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,715
Perhaps it would be best if
we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,219
Of course.

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,882
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,927
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:32,048
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,746
Did you think you were the only
one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,154
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,385
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,004
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,207
I like this one.

24
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,853
You have more power than
you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,720
The question is,
will you control that power?

26
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,655
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,449
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,082
What's going on? Nothing.
I'll be right out.

29
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,752
Come on. You've been in
there for over an hour.

30
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,994
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,395
One second!

32
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,634
Open this door.

33
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,467
Warren.

34
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,343
Let me in there right now.
Open the door.

35
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,394
Oh, God.

36
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,191
Not you. Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,855
Not you. Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,888
The whole world's going to hell and
you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,161
Bobby!

40
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,076
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:30,286
We're getting killed out here. Yeah,
I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,554
Logan. Oh, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,062
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,894
Logan.

45
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,468
It's getting closer. Come on.
Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,133
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,006
How's your throwing arm?
Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,173
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,582
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,099
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,477
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,680
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,315
What was that?
Danger room session.

54
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,253
You know what I mean.
Lighten up.

55
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,486
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,689
I taught 'em something.
It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,598
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,796
This isn't a game, Logan.
Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,240
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,425
Scott! Jean.

61
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,929
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,125
Scott.

63
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,426
Scott.

64
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,602
Are you OK? I'm fine.

65
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,277
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,507
I can't touch my boyfriend without killing him.
Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,016
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:44,748
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,720
They were looking for you. You didn't show.
What do you care?

70
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,025
For starters, I had to cover your ass.
I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,158
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,864
I was just passing through.
So pass through, Logan.

73
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,997
Hey, look.

74
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,245
I know how you feel.
When Jean died... Don't.

75
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,179
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,150
Not everybody heals
as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,514
Mr. Secretary. Yes.

78
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,077
The meeting's begun, sir. Thank you.

79
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,225
Mr. President.

80
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,421
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,925
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,664
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:11,835
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,606
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,205
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,377
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,547
Not any more, she can't. We got her.
You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,287
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,623
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
Raven?

91
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:39,029
Raven, I asked you a question.
I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,265
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,867
Or has he convinced you you
don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,005
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,010
OK, then. Mystique where is he?

96
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,815
In here with us.

97
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,959
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,587
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,261
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,602
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,616
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,284
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,384
But having her does give
us some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,397
On principle, I can't
negotiate with these people.

105
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,902
I thought that's why you
appointed me, sir. Yes, it is.

106
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,598
But that's not why you
called me here. No. This is.

107
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,472
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,541
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,951
Is it viable? We believe it is.

110
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,661
You realize the impact this'll
have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:15,700
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,206
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,175
The use or misuse of
that power is everything.

114
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,945
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,815
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,583
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,522
For psychics, this presents
a particular problem.

118
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,120
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,892
That turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,902
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,370
Without any superhuman
authority behind it.

122
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,103
Einstein wasn't a
mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:06,248
This case study was sent to me by a
colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,254
The man you see here was born with
no higher-Level brain functions.

125
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,122
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,027
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,259
Say a father of four
with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,869
Into the body of this man?

129
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,840
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,380
Professor?

131
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,525
We'll continue this
tomorrow. Class dismissed.

132
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,231
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,900
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,756
I don't have to be psychic to see
that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,823
I don't understand.
Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,954
We've a mutant in the cabinet, a
president who understands us why hide?

137
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,934
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,130
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,334
Storm, I haven't thought of
you as my student for years.

140
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,937
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,321
But Scott's... Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,015
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,284
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,420
But you, of all people, know
how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,091
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,977
Hank?

147
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,103
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,709
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,653
You too. Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

150
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,420
Henry, you are always welcome
here. You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,722
I have news. Is it Eric?

152
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,923
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,629
Mystique was recently
apprehended. Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,205
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,071
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,871
Henry, this is Logan. He's... Wolverine.

157
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,346
I hear you're quite an
animal. Look who's talking.

158
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,473
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,418
Magneto's not the problem. At
least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,013
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,025
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,222
Suppress? Permanently.

163
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,130
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,273
That's ridiculous. You
can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,605
Scientifically speaking...
When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,872
Storm.

167
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,448
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,818
These so-Called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,017
Their affliction is
nothing more than a disease,

170
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,163
A corruption of healthy
cellular activity.

171
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,664
But I stand here today to
tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,998
This site, once the
world's most famous prison,

173
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,063
Will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,301
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,647
I proudly present the
answer to mutation.

176
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,182
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:07,452
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,962
Is it cowardice to save
oneself from persecution?

179
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,122
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:19,136
You don't shed on the furniture. The
government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,672
The government had nothing to do
with it. I've heard that before.

182
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:27,609
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

183
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,911
Did he just call me boy? Is
it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,317
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,984
No. Professor.

186
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,151
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:48,322
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,925
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:56,838
How should we, as mutants,
respond? Here's what I think.

190
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:02,073
This is about getting organized. Bringing
our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:07,675
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:11,916
They don't understand. They don't
know what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:17,963
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:23,930
People, you must listen. They
won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,630
They wanna exterminate
us. This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,230
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,105
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,137
They just do it.

199
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:43,414
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:49,255
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,229
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,527
The extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:55,634 --> 00:19:00,230
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,307
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,047
The only question is, will you
join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,411
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,645
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,281
Or us?

209
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,367
You talk pretty tough
for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,665
Back off.

211
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:38,004
If you're so proud of being
a mutant, where's your mark?

212
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,641
I have been marked once,
my dear. Let me assure you.

213
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,682
No needle shall ever
touch my skin again.

214
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,615
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,779
Do you?

216
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,552
And what can you do?

217
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,893
So you have talents?

218
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,091
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,262
And I know there's 87 mutants in
here, none above a class three.

220
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,396
Other than you two.

221
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:14,379
You can sense other
mutants and their powers?

222
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,279
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:41,369
Let me out of here. I
demand that you release me.

224
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,101
Do you know who I am? I'm the
president of the United States.

225
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,007
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,170
Shut up.

227
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:57,078
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,849
Please.

229
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,757
Keep it up. I'll spray
you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,729
When I get out of here, I'm
going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,893
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,367
Secretary McCoy, welcome
to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,799
Thank you, Dr. Rao. Not
an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:49,670
It's the safest location we could find.
That's why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,175
He is a mutant. You
understand our concern.

236
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,840
We are in compliance with your policy.
How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,851
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,387
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,514
You'll see.

240
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,192
Jimmy.

241
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,858
There's someone I
would like you to meet.

242
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,992
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,002
Hi. My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,213
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,244
It's OK.

246
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,054
You have an amazing
gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,138
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,370
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,281
Scott.

250
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,895
Scott.

251
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,358
Scott.

252
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,560
Can you hear me? I'm
still here. Scott. Stop.

253
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,171
I'm here. Scott. Scott. Stop it.

254
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,969
Scott. Scott. Stop it.

255
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,508
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,444
Stop!

257
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,296
Jean?

258
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,438
Scott.

259
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,944
How?

260
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,976
I don't know.

261
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,760
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,998
Take these off. No.

263
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,011
No.

264
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,773
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,653
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,361
What happened? No clue.

267
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:43,161
Professor, are you
OK? Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,964
You don't want to be here. Do you?

269
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,389
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,824
I can take care of that.

271
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,203
What the...

272
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,608
Logan!

273
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,352
She's alive.

274
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,954
Jean.

275
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:59,701
The sheer mass of water that collapsed on
top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,033
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,908
Is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,737
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:16,548
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:21,387
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,987
When she was a girl, I created
a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,657
To isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:34,797
Jean developed a dual personality. What?

284
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:40,867
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:47,043
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:53,455
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,852
She knew all this? It's
unclear how much she knew.

288
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:04,196
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,738
Or the Phoenix furiously
struggling to be free.

290
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,774
She looks peaceful to me.
I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:16,404
I'm trying to restore the psychic
blocks and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,846
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,477
You have to understand... You're
talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,612
She has to be controlled. Controlled?

295
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,193
Sometimes, when you cage the
beast, the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,491
You have no idea. You have no
idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
No, Professor. I had no idea
what you were capable of.

298
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,434
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:44,406
It sounds to me like
Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,878
I don't have to explain
myself, least of all to you.

301
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,581
History will be made here
today. For the first time,

302
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,024
The so-Called mutant cure will
be available to the public.

303
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,460
Reaction has run the gamut with
mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:12,799
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,143
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:33,485
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,560
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,259
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,558
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,133
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,067
Hello, Warren. How are you, son?

312
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,674
Did you sleep well? Yeah.

313
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,573
You know, I'm proud
of you for doing this.

314
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,203
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,810
You ready?

316
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,048
The transformation can
be a little jarring.

317
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,784
Dad, can we talk about this for a
second? We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,860
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:50,829
Everything's going to be
fine. Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,869
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,030
I can't do this. Yes, you can.

322
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,267
I can't do this. Just relax,
son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,176
I promise you it will be
fine. Warren, relax. Dad.

324
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,347
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,018
It's what we all want. No.

326
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,527
It's what you want.

327
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,094
Warren, no!

328
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,800
Told you so.

329
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,920
About time.

330
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,553
I've been busy. Did you find
what you were looking for?

331
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:04,431
The source of the cure is a
mutant. A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,299
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,430
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,838
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,039
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,084
At the same time. I could
use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,856
I'm in. Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:38,532
Careful with this one. "Cain
Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,595
Check this out. "Prisoner
must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,143
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,838
How fascinating.

342
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,217
What do they call you? Juggernaut.

343
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,447
I can't imagine why. Are you
going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,464
Nice helmet. Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:17,706
I think he'll make a
fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,810
No!

347
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,203
You saved me.

348
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,805
Eric.

349
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,876
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,610
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,284
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:19,301
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,031
Policy is being made
without me, Mr. President.

354
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,267
The decision to turn the cure
into a weapon was made without me.

355
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,140
What happened on that convoy was
inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:34,446
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,851
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,117
I have.

359
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,788
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,923
As do I.

361
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,899
You and I know that it's
only going to get worse.

362
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,238
All the more reason why I
need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,768
Jean.

364
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:37,011
Hi, Logan. Welcome back.

365
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:45,920
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,716
Are you OK?

367
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,519
Yeah.

368
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,790
More than OK.

369
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,642
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,247
You're reading my
thoughts? I don't have to.

371
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,824
It's OK.

372
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,233
It's OK.

373
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,542
Wait. No.

374
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,649
Jean.

375
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,817
This isn't you. Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,896
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:39,168
The professor said
you might be different.

378
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,438
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,307
What? You think he's
not in your head too?

380
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,973
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,412
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,851
Jean?

383
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:08,228
Where am I? You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,861
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,331
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,946
Oh, God.

387
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,188
Look at me.

388
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,102
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,036
Look at me. Look at me. No.

390
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,005
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,541
Kill me.

392
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,410
What? Kill me before
I kill someone else.

393
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,109
Don't say that. Please.

394
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,812
Stop it. Kill me.

395
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,220
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,089
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,621
Hey. The professor can
help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,700
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,675
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,344
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,011
So what do we do? What do we do?

402
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:44,083
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,253
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,627
I picked something up.

405
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,899
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,508
It's a mutant.

407
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,705
Class five. More powerful
than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,179
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,083
Where is she?

410
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,189
Logan.

411
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,385
Jean. Jean. What happened?

412
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,553
What have you done?

413
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,968
I think she killed Scott. What?

414
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,069
That's not possible. I warned you.

415
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:43,848
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,987
It may be too late.

417
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,558
Wait for me here. What?

418
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,688
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,627
You were right, Charles.

420
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,136
This one is special. What
the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,231
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,572
I don't want trouble here. Nor do I.

423
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,703
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,549
I came to bring Jean
home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:19,781
Just like old times, eh? She
needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:23,689
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,819
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,172
I knew you'd come. Of course.
I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,114
I have no home. Yes, you do.
You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,744
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,789
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,723
So you want to control me? He does.

433
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,920
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,225
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,232
Absolutely nothing. Eric, stop.

436
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,362
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,998
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,008
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,812
I'm going in. The professor
said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:05,017
Look at me, Jean. I can
help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,154
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:13,701
Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,171
But I can help you. I think
you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:21,472
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,978
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,714
That's it.

447
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,188
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,489
No, Jean.

449
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,619
Jean!

450
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,889
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,663
Charles.

452
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,263
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,937
No.

454
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,810
God!

455
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,881
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,724
A world full of fear,
hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,896
But in every age, there are
those who fight against it.

458
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,731
Charles Xavier was
born to a world divided.

459
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,741
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,644
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:28,410
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:33,854
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,527
When we were afraid,
he gave us strength.

464
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,531
And when we were alone,
he gave us a family.

465
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:49,731
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,332
Wherever we may go, we
must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:57,345
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,402
Kitty.

469
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,499
Bobby.

470
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,471
You OK? Yeah.

471
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:39,646
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,922
He was the one that
convinced me to come here.

473
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,052
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:50,360
We're all feeling the same way,
you know. No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,662
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,701
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,673
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,512
Kitty, get up. Come with me.
Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,107
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,846
I mean, you can walk
through walls, you know.

481
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,718
Come on.

482
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:27,860
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:10,163
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,583
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:28,692 --> 00:54:30,751
No.

486
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:34,822
Where are you going?

487
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,064
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:41,172 --> 00:54:43,572
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:48,337
I want to be able to
touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:51,937
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:53,983
A kiss.

492
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:57,610
I hope you're not
doing this for some boy.

493
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:01,824
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:05,355
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:09,560
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,726
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:15,032
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:17,308 --> 00:55:20,243
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:20,344 --> 00:55:21,902
Marie.

500
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:25,308
Marie.

501
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:09,591
Remember when we first met? Do you
know what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:15,723
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:17,234 --> 00:56:23,662
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:28,078 --> 00:56:31,980
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:32,082 --> 00:56:35,574
But you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:37,950
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,692
Jean.

508
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:52,826
Enough.

509
00:56:54,772 --> 00:56:56,330
Enough.

510
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:00,906
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:03,946
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:08,142
What do you want? I want
you to be what you are.

513
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:11,214
As nature intended.

514
00:57:13,023 --> 00:57:19,155
That cure is meant for all of us. If
we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:20,464 --> 00:57:22,728
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:34,104
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:37,977
Her power is completely
unstable. Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:41,551
And you trust her? She's one
of them. So were you once.

519
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:47,521
I stuck with you. Would have killed the
professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:47,658 --> 00:57:51,719
Charles Xavier did more for
mutants than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:57,631
My single greatest regret is that
he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,485
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:16,587 --> 00:58:20,148
Xavier started this school. Perhaps
it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:26,160
We'll tell the students they're going
home. Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:32,099
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:37,107 --> 00:58:39,769
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:44,211
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:46,373
It was, son.

529
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:54,251
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,294
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:14,401
Rogue.

532
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,404
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:30,890
Hey, Pete. Have you seen
Rogue? Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:46,471
Logan.

535
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,134
Logan.

536
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:50,042
Logan. Jean?

537
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:52,944
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,981
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,417
Logan. Stop.

540
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:59,853
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,407
Where are you going? Where do you think?

542
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:27,382
She's gone, Logan. She's not
coming back. You don't know that.

543
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:29,918
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,353
It wasn't Jean. The Jean
I know is still in there.

545
01:00:35,225 --> 01:00:37,659
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:41,492
Why can't you just let her
go? Because... because...

547
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:43,657
Because you love her.

548
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:56,240
She made her choice. Now
it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,543
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:15,832
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:19,499
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:19,736 --> 01:01:22,432
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:26,503
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:27,678 --> 01:01:33,241
Getting the cure so you can go
back home to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,046
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:40,281
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:45,685
I figured she'd want
the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:51,891
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:53,637 --> 01:01:55,662
Make a move.

560
01:02:01,044 --> 01:02:04,741
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:20,258
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:20,364 --> 01:02:24,266
So long as the cure
exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:24,368 --> 01:02:30,773
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:34,776
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:34,878 --> 01:02:37,676
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:37,781 --> 01:02:41,740
Enough mutant blood has
been spilled already.

567
01:02:43,153 --> 01:02:47,715
We're trying to track them,
sir. We're working hard.

568
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:52,718
We cannot let him do this.
You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:56,959
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:57,067 --> 01:03:00,730
I want troops armed with cure
weapons deployed immediately.

571
01:03:00,837 --> 01:03:07,037
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:07,144 --> 01:03:10,375
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,108
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:13,216 --> 01:03:16,879
Turn in your old weapon.
Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:16,987 --> 01:03:20,514
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:24,753
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:24,928 --> 01:03:26,953
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:41,474
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:46,340
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:48,885 --> 01:03:52,787
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:10,894 --> 01:06:16,298
They wish to cure us. But I
say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:24,534
The cure for that infirm, imperfect
condition called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:28,702
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:31,772
We have ours.

585
01:06:33,817 --> 01:06:40,245
We will strike with a vengeance and a
fury that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:41,491 --> 01:06:47,953
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:48,665 --> 01:06:51,327
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:53,629
Take control of the cure,

589
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:56,137
And destroy its source.

590
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:59,936
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,922
Jean.

592
01:07:29,506 --> 01:07:32,669
I know the smell of your
domatium from a mile away.

593
01:07:32,776 --> 01:07:35,677
I didn't come here to
fight you. Smart boy.

594
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:41,340
I came for Jean. You think I'm
keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:53,960
She's here because she wants to be.
You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:54,097 --> 01:07:57,692
I know full well. I saw
what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:01,303
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:01,438 --> 01:08:05,033
I'm not leaving here
without her. Yes, you are.

599
01:08:18,488 --> 01:08:20,513
OK.

600
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:25,258
Two minutes till
rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:26,396 --> 01:08:31,356
We have a satellite feed of
Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:33,336 --> 01:08:37,966
How did we find it? She
gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:39,075 --> 01:08:42,408
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,146
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:23,742
Set for 360-Degree incursion.

606
01:09:36,132 --> 01:09:39,863
This is Team Leader to Bravo
One. We are green to go.

607
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,535
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:46,643 --> 01:09:47,837
OK.

609
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:52,380
Freeze, mutants! Get your hands
in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:06,863 --> 01:10:09,559
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:12,831
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:12,969 --> 01:10:15,938
If he's not there, then
where the hell is he?

613
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:28,311
Worthington Labs. It
ends where it began.

614
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:31,784
Are you sure the boy
is still inside? 100%.

615
01:10:31,888 --> 01:10:35,619
So how are we supposed to get
there? 'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:36,259 --> 01:10:38,318
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:46,562
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:49,433
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:51,564
I need help.

620
01:10:51,674 --> 01:10:54,472
You found her. Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:57,444
Where are they? On the move.
I know where they're going.

622
01:10:57,547 --> 01:11:02,849
You're saying you saw Magneto? We
gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:02,952 --> 01:11:06,410
There are troops stationed on that
island. Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:08,582
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:12,762 --> 01:11:16,892
Hard to believe this once fit me. If
Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,969
Can you estimate how many
he has? An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:20,103 --> 01:11:25,769
His powers have limits, hers do
not. There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,810
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:29,946 --> 01:11:32,471
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:34,948
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:35,051 --> 01:11:37,178
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:42,280
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:45,154
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:45,295 --> 01:11:47,320
Are you?

635
01:11:48,498 --> 01:11:50,523
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:51,835 --> 01:11:54,235
X-Men.

637
01:11:54,337 --> 01:11:56,362
All of us.

638
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:05,278
We're in.

639
01:12:05,415 --> 01:12:07,474
Let's go.

640
01:12:11,521 --> 01:12:14,456
They're ready. Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:20,757
But are you ready to do what you
need to do when the time comes?

642
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:50,318
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,679
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,728
We're trapped.

645
01:16:03,086 --> 01:16:06,852
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:21,604 --> 01:16:24,232
My God.

647
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:52,266
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:11,676
The boy's in the southeast
corner of the building.

649
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:15,120
Well, then. Let's take it down!

650
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:34,808
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:37,446 --> 01:17:40,006
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,792
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:57,934 --> 01:18:00,767
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:10,313 --> 01:18:13,009
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:19,589 --> 01:18:21,420
Fire!

656
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:32,964
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:57,020
Oh, my stars and garters.
Go into stealth mode.

658
01:18:59,395 --> 01:19:03,422
What about jets? Tanks? Against
Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:07,332
Where are our ground
troops? 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:10,228
Then God help us.

661
01:19:20,082 --> 01:19:22,107
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:59,180
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:04,927 --> 01:20:07,122
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:07,229 --> 01:20:10,494
Everybody get together!
And hold this line!

665
01:20:26,248 --> 01:20:29,012
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:37,785
Finish them!

667
01:21:13,062 --> 01:21:14,723
Not yet.

668
01:21:29,478 --> 01:21:32,208
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:32,314 --> 01:21:34,373
With pleasure.

670
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:42,851
Hold it!

671
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,785
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:46,896 --> 01:21:49,126
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:49,265 --> 01:21:51,324
Kitty!

674
01:22:01,644 --> 01:22:03,703
Come on.

675
01:22:06,882 --> 01:22:08,782
Grow those back.

676
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:21,487
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:22,498 --> 01:22:25,092
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:59,025
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:02,571 --> 01:23:05,199
You're the guy that
invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:05,307 --> 01:23:07,332
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:09,905
Girls.

682
01:23:10,045 --> 01:23:12,343
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:12,448 --> 01:23:15,679
No. Don't hurt him. Let go
of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:18,014
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,384
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:44,368
I thought you were a diplomat. As
Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:44,513 --> 01:23:47,073
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:47,216 --> 01:23:50,310
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:50,419 --> 01:23:51,647
No.

690
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:02,593
No, don't worry. I'm here to help
you. I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:06,296
This way.

692
01:24:06,402 --> 01:24:11,362
Oh, my God. What's going on?
Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:15,077 --> 01:24:17,409
Stay close, all right? OK.

694
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:23,079
I'm the wrong guy to
play hide-And-Seek with.

695
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,710
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:39,066
Don't. No.

697
01:24:39,935 --> 01:24:41,698
Don't.

698
01:24:41,804 --> 01:24:45,706
Please, don't do this. I only
wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:46,442 --> 01:24:48,740
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:20,935
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,689
Take cover.

702
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,025
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:52,900
Let's go, let's go. Move.

704
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:54,600
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:43,225 --> 01:26:46,160
We work as a team.

706
01:26:46,261 --> 01:26:49,253
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:58,939
Bobby, think you can
take out your old friend?

708
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:13,311
Go ahead.

709
01:27:14,556 --> 01:27:17,081
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:17,226 --> 01:27:19,251
Right.

711
01:28:07,843 --> 01:28:10,903
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:11,013 --> 01:28:13,982
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,124
You never should have left.

714
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,491
This is it.

715
01:28:30,632 --> 01:28:32,600
Hey.

716
01:28:32,734 --> 01:28:35,669
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:48,873
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:53,944
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:07,469 --> 01:29:09,664
I'm...

720
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:12,433
One of them?

721
01:29:22,517 --> 01:29:25,850
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,775
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,305
It's over.

724
01:29:56,518 --> 01:29:58,509
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,332
No!

726
01:30:30,452 --> 01:30:33,512
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:44,089
Bobby!

728
01:30:54,209 --> 01:30:56,268
What have I done?

729
01:31:07,055 --> 01:31:11,389
I'm the only one who can stop
her. Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:11,526 --> 01:31:13,994
Go.

731
01:31:17,566 --> 01:31:19,295
Jean!

732
01:32:04,513 --> 01:32:06,572
Jean!

733
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:09,115
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,292
You would die for them?

735
01:32:59,401 --> 01:33:01,460
No, not for them.

736
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:04,696
For you.

737
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:08,699
For you.

738
01:33:13,715 --> 01:33:15,774
Save me.

739
01:33:17,652 --> 01:33:19,313
I love you.

740
01:34:58,653 --> 01:35:01,281
You're back.

741
01:35:07,629 --> 01:35:10,120
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:10,265 --> 01:35:12,256
I had to.

743
01:35:13,134 --> 01:35:16,160
This isn't what I wanted.
I know.

744
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:19,707
It's what I want.

745
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,614
Hey.

746
01:35:34,556 --> 01:35:36,820
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,620
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:39,761 --> 01:35:42,889
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:43,064 --> 01:35:47,228
And the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:47,335 --> 01:35:50,168
Human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,331
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:57,774
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,371
Morning.

754
01:43:52,787 --> 01:43:55,517
Hello, Moira.

755
01:44:01,929 --> 01:44:03,590
Charles.
