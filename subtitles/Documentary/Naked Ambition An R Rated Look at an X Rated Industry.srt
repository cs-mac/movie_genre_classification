00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,640
Madam, please get in.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,790
Madam.

4
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,050
A fax came for you.

5
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,780
<i>Joo Da Hae, I'm getting
out in seven days.</i>

6
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,160
<i>Wait for me. Ha Ryu.</i>

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Thank you.

8
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,120
A fax came for you here, too.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,960
- I have one here.
- Me too.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,080
Is someone playing a prank?

11
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,480
Someone sent the same fax to all of us.

12
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,680
It's nothing.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
It seems that someone is
playing a practical joke.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,150
Just go back to your seat.

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,950
- Checkmate!
- What is this?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,150
She should have received the fax by now.

17
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,070
Taek Bae said he would
send it today as planned.

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,070
It should be there.

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,500
Make sure your stomach is always full.

20
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,630
Once you are hungry, you become soft.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,290
Mister, how much for the faxes?

22
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,620
Did any fax come for me?

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,750
No, there is one addressed
to Manager Joo.

24
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,630
It must have been sent here by mistake.

25
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,590
Manager Joo?
What is it?

26
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,630
It looks like someone's playing a joke.

27
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,100
Give it to me.

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,790
Find out more about this fax.

29
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,310
And also who Ha Ryu is.

30
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,730
Yum Sam Do, you are being released
next week, right?

31
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,900
Yes.

32
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,810
About your life after this

33
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,800
a lawyer will be assigned
to you pro bono.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,330
Would you be willing to try?

35
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,530
I'm okay.

36
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,970
I see.

37
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,210
It's not mandatory, but...

38
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,450
this lawyer is very beautiful.

39
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,880
Oh, is that right?

40
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,030
I must have come to the wrong room.

41
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,500
I came to see a female lawyer.

42
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,780
I'm sorry about being a male lawyer.
Please have a seat.

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,320
What?

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,020
I'll do my best.

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,380
- It's just that...
- Please have a seat.

46
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,600
- Is your name Yum Sam Do?
- Yes.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,510
By the way...

48
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,020
Is there someone who looks
exactly like you?

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,720
Someone who looks like me?

50
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,400
You look like someone I know.

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,290
He looks exactly like you.

52
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,620
Are you saying that he looks just like me?

53
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,810
Yes.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,530
- Do you know the man who looks like me?
- Yes.

55
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,910
He's in here! In this prison.

56
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,520
In here?

57
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,390
Ha Ryu!

58
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,280
Ha Ryu!

59
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,250
What is it?

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,350
- Thank you.
- Sure.

61
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,680
What is going on?

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,020
Ha Ryu, you have a brother.

63
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,510
- You have a brother.
- What nonsense!

64
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,840
You have a brother, twin brother!

65
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Man, why are you doing this?

66
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,000
Your picture in your pocketbook...

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,440
the picture from your first birthday.

68
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,700
Have a seat.

69
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,170
Are you my brother?

70
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,530
It would be odd if we weren't twins.

71
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,980
We look exactly alike.

72
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,670
That's what I thought.

73
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,750
The pictures were switched.

74
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,380
Because I don't have that spot on me.

75
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,350
That's right.
I have that spot on my arm.

76
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,940
This is me and this is you.

77
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,580
Now the picture has found the real owner.

78
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,910
It's finally found.

79
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,580
Who else is there?

80
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,300
Do we have a mother and father?

81
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,630
There is only our father.

82
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,020
- Do we have any other siblings?
- We are the only ones.

83
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm sorry to have met you like this.

84
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,030
I'm the one who is sorry.

86
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,030
What took you so long?

87
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,490
- You should have come sooner.
- We were looking for you.

88
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,120
We've been looking for you.

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,330
If I had a father...

90
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,430
if I had a brother...

91
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,970
I wouldn't have lived like this.

92
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,290
Do you have any idea
what I went through?

93
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,340
Have you been alone all these years?

95
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,840
I... had a daughter and everything.

96
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,060
I had a beautiful daughter...

97
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,040
Brother.

98
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,910
This is so unfair.

99
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,150
This is so very unfair.

100
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,250
- Happy?
- Yes.

101
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,150
We look exactly alike.

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,420
What did you say?
In prison?

103
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,940
Did you really meet your
brother in a prison?

104
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,340
Yes.

105
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,230
Whew... what do we do?

106
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Why is he in prison?

107
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,220
I didn't ask him the details.

108
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
What do we do?

109
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,650
If we tell your father that
your brother is in prison

110
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,940
he'll have a heart attack.

111
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,250
We should tell him that we haven't
found your brother yet.

112
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,090
I think so too.

113
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,690
I wonder what he did to end up in prison.

114
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,440
You had your father
growing up, but...

115
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,310
it must have been very hard
for your brother.

116
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,850
I feel sorry for him.

117
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,820
Tisk, as if you weren't a cry baby...

118
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,680
Stop crying.

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,330
This is a picture from my first birthday.

120
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,240
Mine and my brother's pictures
were switched.

121
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,250
Look at the spot here.

122
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,030
Wow, you didn't have this birthmark
on the picture you had.

123
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,730
Can I see your birthmark?

124
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,380
It's amazing.

125
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,810
You've had that mark since your birth.

126
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,010
When he gets out of prison,
let's be good to him.

127
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,340
Of course, I will.
He's my brother-in-law.

128
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,930
I'm his sister-in-law.

129
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,800
Wait, should I just talk down to him then?

130
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,970
What do you mean talk down, huh?

131
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,970
Should I not?

132
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,110
Talk casually or not?

133
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,290
Get your facts straight.

134
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,800
Address each other formally.

135
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,650
He will call you 'Sister-in-law' and
you'll call him 'Brother-in-law' politely.

136
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,130
But you are my honey.

137
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,950
Gosh, that's enough.

138
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,490
How did you manage to pass the first
bar exam, when you are this clueless?

139
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,750
Well, that would be my charm.

140
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,290
Ha Ryu.

141
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,290
I'm getting out first.

142
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,630
- We will see each other outside.
- You've made it.

143
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,240
Get some rest until I get out.

144
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
When I get out, things will get tough.

145
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,130
- There will be a plenty of things to do.
- Okay.

146
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,560
I understand.

147
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,240
I will go now.

148
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,300
Please be well.

149
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,180
Master!

150
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,510
Thank you.

151
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,560
Take care.

152
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Thank you.

153
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,740
I will see you when I get out.

154
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,550
Sam Do!

155
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Yum Sam Do, good to see you.

156
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,550
You've made it!

157
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,980
Sir, you've made it.

158
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,750
- Good to see you, sir.
- It's been a while, guys.

159
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,410
You guys all look good.

160
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,410
Introduce yourself.
You know who he is.

161
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,410
He's the infamous Master Yum.

162
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,490
He's the best strategist in Korea.

163
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,710
Sam Do, let's first go to a barbecue
restaurant and talk it over.

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,830
Are you planning something again?

165
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,840
Wait.

166
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,540
In plain language, I should
say 'commit a fraud'.

167
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,760
I told you I quit.

168
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Sam Do.

169
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,690
Without a strategist

170
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,310
even the best operators in Korea
can't do anything.

171
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,970
Draw up a scheme for us one last time.

172
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,970
Please.

173
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,230
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,870
I'm... done with it.

175
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,870
Keep up the good work.

176
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,230
Don't get caught, okay?

177
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,430
Sir.

178
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,350
I didn't like riding at first.

179
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,450
But it became a good exercise.

180
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,500
If you like riding

181
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,620
you will get close to my sister quickly.

182
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,700
It may seem like I'm kissing up to her.

183
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm not good at doing things
to please someone.

184
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,660
Please give me a break.

185
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,370
When you and my sister argue

186
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,810
I get nervous and frustrated.

187
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,610
Let's just pretend that we rode

188
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,320
and go back to Seoul. Please?

189
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,840
Come this way.
I have something to show you.

190
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,090
This is Lisa.

191
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,770
She's the one my sister cares
for like her own child.

192
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,280
Is that so?

193
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,250
I thought you were the one
she cared for the most.

194
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,250
Lisa is the best.

195
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,450
I'm about here?

196
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,590
Then I would be... this much.

197
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,600
Nonsense.

198
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,070
If Lisa coughs

199
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,100
my sister would cancel her business
trip from New York City

200
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,870
and be on the plane home.

201
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,640
Shocking, isn't it?

202
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm jealous.

203
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Here.

204
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Touch her to get close.

205
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,250
You are such a chicken.

206
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,000
It's okay, here.

207
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,180
Why are you doing that?

208
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,430
Madam.

209
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,900
- I got the report on Ha Ryu as you asked.
- Did you?

210
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,850
Ha Ryu is in prison for the remains found
at Baek Hak Town site three years ago.

211
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,110
What did you say?

212
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,450
Then 'be out in seven days' on
the fax means that?

213
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,710
Yes. He's scheduled to be
released in three days.

214
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,260
Alright. Good work.

215
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,090
<i>Joo Da Hae...</i>

216
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,260
<i>Again there is something she's hiding.</i>

217
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,640
Do Kyung!

218
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,020
I'm sorry I'm late.
Let's go now.

219
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm going to hurt you if you lied
about buying me a mink coat today.

220
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,670
What are you looking at?

221
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,040
Auntie, I'm sorry but let's
go shopping next time.

222
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,450
I need to go somewhere in a hurry.

223
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,760
Hey, you said you'd buy me a mink coat!

224
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,410
Do Kyung!

225
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,150
Why is she acting that way?

226
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,010
Ha Ryu... Joo Da Hae?

227
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,950
- Mommy!
- Wow.

228
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,960
- Do I look pretty?
- You look so pretty.

229
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
I wish I had something like this.

230
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,860
Who is this guy?

231
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,850
Did she find the child's father?

232
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,120
This is too soon.
It can't happen already.

233
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,090
So, how was it? It's easier and more
fun than expected, right?

234
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,770
Yes, it was refreshing.

235
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,200
Next time, let's come with my sister.

236
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,740
Okay.

237
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,910
Sir, there is someone who
wants to see you.

238
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,490
Okay.

239
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,490
Be right back.

240
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,280
Hi auntie.

241
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm at the riding club with Do Hoon.

242
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,870
I'm at Do Kyung's office right now.

243
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:13,510
I wanted to go shopping with you,
but I guess you are too busy too.

244
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,730
By the way, do you know
anyone named Ha Ryu?

245
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,110
Pardon?

246
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,680
On Do Kyung's desk,
there is a fax from him, and...

247
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,150
a report on Ha Ryu, so I just got curious.

248
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,670
I came here to go shopping with Do Kyung.

249
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,840
Was it Mi Ah Dong or something?

250
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,890
She grabbed the address
and left in a hurry.

251
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,880
- Mi Ah Dong?
- Yes, it was Mi Ah Dong.

252
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,460
Anyway...

253
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,680
have a good time and I
will see you next time.

254
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,800
When the riding club is three hours away

255
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,930
can she stop Do Kyung in time?

256
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,380
Let's see who this guy is.

257
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,150
Ha Ryu will be out soon.

258
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,560
How much his heart will ache again...

259
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello? Yes.

260
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,870
Lisa did what?

261
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,570
Okay, I'll be right there.

262
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,170
It's okay.

263
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,960
Da Hae.

264
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,360
What is it?

265
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,810
What happened?

266
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,170
How could Lisa get out when I wasn't here?

267
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,360
How could she get out?

268
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,650
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,930
Was that you?

270
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,930
You did that?

271
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,710
She looked stressed,
so I took her out for a walk.

272
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,720
She suddenly jumped and got loose.

273
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,030
I couldn't do anything.

274
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,290
Who the hell are you to take her out?

275
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,500
- Who the hell are you?
- Sis.

276
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,900
Calm down.

277
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,720
The staff is looking for her.

278
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,050
- Lisa will be back.
- Do Hoon, you!

279
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,450
Shut up.

280
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,670
You are here.

281
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,210
They've found Lisa.

282
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,520
Have they?
Where is she?

283
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,220
See, what did I tell you?

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,860
But it's just that...

285
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,450
there was an accident with
a truck on the road.

286
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,410
What accident?

287
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,160
What happened?

288
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm asking you what happened!

289
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,620
On the spot...

290
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,190
she was killed.

291
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,040
Sis, what are you doing?

292
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,840
You are the one who killed Lisa!

293
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,920
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

294
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,640
I don't need your sorry.

295
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,740
Should I say sorry after I kill you?

296
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740
Sis!

297
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,140
A truck with Lisa has arrived.

298
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,320
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

299
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,860
I'm okay.

300
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,720
What did you say?
You've found him?

301
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,680
- You just said you've found him?
- Yes, we have.

302
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,340
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- We've finally found him.

303
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,630
Ever since I let go of his hand

304
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,520
I haven't been able to sleep well at night.

305
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,020
Now I can die without regrets.

306
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,050
Father, this is so great.

307
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,240
Wait a minute, shouldn't we
throw a party or something?

308
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,130
Of course, I will prepare a huge party.

309
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,210
Alright then.
You should get ready for a big party.

310
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,280
In looking for my brother...

311
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,640
you've done most of the work.

312
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,940
Thanks.

313
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,300
Wow, I'm so happy.

314
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Aren't you?

315
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,580
Soo Jung.

316
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,790
Jae Woong.

317
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,900
Will you marry me?

318
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,040
Soo Jung, are you crying?

319
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,770
Don't cry.

320
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,870
Don't cry.

321
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,090
What is this?

322
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,670
Jae Woong.

323
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,860
In a court, in front of brutal criminals

324
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
you show nerves of steel.

325
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,410
Why are you trembling like that now?

326
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,950
That was cute.

327
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:20,990
I'm getting married to Cha Jae Woong!
Hooray!

328
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,180
Jae Woong, I love you.

329
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,830
I love you.

330
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,270
You scared me!

331
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,720
Why are you still up drinking?

332
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I didn't think you were back.

333
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,270
Did something happen?

334
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,490
Lisa...

335
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,200
is dead.

336
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,340
- What?
- Joo Da Hae...

337
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,140
killed Lisa.

338
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,080
Joo Da Hae...

339
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,390
Why would she kill Lisa?

340
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,000
She knew what would hurt me.

341
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,680
That's who she is.

342
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,530
Joo Da Hae...

343
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,000
I will never forgive her.

344
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,310
You are drunk now.
Stop drinking.

345
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,320
Joo Da Hae...

346
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,980
She killed a horse for that?

347
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,290
- I will see you when I get back.
- All right.

348
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,410
Be careful.

349
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,410
Jae Woong.

350
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,400
Drive carefully.

351
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,130
Don't worry.
I will be back soon.

352
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,120
Soo Jung, take care of him.

353
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,070
I will.

354
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,750
Father.

355
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,850
- Please go in.
- Alright.

356
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Jae Woong.

357
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Soo Jung, I can hear everything.

358
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,470
What do I do?
I'll go in. See you later.

359
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,190
- Hello?
- This is Yum Sam Do.

360
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,560
When are you coming?

361
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,640
How can you keep me waiting
when I found you your long-lost brother?

362
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,230
Yes, I'm on my way.

363
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,260
Hello? Da Hae, it's me.

364
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,890
I'm on my way to the prison.

365
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,670
Don't worry.

366
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,070
I will fix Ha Ryu once and for all.

367
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,590
Okay.

368
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,020
Please don't let him show up in front of me.

369
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,680
Alright. Bye.

370
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,950
Gosh, I forgot to buy tofu.

371
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,610
I will go get some.

372
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,540
It's okay. He can have
it when he gets home.

373
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,690
What are you talking about?

374
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,600
As soon as he's out, you have
to put the tofu in his mouth.

375
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,520
That's how it works.

376
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,790
I forgot my wallet.

377
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,740
- How much would it be?
- Ten thousand won will do.

378
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,860
- I will be right back.
- Sure.

379
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,550
Attorney Cha!

380
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,190
Attorney Cha!

381
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,810
Sam Do!

382
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,240
Sam Do!

383
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,550
Ha Ryu, your brother...

384
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,160
- Someone just kidnapped him.
- What?

385
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,380
Who took him?

386
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
Who?

387
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,550
We will talk in the car.
Get in the car, hurry!

388
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,370
You drive!

389
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,090
We have to find him before
something happens to him.

390
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,020
Start the car!

391
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,110
Hello? Officer Bang.

392
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,810
It's me, Yum Sam Do.

393
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,350
We can talk later.

394
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,680
I'm in a hurry.

395
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,150
Can you look up a license plate for me?

396
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,960
Who the hell are you
to threaten her?

397
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
After you killed my father,
you dare to threaten her?

398
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,090
What are you talking about?

399
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,650
Are you going to continue to play dumb?

400
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,650
You murderer!

401
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,890
Who the hell did I kill?

402
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,480
Ha Ryu!

403
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,320
You killed my father, you son of a bitch!

404
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,460
Ha Ryu.

405
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,140
Get up!

406
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,130
Hey!

407
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,120
Ha Ryu!

408
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,270
Wake up!

409
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,550
Ha Ryu!

410
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,430
Wake up.

411
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,930
Wake up!

412
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,570
So, did you see Ha Ryu?

413
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,400
Did you talk some sense into him?

414
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
He...

415
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,640
Ha Ryu is dead.

416
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,970
What?

417
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,860
I said Ha Ryu died.

418
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,630
Let me see, it's 2334.

419
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,050
It's registered to the address near here.

420
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,830
Isn't that the car?

421
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,180
That's it.

422
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,260
Let's get out of the car first.

423
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,930
The car is registered to this night club.

424
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,950
Is he really dead?

425
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,470
I asked if he is really dead.

426
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,480
Are you crazy?

427
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,160
Why did he die?
How could you kill him?

428
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,160
You think I wanted to kill him?

429
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,310
It was just bad luck.

430
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,410
I was only trying to scare him off.

431
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,140
He died on me.

432
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,850
That's right. That's the guy
who took your brother.

433
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,250
- That son of a bitch!
- Hold on!

434
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,210
Ha Ryu paid for his crime.

435
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,700
He even threatened you.

436
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,570
Did anyone see it?

437
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,570
Where is the body?

438
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,420
I handled it.

439
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,280
We won't be caught.

440
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,170
I have to go.
Don't contact me for a while.

441
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,970
What would you do after
you attack him here?

442
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,510
Do you want to die too?

443
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,950
Calm down, Ha Ryu.

444
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,550
Brother!

445
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,970
Joo Da Hae...

446
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,130
<i>That son of a bitch...</i>

447
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,160
<i>Ha Ryu is dead.</i>

448
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,690
<i>It's too late to go back.</i>

449
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,690
<i>Even if I stop here</i>

450
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,470
<i>I know that I won't be forgiven.</i>

451
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,290
<i>I'm sorry, Ha Ryu.</i>

452
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,120
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

453
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,720
If we analyze what happened

454
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,910
Joo Da Hae asked him to murder you.

455
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,400
Joo Yang Hyun mistook your
brother for you and killed him.

456
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,950
Ha Ryu.

457
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,420
Let's call the police.

458
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,420
What's the matter?

459
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,180
They won't find a way out
with the evidence.

460
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,690
Joo Da Hae will find a way out.

461
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,000
Just like how she was able
to do so in the past.

462
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,570
She will find a way out again.

463
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,900
That woman killed my daughter
and my brother.

464
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,220
I will kill her with my own hands,
no matter what.

465
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,060
<i>[Jae Woong, how come you're
not answering?]</i>

466
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,020
<i>[Your father might faint while he's
waiting for you and your brother.]</i>

467
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,520
I don't know what's going on.

468
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,690
We got a text back from Jae Woong.

469
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,900
It would take three to four more days
to handle the matters with his brother.

470
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,900
You've been waiting all this time...

471
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,610
Can't you wait for three to four more days?

472
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,600
It's because I'm being anxious.

473
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,790
Please go inside.
I will go now.

474
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,000
Alright.

475
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,520
If there is anything, call right away.

476
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,580
Yes, I will do that.

477
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,020
Ha Ryu.

478
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,980
Ha Ryu, come over here.

479
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,590
Ha Ryu.

480
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:31,210
I'm going to work on a scheme again.

481
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,060
- Sam Do.
- I know.

482
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,980
I told you I quit.

483
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,030
Please stick to your original plan.

484
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,040
You have to think about your
late daughter, So Young.

485
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,070
That's why I'm going to do
one last big one.

486
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,920
4974 Sam Do.

487
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,570
Before I grab you by the collar
and drag you to the police station

488
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,930
I want you to stop.

489
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,340
Ha Ryu.

490
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:10,720
As I take an x-ray scan
through this office...

491
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,380
I can see the whole picture right away.

492
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,660
Sam Do.

493
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,480
- What?
- Ha Ryu.

494
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,010
From this moment, you...

495
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,370
are not Ha Ryu, but
Attorney Cha Jae Woong.

496
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,700
What?

497
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,260
Ha Ryu died.

498
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,500
He's not alive anymore.

499
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,080
Ha Ryu was killed by Joo Da Hae.

500
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,530
That's right.

501
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,700
I'm my brother,
Attorney Cha Jae Woong.

502
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,240
That's right.

503
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,140
Acting like Attorney Cha Jae Woong

504
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,150
I'm going to follow the scheme
to send Joo Da Hae to hell.

505
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,300
Coming up with the scheme
will be done by Sam Do.

506
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,980
Bingo.

507
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,520
That will be the very last scheme of my life.

508
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
Sam Do.

509
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,700
I'd appreciate it, but I still
want you to go your way.

510
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,100
It will be dangerous.

511
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
There is no scheme that's not dangerous.

512
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
It won't be beneficial to you at all.

513
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,610
Just stick to your original plan.

514
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:42,550
Don't you want to ask me the reason
why I'm trying to do this with you?

515
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,510
My answer is simple.

516
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:50,240
It's just that I like you, man.

517
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,320
Plus, a scheme like this...

518
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,450
To my daughter
So Young, who is in heaven,

519
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,620
I won't be ashamed.

520
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,530
Who knows?

521
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:06,030
Your daughter, Eun Byul
and mine, So Young...

522
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,920
might be friends up there.

523
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,880
Sam Do.

524
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,030
We are going to proceed with the
scheme starting tomorrow.

525
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,000
Sam Do.

526
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,190
Sam Do, wake up.

527
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,960
Wake up.

528
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,970
Guys, when Director Joo buys us lunch

529
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,230
forget kimchi stew or soft tofu stew.

530
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,710
It's polite to choose something expensive.

531
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,410
Madam, can we have tuna sashimi?

532
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,860
Shall we?

533
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,860
Manager Yum, shall we go to
that place from last time?

534
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,100
Yes, Madam.

535
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,940
I will call that restaurant to let
them know that we are coming.

536
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,690
Okay.

537
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,950
Madam, aren't you coming?

538
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,710
Yes, go ahead.

539
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,930
Da Hae, what's the matter?

540
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,590
Yang Hyun, what happened to Ha Ryu?

541
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,080
Ha Ryu is alive.

542
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,130
What are you talking about?
He's dead.

543
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,770
That's not true.
He's alive.

544
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,560
I saw him with my own
eyes a few minutes ago.

545
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,010
Da Hae, pull it together.

546
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,250
He is dead.

547
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,690
How can a dead man be
walking around like that?

548
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,630
Are you saying I saw
a ghost or something?

549
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,780
I wish he was alive too.

550
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,950
I'm telling you that he's dead.

551
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,650
Come in.

552
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,740
Did you ask for me, ma'am?

553
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,610
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

554
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,090
Manager Yum.

555
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,010
Weren't your colleagues already
promoted to a higher position?

556
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,110
Among my colleagues

557
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:54,020
I'm at the lowest position, ma'am.

558
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,310
Manager Yum, you should
be promoted too.

559
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,450
Pardon?

560
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,550
I'm thinking about giving you some work.

561
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,750
Yes, ma'am. If there is any
work you want me to do...

562
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,250
I will offer whatever service I can.

563
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,160
About Director Joo

564
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,240
report her every move to me.

565
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,870
Can you do that?

566
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,690
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,870
I'm shaking now.

568
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,940
First project of the scheme.

569
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:53,980
Make Joo Da Hae sit in front of you.

570
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,220
Will she come to me willingly?

571
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,810
Well, she's coming to see
Attorney Cha, but...

572
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,030
She will definitely show
herself in front of you.

573
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:07,150
For that, we will need some actors.

574
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,070
We will start casting first.

575

Are you by any chance,
Director Baek Do Hoon?

588

Yes, I am.

589
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:00,310
Hello, I'm an employee at
Sae Han Design House.

590
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:02,400
I came to run an errand
for President Chung.

591
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,060
I see.

592
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,110
How come he's not coming?

593
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,820
He's not answering his cell.
Is everything okay?

594
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,080
He says he's very sorry.

595
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,010
He's running late, so...

596
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:16,390
he asked me to proceed with the meeting.

597
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,580
Okay.

598
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,190
What an honor!
You are the heir to Baek Hak Group.

599
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,500
Is it okay to take a picture
before the meeting?

600
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,130
No, thank you.
I'm not too comfortable...

601
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,050
Don't do that.
Please take one picture.

602
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,030
One, two, three!

Excuse me then.

615
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:23,100
- Are you on your way to Seoul?
- Yes.

616
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,010
Is something wrong with the car?

617
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,180
I got two flat tires at once.

618
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,020
There must have been something
sharp on the road.

619

I only have one spare tire.

620

I may need to call someone.

- Is there?

I'm sorry, but do you mind taking me there?

623

Didn't you have a horse named Lisa?

I haven't seen her.

631
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,090
Has she gone to a different
ranch for relaxation?

That's too bad.

I'm sorry.

638
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,070
I shouldn't have asked that
when it must be still hard for you.

While I was working at the riding club

642
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,810
I was studying for the bar.

643

I got lucky and passed the bar.

How come Director Baek Do
Kyung isn't calling me?

662
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,940
4573, how many instant
noodles did you put in?

663
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,470
Are you sure you dropped
your wallet in her car?

664
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,010
I'm positive.

665
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:45,720
I put it on the seat when I was getting out.

666
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,980
Are you really going to eat it all?

667
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,220
Why don't you make one for yourself?

668
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,980
You put a name card with the
phone number in your wallet, right?

669
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,190
I put a lot of them in there.

670
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,900
Let me have one bite.

671
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,700
No way!

672
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,200
I would let you have one of my kidneys,
but I can't let you have my food.

673
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,250
Why isn't she calling yet?

674
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:16,070
What if she took it to the police?

675
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,920
Don't you dare touch my noodles.

676
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,810
I'm not kidding.

677
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,130
Am I interrupting your lunch?

678
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:52,670
No, that's okay.

679
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,420
Have a seat here.

680
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,560
You surprised me.

681
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,150
What brings you here?

682
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,950
You left this in my car last time.

683
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,280
Oh, did I?

684
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,590
I thought I dropped it while
changing the tire on the road.

685
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,200
Thank you.

686
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm okay, so please continue.

687
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,470
It's okay. I'm finished.

688
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,640
But...

689
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,930
you came all the way to drop this off?

690
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,820
I had to take one name card for
your address out of your wallet.

691
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,290
- I'm sorry.
- Don't mention it.

692
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,580
I wanted to give back your wallet, and...

693
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:43,860
I thought I would consult you about a case.

694
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,380
Bring a case?

695
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,970
- A case?
- Yes.

696
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,250
Would it be okay if I asked you on the case?

697
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,260
Go ahead.

698
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,530
What is the case about?

699
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,610
It's about my younger brother.

700
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:06,240
He might have done something shameful.

701
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,440
I want this to be kept confidential.

702
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,050
Is it possible?

703
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,150
We have a duty to protect
our client's privacy.

704
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,550
Go ahead.

705
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:21,020
<i>The female con artist is saying
to Baek Do Hoon that...</i>

706
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:25,080
<i>she will reveal the fact he assaulted
her on the Internet and press.</i>

707
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:29,300
<i>Baek Do Hoon is in a state of panic.  </i>

708
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,000
Hello, Attorney Cha.

709
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,400
How did it go?

710
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,550
<i>Of course, it is resolved well. </i>

711
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,950
<i>Why? The female con artist is on our side.</i>

712
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,950
Is that true, Attorney Cha?

713
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,210
It was completely resolved?

714
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,410
Thank you very much, Attorney Cha.

715
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:57,090
Don't mention it.

716
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,790
I didn't do much.

717
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,310
What do you mean?

718
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:03,010
You have no idea what I went through.

719
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,550
Although I didn't do anything

720
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:07,000
I felt like I did something wrong
to my girlfriend.

721
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,960
I was afraid that my girlfriend
would find out.

722
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:14,060
Are you afraid of your
girlfriend or something?

723
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,250
Yes, very afraid.

724
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,820
Attorney Cha, let me take
you out to dinner.

725
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:22,240
Let's go.
It's my treat.

726
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,250
Wait, shall I have my girlfriend join us?

727
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,610
Do you want to see how scary she can be?

728
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,940
To dinner?

729
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,970
<i>Ha Ryu.</i>

730
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:39,680
<i>It's time for Joo Da Hae to
show up in front of you.</i>

731
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,560
Da Hae, here.

732
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,340
- She's here.
- Okay.

733
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,670
Say hi.

734
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,990
This is Attorney Cha Jae Woong.

735
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,280
How do you do?

736
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,270
Nice to meet you.

737
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,900
