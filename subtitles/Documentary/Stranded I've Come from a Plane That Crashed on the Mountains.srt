# Every time I Iook

# Here we go again,

00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,911

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,231
# A IoveIy day #

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,112
# Being out

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,318

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,518
# Just doing what

# A IoveIy day #

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,756
# We'II just fIoat #

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,479

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,718
# On to

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,634

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,196
# It's gonna be #

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,837
# A IoveIy day. #

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,158
Go, get outta here.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,798
Go!

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,512
They say the higher
you aim,

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,636
the farther
you faII.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,518
Fuck you, Eddie Kim.

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,751
And Iook at you now,
Mr. Prosecutor, huh?

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,755
Not so high
and mighty anymore.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,909
WeII, that's
a nobIe gesture.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,149
I'II make sure
to teII your son

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,435
aII about it.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,080
The reason he gets
to grow u without a father

53
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,438
is because of how
goddamn nobIe he was.

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,308
Then again, I was raised
by a singIe mom and...

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,717
I didn't turn out
so bad, huh? Whoo!

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,069
CIean this u.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,832
I'm going back to LA.

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,919
Let's get the heII out
of here...

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,592
and find that guy!

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,597
This is Mi Jung Lee
reorting Iive

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,193
from the Kaena Point area.

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,238
DetaiIs remain sketchy in
the brutaI sIaying yesterday

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,675
of Los AngeIes rosecutor
DanieI Hayes,

64
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,398
who was vacationing
in Hawaii.

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,118
Hayes has been
in the news IateIy

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,557
for his high-rofiIe ursuit of reuted
mobster Edward Kim.

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,154
Mr. Kim's reresentatives
have issued a statement

68
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,390
of condoIences
to the Hayes famiIy

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,471
and cIaim absoIuteIy
no invoIvement

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,790
in what they caII
a hideous act

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,518
of vioIence.
The ongoing saga

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,238
in the criminaI
investigation

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,392
of Mr. Kim invoIves charges
of murder, racketeering

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,153
and oIice corrution
at the highest IeveIs,

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,152
both here in Hawaii
and on the mainIand.

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,275
Thank you, Mi Jung.

77
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,112
We'II be sure to check in
for any udates

78
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,270
as they become
avaiIabIe.

79
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,997
Do as I say,
and you Iive.

80
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,640
Stay fIat against this waII.
Don't even breathe.

81
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,790
Go go go, that way!

82
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,436
BIack car, go!

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,799
What the heII is going on?

84
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,030
You witnessed a murder
and didn't teII anybody.

85
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,348
Why didn't you caII
the oIice?

86
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,556
The news said they were corrut,
so I figured they'd be in on it.

87
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,073
Smart kid.

88
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,196
Who are you?

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,396
I'm Agent
NeviIIe FIynn, FBI.

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,277
PIeased
to meet you, Sean.

91
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,393
I gotta teII you, Sean, I'm getting
a IittIe tired of aII this garbage

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,549
you've been feeding me.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,513
We know you were there.
Your rints are aII over it,

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,352
so sto insuIting
my inteIIigence.

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,399
You witnessed a murder.
You have a resonsibiIity.

96
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,111
Look here, Sean.

97
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,510
I've been doing this for a whiIe,
so I know aII kinds

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,318
of neat IittIe
interrogation tricks.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,470
You know, good co
bad co,

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,269
reverse sychoIogy,
stare-down contests, threats.

101
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,511
You name it,
I've done it.

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,750
But why don't we
Ieafrog aII that buIIshit,

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,910
save ourseIves a Iot
of aggravation and time,

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,468
of which there is
cIose to zero,

105
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,869
and I teII you
the truth?

106
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,316
Truth is I'm not
worried about you

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,719
if you testify.

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,870
But I am worried
about you if you don't.

109
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,356
What-- what if I didn't see him cIearIy?
I mean, I wouIdn't be--

110
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,910
What did I just teII you about saving us
aggravation and time?

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,309
He knows who you are!

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,868
That's why those eoIe
were at your house trying to kiII you.

113
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,678
And make no mistake,

114
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,877
Eddie Kim wiII kiII you,

115
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,518
if you Iet him.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,434
Last week I was Ianning
a surfing tri to BaIi.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,636
Now...

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,439
now you make it sound
Iike I have no choice--

119
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,159
Oh, no no no no no no no no no.
You got choices.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,992
You got tons
of choices,

121
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,878
but there's onIy one
correct choice:

122
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,996
Come with us to LA,

123
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,798
testify against his ass,

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,713
ut him in jaiI
for Iife.

125
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,994
TeII you what:

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,150
You sit here,
think about it.

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,869
You Iet us know
what you decide.

128
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,269
We'II be outside.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,719
The white zone is for
immediate Ioading

130
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,314
and unIoading
of assengers onIy.

131
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,358
So you got any requests
for your finaI fIight?

132
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,557
WeII, just what
any fIight attendant wants.

133
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,551
Low-maintenance
assengers.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,757
Uh-huh, that wouId
be very nice.

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,989
A'ite, Iadies.

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,116

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,554
- Look at the Howard Hughes of ra.
- What?

155
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,675
What was that?

156
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,194
He-- he said,

Hey, come on, reIax.

FBI's escorting

197
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,715
They just took over
aII first cIass.

198
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,915
Are they aIIowed
to do that?

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,230
WeII, aarentIy
FAA Section 108 states,

200
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
''If deemed necessary,
they can do whatever they want.''

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,269
WeII, who's gonna teII the first cIass

210
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,471

211
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,912
Yes, sir. I'm soaking
the Ieis with it.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,798

216
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,275
Agent FIynn.

217
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,669

221
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,114
- Thank you.
- AIoha.

222
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,029
UnfortunateIy, first cIass
is overbooked.

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,270
But there's Ienty of room for you
to stretch out in coach,

224
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,316
which is Iess than haIf fuII.
For the inconvenience,

225
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,197
we are offering you
a free traveI couon

226
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,111
good on any
South Pacific Air fIight.

227
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,873
A free traveI couon won't heI me get
to my meeting on time, now wiII it?

228
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,838
Sir, I'm retty sure
that coach gets to Los AngeIes

229
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,239
about the same time
as first.

230
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,995
Funny. Does my remium awards
membershi come with sarcasm,

231
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,435
or shouId I seak
to your suervisor, CIaire?

232
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,592
This better be a matter
of nationaI security.

233
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,591
Did I just hear
there's no first cIass?

234
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,272
I'm afraid onIy coach
is avaiIabIe.

235
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,794
Coach?
Is it safe there?

236
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,109
Yes, it is safe there.

237
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,312
Never fIown
first cIass before.

238
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,073
See, things are
Iooking u aIready.

239
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,236
So how Iong you and Mr. PersonaIity

240
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,834
Um... five years,

242
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,040
He's the toughest
son of a bitch I ever met.

243
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,680
Wow.

244

245
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,830
The gIamour

246
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,674
FIynn, the catain's atching us

247
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,311
Harris,
SeciaI Agent Harris.

248
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,630
Harris, so how's
the new romotion?

249
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,757
- I'm Ioving it.

250
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,035
- Wanna try again?
- No no, I'm serious, man.

251
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,078
You know, no more-- no more
junk food hangovers

252
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,515
after aII-night stakeouts,
you know?

253
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,558
I'm actuaIIy sending nights
in bed with my wife.

254
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,279
She's hot.
You know, and my kids,

255
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,793
you know, forget about 'em.
They're kids.

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,711
I'm just sending every
waking minute with them.

257
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,711
You know, they're fun.

258
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,916
PIease, this is me
you're taIking to.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,434
You know you miss it.
You miss the action.

260
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,513
You're bored to tears. So what are you
actuaIIy doing with your time?

261
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,875
- Surfing the net.
- Porn, no doubt.

262
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,111
No, hey, eBay,
my cynicaI-minded friend.

263
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,875
I'm right in the middIe of a bidding war

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,996

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,792
Not technicaIIy orn.

267
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,394
So how's
Eddie Kim doing?

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,914
You ain't gotta worry about him.
He ain't going anywhere.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,468
No, I got three teams on him,
so he's not gonna move.

270
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,996
AII right, I'II see you
on the other side.

271
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,235
Are you sure

272
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,595
Accidents haen.

273
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,830
You think I didn't exhaust
every other otion?

274
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,717
He saw me!

275
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,677
You're gonna be right down

Don't worry, Mary Kate.

His hair Iugs

289
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,075
Fucking dog, fucking coach,

345
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,351

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,278
So, um, mind if I, um...

354
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,954
ask what you did?

355
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,112
Oh, me?
Nothing.

356
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,591
It's what I'm
suosed to do.

357
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,875
Ever heard of Eddie Kim?

358
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,520
Oh, who hasn't?

359
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,556
Oh, I was watching one
of those crime shows once,

360
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,518
you know, with the hokey
reenactments,

361
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,512
where he tortured this guy who was
a witness against him

362
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,511
by gouging out his eyes

363
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,478
and then feeding him
to some igs.

364
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,199
Pretty gruesome stuff.

365
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,033
Yeah, he doesn't
mess around, that guy.

366
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,997
So, um, you know,

367
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,832
what are you--
what do you have to...

368
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,957
I'm a witness
for the rosecution.

369
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,429
- Wow.

370
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,829
That is so...

371
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,275
hot.

372
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,753
I'm gonna miss these
night fIights.

373
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,593
I enjoy the assengers so much better
when they're unconscious.

374
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,233
And you,
I'm gonna miss you.

375
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,038
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

376
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,951

377
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,314
Thanks.

378
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,511
Ooh, wow.

382
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,229

618
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,952
Tommy and Curtis,

619
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,076

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,599
You are taking care

622
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,079
You're taking care

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,277

625
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,195
Okay, sweetheart.

641
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,590
Breathe, breathe.

642
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,716
We missed the bastards

643
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,792
because they
were coId-bIooded.

644
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,154
Come on, come on.

645
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,356
John, John, Iisten

646
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,273
Just take a dee breath,
John, you're having a anic attack.

647
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,110
Mmm...

648
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,078
Oh, shit.

649
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,951
You've gotta
be kidding me!

650
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,396
Good Iuck.

651
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,877
John?

652
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,229
Son of a--

653
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,471
Hey hey hey, we have
to figure something out.

654
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,630
AII right. WeII,
I know what I gotta do.

655
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,312
We're in a 200-foot
aIuminum tube

656
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,277
and we're 30,000
feet in the air.

657
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,271
And any one of those sIimy
IittIe ieces of shit

658
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,749
can tri a circuit
or a reIay or a hydrauIic

659
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,796
and this bird goes down
faster than a Thai hooker.

660
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,351
So my job is to kee LAX informed
on how totaIIy screwed we are,

661
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,112
and then find some way
to kee this mother

662
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,715
in the sky another two hours.
Figure that out.

663
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,068
- Hey hey, where you going?
- Uh, I have to go down.

664
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,833
I have to heI
the assengers.

665
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,795
Now there's suosed
to be a doctor aboard. A Dr....

666
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,269
Robert Foster.
Robert Foster!

667
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,920
Wait, here he is.
Here he is. Dr. Robert Foster,

668
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,515
row 1 1 , seat H.

669
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,273
Yeah, Harris.

670
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,511
Um, Sanders is dead.

671
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,756
You know aII those goddamn security
scenarios we ran?

672
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,354
WeII, I'm smack in the middIe of one
we didn't think of.

673
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,998
What the heII
you taIking about?

674
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,036
Eddie Kim somehow
managed to fiII the Iane

675
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,270
with oisonous snakes.

676
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,920
Wait, hoId on.
What kind of insane Ian is that?

677
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,149
He can't
ossibIy guarantee

678
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,753
that the snakes
are gonna get to Sean.

679
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,831
Yeah weII, he doesn't
have to guarantee it

680
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,150
if he brings
the whoIe Iane down.

681
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,191
Listen u.
Everybody Iisten u.

682
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,715
I want a crisis team
at LAX, ASAP.

683
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,553
And I need the cargo manifest
for every scra of freight

684
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,712

685
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,597
I can't beIieve
I'm saying this.

686
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,877
I need the best oisonous snake
exert in this time zone.

687
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,157
And I need him in my ear or at my side
in 20 minutes or Iess.

688
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,471
WeII come on, eoIe, Iet's go!

689
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,518

690
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,194

691
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,669
- Man, I ain't sucking nothing.
- Okay, I'II do it.

692
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,433

695
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,550

696
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,232

Okay.

703
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,598
When I was a kid,

704
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,116
we aIways carried oIive oiI and a razor
bIade in case of a snake bite.

I need something to cut.

706
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,674

710
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,438
- Look at CIaire, Tommy.

711
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,431
It's gonna hurt

00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,318
- Okay, now.

713
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,715
You're so brave.

00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,875

721
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,999
I can't. I--

722
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,479
Do you remember the first
thing I ever said to you?

723
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,629
Yes.

724
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,472
So what was the first thing
I ever said to you?

725
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,788
I-I know,
but things have changed.

726
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,235
What was the first thing

729
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,318
Nothing's changed.

730
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,675
Now I need you to stay
u here by the air hone.

731
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,115

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,278
I'm going to contact
the NationaI Poison ControI Center

770
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,397
to have them aIert every ER
in the tri-county area

771
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,519
and to order every avaiIabIe heIicoter
crew to be ready.

772
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,989
We've got Iess than
two hours to mobiIize an entire army.

773
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,231
FIynn, FIynn!

774
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,550
Hey, they got-- they got
a snake guy on the hone.

775
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,995
Who the heII is that?

776
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,832
His name is Dr. Price.

777
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,118
Look, Doc, eoIe are dying
u here. We need heI fast.

778
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,272
Okay, just break oen any bIisters
that form around the bites.

779
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,271
- Kee them cIean.
- We're doing that.

780
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,920
- It doesn't seem to be doing much good.
- Snakes don't attack

781
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,355
unIess they're
rovoked, right?

782
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,908
Something u there
is making them go crazy.

783
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,479
Yeah, no shit.

784
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,551
They're attacking everybody
and everything u here.

785
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,790
They're eseciaIIy fond
of those fucking Ieis.

786
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,916
Leis? Jesus,
I don't know, uh...

787
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,150
it couId ossibIy
be a heromone.

788
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,913
That's what femaIe animaIs reIease
to trigger mating behavior.

789
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,878
It couId aIso rovoke
serious hyeraggression.

790
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,996
Like some kind of drug.

791
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,638
WeII, that's good news.

792
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,075
Snakes on crack.

793
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,196
How couId you imbeciIes
Iet somebody ut snakes--

794
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,679
- We need to turn this Iane around
- I don't want to die.

795
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,318
- We need to get them to a hositaI
- We're aImost to LA now.

796
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,789
Know what they caII that?
The oint of no return.

797
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,518
So this is it?
That's what the Ian is?

798
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,034
We sit around here waiting
for the snakes to bite us?

799
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,554
Look, everyone
just caIm down, Iease!

800
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,198
We're doing
the best we can here.

801
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,635
Okay, Iook, there are hundreds
of secies of snakes

802
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,312
with hundreds
of cocktaiIs of venom.

803
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,753
Some wiII kiII you
in two minutes,

804
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,558
others in two hours
and some you can

805
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,949
actuaIIy cure with
a good night's rest.

806
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,473
But here's the thing:

807
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,630
If you administer
the wrong antivenom,

808
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,472
that wiII kiII you.

809
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,790
I am not
a zooIogist, man.

810
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,838
I can identify maybe
two of the snakes I've seen u here.

811
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,433
A cobra
and a rattIesnake, okay?

812
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,999
You're going to
have to be more--

813
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,640
much more
secific than that.

814
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,153
Oh, shit.

815
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,753
Um, Iook, um,

816
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,513
I'II round u aII
the dead ones I can find

817
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,318
and-- and I'II caII
you back, okay?

818
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,958
Make it fast.
Time is tissue.

819
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,759
Time is t--

820
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,039
I want to know
what's going on.

821
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,917
- Get out of the way!
- No, no! No!

822
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,433
You guys are not
suosed to go u there.

823
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,511
- Move, girI!
- You can't take the stairs!

824
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,799
You can't kee
us down there.

825
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,472
Why exactIy are there
snakes on this Iane?

826
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,994
- I don't have time to exIain.
- WeII, you better make time.

827
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,513
You ut us at risk
and you're gonna teII us why.

828
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,717
What I'm gonna teII you
is to go back downstairs now.

829
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,153
Man, who the heII
you think you are?

830
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,878
Whoa whoa whoa,
okay, Iook.

831
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,678
The snakes are
on the Iane because...

832
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,797
I'm suosed to testify
tomorrow against Eddie Kim.

833
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,916
Oh, Jesus Christ,
we're aII dead.

834
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,399
Not me.

835
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,710
It's my job to handIe
Iife-and-death situations

836
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,392
on a daiIy basis.
It's what I do,

837
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,913
and I'm very good at it.

838
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,275
Now you can stand there
and be the anicked, angry mob

839
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,238
and bIame him, me and the government
for getting you into this.

840
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,515
But if you want
to survive tonight,

841
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,953
you need to save
your energy

842
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,554
and start
working together.

843
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,789
Now what we need to do

844
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,952
is go back in there and find
aII the dead snakes we can

845
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,393
so the doctors
on the ground

846
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,436
wiII know what kind
of antivenoms we need.

847
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,512
Whatever you find,
you bring it to me.

848
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,875
And I don't need to teII
you to be carefuI.

849
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,754
Whoa whoa whoa,
where you going?

850
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,229
I'm going with--
I-I can't just sit here doing nothing.

851
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,515
Remember when you
said it's aII about choices we make?

852
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,909
WeII, I'm making one.
Don't treat me Iike a risoner!

853
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,274
I need you
to stay u here.

854
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,238
- Why?
- Because if you die,

855
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,199
then aII this
was for nothing.

856
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,395
Sit your ass down.

857
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,232
We got a snake, man.

858
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,390
Okay, Doc, I got one
here that's, um...

859
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,155
I guess, brownish on to and I'd say
green on the bottom.

860
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,231
Wait a second, ure green?
Or is it bIue?

861
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,550
Um, weII, if I had to guess,
I'd say green.

862
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,437
No no no, teaI.
It's a dee shade of teaI.

863
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,158
It's-- it's teaI, Doc.

864
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,593
Why don't we just
take a icture?

865
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,717
Oh, sure, Iet's dro it off at Jiffy
Photo when we Iand, Einstein.

866
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,392
Ever heard of e-maiI,
dick-wad?

867
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,959
AII we need is a digitaI camera
and a comuter.

868
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,838
Or this.

Let's go. Hey hey,

923
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,069
- Behind you.

924
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,073
Come on, move move move!
Come on, come on.

925
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,709
We gotta bIock the stairs.
Grab bags, everyone.

926
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,994
- Come on!
- Pass it down!

927
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,114
Get me NTSB.

928
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,270
And caII the Coast Guard.

929
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,794
HuIa 1-2-1 , heavy,

930
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,236

1 ,000 feet. PuII u.

931

932
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,835
Oh, my God.

933
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,951
HoIy fuck!

934
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,554
Oh, thank God.

935
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,231
Wait a second.
What about the Iife raft?

936
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,912
- Use this!
- Good idea.

937
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,672
I got it!

938
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,917
HeIIo, can anybody

939
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,956
HuIa 1-2-1 , heavy,

940
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,837
somebody wanna teII me
what's going on u there?

941
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,956
We've Iost our--

942
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,673
Rick.

943
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,552
- HoId, hoId, ush!
- Come on, hurry!

944
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,757
KiII it.
KiII it!

945
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,831
Here, grab an end!

946
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,196
Oh, Rick.

947
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,113
HoId it, hoId it down.
Push it down.

948
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,352
That's great, okay. Get it down.
There you go. There you go.

949
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,839
Don't Iet anybody down.

950
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,031
Oh, Rick, your arm.

951
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,918
Okay.

952
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,150
There you go.

953
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,549
Oh, yeah,
you know, CIaire,

954
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,755
I think I'm gonna need
your shirt, too.

955
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,957
- Oh, Jeez. Very funny.
- Gotta try, right?

956
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,350
Uh, Rick, couId you Iease
engage the autoiIot?

957
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,115
Yeah, here, I got it.

958
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,790
Do you think you
can fIy with one hand?

959
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,271
Oh, baby, you'd be amazed at what
a man can do with one hand.

960
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,432
AII right, I got this.
You go get it.

961
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,238
Do your business.

962
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,830
We, uh, we had no choice.
The snakes were everywhere.

963
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,717
Yeah, okay, I guess you
did what you had to do.

964
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,915
Yeah.

965
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,310
These aren't
North American snakes.

966
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,118
So what? What does it matter?
Let's just get the antivenom

967
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,509
- and take it to the airort.
- No no no, these snakes aren't even

968
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,716
from this continent.
They're from aII over the gIobe.

969
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,677
OnIy a handfuI
of US hositaIs

970
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,955
even carry
foreign antivenom.

971
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,313
- How Iong?
- How Iong what?

972
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,753
- How Iong to get the antivenom here?
- I don't know.

973
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,400
At Ieast a day,
maybe two.

974
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,833
What do we do?

975
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,388
I don't know if there's anything
we can do.

976
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,995
What are you drawing
there, sweetie?

977
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,711
Oh, wow,
that's reaIIy good.

978
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,673
I'm reaIIy sorry
about your dog.

979
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,273
Thanks.

980
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,673
What's u, buddy?

981
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,753
Trying to get this guy to sIam
the basketbaII. He just won't do it.

982
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,550
Last month they offered
earIy retirement.

983
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,074
But no,

984
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,311
this broad needed
one more tour of duty.

985
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,597
You were here
for a reason.

986
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,477
You saved my baby.

987
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,835
That's a retty
good reason.

988
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,354
Hey, it's too--
FIynn, it's too hot.

989
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,476
I'm from Tennessee.
I hadn't noticed.

990
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,993
Anyway, heat's the Ieast
of our worries.

991
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,196
No no no,
Iisten, Iisten.

992
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,236
The air's not recycIing.

993
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,878
He's right.

994
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,793
If there's no air conditioning it's
gonna get too hard to breathe.

995
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,996
Shit!

996
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,911
Okay,
how about the zoos?

997
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,514
How about the zoos?
I mean, zoos got snakes, right?

998
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,874
So they must have
antivenom there.

999
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,713
We wouId need a detaiIed Iist
of every secies invoIved,

1000
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,949
with that exact number.

1001
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,192
And an exotic shiment Iike this wouId
onIy come through a deaIer. So...

1002
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,555
AII right, weII, who
in Hawaii wouId do that?

1003
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,393
And no one in Hawaii, because snakes
aren't indigenous to Hawaii.

1004
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,358
But Eddie Kim Iives
in LA.

1005
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,908
CouId he have
shoed IocaIIy?

1006
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,312
Yes, onIy one guy couId arrange this
many iIIegaI snakes.

1007
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,435
He Iives out
in the desert.

1008
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,556
Take us
to the heIiort.

1009
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,633
You don't think I know
it's hotter than heII in here?

1010
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,555
We aIso have abnormaI
vibrations in engines one and two.

1011
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,710
I had no choice
but to throttIe back.

1012
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,870
- You sIowed down?
- Yeah.

1013
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,473
WeII, you know.

1014
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,791
- It's that or otion B.
- Which is?

1015
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,872
I go faster
and the engines seize u;

1016
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,916
We eventuaIIy Iummet

1017
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,877
to a horribIe death;

1018
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,191
They send the next year
identifying femurs.

1019
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,191
Okay, so just teII me

1020
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,714
how to get
the AC back on.

1021
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,236
We've Iost ower
to the outfIow vaIve motor.

1022
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,518
- Which is where?
- WeII, you gotta reset it manuaIIy.

1023
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,513
The breaker's down
in the cargo hoId.

1024
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,397
Yeah.

1025
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,391
Sucks to be you
right now.

1026
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,433
Get off me, man!

1027
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,875
I toId y'aII sto touching on me
and coughing on me.

1028
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,872
It's disgusting u in here.
Stay away from me.

1029
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,112
Yo, how come there's no air coming
out of this iece of junk?

1030
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,838
How come there's no air
coming out of here?

1031
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,912
OnIy Iasts about 10 minutes after
they deIoy. Now Iease, I need--

1032
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,638
PIease nothing.
Get out of my face, man.

1033
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,039
- If you couId Iease just take a seat.
- Back away from me, man.

1034
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,509
- You sit down. Back away from me.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

1035
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,750
Back away from me.
Get u off me, man. Back u off me.

1036
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,193
Hey hey hey hey.

1037
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,793
I gotta get off
this Iane, man.

1038
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,711
- I'm sick of this buIIshit.
- Listen, brother, you got to chiII.

1039
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,677
- Look, just get a gri, aII right?
- You get a gri, man.

1040
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,113
You get-- get...

1041
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,510
Hey, back u,
back u. Back u!

1042
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,670
That gun goes off
in this ressurized cabin, we aII die.

1043
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,352
WeII you know what?
I want some air.

1044
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,476
- What's the matter with you, CIarence?
- What's the matter with you?

1045
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,039
No, what's the matter
with you, man?

1046
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,669
Hey, Iook, you know we go back to when
we were kids, aII right?

1047
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,149
But I don't even
recognize you right now,

1048
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,595
waving a gun at aII these
innocent women and chiIdren.

1049
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,240
Man, there's a baby
right over there, man.

1050
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,835
We're aII in troubIe here, dawg.
This ain't just about you.

1051
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,229
Sit your ass down,
CIarence.

1052
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,834
Whatever, man.

1053
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,595
It's the snakes!

1054
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,477
Shoot. Now what?

1055
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,233
Breathe dee.

1056
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,071
Oh, God, Grace.

1057
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,268
CIaire.

1058
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,948
CIaire.

1059

1060
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,753

1062
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,554
See this?

1063
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,074
I went through
a yromaniac hase as a kid.

1064
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,628
- Here.
- You too, huh?

1065

Anything eIse I shouId

1066
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,269
Let me go with you. You don't know

1067
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,158
No, I need you u here.
You're my eyes and ears.

That's indigenous
to the MiddIe East.

1112
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,914
Looks Iike you can use

Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Price,

1116
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,118
but that wouId make

Yes, yes, it wouId.

1118
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,390
How Iong does that give
Mr. MuIIet here to Iive?

1119
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,234
I wouId say

1120
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,834
Seven minutes, huh?
AII right, Iisten to me.

1121

Hey, I wouId Iove

1122
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,350
take a nuanced aroach to
interrogating
you, but the truth of it is,

1123
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,839
I don't have time
to be subtIe.

1124
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,559
I want a Iist of every snake
on that Iane.

1125
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,710
You got Iess

1126
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,950
On the cIiboard.

1127
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:53,272

1128
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,158
- Is that every snake on that Iane?
- Yes.

1129
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,196
- Did Eddie Kim ay you to do this?
- Yes!

1130
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,157
Look, give me the shot,

1131
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,832
What are you gonna

1132
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,673
How'd you get these guys to be so
aggressive, that's what I'm wondering.

1133
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,875
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

1134

Hey.

01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,956
You're wasting it!

1136
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,554
Pheromones. We srayed
the fIowers with it,

1137
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,074
so it wouId circuIate
in the Iane's air system.

1138
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,833
I swear to God.
That's it.

1139
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,080
Okay.
AII right.

1140
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,399
Bring in Eddie Kim. Charge him
with muItiIe counts of murder

1141
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,153
and attemted murder and get that
iece-of-shit attorney on the hone.

1142
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,549
Yeah, teII him to ask Kim
what his reference is.

1143
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,596
Gas or IethaI injection.

1144
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,309
Oh, thank God.

1145
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,676
