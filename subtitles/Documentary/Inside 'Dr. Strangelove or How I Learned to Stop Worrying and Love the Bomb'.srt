1
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,587
For more than a year, ominous rumours
had been privately circulating...

2
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,090
among high-level Western leaders...

3
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:52,011
that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...

4
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,765
the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,770
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,522
to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...

7
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:05,984
below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:11,407
What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...

9
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:13,743
no one could say.

10
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,536
General Ripper, sir.

11
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:47,538
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,581
This is General Ripper speaking.

13
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,834
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognise my voice?

14
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,337
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,172
Why do you think?

16
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:59,843
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:05,141
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,642
No, I don't.

19
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,894
Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

20
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,440
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

21
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:15,360
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

22
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:19,031
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

23
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:21,908
The base is being put on condition red.

24
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:24,203
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

25
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:27,623
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

26
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,959
This is not an exercise.

27
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:32,920
Not an exercise?

28
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,219
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right to know.

29
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:41,263
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

30
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:47,228
- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.

31
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,067
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:56,697
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,699
R for Robert, to the Wing.

34
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:02,161
- plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?

35
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:04,748
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,833
Plan R for Robert.

37
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:10,253
Last and possibly most important...

38
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:14,550
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:18,554
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:21,474
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:25,562
I want every one collected
without exception.

42
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,940
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,723
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

44
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:01,226
America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...

45
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:05,440
a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.

46
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:10,403
Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...

47
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:15,492
equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...

48
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:20,164
and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.

49
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,376
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

50
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:26,212
is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

51
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:29,090
But they have one geographical factor
in common.

52
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:33,137
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

53
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:56,145
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,898
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

55
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:04,946
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:12,329
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:13,914
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,424
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

59
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,426
horsing around on the airplane?

60
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,762
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

61
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,514
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

62
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:33,436
and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.

63
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,396
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:37,940
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,569
There's gotta be something wrong.

66
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,030
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:21,155
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,657
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,391
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:50,146
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:54,316
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,819
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,489
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,867
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,201
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,787
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

77
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:13,004
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,341
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

79
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,238
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

80
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,994
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:44,038
is going on back there.

82
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:48,001
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:51,546
that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

84
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:54,341
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...

85
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:59,013
if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.

86
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:02,016
I want you to remember one thing.

87
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,852
The folks back home
are counting on you.

88
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,271
And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

89
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,402
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:16,448
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

91
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,578
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,457
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,294
That goes for every last one of you...

94
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:31,173
regardless of your race,
colour or your creed.

95
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,802
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:50,653
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,655
Yeah, you'll have to.

98
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,372
Hello?

99
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:05,043
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

100
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:07,380
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

101
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,717
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,052
Fine. And you?

103
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:17,808
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:22,521
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

105
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:25,024
Just a minute.

106
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:28,361
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

107
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,363
Tell him to call back.

108
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:35,118
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

109
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:37,121
He says it can't wait.

110
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:40,541
For Pete's...
Find out what he wants.

111
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,504
The general is in the powder room
right now.

112
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,840
Could you tell me what it's about?

113
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:52,387
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

114
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,932
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

115
00:12:56,768 --> 00:13:01,856
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

116
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:07,071
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

117
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:12,827
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

118
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,578
Do I have to think of everything?

119
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,251
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

120
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,712
Oh. All communications are dead!

121
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:26,175
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

122
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,180
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

123
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:35,936
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

124
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:38,772
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

125
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,867
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

126
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:51,911
Yeah?

127
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:56,333
Well, are you sure
it's Plan R?

128
00:13:57,585 --> 00:14:00,296
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

129
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:03,132
Nothing? Nothing at all?

130
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,387
I don't like the look of this.

131
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,475
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

132
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,729
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

133
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,356
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

134
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,650
- What's up?
- Nothing.

135
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,531
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

136
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,325
No place.

137
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:31,163
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

138
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,040
It's 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,043
The air force never sleeps.

140
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:39,047
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

141
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,512
I know how it is, baby.

142
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,597
Tell you what you do.

143
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,602
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

144
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:55,232
before you can say "Blastoff!"

145
00:14:56,525 --> 00:15:00,612
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

146
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,618
For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...

147
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,787
for extreme watchfulness.

148
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,874
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

149
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,545
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

150
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:18,132
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

151
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:20,968
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

152
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:26,433
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

153
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:31,020
First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

154
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,566
unless he is known to you personally.

155
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,527
Secondly: Anyone or anything...

156
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,490
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

157
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:47,205
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

158
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:50,625
I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...

159
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,839
than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.

160
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:59,051
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

161
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:02,973
Now, men, in conclusion...

162
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:07,102
I would like to say
that in the two years...

163
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:10,981
that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

164
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:13,985
I have always expected
the best from you...

165
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:17,947
and you have never given me
anything less than that.

166
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,367
Today the nation is counting on us.

167
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:25,289
We are not going to let them down.

168
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,291
Good luck to you all.

169
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:00,035
Here's the attack profile, sir.

170
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:30,444
This is your attack profile.

171
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:33,614
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...

172
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,867
or plant false transmission...

173
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:41,080
the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

174
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:44,585
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

175
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,087
on the dials of the C.R.M.

176
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:51,718
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix."

177
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:55,430
Stand by to set code prefix.

178
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,974
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

179
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,934
"Set code prefix."

180
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:10,905
Code prefix set.

181
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,616
"Lock code prefix."

182
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,745
Code prefix locked.

183
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,290
"Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. discriminators."

184
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,754
Switched to C.R.M. discriminators.

185
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,672
"Check auto destruct circuits."

186
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,929
Auto destruct circuits checked.

187
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,731
"Primary target:
the I.C.B.M. complex at Laputa.

188
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:46,027
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...

189
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,154
3-6-0.

190
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:50,198
Thirty megaton nuclear device...

191
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,370
fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.

192
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:58,916
Twenty megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

193
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,670
Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:

194
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:05,757
missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

195
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:09,803
Target reference:
November, bravo, Xray...

196
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:12,348
1-0-8.

197
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:17,728
Fused air burst at 10..."
Check..."12,000 feet."

198
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,912
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

199
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,832
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

200
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:41,714
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

201
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:43,757
I think it's taking things too far.

202
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,886
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

203
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,182
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

204
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,727
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

205
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,230
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

206
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:01,611
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

207
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:05,156
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

208
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:09,703
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

209
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:13,832
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

210
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,544
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

211
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:21,841
I realise that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

212
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:24,677
After all, let's face it.

213
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:28,765
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

214
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:33,395
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

215
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,605
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:39,569
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

217
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:42,531
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

218
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,450
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

219
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:51,666
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

220
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,876
rather an odd way of looking at it

221
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,379
If a Russian attack was in progress...

222
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,384
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,303
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,098
What if it is true?

225
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,185
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

226
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,148
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:17,569
then your use of Plan R... In fact,
your orders to the entire Wing...

228
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:30,333
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

229
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:33,753
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

230
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:36,506
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,010
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:52,149
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:55,486
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:00,241
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

235
00:22:00,325 --> 00:22:02,327
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:15,841
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

237
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,428
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

238
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,056
There's nothing anybody can do now.

239
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,558
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

240
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,186
I must insist
that you give them to me!

241
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,284
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

242
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:45,666
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

243
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:49,337
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

244
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,299
a decision is being made
by the president...

245
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:56,511
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

246
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:03,185
When they realise there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

247
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,566
there will be only one course
of action open.

248
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,526
Total commitment.

249
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,241
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

250
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:20,246
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

251
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,959
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

252
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:30,632
When he said that 50 years ago...

253
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,676
he might have been right.

254
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:35,095
But today...

255
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:38,641
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

256
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:43,188
They have neither the time,
the training...

257
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,317
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

258
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,449
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

259
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:58,705
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

260
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,415
Communist subversion...

261
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,755
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

262
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:08,674
to sap and impurify...

263
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:12,094
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

264
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:19,770
Staines, is everybody here?

265
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:22,314
Mr. President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

266
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:26,361
The secretary of defence is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

267
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:31,407
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

268
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:34,577
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

269
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,666
Mr. President...

270
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:42,419
about 35 minutes ago...

271
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:46,466
General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

272
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,010
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

273
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,347
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

274
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,516
which were airborne at the time...

275
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:58,729
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

276
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:03,484
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

277
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,947
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

278
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,243
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

279
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:14,831
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

280
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:19,377
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

281
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:24,090
The triangles
are their primary targets.

282
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:27,094
The squares
are their secondary targets.

283
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:33,476
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

284
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:38,982
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

285
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:44,322
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

286
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:49,535
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorised to do so.

287
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:53,916
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:57,628
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:02,591
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:06,262
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,181
Plan R?

292
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,144
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:15,731
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

294
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:18,943
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:22,530
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:25,492
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:30,872
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

298
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,918
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

299
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:38,714
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,758
A safeguard?

301
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:44,137
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

302
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,599
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

303
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:52,271
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:56,526
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

305
00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:59,320
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:01,406
once they reach their fail-safe points.

307
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:07,037
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

308
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:09,123
when the go code was issued.

309
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:13,712
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:15,714
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:18,842
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

312
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:23,556
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

313
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,850
Why?

314
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:28,311
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:32,023
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:36,695
that once the go code
is received...

317
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:40,073
the normal S.S.B. radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,619
are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,747
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

320
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,251
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,256
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,887
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

323
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:05,310
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

324
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:08,313
That's the size of it.
However, we are ploughing through...

325
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,274
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

326
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:16,572
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

327
00:28:16,614 --> 00:28:20,243
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

328
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:23,080
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

329
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,625
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

330
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:31,631
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

331
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:33,299
Where did you get this information?

332
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:36,970
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

333
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,597
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,269
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,145
Read it.

336
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:49,692
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,029
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:58,326
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

339
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,205
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,958
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:08,963
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:14,344
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

343
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,973
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:20,894
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:25,857
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,319
and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:33,240
and essence of our natural...

348
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:34,742
fluids.

349
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:37,745
God bless you all."

350
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:42,334
Then he hung up.

351
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:46,004
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

352
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:50,384
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:55,556
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

354
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,229
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

355
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:04,233
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

356
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:10,281
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

357
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:13,034
because of a single slip up, sir.

358
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:15,620
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

359
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:17,205
That's impossible.

360
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:21,210
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

361
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:24,839
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

362
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:27,424
General Faceman.

363
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:28,676
Yes, sir?

364
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,096
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,223
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,521
Hello?

367
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:44,318
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:49,407
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:52,035
My president needs me.

370
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,747
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:59,961
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:02,505
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:05,675
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:09,805
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:12,850
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

376
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:17,479
All right. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

377
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,450
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:31,329
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:35,666
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,127
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

381
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,838
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,548
Mr. President?

383
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,217
If I may advise.

384
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,554
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

385
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,391
and the base defended
by base security troops.

386
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,896
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

387
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:59,026
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defence team...

388
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,862
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

389
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,535
Mr. President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

390
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,038
Go ahead, General.

391
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,211
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

392
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:20,550
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

393
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:23,678
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

394
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:26,722
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

395
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,809
Three: When they do...

396
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:32,521
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

397
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:36,483
Four: If prior to this time...

398
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:40,029
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

399
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:43,741
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

400
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:51,500
Five: If, on the other hand...

401
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:58,717
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

402
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,970
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

403
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:04,431
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

404
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:07,267
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

405
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,730
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

406
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:16,152
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

407
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:21,158
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

408
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:23,368
We would therefore prevail...

409
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:26,663
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

410
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:31,169
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

411
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:34,672
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

412
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:36,926
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

413
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:41,680
Well, Mr. President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

414
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:46,185
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

415
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:52,025
Mr. President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

416
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:55,278
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

417
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:57,990
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

418
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,618
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

419
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:03,454
to choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

420
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:07,000
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

421
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:11,880
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

422
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:14,925
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

423
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:18,555
Mr. President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

424
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:23,268
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

425
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,353
Depending on the breaks.

426
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:29,400
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

427
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,069
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

428
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:35,489
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

429
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,577
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

430
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,079
Thank you very much.

431
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,707
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

432
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,420
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

433
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,964
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

434
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:51,591
Yes, sir.

435
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,176
Is that the Russian ambassador?

436
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,346
Yes, it is, General.

437
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,435
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

438
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:03,854
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

439
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,816
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

440
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:11,905
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

441
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:15,409
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

442
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:19,622
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

443
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:22,917
That is precisely the idea, General.

444
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,211
That is precisely the idea.

445
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:30,675
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

446
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:41,687
"Survival kit contents check.

447
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:46,693
In them you will find
one .45 caliber automatic...

448
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,279
two boxes of ammunition...

449
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,616
four days concentrated
emergency rations...

450
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:56,037
one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

451
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,416
morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

452
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,295
sleeping pills,
tranquilliser pills...

453
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:09,218
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

454
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,304
$100 in roubles...

455
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:14,516
$100 in gold...

456
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:17,352
nine packs of chewing gum...

457
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:19,354
one issue of prophylactics...

458
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:23,441
three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings."

459
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:28,239
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

460
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:36,623
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

461
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:38,876
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:42,921
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

463
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:46,426
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

464
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:49,679
Try one of theseJamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

465
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:53,224
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

466
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:55,895
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

467
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,521
Mr. President.

468
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:02,693
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

469
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:03,862
Mr. President?

470
00:37:03,945 --> 00:37:07,699
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

471
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:10,160
and he won't be back for two hours.

472
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:13,748
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

473
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,917
You would never have found him
through his office.

474
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,004
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

475
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:22,798
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

476
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,428
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

477
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,431
- Have this ignorant fool...
- I'm sorry!

478
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:33,436
Mr. President,
I think they're trying the number.

479
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:47,201
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

480
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:50,120
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

481
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:54,459
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

482
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,128
You bet your sweets, Mr. Commie!
Look at this, Mr. President.

483
00:37:57,212 --> 00:38:00,799
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

484
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:03,719
Mr. Ambassador!

485
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:08,057
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

486
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,018
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

487
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,274
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behaviour in the War Room before.

488
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:17,818
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

489
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,767
You got to hand it to those Commies.

490
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:52,398
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

491
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,400
I wonder where they got them from.

492
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,736
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

493
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:04,494
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

494
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:05,395
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

495
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:07,772
but nothing more than that.

496
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:12,778
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

497
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,448
But I don't have a phone.

498
00:40:16,532 --> 00:40:19,076
Give him the phone.

499
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:50,235
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

500
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:57,702
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

501
00:40:57,785 --> 00:41:00,205
Listen, I can't hear too well.

502
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:03,542
Could you turn the music down
a little?

503
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,544
That's much better.

504
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:08,255
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,302
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

506
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:15,889
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

507
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:20,353
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

508
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,398
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

509
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,400
It's good that you're fine...

510
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,736
and I'm fine.

511
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,032
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

512
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,118
Now, Dimitri...

513
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:40,917
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

514
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,670
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

515
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:47,006
The bomb, Dimitri.

516
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:50,844
The hydrogen bomb.

517
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:53,889
Well, now, what happened is...

518
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:58,185
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of...

519
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:01,481
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

520
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:04,651
You know, just a little funny.

521
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:08,363
And he went and did a silly thing.

522
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:11,367
I'll tell you what he did.

523
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,786
He ordered his planes...

524
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:17,915
to attack your country.

525
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:20,377
Let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:23,380
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:42:23,422 --> 00:42:26,633
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,554
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:33,266
Why do you think I'm calling you?

530
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,351
Just to say hello?

531
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:38,856
Of course I like to speak to you!

532
00:42:38,897 --> 00:42:41,442
Of course I like to say hello!

533
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,694
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

534
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:47,823
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

535
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:50,869
Of course, it's a friendly call.

536
00:42:50,952 --> 00:42:55,206
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

537
00:42:57,542 --> 00:43:02,298
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

538
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:05,468
I am positive, Dimitri.

539
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:07,970
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

540
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:10,557
It is not a trick.

541
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:12,100
I'll tell you.

542
00:43:12,142 --> 00:43:15,979
We'd like to give your Air Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

543
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:19,317
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

544
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,322
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

545
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:27,075
I'd say, well...

546
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:32,831
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

547
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:35,834
I know they're our boys.

548
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,421
Listen. Now, who should we call?

549
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:44,761
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

550
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:49,850
The Peoples Central
Air Defence Headquarters.

551
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:52,228
Where is that, Dimitri?

552
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:54,438
In Omsk. Right.

553
00:43:55,481 --> 00:43:56,774
Yes.

554
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,736
You'll call them first, will you?

555
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,157
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

556
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:09,038
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

557
00:44:11,124 --> 00:44:15,253
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

558
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:19,174
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

559
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,721
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

560
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,764
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

561
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:28,768
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

562
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,770
So we're both sorry, all right?

563
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:32,272
All right.

564
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:37,778
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

565
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:52,044
What?

566
00:45:10,731 --> 00:45:13,567
What? What is it? What?

567
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:16,696
The fools. The mad fools.

568
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:20,241
What's happened?

569
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,661
The doomsday machine.

570
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:25,288
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

571
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:30,795
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

572
00:45:30,836 --> 00:45:33,089
All human and animal life?

573
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:50,275
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

574
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:55,154
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

575
00:45:55,238 --> 00:45:59,785
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

576
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:05,875
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

577
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:10,338
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

578
00:46:10,422 --> 00:46:13,883
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

579
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:16,304
and not without good reason.

580
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:20,016
Oh, yes.

581
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:25,146
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

582
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:29,484
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

583
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:34,489
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

584
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:39,662
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

585
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:43,041
Why, do you realise that...

586
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:46,170
70% of you is water?

587
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:47,713
Good Lord.

588
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:52,885
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

589
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:56,556
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

590
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,392
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

591
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:11,989
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

592
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:16,453
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

593
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:19,831
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

594
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:24,879
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

595
00:47:25,964 --> 00:47:29,801
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

596
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:31,803
Do you know what it is?

597
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:35,015
No, no, I don't know what it is.

598
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:39,019
Do you realise that fluoridation...

599
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:41,939
is the most monstrously conceived...

600
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:44,776
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

601
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,159
Two can play at that game, soldier.

602
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:01,002
That's nice shooting, soldier!

603
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:27,531
Mandrake, come here.

604
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:29,617
You calling me, Jack?

605
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,161
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

606
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:38,168
I haven't had very much experience...

607
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:41,046
with those sort of machines.

608
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:44,925
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

609
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:48,638
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

610
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:53,477
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

611
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,355
the string in my leg is gone.

612
00:48:57,397 --> 00:49:01,193
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

613
00:49:01,276 --> 00:49:05,198
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

614
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:10,995
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

615
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,251
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

616
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:18,253
so that in ten months...

617
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:21,423
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

618
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:24,469
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

619
00:49:24,552 --> 00:49:28,682
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

620
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:33,771
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?

621
00:49:33,854 --> 00:49:37,942
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

622
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:41,112
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

623
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:43,615
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

624
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:48,287
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

625
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,664
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

626
00:49:50,747 --> 00:49:55,169
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

627
00:49:55,253 --> 00:49:58,798
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

628
00:49:59,882 --> 00:50:02,553
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

629
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:06,265
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

630
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:08,892
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

631
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,896
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

632
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,232
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

633
00:50:14,316 --> 00:50:18,236
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

634
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,571
Automatically?

635
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,241
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

636
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:25,411
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

637
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:30,124
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

638
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,169
There are those of us
who fought against it.

639
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:34,296
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

640
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:38,925
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

641
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:44,223
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

642
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,851
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

643
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:50,188
of what we have been spending on defence
in a single year.

644
00:50:50,229 --> 00:50:54,693
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

645
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:56,695
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

646
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:00,115
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

647
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,036
Our source was The New York Times.

648
00:51:03,078 --> 00:51:06,998
Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

649
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,542
A moment, please, Mr. President.

650
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:15,716
Under the authority granted me...

651
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:19,929
as director of weapons research
and development...

652
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:24,226
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

653
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:26,520
by the Bland Corporation.

654
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:29,731
Based on the findings of the report...

655
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:35,321
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

656
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:39,242
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

657
00:51:39,283 --> 00:51:42,705
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

658
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:51,756
Mr. President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

659
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:56,219
of even the smallest nuclear power.

660
00:51:56,303 --> 00:52:00,224
It requires only the will to do so.

661
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:05,104
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

662
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:07,523
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

663
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:11,611
Mr. President,
it is not only possible...

664
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,655
it is essential.

665
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:18,160
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

666
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:23,416
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

667
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:26,085
the fear of attack.

668
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:31,091
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

669
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:35,054
which rules out human meddling...

670
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:39,099
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

671
00:52:39,183 --> 00:52:41,269
and simple to understand...

672
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:45,023
and completely credible
and convincing.

673
00:52:45,106 --> 00:52:48,443
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

674
00:52:48,526 --> 00:52:52,114
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

675
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:55,993
It's remarkably simple to do that.

676
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:59,581
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

677
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:02,000
there's no limit to the size.

678
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,294
After that, they are connected...

679
00:53:04,378 --> 00:53:08,382
to a gigantic complex of computers.

680
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:14,180
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

681
00:53:14,263 --> 00:53:17,725
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

682
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:21,855
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

683
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:25,025
Hmm. Strangelove?

684
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:29,155
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

685
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,533
He changed it when he became a citizen.

686
00:53:31,574 --> 00:53:34,577
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

687
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:39,041
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

688
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:45,297
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

689
00:53:45,381 --> 00:53:48,927
is lost if you keep it a secret!

690
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:51,179
Why didn't you tell the world?

691
00:53:51,263 --> 00:53:55,642
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

692
00:53:55,726 --> 00:53:59,063
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

693
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:49,786
Stay with me, Mandrake.

694
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:57,670
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

695
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:32,582
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

696
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,710
We're okay here.

697
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:40,383
Mandrake, do you realise that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

698
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:44,053
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

699
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:49,143
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

700
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:50,477
Ice cream.

701
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:52,980
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

702
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:55,482
You know when fluoridation
first began?

703
00:55:56,525 --> 00:55:58,445
No, I don't, Jack.

704
00:55:58,528 --> 00:56:00,989
1946.

705
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:03,825
1946, Mandrake.

706
00:56:03,908 --> 00:56:08,205
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

707
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:11,584
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

708
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:17,174
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

709
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:20,510
without the knowledge
of the individual.

710
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:22,512
Certainly without any choice.

711
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:27,643
That's the way a hard -core Commie works.

712
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:32,273
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

713
00:56:32,357 --> 00:56:35,026
When did you first become...

714
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:37,863
Well, develop this theory?

715
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:41,200
Well, l...

716
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:44,828
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

717
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:46,915
during the physical act of love.

718
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:52,962
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

719
00:56:53,004 --> 00:56:55,590
feeling of emptiness followed.

720
00:56:55,674 --> 00:56:59,428
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

721
00:57:00,846 --> 00:57:02,473
Loss of essence.

722
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,854
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

723
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:10,857
Women sense my power...

724
00:57:12,067 --> 00:57:14,194
and they seek the life essence.

725
00:57:15,488 --> 00:57:18,825
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

726
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,786
But I do deny them my essence.

727
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,706
Yes, yes, Jack.

728
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,514
Cease fire!

729
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:02,497
My boys must have surrendered.

730
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:04,917
There it is.

731
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,794
Jack, listen.

732
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:10,214
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and...

733
00:58:12,342 --> 00:58:15,179
Those boys were like my children.

734
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:18,807
Now they let me down.

735
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,601
No, not a bit.

736
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:23,437
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

737
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,024
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

738
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:28,818
every man jack of them, Jack.

739
00:58:28,902 --> 00:58:31,571
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

740
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:33,948
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

741
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,952
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

742
00:58:37,036 --> 00:58:39,830
Look at me, Jack. Look.

743
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:44,001
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

744
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:47,464
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

745
00:58:47,506 --> 00:58:49,800
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

746
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:52,344
Not a thing, Jackie.

747
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:54,722
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

748
00:58:54,806 --> 00:58:58,476
Well, Jack, the time's running very...

749
00:58:58,518 --> 00:59:01,604
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

750
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,774
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

751
00:59:03,857 --> 00:59:06,944
Did they torture you?

752
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:10,030
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by theJapanese.

753
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:11,782
Not a pretty story.

754
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:13,450
What happened?

755
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:17,831
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

756
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:20,125
Well, what happened was...

757
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:23,587
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

758
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:28,050
I was laying train lines
for the bloodyJapanese puff-puffs.

759
00:59:28,092 --> 00:59:31,345
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

760
00:59:33,055 --> 00:59:35,058
No, l...

761
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:39,396
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

762
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:42,566
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

763
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:45,987
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

764
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:53,370
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

765
00:59:56,373 --> 00:59:59,710
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

766
01:00:00,836 --> 01:00:03,840
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

767
01:00:03,923 --> 01:00:07,177
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

768
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,389
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

769
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:14,352
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

770
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:17,688
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

771
01:00:17,772 --> 01:00:21,275
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

772
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,154
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

773
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,907
You know, Mandrake...

774
01:00:26,948 --> 01:00:30,202
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

775
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:35,124
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

776
01:00:36,959 --> 01:00:38,461
And I think I can.

777
01:00:38,503 --> 01:00:41,756
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

778
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:44,259
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

779
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:48,180
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack...

780
01:00:48,263 --> 01:00:51,141
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

781
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:54,771
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

782
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:58,358
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

783
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:02,780
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

784
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:05,449
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

785
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:08,285
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvellous.

786
01:01:08,327 --> 01:01:11,122
That's what we need: water on
the back of the neck and the code.

787
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:14,793
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

788
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:17,838
I'll try and guess
what the code is...

789
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:38,819
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

790
01:01:38,902 --> 01:01:41,906
We have 109,000 total...

791
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,784
79,000 in the mains...

792
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,662
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

793
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,664
And that works out
to roughly...

794
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,169
seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

795
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:55,755
D.S.O. to Captain.

796
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,924
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

797
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,929
Distance: 60 miles.

798
01:02:04,097 --> 01:02:07,267
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

799
01:02:07,351 --> 01:02:09,269
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

800
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:14,275
Confirmed:
definite missile track.

801
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,402
Commence evasive action right.

802
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:26,330
Missile still closing range.

803
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:30,376
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

804
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:33,213
Lock E.C.M. to target intercept mode.

805
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:36,925
E.C.M. locked to
target intercept mode.

806
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:39,427
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

807
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:43,474
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:50,649
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

809
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:54,236
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

810
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,238
Range: 30 miles.

811
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:02,745
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

812
01:03:10,295 --> 01:03:12,256
Range: 20 miles.

813
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:16,218
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

814
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:18,721
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

815
01:03:18,804 --> 01:03:21,224
Range gate on maximum scan.

816
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:24,185
Range: 10 miles.

817
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:28,189
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

818
01:03:28,273 --> 01:03:31,527
Deflection increasing.
Range: eight miles.

819
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:35,531
Deflection still increasing.
Range: six miles.

820
01:03:35,614 --> 01:03:38,325
Missile still deflecting.
Range: four miles.

821
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:47,335
Range: two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

822
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:49,672
Range: one mile.
Missile detonated!

823
01:03:56,345 --> 01:03:58,431
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

824
01:04:01,852 --> 01:04:03,270
We're losing power!

825
01:04:11,738 --> 01:04:14,074
Re-select essential power!

826
01:04:14,115 --> 01:04:16,159
Essential power re -selected.

827
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,710
The hatch is stuck!

828
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:29,716
Hit emergency power!

829
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:35,055
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

830
01:04:41,771 --> 01:04:45,066
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

831
01:04:45,108 --> 01:04:47,402
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

832
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:01,126
Fuel valves three, four and six!

833
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:15,099
Give me full power!

834
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:30,575
Peace on Earth.

835
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:37,916
P.O.E.

836
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,836
Purity of Essence.

837
01:05:40,919 --> 01:05:44,465
O.P.O.E.

838
01:05:55,602 --> 01:05:57,938
Put your hands over your head.

839
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,649
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

840
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:02,568
Put your hands over your head.

841
01:06:02,651 --> 01:06:06,238
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

842
01:06:06,322 --> 01:06:08,325
What do you mean, suit?

843
01:06:08,408 --> 01:06:10,827
This happens to be
an R.A.F. uniform...

844
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:15,207
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

845
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:16,833
Where's General Ripper?

846
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:19,712
He's dead, in the bathroom.

847
01:06:19,796 --> 01:06:21,964
Where's the bathroom?

848
01:06:22,048 --> 01:06:23,466
Next to you.

849
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:35,687
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

850
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:37,899
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

851
01:06:37,941 --> 01:06:40,485
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

852
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:44,239
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

853
01:06:44,322 --> 01:06:46,032
Got any witnesses?

854
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:48,035
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

855
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:50,121
While he was shaving?

856
01:06:50,204 --> 01:06:53,374
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

857
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,918
if that really is your name...

858
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,840
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea...

859
01:06:59,923 --> 01:07:02,926
I think, hope, pray...
what the recall code is.

860
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:05,762
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

861
01:07:05,804 --> 01:07:09,058
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence,"
one of those.

862
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:12,979
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walking.

863
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,275
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

864
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:19,737
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

865
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,323
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

866
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:27,495
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

867
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:28,997
and I hope...

868
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,709
Blast. Blast.

869
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:36,797
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

870
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:40,259
Right.

871
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:43,721
All right, Charlie, I've been
wasting too much time on you.

872
01:07:43,804 --> 01:07:47,601
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walking.

873
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,712
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

874
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:16,966
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

875
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:24,724
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

876
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:28,270
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.

877
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,064
Roger. Navigator?

878
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:35,612
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

879
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,490
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

880
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,910
primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

881
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:46,165
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

882
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:49,669
However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...

883
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:52,463
at weather ship Tango Delta...

884
01:08:52,547 --> 01:08:55,801
grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.

885
01:09:00,597 --> 01:09:03,016
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

886
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,896
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

887
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,982
The radio is gone,
and we're leaking fuel.

888
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:12,485
And if we was flying any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

889
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,573
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

890
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,575
At this height
they might harpoon us...

891
01:09:17,658 --> 01:09:20,745
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

892
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:33,842
The other way.

893
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:36,345
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

894
01:09:38,389 --> 01:09:41,851
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

895
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:43,853
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

896
01:09:43,936 --> 01:09:46,648
I think you're some kind
of deviated prevert.

897
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,443
I think General Ripper found out
about your preversion...

898
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:51,820
and that you were organising
some kind of mutiny of preverts.

899
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:54,282
Now, move!

900
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:57,660
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

901
01:09:57,744 --> 01:10:01,539
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

902
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:06,378
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."

903
01:10:06,462 --> 01:10:08,672
What about the president?

904
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:11,926
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

905
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:14,596
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

906
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:16,890
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

907
01:10:16,973 --> 01:10:19,935
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

908
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:23,731
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

909
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:26,609
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

910
01:10:26,692 --> 01:10:29,570
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

911
01:10:29,612 --> 01:10:33,282
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

912
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:37,371
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

913
01:10:37,454 --> 01:10:41,542
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

914
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:50,009
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

915
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:54,723
Try any preversions,
I'll blow your head off.

916
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:12,200
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

917
01:11:12,284 --> 01:11:14,328
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

918
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:18,291
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

919
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,461
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

920
01:11:22,838 --> 01:11:26,049
Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.

921
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:32,306
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

922
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,310
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

923
01:11:35,351 --> 01:11:38,813
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

924
01:11:50,743 --> 01:11:54,372
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

925
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,333
Have you got 55 cents?

926
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:59,461
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

927
01:12:01,838 --> 01:12:04,717
Operator, look.

928
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:08,304
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

929
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:11,140
Well, what do you call it?
You know...

930
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:14,186
Oh, station-to-station.

931
01:12:18,315 --> 01:12:21,820
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

932
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:27,117
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

933
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,371
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

934
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,499
There may be change in there.

935
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:38,504
That's private property.

936
01:12:38,546 --> 01:12:41,508
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

937
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:44,261
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

938
01:12:44,344 --> 01:12:48,890
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

939
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:52,937
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

940
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:56,649
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

941
01:12:56,732 --> 01:13:00,194
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

942
01:13:00,278 --> 01:13:04,408
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

943
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:08,078
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

944
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,300
This is SAC
Communications Control.

945
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,763
The recall code O.p. E...

946
01:13:23,846 --> 01:13:25,806
is being acknowledged "roger"...

947
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:30,771
by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.

948
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:32,814
These are the details.

949
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:37,444
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

950
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:41,115
are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

951
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:45,787
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

952
01:13:45,828 --> 01:13:47,789
This is SAC Communications Control.

953
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,499
Over and out.

954
01:13:49,582 --> 01:13:51,502
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

955
01:13:51,543 --> 01:13:53,962
Gentlemen.

956
01:13:54,004 --> 01:13:55,964
Mr. President.

957
01:13:56,006 --> 01:13:58,133
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

958
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:01,471
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

959
01:14:01,513 --> 01:14:05,350
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

960
01:14:05,433 --> 01:14:07,477
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

961
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,020
Lord...

962
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:14,819
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

963
01:14:14,902 --> 01:14:17,780
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

964
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:20,492
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil...

965
01:14:20,575 --> 01:14:22,160
Excuse me, sir.

966
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:25,372
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

967
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:36,050
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

968
01:14:36,134 --> 01:14:40,180
Now works out at 2-0-5.

969
01:14:41,223 --> 01:14:43,225
Estimate remaining fuel...

970
01:14:43,308 --> 01:14:47,229
at 8-7-9-0.

971
01:14:50,567 --> 01:14:54,404
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

972
01:14:54,487 --> 01:14:58,533
and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.

973
01:15:05,082 --> 01:15:09,171
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

974
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:11,298
No, I'm certain of that.

975
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,594
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

976
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:18,555
Just a second.
You know what he says?

977
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,892
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

978
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,561
He says according to information
forwarded by our Air Staffs...

979
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,564
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

980
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:32,488
That's impossible, Mr. President.

981
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:34,615
I mean,
look at the big board.

982
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:37,826
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

983
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,789
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

984
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:46,920
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

985
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:50,257
except the four you've shot down.

986
01:15:57,598 --> 01:15:59,976
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

987
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,396
He says their air defence now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

988
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,941
The fourth may only be damaged.

989
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,029
Mr. President...

990
01:16:10,113 --> 01:16:12,490
I'm beginning to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

991
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:16,410
I mean, supposing Kissoff is lying
about that fourth plane...

992
01:16:16,494 --> 01:16:18,664
just looking for
an excuse to clobber us?

993
01:16:18,705 --> 01:16:21,166
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

994
01:16:25,254 --> 01:16:27,840
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

995
01:16:27,924 --> 01:16:31,553
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

996
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:35,849
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

997
01:16:39,103 --> 01:16:41,063
Are you sure?

998
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:46,861
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

999
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,990
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1000
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,242
but they're trained to do it.

1001
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:53,994
It's initiative.

1002
01:16:55,704 --> 01:16:58,583
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:16:58,624 --> 01:17:01,794
and I'm sure your entire air defence
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:17:04,964 --> 01:17:09,553
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

1005
01:17:11,096 --> 01:17:16,393
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1006
01:17:16,435 --> 01:17:20,690
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

1007
01:17:20,774 --> 01:17:23,026
I am not...
I am not getting...

1008
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:25,528
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

1009
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:27,490
That's all.

1010
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:30,618
Now look, if our Air Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:17:30,701 --> 01:17:34,663
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

1012
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:36,165
You gotta believe it!

1013
01:17:36,248 --> 01:17:39,961
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word...

1014
01:17:40,045 --> 01:17:43,381
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:17:43,465 --> 01:17:45,091
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:17:45,175 --> 01:17:48,763
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

1017
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:58,774
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:02,986
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:05,531
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:09,536
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:13,456
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:18:13,498 --> 01:18:15,333
not at 2-0-5.

1023
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,670
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:19,880
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

1025
01:18:19,964 --> 01:18:23,384
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:26,721
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:28,974
Well, shoot!

1028
01:18:29,057 --> 01:18:33,395
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:18:33,478 --> 01:18:35,480
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

1030
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,994
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:18:47,035 --> 01:18:50,831
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

1032
01:18:50,914 --> 01:18:55,712
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

1033
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:59,674
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:18:59,716 --> 01:19:01,843
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:19:01,926 --> 01:19:05,890
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:11,687
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

1037
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:14,732
Give me a rough heading just as soon
as you get it worked out.

1038
01:19:26,913 --> 01:19:31,793
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:19:31,876 --> 01:19:35,714
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:39,510
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

1041
01:19:39,593 --> 01:19:41,011
All right, Dimitri.

1042
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:44,807
General Turgidson...

1043
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:48,102
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

1044
01:19:49,813 --> 01:19:52,273
Mr. President,
if I may speak freely.

1045
01:19:52,315 --> 01:19:55,945
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

1046
01:19:56,028 --> 01:20:00,533
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

1047
01:20:00,616 --> 01:20:03,035
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr. Ambassador.

1048
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,705
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

1049
01:20:05,789 --> 01:20:08,917
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

1050
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,877
Can't you stick to the point?

1051
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:14,674
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see...

1052
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:18,928
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1053
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:23,474
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

1054
01:20:23,558 --> 01:20:26,645
Its jet exhaust frying chickens
in the barnyard!

1055
01:20:26,687 --> 01:20:29,815
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1056
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:31,358
Hell, ye...

1057
01:20:56,845 --> 01:20:58,263
Navigator to Captain.

1058
01:20:58,346 --> 01:21:02,851
Approaching target
at distance 1-0 miles.

1059
01:21:02,934 --> 01:21:06,272
Switch from green grid
to target orange.

1060
01:21:06,355 --> 01:21:09,442
Roger.
Ready for final bomb run check.

1061
01:21:09,525 --> 01:21:10,943
- Take over, Ace.
- Roger.

1062
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:18,702
- D.S.O. ready.
- Bombardier ready, sir.

1063
01:21:18,785 --> 01:21:20,996
Bomb fusing, master safety on.

1064
01:21:21,079 --> 01:21:24,167

1072
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:48,527
Bomb arming test lights on,
one through four.

1073
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,279
Engage primary trigger switch override.

1074
01:21:51,363 --> 01:21:54,492
primary trigger switch override engaged.

1075
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:57,119
Track indicators
to maximum deflection.

1076
01:21:57,203 --> 01:21:59,622
Track indicators
to maximum deflection.

1077
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:02,918
Detonator set to zero altitude.

1078
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,754
Detonator set to zero altitude.

1079
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,464
Release first safety.

1080
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,721
First safety released.

1081
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:18,476
- First safety.
- Release second safety.

1082
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,190
Second safety released.

1083
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,110
Second safety.

1084
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,288
Check bomb door circuits
one through four.

1085
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:50,344
Uh, bomb door circuits...

1086
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:53,056
negative function, lights red.

1087
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,726
- Switch in backup circuits.
- Roger.

1088
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:59,771
Backup circuits switched in.
Still negative function.

1089
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,607
Engage emergency power.

1090
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:04,027
Roger.

1091
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:06,446
Emergency power on.
Still negative function.

1092
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,492
Operate manual override!

1093
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:13,662
Roger.

1094
01:23:23,256 --> 01:23:25,717
Still negative function.

1095
01:23:25,759 --> 01:23:28,553
The Teleflex drive cable
must be sheared away.

1096
01:23:28,595 --> 01:23:32,767
- Fire the explosive bolts!
- Roger.

1097
01:23:47,282 --> 01:23:50,953
Still negative, sir.
The operating circuits are dead, sir.

1098
01:23:56,376 --> 01:24:00,296
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm going
down below and see what I can do.

1099
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,729
Stay on the bomb run.

1100
01:24:14,813 --> 01:24:18,984
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1101
01:25:12,543 --> 01:25:15,463
Target orange grid reference checks.

1102
01:25:15,546 --> 01:25:17,840
Target distance: eight miles.

1103
01:25:17,882 --> 01:25:20,010
Roger. Eight miles.

1104
01:25:20,052 --> 01:25:22,387

into orange grid.

1105
01:25:22,471 --> 01:25:24,890
Telemetric guidance computer
into orange grid.

1106
01:25:33,566 --> 01:25:36,110
Target distance: seven miles.

1107
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:39,531
Correct track indicator:
minus seven.

1108
01:25:39,573 --> 01:25:43,202
Roger. Seven miles.
Check G.p.I. acceleration factor.

1109
01:25:43,244 --> 01:25:45,287
G.P.I. acceleration factor set.

1110
01:25:48,707 --> 01:25:51,169
Target distance: six miles.

1111
01:25:51,253 --> 01:25:55,882
Roger. Six miles.

1113
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,645
Target distance: five miles.

1114
01:26:07,728 --> 01:26:11,692
Five miles. Homing alignment
factor to zero mode.

1115
01:26:11,775 --> 01:26:13,777
Homing alignment factor
to zero mode.

1116
01:26:17,364 --> 01:26:19,909
Target distance: four miles.

1117
01:26:19,951 --> 01:26:21,661
Roger. Four miles.

1118
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:24,622
Auto C.D.C. into
manual Teleflex link.

1119
01:26:24,706 --> 01:26:27,292
Auto C.D.C. into

1120
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:40,098
Target distance: three miles.

1121
01:26:40,182 --> 01:26:42,642
Roger. Three miles.

1122
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:46,396
Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1123
01:27:10,173 --> 01:27:11,424
What about Major Kong?

1124
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:43,334
Mr. President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1125
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:46,462
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1126
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:49,424
It would be quite easy...

1127
01:27:51,844 --> 01:27:56,932
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1128
01:27:57,015 --> 01:28:01,855
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1129
01:28:01,938 --> 01:28:06,192
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1130
01:28:06,276 --> 01:28:08,195
could easily be provided.

1131
01:28:08,279 --> 01:28:11,031
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1132
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:14,952
Well, that's, you know...

1133
01:28:15,035 --> 01:28:17,706
Cobalt thorium G.

1134
01:28:27,967 --> 01:28:31,804
Radioactive half-life of...

1135
01:28:33,848 --> 01:28:38,604
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

1136
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:44,943
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1137
01:28:44,985 --> 01:28:47,238
It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.

1138
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,532
Nuclear reactors could...

1139
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,993
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1140
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:55,830
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1141
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,751
Greehouses could maintain
plant life.

1142
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:02,421
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1143
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:06,927
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

1144
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:10,805
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1145
01:29:10,847 --> 01:29:14,518
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1146
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:17,730
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1147
01:29:17,813 --> 01:29:20,691
who stays up and who goes down.

1148
01:29:20,775 --> 01:29:24,695
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr. President.

1149
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:27,616
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1150
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:29,993
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

1151
01:29:30,035 --> 01:29:33,121
to accept factors
from youth, health...

1152
01:29:33,205 --> 01:29:36,334
sexual fertility, intelligence...

1153
01:29:36,417 --> 01:29:38,920
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1154
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:41,256
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1155
01:29:41,339 --> 01:29:45,301
that our top government
and military men be included...

1156
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:50,224
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1157
01:29:56,273 --> 01:29:59,192
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1158
01:29:59,234 --> 01:30:02,070
There would be much time
and little to do.

1159
01:30:03,655 --> 01:30:08,578
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

1160
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:11,414
ten females to each male...

1161
01:30:11,497 --> 01:30:16,128
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1162
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,963
within 20 years.

1163
01:30:19,172 --> 01:30:21,925
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1164
01:30:21,967 --> 01:30:27,056
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

1165
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:30,643
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1166
01:30:30,727 --> 01:30:33,563
No, sir. Excuse me.

1167
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:46,786
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1168
01:30:46,828 --> 01:30:48,955
There would be
no shocking memories...

1169
01:30:48,997 --> 01:30:53,668
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1170
01:30:53,752 --> 01:30:56,631
combined with a spirt of...

1171
01:30:56,672 --> 01:30:59,133
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

1172
01:31:16,653 --> 01:31:18,571
Doctor...

1173
01:31:20,782 --> 01:31:26,205
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

1174
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:29,416
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

1175
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:33,295
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1176
01:31:33,379 --> 01:31:37,008
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

1177
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:38,426
Regrettably, yes.

1178
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:43,890
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1179
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:48,938
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1180
01:31:50,731 --> 01:31:52,650
service along these lines...

1181
01:31:52,733 --> 01:31:56,530
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1182
01:31:56,572 --> 01:32:00,367
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1183
01:32:00,409 --> 01:32:04,247
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1184
01:32:05,415 --> 01:32:06,875
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:09,919
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

1186
01:32:09,961 --> 01:32:13,924
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

1187
01:32:13,966 --> 01:32:16,927
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

1188
01:32:16,969 --> 01:32:19,889
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1189
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,724
I agree, Mr. President.

1190
01:32:21,765 --> 01:32:25,395
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

1191
01:32:25,437 --> 01:32:30,066
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

1192
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,111
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1193
01:32:33,153 --> 01:32:35,990
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1194
01:32:36,073 --> 01:32:38,576
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

1195
01:32:38,659 --> 01:32:40,620
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

1196
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:43,790
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1197
01:32:43,874 --> 01:32:47,961
Mr. President, we must not allow
a mine-shaft gap!

1198
01:32:48,045 --> 01:32:50,130
Sir!

1199
01:32:50,214 --> 01:32:52,466
I have a plan...

1200
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,346
Mein Fuhrer...

1201
01:32:56,429 --> 01:32:59,015
I can walk!
