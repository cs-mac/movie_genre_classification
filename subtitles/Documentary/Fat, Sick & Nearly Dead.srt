1
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,172
Hello.

2
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,950
I have a new body for you.

3
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,282
Seven days?

4
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,950
No problem. I'll store it for you.

5
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,560
But you have to give me a deposit.

6
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,624
I'll meet you at the same time,
same place.

7
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,958
7 DAYS LATER

8
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,809
Let me go before I tell everyone...

9
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,611
...that you make money
from dead bodies!

10
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,448
Make money from dead bodies!

11
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,256
Doctor! Doctor!

12
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,055
Quick. Inject her.

13
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,498
No!

14
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,326
I've already told you
that practice makes perfect.

15
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:44,765
It's fish maw soup.
Here, let me get you some.

16
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:06,221
Hello. It's me.
Why haven't you picked it up yet?

17
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,822
<i>You have to wait.
I am not ready yet.</i>

18
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,552
Not ready?

19
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,096
But it's been seven days.
There could be a problem with the body.

20
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,928
<i>You sell the bodies.
You must know what needs to be done.</i>

21
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,435
<i>There were never any problems before.
Our customers were always content.</i>

22
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,237
But there could be a problem
with your order.

23
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,775
<i>Calm down. I've already paid for it.
Just wait for me at the usual place.</i>

24
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,910
Let's get married.
Love Tahwaan

25
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,627
Doctor Tar.
Let's take a look at some wedding rings.

26
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,567
Excuse me.

27
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,308
This is Nook, my sister.

28
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,709
You can go now.

29
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,153
Don't even think about her.

30
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,946
Next we will be presenting the award
for doctor of the year.

31
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,051
Please welcome Doctor Tar
to the stage...

32
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,984
...who will receive his bouquet
from Professor Yo.

33
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,460
Doctor Tar is not only
doctor of the year...

34
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:54,258
...but is also deeply loved
by the staff of this hospital.

35
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,518
Are you going to the ceremony?
Look at all that makeup.

36
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,713
What's wrong with
a little makeup for work?

37
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,053
So this is what 100,000 Baht tastes like.

38
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,967
How many days has it been?

39
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,729
Has what been?

40
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,896
How many days has she been dead?

41
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,974
Today is the seventh day.
Why do you want to know?

42
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:47,518
Did you know the dead always return to
the one they love on the seventh day?

43
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,655
If she knew that you wanted
to take Doctor Tar from her...

44
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,291
...she would come for you
tonight for sure.

45
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,256
Are you out of your mind?

46
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,590
Anyway, what could she do?
It's almost midnight.

47
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,393
And even if she did try something,
with this little time...

48
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,833
...I'm sure she would
come for you first, Aeh.

49
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,404
You'll know soon enough.

50
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,380
<i>Why get married?</i>

51
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>What do you get in return?</i>

52
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,517
<i>Will you get married
And become</i> a <i>servant</i>

53
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,720
<i>Or will you just tend to his garden?</i>

54
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,646
Low class scum
should stay where they belong.

55
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,931
You...

56
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,894
You...

57
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,953
Do you know you're the most
beautiful girl in the world?

58
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,923
No, you're the most beautiful.

59
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,658
No, it's you.

60
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,393
You're the most beautiful.

61
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,832
You're the most beautiful.

62
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,404
You are.

63
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,404
You are.

64
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,476
Close your eyes.

65
00:08:55,935 --> 00:09:01,214
That hurts.
Now it's my turn. Close your eyes.

66
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:29,046
- Let's play ghosts under the covers.
- Come on.

67
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,146
Let's play it.
I'm under the covers already.

68
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:38,187
Stop acting so sweet, the pair of you.
It's time for work.

69
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,486
What are you laughing at?

70
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,928
- I won.
- The loser must pay a forfeit.

71
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,121
What kind of forfeit?

72
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,357
- I’ve given you my heart.
- You missed me and grazed my head.

73
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,001
- Now you give me yours.
- Here.

74
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,467
Quickly. One more time.

75
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,832
Here.

76
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,736
- It went over there.
- You're all crazy.

77
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,806
If you don't love us then don't look.

78
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,917
- But if you do look you will love us.
- But if you do look you will love us.

79
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,719
<i>Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man</i>

80
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,952
<i>Bake me a cake as fast as you can.</i>

81
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,633
Fifty-five.

82
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,972
Fifty-six.

83
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,310
Fifty-seven.

84
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,476
Fifty-eight.

85
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,548
Fifty-nine.

86
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,316
Sixty.

87
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,061
So sexy!

88
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,726
Go away!

89
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,462
Whatever.

90
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,799
You cannot eat yet.

91
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,409
Do you want to become a fat pig?

92
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,537
I'll keep an eye on your weight
for you. Get out of here.

93
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,084
Shit.

94
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:01,931
Hey. Hey. Let me go.

95
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,218
Thanks, Tuwangwit.

96
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:09,328
You know people who are born
under Virgo shouldn't work in hospitals.

97
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,599
Why not?

98
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,605
It's a kind of conflict.

99
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,368
What conflict?
What do you mean?

100
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,103
You have to stay virgins.

101
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,272
- Oh, I see.
- Get it?

102
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,042
Can I borrow your telephone
for a moment, ma'am?

103
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,552
- Of course you can. Here.
- Thank you.

104
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,616
Just a second.

105
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,650
Hello.

106
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,696
You old fart. You just can't
control yourself around young girls.

107
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,231
- Hello.
- You insane bitch.

108
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,636
Why did you do that?
You're out of order.

109
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,935
Sorry. Excuse me.

110
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,601
Who are you? Who are you?

111
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,905
Your damn husband.

112
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,072
I'm afraid my husband died
five years ago. Who are you?

113
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,615
Excuse me, ma'am.

114
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:05,391
Ms. Samornsri, please forgive me.
I dialed the wrong number.

115
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,078
Damn it.

116
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,753
What do those two emblems mean?

117
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:46,669
Everything has a cycle.
It symbolizes eternity. Do you like it?

118
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,237
It's cool.

119
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,531
One, two. Pose.

120
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,765
One more. One more time.

121
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,802
Me too.

122
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,237
All of me.

123
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,811
Look this way. Yes, just like that.

124
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,365
Nook. Help us, Nook.

125
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,238
Nook. Please help us, Nook.

126
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,675
Nook. Help us.

127
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,276
Nook. Help us.

128
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:19,078
Nook. Nook. Nook. Help us, please.

129
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,748
Nook. Nook. Nook.

130
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,302
Aeh.

131
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,590
Aeh.

132
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,731
Aeh.

133
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,511
Aeh?

134
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,586
No, doctor. This isn't the right place.

135
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:14,024
If the dead want to be jealous,
that's up to them.

136
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,200
How could you do that to me?

137
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,437
You're my sister. My sister!

138
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,978
Are you going to
stay away from my doctor?

139
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,744
Answer me.

140
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,548
I told you to answer me.

141
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,582
You like this, don't you?

142
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,091
Is this what you want?

143
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,060
You like it, don't you?

144
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,364
I'm carrying the doctor's child.

145
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,802
You!

146
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,409
Why do you
care about him so much?

147
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,637
He'll never marry you anyway.

148
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:53,685
Let me go. I'm gonna get her.
This is none of your business.

149
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,691
Let me go. Let me go. Doctor!

150
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,428
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor, help me.

151
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,428
Doctor!

152
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,567
Doctor, you have to marry me!

153
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,997
You promised.

154
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,899
You promised me!

155
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,040
You've lost your chance, Tahwaan.

156
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,374
Let me go.

157
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,205
Let me go!

158
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,675
Let me go...

159
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,874
...before I tell everyone
that you make money from dead bodies.

160
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,713
You make money from dead bodies!

161
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,546
Doctor... Doctor...

162
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,241
What is it, my love?

163
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:34,618
<i>Doctor... Doctor... Tah... Tah...</i>

164
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,884
Tah. What are you talking about, Nook?

165
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,756
<i>Tah... Tah...</i>

166
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:45,960
<i>Tah. Come as quick as you can.
I have a surprise for you.</i>

167
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,901
You have something special
for me today?

168
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:54,976
- You're being very secretive.
- Just come back quickly.

169
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:58,671
<i>Okay. I'm on my way.</i>

170
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,446
- This way.
- No, this way.

171
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,081
Am. Am. Come on. Am. Am.

172
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,060
Am, quickly.

173
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,527
Am.

174
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,568
Am.

175
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,240
Am?

176
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,280
Am.Am.

177
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,650
Where are you, Am?

178
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,555
Where are you?

179
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,195
Is it with you?

180
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,093
Or is it with you?

181
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,960
Wait. Hold on.

182
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,013
- Orn, be careful.
- What is it?

183
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,153
<i>Behind you. Behind you!</i>

184
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,344
Orn!

185
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,786
Orn! Orn!

186
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,321
<i>Off]!</i>

187
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,592
Orn!

188
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,429
Orn.

189
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,730
Help me!

190
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,203
Let go of me!

191
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:30,069
Help me! Somebody help me!

192
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:36,369
Help me! Help me!

193
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,314
No.

194
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,812
Aeh?

195
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:58,999
Am...

196
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,664
Am...

197
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,998
Don't, Am.

198
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,204
Orn.

199
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,897
Hold on.

200
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:16,938
I have to find a way to get this off first.

201
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,240
Nook.

202
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,431
It'll come off after I pull this free.

203
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,634
Nook... Nook. Don't do it.

204
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,710
Nook...

205
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:53,178
- Nook.
- Just one more to go, Aeh.

206
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,680
Nook.

207
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:49,263
Wait for me.

208
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,655
No more.

209
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:49,320
Don't do this to us anymore, Tahwaan.

210
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,796
We didn't mean to.

211
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,699
Let us go.

212
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,967
I'm sorry.

213
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,294
You bitch!

214
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:44,912
<i>No!</i>

215
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,484
- Quick. Inject her.
- Let me go!

216
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:53,355
Orn. She's a person,
not just some dead body.

217
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:05,603
Tell them, Nook. Tell them to stop.

218
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,957
What should we bet on next?

219
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,065
I'm bored of doing it for whiskey.

220
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,428
How about if the winner can ask
anything of the loser?

221
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,433
Are you up for it?

222
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,367
No worries.

223
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:52,476
Damn it.

224
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,343
I've lost again.

225
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,381
What do you want?

226
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,953
You have to promise you'll do it first.

227
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,681
<i>Okay.</i>

228
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,289
Let's get married.

229
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:12,759
You're crazy. I can't marry a man.

230
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,134
Please don't do this to me.

231
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,608
For the sake of a child, please.

232
01:01:08,565 --> 01:01:11,512
Have mercy on me.

233
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,012
<i>Compassion</i>

234
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,642
<i>Will support the world
Compassion</i>

235
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:23,348
<i>Will support the world
Compassion</i>

236
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,222
<i>Will support the world
Compassion</i>

237
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,159
<i>Will support the world</i>

238
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,630
<i>Compassion</i>

239
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:03,676
<i>Will support the world
Compassion</i>

240
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,336
<i>Will support the world</i>

241
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:11,885
<i>Compassion
Will support the world</i>

242
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:17,582
<i>Compassion
Will support the world</i>

243
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,455
I'm scared.

244
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:04,758
Go get the needle.

245
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,661
Orn.

246
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,398
You are so cute.

247
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:17,044
What are you waiting for?

248
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:24,717
Hurry up! Hurry up!

249
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:37,055
Doctor, doctor, doctor!

250
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:40,895
Don't bite me!

251
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:51,843
You are so perfect.

252
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,548
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

253
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:24,571
Doctor, doctor, doctor!

254
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:50,123
See, I am a woman now.

255
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:59,005
You have to marry me now.

256
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,706
What do those two emblems mean?

257
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,608
Everything has a cycle.
It symbolizes eternity.

258
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,512
Tuwangwit.

259
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,580
Call me Tahwaan.

260
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,152
Let's get married.

261
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,023
Tuwangwit.

262
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,035
Marry me.

263
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,876
Nook.

264
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,371
Don't!

265
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,166
I know Tahwaan is about to report us...

266
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:50,140
...but I don't see why we have to do this.

267
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,406
Nook... Nook...

268
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,142
Nook... What's wrong with you, Nook?

269
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,753
Nook. Someone stop them.

270
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,514
Nook...

271
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:24,875
Don't, Nook. Don't.

272
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:31,377
Let's get married.

273
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:39,011
Come on.
Let's get out of here, Nook.

274
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,811
Marry me.

275
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:11,067
