1
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:10,293
In the old times, when my
grandfather was alive,

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,896
our country was weak, and
we once lost our country...

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,033
to our neighbor, Japan.

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:20,504
At that time, there were people
who were trying to get it back.

5
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,408
And General Baek San was their leader.

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,811
At that time, there were also bad
people who stayed close to Japan...

7
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:32,616
and took all the national treasure.

8
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:34,751
- At that moment...
- At that moment,

9
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,231
General Baek San and his men
appeared in front of him,

10
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,924
took all those treasures back,

11
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:43,392
and hid them in a remote area...

12
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,095
deep in the woods.

13
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,598
General Baek San recorded
the location of...

14
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,935
those treasures in three different maps.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,239
However, one betrayer,
who wanted to take...

16
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,809
those treasures for himself
killed General Baek San.

17
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,880
However, the maps weren't found,

18
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:08,151
and the treasures got hidden forever.

19
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:26,036
Hey! Open the door! It's the police!

20
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,874
Open it! Hey!

21
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,810
Hey! Open the door.

22
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,549
Where is the gold?

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,151
He ran away this way.

24
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,220
What?

25
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,022
Hey!

26
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,924
Stop!

27
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,360
- Gosh.
- Hey!

28
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,662
Oh no.

29
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:55,232
Go away.

30
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,036
- You jerk.
- I didn't do anything.

31
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,239
I didn't do anything. Let go of me.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,208
- Let go of me!
- I got you.

33
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,903
Mr. Cheon In Moon.

34
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,207
I bet you've been through a lot.

35
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,463
Let me just ask you...

36
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:28,932
a few questions.

37
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,470
Make yourself comfortable.

38
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,439
Just relax.

39
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,943
Mr. Cheon In Moon.

40
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,279
I know that you were taking care of...

41
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,648
the gold Cheonmun defrauded.

42
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,716
Where is the gold now?

43
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,619
Did your colleagues run away with the gold?

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,289
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,501
I'd like to resolve things...

46
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,394
with a decent conversation.

47
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:01,230
It wouldn't be good for you to piss me off.

48
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,831
Look at my face. I'm not a nice person.

49
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,734
But I really don't know anything.

50
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,138
We didn't even exchange names.

51
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,439
I'm serious.

52
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,008
Then...

53
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,511
who were the men waiting outside the door?

54
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:18,457
- Oh, those men?
- Yes.

55
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:20,550
They hired us.

56
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,419
I don't know who they are.

57
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,121
You jerk, if I ask you
something, you should answer it.

58
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,357
Well, I just...

59
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,859
went there because I heard
I'd get paid a lot.

60
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,928
I'm serious.

61
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,007
You're late.

62
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,811
- Yes.
- Why would they let you work...

63
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:51,014
until late without paying you?

64
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,717
- Where are the kids?
- They are in Min Jae's room.

65
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,654
I guess Dol Mok has a slight cold.
He went to bed early.

66
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,667
You're studying.

67
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,176
He doesn't have a fever. I think he's okay.

68
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,546
Okay. That's a relief.

69
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:27,317
By the way, Dad, someone came
to our house earlier today.

70
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,518
Who was it?

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,421
He said he is the father
of Dol Mok's friend,

72
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,089
but he seemed a little strange.

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,826
He was trying to find out if
Dol Mok and I are brothers.

74
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:38,261
So what did you tell him?

75
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,929
Did you tell him the truth?

76
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:43,533
No. Why would I say that to a stranger?

77
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,171
And he asked me if I knew...

78
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,040
a man named Baek San.

79
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,776
Do you know who he is?

80
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,713
No.

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,549
I don't know him.

82
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,520
Dad, what's wrong?

83
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,389
I said I don't know.

84
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,627
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,163
I let you take care of it
as you sounded so sure.

86
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,864
Now that you lost the
person and the evidence,

87
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,434
there's no way to attack the tycoon.

88
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,902
Say no more.

89
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,172
Just find the evidence.
Otherwise, you'll be finished.

90
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,222
What are you doing, Seong Il?

91
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,791
Just confess the truth or you will be dead.

92
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,928
You are a cop. How can you do this to me?

93
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,630
- I'll sue you for assault.
- Assault?

94
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:51,233
All right. I'll show you
how it's done. Look.

95
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,936
Watch. Watch me.

96
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,705
This is assault.

97
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,678
Hey, you just hit me.

98
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,080
You're a suspect who hit a cop.

99
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,549
I just hit you in self-defense.

100
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,118
So tell me. Who took the gold? Say it!

101
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,353
Stop it.

102
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,699
You jerk, I need to find evidence.

103
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,192
I have to put Chairman Hong in prison.

104
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,162
Do you know what I've been
through in front of So Joo?

105
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,799
My daughter cried a lot.

106
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,668
- Stop it.
- I have to catch that scumbag.

107
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,339
I need the evidence. Who took it?

108
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,173
Who took the gold?

109
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,743
I really don't know anything.

110
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,780
You jerk! Tell me the truth!

111
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,848
You jerk!

112
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,518
My daughter cried a lot
because of that scumbag!

113
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,235
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,005
What?

115
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:07,177
You keep tossing and turning
without falling asleep.

116
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm trying to sleep.

117
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,595
(Chuncheon Police Station)

118
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,776
Is this an interrogation room or an inn?

119
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,945
I'm sorry. I was just
thinking about something.

120
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,613
So did you...

121
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,319
So Joo!

122
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,021
Go wash up and change your underwear.

123
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,324
It shows all over your face
that you're a widower.

124
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,463
Dol Mok, how's your head feeling?

125
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:02,665
I'm okay.

126
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:06,536
Min Jae, you should hurry.
You're on duty today.

127
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,271
I have enough time.

128
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,808
Well, can we move out?

129
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:17,223
I don't think I'll get
paid in this company.

130
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,516
I think I should find another job.

131
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,352
I guess things would be better in Seoul.

132
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,420
What are you talking about now?

133
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,089
What about their school?

134
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,857
They can move to another school.

135
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:31,060
Stop talking nonsense
and just eat your meal.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,406
You've worked hard for more than
two months. You have to get paid.

137
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,099
We are not going anywhere.

138
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,401
Will you move out after I get paid?

139
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,904
You're being ridiculous.

140
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:44,741
Things have just settled for my tofu
business. Why would you say that?

141
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,142
Gosh.

142
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,078
I'm going to school.

143
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,881
Why don't you finish your meal?

144
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:54,751
Gosh.

145
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,819
Dol Mok, eat up.

146
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,162
What's so funny?

147
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,432
That's my food. Why is he eating my food?

148
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,635
Hey, just wait.

149
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,506
Please help yourself.

150
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,642
You must be tired and hungry...

151
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,312
as you were harassed by Dad all night.

152
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,228
Can I really eat this?

153
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,372
You should eat some food and
keep your energies high.

154
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,589
Okay.

155
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,132
What's wrong with you?

156
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:45,868
I have a daughter.

157
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,939
She's the apple of my eye just like you.

158
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,376
She must be staying with
her old grandmother.

159
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,313
I wonder if she's eating well.

160
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:02,819
I don't want to eat alone
when Dad doesn't come home.

161
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,822
My daughter is only four years old.

162
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,925
She must miss her dad so much.

163
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,996
I always hung around with Dad at her age.

164
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,868
Can't you just come clean...

165
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,703
and go home?

166
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,639
How can I do that?

167
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,208
They must have started the job...

168
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,777
just to feed their young children.

169
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:31,647
One of the guys I worked with has two sons,

170
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:33,615
but he didn't get paid for a few months.

171
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,176
His family is about to starve to death.

172
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,489
But why did you do that when you have...

173
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,256
the skills to make gold?

174
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,993
You mean goldsmith?

175
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:48,931
When I was in the prison,
I learned the skill,

176
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,768
so I can live well when I get out.

177
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,302
But who would hire...

178
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,215
ex-convicts like us?

179
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,275
Even normal people get sacked.

180
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,818
Eat some meat.

181
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:12,755
My dad made it, and he's
a really good cook.

182
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,804
You interrogated him all night
and failed to get anything.

183
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,229
And she managed to do it so easily.

184
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,298
She's so amazing.

185
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,801
Who do you think she got it from?

186
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,538
You go and get a list of people
who learned goldsmith...

187
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:31,517
in the prison.

188
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,777
And narrow the list down to
people with a newborn...

189
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,678
and people who have two sons.

190
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,714
Okay.

191
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,650
I should make her a prosecutor.

192
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,519
Or should I make her a judge?

193
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,992
Did you get into trouble again?

194
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,195
What are you talking about?

195
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,198
I know you.

196
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,733
You didn't sleep at all last night,

197
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,602
and you suddenly suggested that we move.

198
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:04,574
You've been sighing deeply like
a steamer releasing steam.

199
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,276
Fess up. What did you do?

200
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,178
It's nothing.

201
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,581
Did you steal again?

202
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:13,048
I didn't.

203
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,350
So just tell me what you did.

204
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,652
Don't you dare think about lying to me.

205
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,689
Tell me right now.

206
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,263
Wait for me.

207
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,935
I said, wait for me.

208
00:12:33,402 --> 00:12:34,937
Why are you going to school so early?

209
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,839
You have to stay in the classroom alone.

210
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,276
But I want to go to school with you.

211
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,479
You should help mom.

212
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,658
I loved it when you held
my hand the other day.

213
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,466
Min Jae.

214
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,140
You rascal.

215
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:15,244
I really like you.

216
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,446
I really, really like you.

217
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:21,751
Catch me if you can.

218
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,557
I caught you.

219
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,459
So...

220
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,897
all of these happened...

221
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,334
because I told you to
file that application.

222
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,306
I started everything because I
wanted to raise Min Jae well.

223
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,108
While I was trying to protect Min Jae,

224
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,680
my friend died,

225
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,751
and his wife died as well.

226
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,290
It all happened because I exposed him.

227
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:03,926
My goodness.

228
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,329
Goodness gracious.

229
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,232
How can this be?

230
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,569
How could you...

231
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,872
keep that to yourself...

232
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,585
and not say a word about it all this time?

233
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,910
They threatened to kill...

234
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:26,749
everyone in our family if this gets out.

235
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
They killed the innocent history teacher...

236
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,723
and turned him into a drug offender.

237
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,992
I can't deal with them.

238
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:40,129
Even so, you should've told me earlier.

239
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,731
You should've told me.

240
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:43,933
What good would it have done if you knew?

241
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:46,935
It was better for me to
take all the burden.

242
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,171
Still, if you told me earlier,

243
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:53,643
I wouldn't have treated Dol Mok so badly.

244
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,345
His parents were sacrificed
instead of Min Jae.

245
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:58,948
Because of us,

246
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,350
he lost his father...

247
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,453
as well as his mother.

248
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,925
I owe my life to him.

249
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,693
What do I do?

250
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,229
What do I do?

251
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,430
The problem is...

252
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,301
that they seem to be suspecting me.

253
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,636
They recently visited the town.

254
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,772
Is that...

255
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,107
Is that why...

256
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:27,743
you suggested that we move?

257
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:29,812
Ha Kyung,

258
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:31,948
I...

259
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,251
I will give you a comfortable life.

260
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:36,819
Let's leave this place.

261
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,055
I have to protect Dol Mok.

262
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:40,823
Otherwise,

263
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,559
when I die,

264
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,562
I can't face my friend.

265
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,873
Poor Dol Mok.

266
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:04,413
I'm back.

267
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:05,548
Hey.

268
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:07,288
Did you find out anything?

269
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,653
There is only one prison
that teaches the goldwork.

270
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,532
Among the ones who got
discharged from that prison,

271
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,725
there is one man with a newborn daughter,

272
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,260
and there are 3 men with 2 sons.

273
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:20,472
Investigate that man with
a newborn daughter first.

274
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,597
Okay.

275
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,101
Ta-da. This is a reward for So Joo.

276
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,401
You like corn dogs, don't you?

277
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:29,938
Wow! You are the best!

278
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:31,907
- Enjoy it. Bye.
- Okay.

279
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:36,488
Let's see. Let's see who the suspect is.

280
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:37,680
Choi Bu Seo.

281
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,048
Lee Jong Yeol.

282
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:40,916
Jang Pan Soo.

283
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,551
Jang Pan Soo.

284
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
(Family members)

285
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,399
Dol Mok? Dol Mok?

286
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,558
Dol Mok? Jang Dol Mok?

287
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,395
Can you see through papers now?

288
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,439
How did you know it was Jang Dol Mok?

289
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,732
Are you stupid? You saw him
at the hospital yesterday.

290
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,613
He's the one who went to
the gold mine with me.

291
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,471
Who is Jang Dol Mok?

292
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,507
It's him.

293
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,375
Who is Dol Mok?

294
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,310
It's me.

295
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:12,314
Dad, I think Dol Mok is...

296
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,383
the kid you were looking for a while ago.

297
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,094
What was his name?

298
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,219
Who are you talking about?

299
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,189
The boy I met in the hospital.

300
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,558
The boy who got gas poisoning.

301
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,404
- Soo Yeon.
- Right.

302
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,930
It's him for sure. I remember it clearly.

303
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,643
I once gave him a candy and a corn dog.

304
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,136
He said the same thing he told me then.

305
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,881
You can give it to me.

306
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,452
Are you Mr. Jang Pan Soo?

307
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,320
No.

308
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,289
You have to bring a power of
attorney if you're not him.

309
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,093
Didn't you get a call from
Prosecutor Yoon Joong Tae...

310
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,420
from Chuncheon District
Prosecutors' Office?

311
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,729
Oh, right.

312
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,532
So that's you. I am sorry.

313
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,135
Will you wait over there?

314
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,221
Where is it?

315
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:29,425
Where is it? Dobong-ri.

316
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,359
Dobong-ri.

317
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,828
Gosh!

318
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:34,262
What are you doing?

319
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:36,498
What is it again? What's wrong?

320
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,399
Didn't you see that this area is
strictly permitted to the staffs?

321
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,702
Stop it. Get out.

322
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,737
What do you want now?

323
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,710
Gosh...

324
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,681
I am sorry for making you wait long.

325
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:59,172
All the records will be computerized
by next year, and it will be faster.

326
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,059
- Give it to me.
- Here.

327
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:05,427
Settle down.

328
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,863
Dol Mok.

329
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,733
You don't need to take the
afternoon classes. Go home.

330
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,902
- Why?
- I don't know.

331
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:15,037
It seems like something
came up in your house.

332
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:16,572
Go.

333
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:28,350
He is registered as his son
in the family register.

334
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,198
Yes.

335
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,790
Soo Yeon, aren't you hungry?

336
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,725
I am not a bad person.

337
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,028
I will look into it.

338
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:52,541
Dad.

339
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:56,345
I remember that man.

340
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,381
He came to the hospital,

341
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:02,418
and he even came to our house.

342
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,919
Right?

343
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,089
Did he see you?

344
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,557
No.

345
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:12,661
He came for me, right?

346
00:20:14,396 --> 00:20:16,198
Why is he following me?

347
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,301
He's trying to take you.

348
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,536
Why would he take me?

349
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,672
Who is he?

350
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:26,008
He is...

351
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,813
After your mother died,

352
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,080
I think your mom's side of the family...

353
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,951
came to take you away.

354
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,920
Right now,

355
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,623
I have your mom and your brother.

356
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,830
Do you want to go with him?

357
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,733
No, I'm scared of him.

358
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,369
I am going to live with you no matter what.

359
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,289
I'll live with my brother and mom too.

360
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,240
Really? Then...

361
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,943
you can't say your old name.

362
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,854
You were never Soo Yeon.

363
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:05,914
Your name is Jang Dol Mok no matter what.
Do you understand?

364
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:10,719
And if you ever meet him again,

365
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,200
you have to pretend that it's
your first time seeing him.

366
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,457
He only saw you when you were young.

367
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,136
He wouldn't be able to recognize you...

368
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,762
if he sees you all grown up like this.

369
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,197
If you look scared just like before,

370
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,099
he will realize you're Soo Yeon.

371
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,502
You understand what I'm saying, right?

372
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:30,239
Yes. But why are you at school?

373
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,575
My teacher told me to go home early today.

374
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:36,378
Did something happen at home?

375
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,947
Should we talk about that on our way home?

376
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:40,949
Okay.

377
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,152
All right.

378
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,756
I heard Jang Dol Mok is Min
Jae's younger brother.

379
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,693
- You didn't know?
- Oh, really?

380
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:54,196
Then was I mistaken?

381
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,099
I always thought Min Jae was an only child.

382
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,936
Well, it's been a long time
since I taught Min Jae.

383
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,205
I might have not remembered correctly.

384
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:06,818
(Certified copy of Jang Dol
Mok's family registry)

385
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,162
According to his family registry,

386
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,579
he is Jang Pan Soo's biological son.

387
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:11,690
Yes, he is.

388
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:13,248
But something doesn't feel right.

389
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,251
The school teacher seemed confused.

390
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,120
I went to his old neighborhood,

391
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,889
but some people thought Min
Jae was an only child.

392
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,093
Well, since it's such a remote area,

393
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:26,167
they didn't know about him in depth.

394
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:32,134
(Certified copy of Jang Dol
Mok's family registry)

395
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,437
Gosh, this is good.

396
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,843
What's up?

397
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,944
How important of a guy is he?

398
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,780
Even the prosecution contacted the office.

399
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,048
How can you ask me to get a copy...

400
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,451
of certified family registry
without any reference?

401
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:51,820
You know this...

402
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:56,525
This is illegal, Seong Il.

403
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,495
I put up with this job...

404
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,340
although the pay is so little...

405
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:05,033
because I want to get that
pension when I get old.

406
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:06,402
That's why.

407
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,880
If something goes wrong, I'll lose my job.

408
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,115
- What are you going to do?
- I know that.

409
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,774
Goodness. Is this how
you're going to play this?

410
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,918
You're not going to give me anything?

411
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:15,610
Hey, I'm buying you a meal...

412
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:18,446
- and I gave you some money before.
- That wasn't much.

413
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,815
Are you serious?

414
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,316
You're so petty.

415
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,720
I don't want you to get hurt.

416
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,256
I knew you would deflect my question.

417
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:34,763
(Date of birth: May 14, 1989
Date of registry: May 28, 1992)

418
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,532
Gosh.

419
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,209
Hey, Dol Mok!

420
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,446
Isn't that rice wine?

421
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:53,415
No. It was just overflowing.

422
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:55,617
Why are you here?

423
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,520
What do you mean, you dummy?
I'm here to see you.

424
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:00,321
Why?

425
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:03,258
I didn't get to thank
you for the other day.

426
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,360
You don't need to.

427
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,264
- Is Hwa Young well?
- Yes.

428
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,211
- You like Hwa Young, don't you?
- No, I don't.

429
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,270
Don't lie. You're getting red.

430
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,105
It's because I drank the rice wine.

431
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,241
There's no need to be embarrassed.

432
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,311
Every boy in our school
likes Hwa Young too.

433
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,612
She's pretty.

434
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,048
I don't like her. I'm going.

435
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:27,349
Hold on.

436
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,920
Wasn't your name Soo Yeon before?

437
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:33,922
What are you talking about?

438
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,026
Why did you roar like a tiger
when you gave me that corn dog?

439
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,629
I didn't want you to cry.

440
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,732
That's what my dad told
me when I was young.

441
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,201
You're talking nonsense.

442
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,404
Can I visit your house
some time in the future?

443
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,740
You won't be able to.

444
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,509
We are going to move anyway.

445
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,411
It was nice meeting you. Bye.

446
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,249
You're going to move?

447
00:25:08,357 --> 00:25:10,192
Min Jae, you have luck with food.

448
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,161
Come in. Sit and have some meat.

449
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,030
What is all this?

450
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:16,999
We are having a party.

451
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,402
- A party?
- Yes. I got a job in Seoul.

452
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:21,862
We're going to move to Seoul.

453
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,206
Min Jae, we are moving to Seoul.

454
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:27,442
It's such a big city. There
are a lot of cars too.

455
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,453
Did you not understand me?
Stop investigating that case.

456
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,819
Sir, this isn't just an ordinary case.

457
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,756
Someone scammed the whole country.
This is a big case.

458
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:44,369
If this happens the right way,
your career will take off.

459
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:47,863
So is that why you beat up a
suspect without an evidence?

460
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,431
Well, that's history.

461
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,899
I'm so close to getting that evidence.
I can almost taste it.

462
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,803
Don't make a big deal out of this.
Stop investigating when I tell you.

463
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,181
Where is this coming from?

464
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,111
- They paid you off, didn't they?
- You jerk.

465
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:05,146
Do you think I'm like you?

466
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,215
Don't lose your job by
making a fuss out of this.

467
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:10,152
Don't start something you can't handle.
Understood?

468
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,356
I think Cheonmun Group must
have gotten a wind of this.

469
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,737
Where is the evidence?

470
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,864
We'll catch them soon since the
suspect has been narrowed to two.

471
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,402
You should only take care
of that, Detective Kang.

472
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,272
I will be in charge of
handling Cheonmun Group.

473
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,781
- Here.
- There you go.

474
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,292
This is so tasty. Hey.

475
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,328
Min Jae. Here.

476
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,265
You ought to learn how
to drink from your dad.

477
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,134
Drink it up.

478
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,140
Why are you looking at me?
It's from your dad.

479
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,910
What?

480
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:18,754
Hey!

481
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,825
- How does it taste?
- It's sweet and delicious.

482
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,428
It's even tastier with the meat.

483
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,696
It's been so long since we had meat.

484
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,931
Gosh, Dol Mok...

485
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:33,135
will be good at drinking now.

486
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,542
Min Jae.

487
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,913
All of us should drink it up.
Let's get this started!

488
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,014
Gosh.

489
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:51,353
Gosh, you're good at drinking too.

490
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,225
Now you are a man. Okay?

491
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:02,864
Hey, get up.

492
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:05,934
Get up and follow me.

493
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:07,569
Get up.

494
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:11,807
Hey.

495
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:16,044
We are going to have at it like a man.
Did you get that?

496
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,556
- Come at me.
- I won't go easy on you.

497
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,247
There's no point regretting it later.

498
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,450
Gosh.

499
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,594
Hey, do you call yourselves men?

500
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,822
How can men talk so much? You punks.

501
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:29,658
Come here.

502
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,934
This feels great.

503
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,338
Who.

504
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:47,776
- Would know - Would know.

505
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,378
- A man's - A man's.

506
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,449
- Crying heart?
- Crying heart?

507
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,619
- His pure love - His pure love.

508
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,623
- Is shaken - Is shaken.

509
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,493
- By the wind - By the wind.

510
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:08,330
- His love is like the reed.
- His love is like the reed.

511
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:12,901
Everyone is trying to collect
gold to save our country.

512
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,237
I also thought hard about this.

513
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:16,805
Darn it.

514
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,108
I thought our country comes first
even if I starve to death.

515
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:23,912
I went out with the wedding
ring your father gave me.

516
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,017
But this turned out to be fake.

517
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,132
Don't laugh, Dol Mok.

518
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:37,659
I lived my life for 15 years
believing that this was real gold.

519
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,929
Mom, I will buy you...

520
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:42,631
a better ring later.

521
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:44,933
So will I.

522
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,402
I will buy you a diamond ring.

523
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:48,770
Sure.

524
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,373
To me,

525
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,713
this gold-plated ring is more precious...

526
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,578
than any treasure in this world.

527
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:58,814
I know too well that...

528
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:02,751
your dad worked on the construction
site for days to buy this.

529
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,921
My memory for this ring is
the value of this ring.

530
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:08,323
You understand what I'm saying, right?

531
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,591
The material of the ring
isn't of importance.

532
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,795
Blood isn't of importance too.

533
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:15,797
You are...

534
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:19,034
my son whom I bore with my heart.

535
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,669
Understood?

536
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,106
Later,

537
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,143
when your dad and I no
longer live in this world,

538
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,912
your family will be only you and Dol Mok.

539
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,549
You two should take care
and cover for each other.

540
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,117
Okay?

541
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,657
What matters the most is...

542
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:47,028
that you two share the same memories.

543
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:50,164
Just like your father and
me living together...

544
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,167
and caring for each other
through thick and thin,

545
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:54,803
you also will build a strong bond.

546
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,573
This is...

547
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:02,577
a gift I give you guys.

548
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:09,217
You should keep what I said in
mind for the rest of your lives.

549
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:11,119
Okay?

550
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,355
Goodness.

551
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:15,923
My little sons.

552
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,460
You're my dear sons.

553
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,263
I would envy nobody!

554
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:24,799
My dear sons.

555
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:33,074
(Cheonmun Department Store)

556
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,020
What brings you here?

557
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,888
I'm Prosecutor Yoon Joong Tae from
Chuncheon Prosecutors' Office.

558
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,489
On the charges of embezzlement,
special larceny, and malpractice,

559
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:53,161
a search and seizure warrant for
your department was issued.

560
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:54,562
You may begin.

561
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:28,697
Have I...

562
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,067
ever made you upset?

563
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,602
What is this without notice?

564
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:36,843
This isn't a personal matter...

565
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:39,474
between me and you.

566
00:32:40,342 --> 00:32:42,911
You committed a crime that
can never be forgiven.

567
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:44,579
Listen.

568
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,049
You know how harsh the
time is for companies.

569
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,320
All the large companies
have gone to the wall.

570
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,057
I had no choice...

571
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:57,926
in order to survive.

572
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:00,562
Is that why...

573
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,163
you siphoned off...

574
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,724
the wedding rings and baby rings
people donated for the country?

575
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,803
Didn't your conscience
feel the tiniest prick?

576
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,673
Don't be so naive.

577
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,677
Conscience feeds nobody.

578
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,123
People can prosper only
when companies prosper.

579
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:20,181
That's nonsense.

580
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,151
I know how greedy you are.

581
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,719
I'm sure you'll still fulfill
your selfish desires...

582
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,555
even if all the people in the nation die.

583
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:29,557
What you're doing is the exactly same...

584
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:32,225
as your father did during the
Japanese colonial period.

585
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:36,264
I think you've crossed the line.

586
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:39,667
Do you think you're flawless?

587
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,437
Kim Chan Gi case.

588
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,674
If people find out you framed an
innocent man as a drug offender,

589
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,478
you'll be doomed as well.

590
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,249
So you're trying to get nasty.

591
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:55,617
Then...

592
00:33:57,552 --> 00:34:01,656
you'll have to explain why you
threatened him and his little kid...

593
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,193
in your villa and killed him in the end.

594
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:07,662
What are you talking about?

595
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,664
He killed himself!

596
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:11,232
It doesn't really matter.

597
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,936
It was your excessive
avarice that made him die.

598
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:19,274
You'll be gravely punished by the law...

599
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,209
and criticized by the public.

600
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,578
Then you will never be...

601
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,781
able to stand on your feet again.

602
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,149
So...

603
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,519
you want to get messy?

604
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:35,023
Do you really think you can beat me?

605
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,093
Let's see if I can beat you...

606
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:40,261
or not.

607
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:47,802
Dad!

608
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,904
Dad!

609
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:51,539
Dad!

610
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:54,876
Catch your breath first, Dol Mok.

611
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:56,411
I found it.

612
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,913
I found General Baek San's treasure.

613
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:03,718
It's here.

614
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,890
I came here to say goodbye to Grandfather.

615
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:11,912
And I happened to look into this.

616
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,996
I found something in here and opened it.

617
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,132
Come here, Dad.

618
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,636
Look. This is gold, isn't it?

619
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,145
This isn't General Baek San's treasure.

620
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,679
Then what is it?

621
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,215
It looks like gold.

622
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,452
I brought it here.

623
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,521
Where did you get this?

624
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,125
Dad,

625
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,361
did you steal it from others?

626
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,164
No way. I didn't steal it.

627
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:53,019
You've heard of gold
collection campaign, right?

628
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,170
Bad people smuggled it...

629
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,315
when it was being transported
to the government,

630
00:35:58,339 --> 00:35:59,941
so I took it.

631
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,543
Still,

632
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,711
you stole it after all.

633
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,249
Right.

634
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,019
General Baek San also took
treasures from the bad people.

635
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,289
You can use this for good things.

636
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,424
Exactly.

637
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,872
You must not talk about this to anybody.

638
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,113
If people find this out, I'll
be arrested by the police.

639
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,744
Promise me.

640
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,081
Let's go.

641
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,551
Come. Good boy.

642
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,659
Why are you coming from there?

643
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:54,495
We came to see if we can find
anything we can still use.

644
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:56,563
Did you tell your teacher?

645
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,532
I did. She said I should...

646
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:01,169
report the district office
first for school transfer...

647
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,003
so that I can be assigned to a new school.

648
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,573
Really? Then we should do
that when we get there.

649
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:08,542
- Where is Mom?
- She went out to sell...

650
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:09,743
the leftover tofu.

651
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,247
Pan Soo, you stole the gold, right?

652
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,016
What are you talking about?

653
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:18,118
It is no good denying it.

654
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,854
We talked to the one who's in police
and the other one who ran away.

655
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:22,991
You were the last to leave.

656
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,802
Then it's you who took it.

657
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,094
Dad, what are they talking about?

658
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:30,031
That's not true. I have no idea
what they're talking about.

659
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,633
You jerk.

660
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,067
Do you have a death wish?

661
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,568
Give it to me right now.

662
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:36,203
What are you doing to my dad?

663
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:37,238
Get off, kid.

664
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,642
He's just a kid!

665
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,511
Give the gold back to me, you jerk!

666
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,380
I let you make a loan,

667
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:48,016
and you steal the gold from us?

668
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:50,551
Do you know who it belongs to?

669
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:53,353
He's out of our league.

670
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,823
He can easily get rid of you on the quiet.

671
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,225
Give me the gold!

672
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:00,028
- Where did you hide it?
- Hey, you are...

673
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,364
We've met at the warehouse.

674
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,933
You were there!

675
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,270
Hey!

676
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:14,442
Stop!

677
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:28,156
Hey,

678
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:29,790
do you know who I am?

679
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,391
I do. You're So Joo's dad.

680
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,227
You're very smart.

681
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,497
Those jerks.

682
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,534
Mr. Jang,

683
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:41,836
we need to talk.

684
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:44,672
- Who are you?
- Just come with me.

685
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:09,664
You stole the gold, right?

686
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,432
Sorry?

687
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,302
No... No, it wasn't me.

688
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,104
Mr. Jang,

689
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,473
I'm a police officer.

690
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,708
If I have my subordinates...

691
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:23,077
ransack your place,

692
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:25,546
I bet we can find it in an hour.

693
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,516
You already have two previous convictions.

694
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,610
Do you want to be put
behind the bars again?

695
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,491
By the way, what interests me...

696
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:40,561
isn't really the gold.

697
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,398
Well, it interests me a little,

698
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:48,169
but I'm more interested
in your son, Dol Mok.

699
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:51,372
No, his name isn't Dol Mok.

700
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:53,074
He's Soo Yeon.

701
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,343
He's the late Kim Chan Gi's son...

702
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:57,178
Kim Soo Yeon.

703
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,550
What's that nonsense? Dol Mok is my son.

704
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:11,158
(Family register, Jang Dol Mok)

705
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,692
It says you adopted Dol Mok...

706
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,096
six years ago in 1992,

707
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,664
doesn't it?

708
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:20,001
There's no need to be bewildered.
We have the same goal.

709
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:23,137
I have a grudge against Hong Il Gwon.

710
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:26,374
Who is that?

711
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:28,509
You don't know him?

712
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,746
Chairman Hong Il Gwon of Cheonmun Group.

713
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,617
Kim Chan Gi's body was
found near his villa.

714
00:40:38,553 --> 00:40:40,320
Someone called me...

715
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,457
saying the kid was abducted back then.

716
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,091
Who was it?

717
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:46,327
I wasn't sure.

718
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,829
It was you, right?

719
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,865
It turned out...

720
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,666
Kim Chan Gi was one of your
middle school friends.

721
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:58,639
You don't need to get scared.
He's really something.

722
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,245
Mr. Jang.

723
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,447
I'm on your side.

724
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,015
Trust me.

725
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,652
Let's work together to get
rid of Chairman Hong.

726
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,790
To do so, I need you to tell me the truth.

727
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,460
About what happened that day.

728
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:30,438
Did you know about this?

729
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,109
Follow me.

730
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:43,851
Min Jae.

731
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:45,620
You lied to me again.

732
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,289
We were moving out as
you got a job in Seoul?

733
00:41:48,456 --> 00:41:50,056
That's not it, Min Jae.

734
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:51,626
I won't believe a word you say now.

735
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:53,928
You've always tried to deceive me.

736
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:56,330
But I trusted Mom...

737
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,766
and felt bad for you.

738
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,169
Even when I got upset because of Dol Mok,

739
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,523
I tried to understand you
because you're my dad.

740
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:06,908
I just put up with it.

741
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:09,443
But I can't believe...

742
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,746
anything you say anymore.

743
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,848
You lied to me that you loved me.

744
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,617
Min Jae, I'm sorry.

745
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:17,952
- Listen to me.
- No!

746
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,421
I'm sick of hearing you're sorry.

747
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:23,858
You've never told me the truth.

748
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:27,094
You're a liar and a thief.

749
00:42:27,194 --> 00:42:28,629
You're impossible!

750
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:33,467
Do you even know...

751
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:36,437
how hard I tried...

752
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,839
to forget that you're a thief?

753
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,376
But...

754
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,313
you just deceived me again.

755
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,850
Min Jae, he took it from bad people.

756
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,320
- What?
- He can take it from bad people...

757
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,655
and use it for good.

758
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:55,990
What's wrong with that?

759
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,259
Stop judging him.

760
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,195
- There are people worse than Dad.
- You punk!

761
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,399
Hey! What are you doing?

762
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,102
So what? Do you want to live like Dad?

763
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:09,870
Do you want to go to prison?

764
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,106
Do you want to be criticized by people...

765
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,808
and give Mom a hard time?

766
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:17,244
Do you know why you don't have friends?

767
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:20,081
That's because of Dad.

768
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,516
Do you know that?

769
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:26,287
Hey! I know you're mad, but
you didn't have to hit him.

770
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,823
It's my fault, not Dol Mok's.

771
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,791
All right. You must be happy...

772
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,960
to have a son who understands you.

773
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,130
I hope you two will live
happily ever after.

774
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:38,265
Why you...

775
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:40,868
Min Jae. Min Jae!

776
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:44,505
Don't cry.

777
00:43:45,006 --> 00:43:46,073
Don't cry.

778
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,343
- What do you think? Isn't it fun?
- Yes, it is.

779
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:52,446
That's very interesting.

780
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,851
Where did you hear that story?

781
00:43:57,418 --> 00:43:58,953
I heard...

782
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,523
Dad. Grandpa is here.

783
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,291
You're here.

784
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,129
I was talking with Hwa Young.

785
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,972
Can I talk to you for a second?

786
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,419
Is that true?

787
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:34,155
Are you trying to put Dad behind bars?

788
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,958
Father committed the worst crime.

789
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,961
Didn't you know that he's
that kind of person?

790
00:44:41,128 --> 00:44:43,197
Why are you taking care of it?

791
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,076
No one wants to do this, so I'm doing it.

792
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,501
It's my dad we are talking about.

793
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,104
You told me the other day.

794
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:53,104
That if you had to choose between
Father and me, you'd choose me.

795
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:55,276
Gosh, you planned this since then.

796
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:58,012
No.

797
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,114
I will never let you do that.

798
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,349
You know how he is.

799
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,351
It may seem like you're holding the cards,

800
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,254
but you never know what will happen later.

801
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:09,389
I wouldn't have started it
if I were afraid of that.

802
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,991
You can't do this!

803
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:12,993
- Shin Ae.
- Do you know...

804
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:16,597
why I've put up with this even
when I was humiliated by Mi Ae?

805
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,867
We won't get anything if we
turn our back on Dad now.

806
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,003
If you don't stop it
now, we will be doomed.

807
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:26,507
Even though I love you, I can't let you...

808
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:29,477
drag Hwa Young down to the bottom.

809
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:47,795
You got Shin Ae involved in this quarrel.

810
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't have time to take every
little thing into consideration.

811
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,541
When you play go, you should
play all your cards just to win.

812
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,207
Joong Tae.

813
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,144
Let's make a deal.

814
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:06,580
We don't have to go down the tube together.

815
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,949
- Make a deal?
- Yes.

816
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,319
I'll turn...

817
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:14,453
20 percent of the company shares...

818
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,358
over to Shin Ae.

819
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,560
And I'll send you...

820
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:22,429
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

821
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:26,500
If I break this promise,

822
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,270
you can break the scandal.

823
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:33,107
You're the one...

824
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,009
who's holding the cards.

825
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:39,446
Do you remember my dad?

826
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:43,617
My grandfather was an independence fighter.

827
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:47,054
But my dad lived as a petty
official for his entire life.

828
00:46:47,955 --> 00:46:50,357
When I married Shin Ae,

829
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:54,061
he couldn't raise his head in front of you.

830
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:56,964
Distinguished family.

831
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:58,833
Great achievements of ancestors.

832
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,503
All things...

833
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:04,805
yielded to money.

834
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:08,509
So...

835
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:11,912
I'm telling you that I'll give you money.

836
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:13,113
No.

837
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,118
I want something bigger than that.

838
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,156
The country is in a mess.

839
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,901
The country is ruined by
the venal and the corrupt.

840
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,595
So even children are stepping
up to save the country.

841
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:30,664
I want to get things right.

842
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:35,001
I won't fail like my grandfather did.

843
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:36,036
To do so,

844
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:39,707
I have to stand on the highest peak.

845
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:43,911
Are you...

846
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:46,313
- thinking about...
- That's right.

847
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:48,916
I want to work in politics.

848
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:54,021
I don't think it will cause you any harm.

849
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,842
You've never told me the truth.

850
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:18,646
You're a liar and a thief.

851
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:20,281
You're impossible!

852
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,451
Do you even know...

853
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,354
how hard I tried...

854
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:29,757
to forget that you're a thief?

855
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,160
Mr. Jang.

856
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:36,797
I'll give you some time until 8pm.

857
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,066
Come visit me with the gold.

858
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:41,035
You can work together with me...

859
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:43,504
to avenge your friend's murder...

860
00:48:44,638 --> 00:48:46,573
or live as a thief for
the rest of your life.

861
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,442
It's your choice.

862
00:48:56,817 --> 00:48:57,818
Did you...

863
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:00,754
talk about Baek San to Hwa Young?

864
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:05,092
Why didn't you tell me
the whole thing before?

865
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,895
I don't understand what you mean.

866
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,430
Hwa Young says...

867
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,132
Baek San had three maps.

868
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,935
You didn't tell me that.

869
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:17,304
Haven't you let it go yet?

870
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,442
I told you to forget about it.

871
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:22,977
Unlike you,

872
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,379
I don't give up easily.

873
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:28,649
This isn't about money.

874
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,251
The quintessence of this country...

875
00:49:32,019 --> 00:49:34,455
that my father worked on
all his life is there.

876
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:36,790
It's the heritage from my father.

877
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:41,528
I will find it no matter what.

878
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,906
Dol Mok.

879
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:55,242
Min Jae is right.

880
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,646
As I found it hard to live...

881
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:03,117
I made a mistake.

882
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,321
I'll bring this back.

883
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:11,625
I need to talk to the police for a while.

884
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:15,229
So you should go home, Dol Mok.

885
00:50:23,637 --> 00:50:26,573
Don't be upset with your
brother that he hit you today.

886
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,809
You should tell him you're sorry.

887
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:33,113
I'll go later and talk to Min Jae.

888
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,481
Okay?

889
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:35,949
Okay.

890
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,319
Okay. Go now.

891
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,735
Detective Kang.

892
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Dad!

893
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:15,789
Pan Soo.

894
00:51:16,023 --> 00:51:17,824
- Hey!
- Dad!

895
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,292
You're under arrest for special larceny.

896
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:22,295
Why are you doing this? I
brought the gold as I promised.

897
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:23,430
Dad!

898
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:24,597
Dol Mok!

899
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:25,632
Stay still!

900
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:29,202
Don't worry, Dol Mok! I will come out soon.

901
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:30,570
Dad!

902
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,840
- Let go of me!
- Dad!

903
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:39,480
What are you doing right now?

904
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:42,549
Mom, didn't you know that dad lied about...

905
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:44,351
getting a job in Seoul?

906
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:49,122
We're in trouble, Mom. Dad was taken away.

907
00:51:49,123 --> 00:51:50,190
What do you mean?

908
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:52,459
- Dad...
- When you steal,

909
00:51:52,893 --> 00:51:54,328
you get arrested.

910
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,531
What are you talking about?

911
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,400
Dad stole again.

912
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:03,871
He stole the gold people
donated to save this country.

913
00:52:04,404 --> 00:52:07,374
- What?
- He was trying to return it.

914
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:10,377
That's why he took it
to the police station.

915
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,080
And they arrested him.

916
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:16,349
Listen. You have to...

917
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,919
pay for what you've done.

918
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,433
It might be a mistake the
first time you do it.

919
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:23,789
But when you do it twice or three times...

920
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,592
Why don't you listen to me?

921
00:52:25,993 --> 00:52:27,694
He was trying to return it.

922
00:52:27,794 --> 00:52:29,072
That's what I am saying.

923
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,498
He did what he should never have done.

924
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,266
So he should pay for it.

925
00:52:33,267 --> 00:52:35,969
What are you doing? Your
father got arrested.

926
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:39,039
Dol Mok, where is it?

927
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,074
Where did he get arrested?

928
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:45,579
Detective Kang.

929
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:49,550
Have a seat.

930
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:54,922
Why did you arrest me? This
is not what you promised.

931
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:58,058
- What promise?
- You said we will work together...

932
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:01,194
to take revenge on Chairman
Hong when I bring you the gold.

933
00:53:01,195 --> 00:53:03,197
Did you have a dream?

934
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,432
Why would I work together with a thief?

935
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,193
And what are you saying
about Chairman Hong?

936
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,504
That's nonsense.

937
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:13,105
You said that while...

938
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,974
showing me Dol Mok's family register.

939
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:16,143
Did I?

940
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,744
Did I?

941
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:19,346
So what about Dol Mok?

942
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,647
What does the family register mean?

943
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:23,350
Tell me. I'll go get people.

944
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,719
Tell me with your tongue.

945
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:28,922
Stop talking nonsense.

946
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,191
I got all the evidence.

947
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:33,160
So just admit the crime.

948
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:34,761
Let me write a report.

949
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,898
Did you steal the gold from
Cheonmun Department Store?

950
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:40,399
The department store reported a burglary.

951
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,068
What are you talking about?

952
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:44,571
I turned myself in because
I trusted your words.

953
00:53:44,871 --> 00:53:47,873
The ones who took the gold
from the storage are...

954
00:53:47,874 --> 00:53:49,509
the loan sharks.

955
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:51,777
You saw it too.

956
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:53,146
Hey, Pan Soo!

957
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,948
You thief, listen carefully.

958
00:53:56,049 --> 00:54:00,053
You stayed in prison for five
years, so you must be quick-witted.

959
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,589
You stole the gold from
Cheonmun Department Store.

960
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,158
Only then you will be extenuated
for turning yourself in.

961
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,426
Do you understand?

962
00:54:08,362 --> 00:54:09,596
I can't do that.

963
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,500
I can't go to prison again
and leave my children.

964
00:54:14,268 --> 00:54:18,171
Why would I take responsibility
for something I didn't do?

965
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:19,940
Do you want me to tell you why?

966
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:23,477
It's for Dol Mok.

967
00:54:25,646 --> 00:54:27,214
If you keep being stubborn like that,

968
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:30,450
I will go to Chairman Hong.

969
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,990
What do you think I will say to him?

970
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,580
I will tell him that Dol Mok is...

971
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:37,524
Soo Yeon, the son of Late Kim Chan Gi.
How's that?

972
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:39,826
Do you know that?

973
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,330
His underling even went
to the district office...

974
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,265
to find out about Dol Mok.

975
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,634
I stopped him from finding out.

976
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,688
What will happen if the
chairman finds out the truth?

977
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:54,274
There's no guarantee that Dol Mok
won't end up like his father.

978
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:35,749
It's not time yet.

979
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:37,751
This is crazy.

980
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:39,919
What nonsense are you saying?

981
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,288
It's not an ordinary crime.
These men stole the gold...

982
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:44,290
donated by little kids.

983
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,359
Detective Kang.

984
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,295
You weren't always righteous, were you?

985
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:51,698
I will give you what you want.

986
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,401
I will promote you to a
first-degree detective...

987
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:56,612
and be responsible for
your daughter's future.

988
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:58,271
I will make sure to keep my words.

989
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:05,045
It's clear that you are no better than me.

990
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:08,348
This deal will put the
chairman in a safe position,

991
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:11,318
and both of us will benefit from it.
Is that it?

992
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:13,520
I clearly said it's not the right time yet.

993
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:17,014
I am going to grow my power,
and when the right time comes,

994
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:19,192
I am going to catch him.

995
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:22,696
It's more fun if you wait until
the fish becomes bigger.

996
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:26,600
Let's stop it between us who has evidence.

997
00:56:26,767 --> 00:56:28,135
Do you know who that man is?

998
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:32,238
He's the man who saved
your child, Jang Pan Soo.

999
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:34,541
Also, he is just a
simple-minded technician.

1000
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:38,011
There are other people who
take care of this stolen gold.

1001
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,817
When you unveil the managers,
the chairman might get exposed.

1002
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,820
We have to stop at Jang Pan Soo.
We have to.

1003
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,355
Sir.

1004
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,391
I am no good man,

1005
00:56:52,893 --> 00:56:54,294
but I can't put the man...

1006
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,931
who saved my daughter
behind bars like that.

1007
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,402
Then you might end up behind bars.

1008
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:05,571
- What?
- Do you think he doesn't know...

1009
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:07,292
that you're in charge of the investigation?

1010
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:09,876
It seems like he already has
a connection with your boss.

1011
00:57:11,144 --> 00:57:13,680
Whether you like it or not,

1012
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:16,316
you already stepped into this filthy world.

1013
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:18,351
Let's think about our future.

1014
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,821
Think about the future of your son...

1015
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:23,241
and about my future dream
of capturing Chairman Hong.

1016
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:27,592
In order to pass through a big mountain,

1017
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,297
you have to bear with small scratches.

1018
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:32,866
We are on the hunt for a tiger.

1019
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,669
Why do we have to worry
about cockroaches too?

1020
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:41,408
- Dad.
- Goodness.

1021
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:44,678
Goodness.

1022
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:47,047
What are you doing?

1023
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:49,816
You're going to smoke again, aren't you?

1024
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,951
Please quit.

1025
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:54,321
Okay. Why are you here?

1026
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:56,656
I've come to see if you are eating well.

1027
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,558
Are you not coming home again?

1028
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:03,463
No.

1029
00:58:03,964 --> 00:58:06,065
Don't be a cop like me.

1030
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,567
Why not? You catch bad people.

1031
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,338
While trying to catch bad
guys, I will turn bad first.

1032
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:12,839
What do you mean?

1033
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,777
It's nothing. What do you want to eat?

1034
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:19,813
Should we go eat tteokbokki?

1035
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:21,013
Is this the right place?

1036
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:22,148
Yes, I am sure.

1037
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,352
Let's go.

1038
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:26,953
It's him.

1039
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:28,154
Dol Mok.

1040
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:29,823
So Joo.

1041
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:32,092
Mister.

1042
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:34,628
You arrested my dad, didn't you?

1043
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:38,865
Why did you arrest him when
he came to turn himself in?

1044
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:41,333
Let my dad go.

1045
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:42,636
What is he talking about?

1046
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:46,206
Did you arrest Dol Mok's dad? Why?

1047
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,442
His dad...

1048
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,145
stole the gold from the
gold collection campaign.

1049
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,624
Are you sure about that?

1050
00:58:54,648 --> 00:58:55,849
No.

1051
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,119
It was other people who stole the gold.

1052
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,822
You came to my place and saw them yourself.

1053
00:59:03,256 --> 00:59:05,868
And Dad only tried to take
those to the police station.

1054
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:07,193
What do you know?

1055
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:09,962
Your dad stole it.

1056
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,065
Sir, then...

1057
00:59:12,365 --> 00:59:15,401
can I meet my husband?

1058
00:59:15,402 --> 00:59:17,613
I need to talk to him and
find out what happened.

1059
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,406
Where is he right now?

1060
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:21,675
According to Dol Mok,

1061
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:24,611
he got caught around here.

1062
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:28,515
Then he was arrested while trying
to return the gold, right?

1063
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,618
Why would you interrogate him?

1064
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:34,120
I can't tell you the reason now.

1065
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,289
Anyway, you can't see him.

1066
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,591
Let them meet, Dad.

1067
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:39,669
I said no.

1068
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:40,827
Why not?

1069
00:59:41,027 --> 00:59:44,364
Aren't you allowed to meet
your attorney and your family?

1070
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,734
How would you know?

1071
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:51,571
Do you think we're playing
and this is your playground?

1072
00:59:53,406 --> 00:59:55,918
- Let's go.
- Wait, sir.

1073
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:57,978
Wait. Gosh.

1074
01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:06,419
What do we do?

1075
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:31,176
What is it?

1076
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,013
It's here.

1077
01:00:38,952 --> 01:00:40,619
- Mr. Jang.
- Mr. Jang!

1078
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,164
Do you admit your charge?

1079
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:43,656
- Please answer me.
- Did you do that alone?

1080
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:44,857
Or is there anyone behind you?

1081
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:46,726
Please make any comment.

1082
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:48,228
I did it on my own.

1083
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:50,897
I did it alone...

1084
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:54,601
out of greed. I apologize.

1085
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,755
- I am sorry.
- You're a filthy thief!

1086
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,581
You pieces of trash!

1087
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:00,149
Mr. Jang who suffered from poverty...

1088
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:02,184
intruded into Cheonmun
Department Store's warehouse...

1089
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,643
and robbed 20kg of...

1090
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:06,913
It's not true. It's a lie.

1091
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:09,849
He said he took it from there...

1092
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:12,152
because bad people tried
to pocket the gold.

1093
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,120
Okay.

1094
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,790
There must be a misunderstanding.

1095
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:18,992
You must know...

1096
01:01:19,526 --> 01:01:22,128
that your father isn't a bad person.

1097
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:25,398
You must wake up.

1098
01:01:26,132 --> 01:01:27,534
He confessed his crime.

1099
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,672
Gosh. Min Jae. Min Jae!

1100
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,305
Give the gold back to me, you jerk!

1101
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:08,241
I let you make a loan, and
you steal the gold from us?

1102
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:11,044
Do you know who it belongs to?

1103
01:02:11,678 --> 01:02:14,114
He's out of our league.

1104
01:02:14,347 --> 01:02:16,816
He can easily get rid of you on the quiet.

1105
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,319
Give me the gold!

1106
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:21,321
Where did you hide it?

1107
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:23,990
We've met at the warehouse.

1108
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,291
You were there!

1109
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:30,029
(Gangwon 36, Na 4785)

1110
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:34,134
It was Gangwon 36, Na.

1111
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:35,802
And 4785.

1112
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,121
(The Good Thieves)

1113
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:57,023
Dol Mok went to the villa?

1114
01:02:57,457 --> 01:03:00,493
I think I've been to that villa before.

1115
01:03:00,627 --> 01:03:03,396
I already laid the blame on
the guy named Jang Pan Soo.

1116
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:06,242
Jang Pan Soo? The thief?

1117
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:08,346
You know the real culprit?
What do you mean by that?

1118
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:11,237
I came here because I
cannot trust the police.

1119
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:12,906
I did steal the gold,

1120
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:14,774
so don't act recklessly anymore.

1121
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:16,910
Dol Mok isn't what matters now.

1122
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,546
You will have to spend
your whole life in prison.

1123
01:03:19,946 --> 01:03:22,148
There's a good reason why your dad...

1124
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:24,250
cares so much about Dol Mok.

1125
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:26,219
I'm sick of Dad and Dol Mok.

1126
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,289
This wouldn't have happened if
you hadn't come to our family.

1127
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:31,991
Min Jae! Min Jae!
