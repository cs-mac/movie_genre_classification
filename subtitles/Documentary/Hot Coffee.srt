2
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,001
You better finish your little
cafe latte there, they'll
never let you in with it.

3
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:19,369
Why not?

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,805
'cause they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,174
Well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.

6
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,463
Pardon me. Excuse us.

7
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:31,548
Oh!

8
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:33,466
Ahh!

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,684
Coffee!

10
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,059
<i>And then,</i>
<i>there is this tonight.</i>

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,064
<i>In albuquerque, an</i>
<i>81-year-old woman has been</i>
<i>awarded $2.9 million</i>

12
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,985
<i>After she sued mcdonald's,</i>
<i>claiming their coffee was</i>
<i>too hot.</i>

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,822
<i>It seems she was holding</i>
<i>a cup between her legs</i>
<i>while driving.</i>

14
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:58,541
I spoke to a lawyer,
we're suing for millions.

15
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,411
Suing, what for?

16
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,379
The coffee was too hot!

17
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,136
I've been thinking of
quitting work here,

18
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,373
And suing big companies
for a living instead.

19
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,842
Suing has become a popular
american pastime,

20
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,244
And I'd like to get in on
some of that easy money.

21
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,649
<i>A college student</i>
<i>sued his college, because his</i>
<i>roommate partied too much.</i>

22
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,052
<i>A florida man sued because</i>
<i>he got a bad haircut.</i>

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,271
<i>Of course, many of</i>
<i>these lawsuits fail.</i>

24
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,657
<i>But you might win.</i>

25
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,676
<i>Stella liebeck did, because</i>
<i>of a cup of coffee.</i>

26
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,703
Every minute they waste on
this frivolous lawsuit,

27
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,756
They're not able to waste on
other frivolous lawsuits.

28
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,460
Like "ooh, my coffee was
too hot!" it's coffee!

29
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,829
The woman, she purchased
the coffee, and she
spilled it on herself.

30
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:57,183
I mean, it wasn't like the
mcdonald's employee took
the coffee, threw it on her.

31
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,185
Now that in itself, then she
would have had a lawsuit.

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,923
It's just, people just are
greedy, and want money, and
they'll do anything to get it.

33
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:12,148
I think many americans
have a, a fundamentally
wrong perception

34
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,900
Of the civil
justice system.

35
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:17,020
They think that the
system is flooded with
frivolous lawsuits.

36
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,604
Jackpot justice!

37
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,824
<i>Predatory</i>
<i>trial lawyers at it again.</i>

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,126
<i>Junk lawsuits</i>
<i>over frivolous injuries...</i>

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,296
<i>Lawsuit</i>
<i>lottery, and jackpot justice,</i>
<i>and frivolous lawsuits.</i>

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,049
These were bumper-sticker
phrases that were easy
to market,

41
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:36,589
<i>And use to move public</i>
<i>sentiment away from a strong</i>
<i>civil justice system.</i>

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,477
The whole issue is, the
industry does not want
the public, generally,

43
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,563
<i>To have access to the courts.</i>

44
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,466
<i>So, there's all of</i>
<i>these devices and methods</i>
<i>that businesses use</i>

45
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,069
To keep consumers out
of the courtroom.

46
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,154
<i>My mother,</i>
<i>at 79, was very active.</i>

47
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>She drove, she drove well,</i>

48
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,359
<i>She very seldom</i>
<i>dropped anything,</i>

49
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,762
She very seldom
spilled anything,

50
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:21,017
And so that, uh,
for her age,

51
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:25,054
At 79 years old, I thought
she was, she was remarkable.

52
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,340
<i>And she had been working</i>
<i>full-time just about,</i>

53
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:29,525
<i>Until about a week before</i>
<i>this all happened.</i>

54
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,024
My name is charles allen.

55
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:49,162
I'd like to introduce my
wife, judy, and her mother,
stella liebeck.

56
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:54,300
The woman who was burned by a
cup of scalding hot mcdonald's
coffee three years ago.

57
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:58,922
She cannot speak due to a
confidentiality agreement
that she signed,

58
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,591
But judy and I have
no such agreement.

59
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,765
I am just xxtoded at
how many people are
aware of this case,

60
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:13,603
And how many people have a
distorted view of the case.

61
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:18,608
It doesn't matter where I am,
or who I speak to, they "oh,
yeah, I know all about that."

62
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,226
Well, what do you know?

63
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:22,612
I got this picture in my mind
that she actually pulled up,

64
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,782
Maybe took the coffee,
and dumped it.

65
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,501
I think she went through
the drive-through.

66
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,003
She was driving the car.

67
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,504
Tried to drive and drink
it at the same time.

68
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,207
And then it might have
popped open and it
spilled on her lap.

69
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,491
Had it between her legs.

70
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,627
Spilled in her lap,
it was too hot.

71
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,911
And then sued mcdonald's

72
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,281
For millions of dollars.

73
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:46,386
And I'll say, "what would
you say if I told you
she wasn't driving?"

74
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,554
"oh no, she was driving!"

75
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,692
"what would you say if I told
you that's the wrong report,
and she was not driving?

76
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,144
"she was in the parking lot.

77
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,364
"she was in the passenger
seat. My nephew was driving."

78
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,069
So we had just dropped off
my uncle at the airport,

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,442
And went to the nearest
mcdonald's that I knew of,
and this was it.

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,080
<i>So, pulled up, she ordered</i>
<i>coffee with her value meal,</i>

81
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,466
<i>And I knew she liked</i>
<i>cream and sugar in it.</i>

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,552
<i>There was no place in,</i>
<i>in my 1989 ford probe.</i>

83
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:23,089
<i>Everything sloped. There were</i>
<i>no cup holders in that car.</i>

84
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,808
Did I get cream
and sugar also?

85
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,809
It's in the bag.

86
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:27,927
It's in the bag?
Yeah.

87
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,145
Thank you.

88
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,733
We pulled out of here
knowing that we...

89
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,519
I needed to get organized
if I was going to be
eating and driving,

90
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,105
And I knew she wanted
to put her cream and
sugar in the coffee,

91
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,526
So, pretty much pulled
right here, almost
exactly in this spot,

92
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:47,447
And handed her her coffee,
or had already done that,

93
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:52,001
And so we just went
about organizing,

94
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:56,522
And a short period after
that, she started screaming.

95
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,042
Wanted to get the top off
to put cream and sugar in,

96
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:03,179
So I put it between my knees
to steady it with this hand,

97
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:06,382
Trying to get the top off,
and it just went "whoo."

98
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,885
Are you going to
show me the burns?
Yeah.

99
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,186
What?

100
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,972
Yeah. Would that
change your mind at all?

101
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,974
Wow.

102
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:19,779
Yes, if I saw injuries like
that, I would definitely take
a different view of it

103
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,064
From what I hear
from the media.

104
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,281
Oh, my gosh!

105
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,739
<i>Excruciating pain.</i>

106
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,044
Uh, I was burned so
severely that, uh, they
didn't think I would live.

107
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,863
I'm a nurse, and I
was horrified

108
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,466
At the type of injuries
that she had sustained.

109
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:44,087
Um, the skin grafts,
and the pieces that
were still ongoing.

110
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:49,008
<i>So it was kind of a shocker,</i>
<i>'cause it's one thing to hear,</i>
<i>but it's another thing to see.</i>

111
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,844
So it was kind of, uh,
"oh my goodness."

112
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:57,233
<i>We could see</i>
<i>the extent of this injury,</i>
<i>so we started saying</i>

113
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:00,436
We need to ask mcdonald's
to pay for this.

114
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:04,524
Under no circumstances
would she ever sue or
do anything like that.

115
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:09,245
We thought that the company
would take care of medical,
and everything would be done.

116
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,765
And chuck and I wrote
the letter to mcdonald's.

117
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,786
<i>The very first</i>
<i>thing we said is, "your</i>
<i>machine must be too hot,</i>

118
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,205
<i>"so look at it, and</i>
<i>fix it, if it's broken."</i>

119
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,873
<i>This must be</i>
<i>an aberration.</i>

120
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,876
<i>"it must be</i>
<i>an aberration. But if</i>
<i>it is your, your policy,</i>

121
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,012
<i>"we ask you to worry</i>
<i>about that policy,</i>

122
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:29,966
<i>"because it...You do not</i>
<i>want to have this happen</i>
<i>to just one person."</i>

123
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,552
<i>And then clearly it can't have</i>
<i>happened to just one person.</i>

124
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,524
We were extremely surprised
when mcdonald's did not

125
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:43,629
Offer more than $800 on
what was at that point a
$10,000 medical problem.

126
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,452
It's one of those things
that's really like,

127
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,237
If you ask people what the top
ten issues they care about,

128
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,040
You know, the economy,
healthcare, education,

129
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,126
The civil justice system never
even makes the top twenty.

130
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:00,279
It's just not in, in most
people's radar screen.

131
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,114
Until something bad
happens to them,

132
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:05,784
And then the first thing that
most americans think is that
they should find a lawyer.

133
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:09,805
When you are hurt by somebody,
harmed in some way,

134
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,593
And the person or the company
that harms you is negligent,

135
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:17,063
Or does this intentionally,

136
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,749
<i>You have a right to hold</i>
<i>that wrongdoer accountable.</i>

137
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,885

<i>civil courts that handle</i>
<i>those kinds of cases,</i>

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,987
<i>And that is our</i>
<i>civil justice system.</i>

<i>of government is one of the</i>
<i>very few places where</i>

147
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:59,004
An average person can
actually go and confront
a big corporation

148
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,357
On somewhat of a level
playing field, you know.

149
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:06,596
<i>The other two branches of</i>
<i>government are dominated</i>
<i>by money, and politics.</i>

150
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,783
The judicial branch is
not, because you can't
wine and dine juries.

151
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:15,404
<i>In the</i>
<i>courts, it's you versus</i>
<i>general motors.</i>

152
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,407
<i>Or it's you versus, you</i>
<i>know, bank of america.</i>

153
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,378
And if you can present your
information and your complaint
in an effective way,

154
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:26,332
You have just as much
likelihood of winning
as general motors does.

155
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,218
There's no other part of the
government where that's true.

156
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:36,309
<i>I got involved in</i>
<i>the liebeck case by way of</i>
<i>invitation from reed morgan,</i>

157
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,378
<i>Who was lead council,</i>

158
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:44,183
And once I met reed, and
met stella liebeck, and
looked at the evidence,

159
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,235
<i>You know, they had</i>
<i>my full attention.</i>

160
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,606
<i>Because the coffee in question</i>
<i>was brewed at temperatures</i>

161
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,277
<i>That would approximate the</i>
<i>temperature in your radiator</i>

162
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:58,164
After you drive from,
you know, from your
office to home.

163
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:04,086
<i>In discovery, we learned</i>
<i>that in the franchise</i>
<i>directives and manuals,</i>

164
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,905
<i>That the franchisee was</i>
<i>required to follow,</i>

165
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:10,760
<i>That they had to have</i>
<i>their, their waters at</i>
<i>certain temperatures.</i>

166
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:18,301
<i>And they said that the holding</i>
<i>temperature should be 180</i>
<i>fahrenheit to 190 fahrenheit.</i>

167
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,037
<i>Hot liquid, whether</i>
<i>it's coffee, or water,</i>

168
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:22,805
<i>Or any liquid like that,</i>

169
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,525
If it's in the range of
180 degrees or hotter,

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,979
If it is in contact with
your skin for more than
just a few seconds,

171
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,448
It will produce
very serious burns.

172
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:35,534
If you're lucky, it'll
produce a second-degree burn,

173
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:39,772
If you're not as lucky,
you will get third-degree,
or full-thickness burns

174
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,191
Requiring skin grafting
and surgery.

175
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:52,585
And if
you add up the, uh, burn
history of mcdonald's

176
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:59,925
Since January of 1983
until March of uh, '92,

177
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,146
It's over 700 burn cases,
and that doesn't surprise
you, does it?

178
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:08,351
I can't say that I'm surprised
or not surprised. I'm, I'm
glad the number's not higher.

179
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,019
All right.

180
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,071
I'm, I'm really pleased that
that's not more than that.

181
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,857
I thought that
was, that was terrible

182
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,193
That he was so indifferent
about it, you know.

183
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:21,163
Uh, even if it was just
one person, that's enough
to pay attention to.

184
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:24,667
I mean, uh, one
person that spoke up.

185
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:28,654
I'm sure there's more
than that, that was
damaged with a hot coffee.

186
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,376
But, uh, it's so easy to
burn at that temperature,

187
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,028
And they were so
indifferent about it.

188
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,547
If you were to take
a sip of that coffee,

189
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,600
Enough to where you could
feel it go down your throat,

190
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,337
You can't do that at 180
to 190 degrees, can you,
because you'll be burned.

191
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:47,423
You better not do that,
you will get burned.

192
00:11:54,097 --> 00:12:00,236
We talked about different
percentages of how much was
her fault versus, you know,

193
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,238
How much was mcdonald's,

194
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:07,543
And we finally came to assign
20% fault to mrs. Liebeck,

195
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:10,195
<i>Because she had initially</i>
<i>spilled the coffee,</i>

196
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:15,968
And we assigned 80% of the,
uh, blame to mcdonald's,

197
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:20,673
<i>Because they had a</i>
<i>very long history of</i>
<i>people being injured,</i>

198
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:26,262
<i>And they were so adamant that</i>
<i>it was such a trivial thing,</i>

199
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,715
<i>That they weren't going</i>
<i>to bother to do anything</i>

200
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:34,170
<i>Other than just continue</i>
<i>to rake in the money</i>
<i>on their coffee sales.</i>

201
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>And the fact that it</i>
<i>was their own records</i>

202
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:40,276
<i>Really damned mcdonald's</i>
<i>as far as I was concerned,</i>

203
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:44,547
<i>Because it was very</i>
<i>obvious that they knew</i>
<i>there was a problem,</i>

204
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,899
And they were ignoring
it completely.

205
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:51,153
Just totally disregarding
the consumers' safety.

206
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:00,880
<i>We looked at the</i>
<i>coffee sales on a daily basis,</i>

207
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:05,885
<i>And we figured about two</i>
<i>days' worth of coffee sales.</i>

208
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,138
We thought that that was,
you know, a fair amount,

209
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,143
And punitive damages we, uh,
assessed at $2.7 million.

210
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:20,800
Punitive damages are
very rare, and they
have a specific purpose,

211
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,503
<i>Which is to essentially change</i>
<i>the behavior of the wrongdoer.</i>

212
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:29,291
Only way you can get
the attention of a big
company would be,

213
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:32,745
To, uh, make punitive
damages against them,

214
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,565
And this was a very small
punitive damage, we thought.

215
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,396
Even though the amount
was reduced later,

216
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,652
I think the initial
award certainly got
everybody's attention,

217
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,971
Not necessarily in
a favorable way.

This was a perfect case
for them, because it looked
like it was frivolous.

233
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:56,145
<i>I had heard</i>
<i>the word "tort reform"</i>
<i>before my mother was injured,</i>

234
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:00,916
But I, I had never really
understood what that meant.

235
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:09,658
A tort is, uh, a pastry,
as far as I know.

236
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,293
It's also some
type of funding

237
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,264
That the federal government
has done, uh, for bailout
money, I believe.

238
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,949
Oh, I thought
that was tarp.

239
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,300
No, I think it's tort.

240
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,519
Uh...
I have no
idea what a tort is.

241
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,322
A tort is a piece of...

242
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,192
It's a...I think a tort
is a piece of bread

243
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:32,448
That looks like a
hoagie roll, but
isn't a hoagie roll.

244
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:37,503
So a tort is a harm,
it's, it's a, when
someone commits a tort,

245
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,071
They have harmed
you in some way.

246
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,173
I've heard the statement,
"tort reform."

247
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,458
Do you know
what it means?

248
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,593
No.

249
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:49,581
Tort reform would mean
trying to clean up, the, the
logistics of suing people,

250
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,750
Or, or trying to make
it easier or harder.

251
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm not quite sure which way
tort reform tends to work.

252
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:59,725
Well, tort reform is a term
drummed up by some of the
advertising people for the uh,

253
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,310
<i>Business sector,</i>

254
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:04,947
<i>Which is, to limit the</i>
<i>likelihood that you</i>
<i>can bring a lawsuit.</i>

255
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:10,669
It is, essentially, laws
that restrict people's
rights to go to court.

256
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,738
I don't think that the term...
I'm not going to say it.

257
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:16,458
I, I just won't say the
word "tort reform," the
phrase, that phrase,

258
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:19,912
Because, um, I don't
think that it, uh,

259
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,464
Is an accurate representation
of what's really going on.

260
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:28,003
Ralph nader calls it "tort
deform," so I guess reform is
in the eyes of the beholder.

261
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:33,676
But if you want to change a
system, which had become,
in the late 1970s,

262
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,812
Very, very pro-plaintiff
in the view of some,

263
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:40,766
If you want to change
it, usually the word
"reform" is used.

264
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,654
<i>This big push to</i>
<i>publicize the mcdonald's case</i>

265
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:48,440
<i>Came in the midst of</i>
<i>an attempt to pass</i>
<i>federal legislation.</i>

266
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,777
<i>It was going to limit</i>
<i>the consumer's right</i>
<i>to go to court.</i>

267
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,146
<i>It meant that there were</i>
<i>going to be caps on damages,</i>

268
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,783
That there were gonna be all
sorts of changes in the rules

269
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,485
Of what you could do in order
to bring a case into court.

270
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:03,956
<i>And so there was this</i>
<i>humongous campaign</i>
<i>by industry,</i>

271
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,376
<i>Attempting to affect</i>
<i>juries, but also attempting</i>
<i>to affect senators.</i>

272
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,062
<i>And the mcdonald's case</i>
<i>became the poster child</i>

273
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,681
For what's wrong
with people going to
court and suing.

274
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:17,219
<i>We looked at</i>
<i>the congressional hearings</i>
<i>about the tort reform bill,</i>

275
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,307
And we found that the
most common reference
to justify tort reform

276
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,942
Was the mcdonald's
coffee case.

277
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,944
There were not many
statistical studies.

278
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,230
<i>The primary evidence was,</i>
<i>everybody knows the</i>
<i>mcdonald's coffee case,</i>

279
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,282
<i>Therefore we need tort reform.</i>

280
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:35,154
If a lady goes to a fast food
restaurant, puts coffee in her
lap, burns her, her legs,

281
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,372
And sues and gets
a big settlement,

282
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:41,460
That in and of...Of itself
is enough to tell you why we
need to have tort reform.

283
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,630
And in fact what happened was,
it did pass the senate,

284
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,249
And, uh, president
bill clinton did veto it.

285
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,753
This legislation is
arcane, complex,

286
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,806
It has a lot of legalisms
and loopholes in it,

287
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,812
But the real fact is, it
could have a devastating
impact on innocent americans.

288
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,546
<i>And so</i>
<i>what happened was,</i>

289
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,398
<i>Corporate america sort</i>
<i>of went to a plan b,</i>

290
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,901
<i>So they went to a lot</i>
<i>of state legislatures,</i>

291
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:08,737
And asked the state
legislatures to pass laws

292
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:12,658
That would limit the rights
and remedies of individuals
in various ways.

293
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,228
And they were constantly
on the attack, because
they had so many pr firms

294
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:19,414
That they had hired to go
out and do their work in
the different states.

295
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:23,969
<i>A woman was</i>
<i>awarded $2.9 million in a</i>
<i>lawsuit against mcdonald's.</i>

296
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,405
<i>She spilled hot coffee on her</i>
<i>lap while sitting in her car,</i>
<i>and claimed it was too hot.</i>

297
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:32,410
<i>Every day we hear about</i>
<i>another outrageous lawsuit.</i>
<i>Who pays? You do.</i>

298
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:36,348
<i>Tell the legislature we</i>
<i>can't afford another million</i>
<i>dollar cup of coffee.</i>

299
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:40,402
<i>One of the most</i>
<i>significant pr efforts</i>

300
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:43,355
Was spearheaded by the
american tort reform
association,

301
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,524
<i>Atra.</i>

302
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:51,146
The american tort reform
association is a group of
several hundred businesses

303
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,932
And also colleges
and universities,

304
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,951
And I'm their general counsel.

305
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,270
And they are dedicated
to try to see

306
00:18:58,288 --> 00:19:00,956
That there's a fair and
balanced legal system
in the United States.

307
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,794
<i>The american</i>
<i>tort reform association</i>
<i>was formed in 1986</i>

308
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,748
<i>By about 300 major</i>
<i>corporations,</i>

309
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:14,419
<i>Insurance companies, chemical</i>
<i>companies, oil and gas,</i>
<i>pharmaceutical companies.</i>

310
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>They were going to start</i>
<i>advocating for laws all</i>
<i>around the country</i>

311
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,810
<i>To limit the liability</i>
<i>of all their members.</i>

312
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,980
And so they hired a pr
firm, and they came up
with these groups called

313
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,716
<i>Citizens against</i>
<i>lawsuit abuse.</i>

314
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,118
<i>They were to give</i>
<i>the impression</i>

315
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:34,273
<i>That these were just</i>
<i>citizen groups that had</i>
<i>sprung up spontaneously.</i>

316
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,993
<i>Astroturf groups.</i>
<i>So they looked like they were</i>
<i>grassroots groups,</i>

317
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,246
<i>But they really had no people</i>
<i>in them, they were all run</i>
<i>through the pr firm.</i>

318
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,448
But that's what citizens
against lawsuit abuse was.

319
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,302
The tobacco industry
was actually funding
a lot of this.

320
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:51,290
<i>That they would</i>
<i>funnel money through a</i>
<i>washington, dc law firm</i>

321
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,075
<i>Called covington & burling,</i>

322
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,894
<i>That would then distribute</i>
<i>tobacco money</i>

323
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,165
<i>To some of these citizens</i>
<i>against lawsuit abuse groups.</i>

324
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:04,887
Was there any distortions
by people in the media,
by politicians,

325
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,972
By people who
wanted tort reform?

326
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,142
Sometimes stories were
repeated, and repeated
over and over again,

327
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,177
It happens all the time,

328
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:16,114
That were not, uh, true, or
they were unfounded. I don't
think it was intentional.

329
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,983
Listen to just a few cases.

330
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,987
I hope I won't be repeating
some that maybe have already
been told to you.

331
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:26,191
In california, a man was
using a public telephone
booth to place a call.

332
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:29,461
An alleged drunk driver
careened down the street,

333
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,864
Lost control of her car, and
crashed into the phone booth.

334
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,751
Now it's no surprise that
the injured man sued,

335
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:39,704
But you might be startled
to hear whom he sued.

336
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:43,541
The telephone company
and associated firms.

337
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,727
That's right.

338
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:49,514
There's a telephone booth
on the corner of a very busy
intersection in los angeles,

339
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,768
<i>And this guy was standing</i>
<i>inside, and he saw this</i>
<i>car coming right at him,</i>

340
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,637
<i>And he tried to get</i>
<i>out of the phone booth,</i>
<i>and the door stuck.</i>

341
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,523
And the reason that
this was the fault of
the telephone company

342
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,158
Is that there'd been
lots of other cases

343
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,727
<i>Where this telephone booth</i>
<i>had been hit by cars,</i>

344
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,063
<i>'cause it was in a very</i>
<i>dangerous position,</i>

345
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,784
And it hadn't been
properly repaired, so
the guy couldn't get out!

346
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,953
And so he was hit
inside the phone booth.

347
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,871
He lost his leg. He
was extremely ill.

348
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,908
You know, it was not the
source of real humor the
way reagan had portrayed it.

349
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:18,427
So there were a lot
of stories like that.

350
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:21,213
<i>For me, you know, not being</i>
<i>a lawyer, I'm a journalist,</i>

351
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,217
<i>And I felt like journalists</i>
<i>had just really not done</i>
<i>a good job of covering,</i>

352
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:29,604
And that they had fallen for
lots of public relations ruses

353
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,523
That they should
know better about.

354
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:36,311
There was even a story of
somebody taking a lawnmower
to trim a hedge,

355
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,264
And there was a lawsuit, and
actually it never occurred.

356
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:43,402
So there were some scare
tactics that really didn't
have basis in fact.

357
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,405
I didn't take this job
to sit around and worry
about getting sued.

358
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,323
If we don't stop
lawsuit abuse,

359
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,125
I might not be
able to do my job.

360
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,778
And my job just might
be to save your life.

361
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:56,965
<i>Join the</i>
<i>jury against lawsuit abuse.</i>

362
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,720
It was supposedly just a
group of business people
and community leaders

363
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,788
Who were acting on their
own, when in fact,

364
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,892
It was a carefully
orchestrated campaign,

365
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:11,963
<i>Orchestrated out of</i>
<i>washington, dc with the help</i>
<i>of people like karl rove,</i>

366
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:17,569
<i>Who had their own business and</i>
<i>financial interest in pushing</i>
<i>the agenda of tort reform,</i>

367
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:21,073
<i>And making it look</i>
<i>like it was a totally</i>
<i>spontaneous event.</i>

368
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:27,145
Texas must end the junk
lawsuits that clog our courts
and threaten our producers.

369
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:32,434
<i>In texas in the</i>
<i>mid '90s, you had karl rove,</i>

370
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,703
<i>And then-candidate</i>
<i>bush come along,</i>

371
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,489
And see that there was a
real political advantage

372
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,508
To talking about
so-called tort reform.

373
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,595
Karl rove was, in the
early 1990s, a consultant
for phillip morris,

374
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,963
For the tobacco industry.

375
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,933
He was working for
phillip morris and bush
at the same time.

376
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:51,086
He was on the phillip
morris payroll. So he had a
lot of ties to these folks.

377
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,942
Rove saw that if he used
tort reform, and if his
candidates ran on tort reform,

378
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,277
It would make it that
much easier for him

379
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,263
To open the pockets of
the business community.

380
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:05,400
And then, once governor
bush was elected, uh, it
was katy bar the door.

381
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:09,738
They implemented all of the
things that interests like
insurance companies,

382
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,908
<i>And the health care industry,</i>
<i>and others wanted in texas.</i>

383
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:18,497
And so it's with great
pleasure that I sign a cap
on punitive damages,

384
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:22,167
That will add certainty
to the business climate.

385
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:27,923
And a lot of the people who
had been his biggest financial
backers in texas,

386
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,726
<i>They followed him right to the</i>
<i>white house. So he kept going.</i>

387
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:36,014
No one has ever been healed
by a frivolous lawsuit.

388
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:39,884
I urge the congress to pass
medical liability reform.

389
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:47,359
Our economy is held back by
irresponsible class actions,
and frivolous asbestos claims,

390
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,581
And I urge congress to pass
legal reforms this year.

391
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:56,118
Because lawsuits are
driving many good doctors
out of practice,

392
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,873
Leaving women in nearly
1500 american counties
without a single obgyn,

393
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:06,795
I ask the congress to
pass medical liability
reform this year.

394
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,897
<i>He was</i>
<i>tort-reformer-in-chief.</i>

395
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:13,084
He really brought the issue
to center stage in a way
nobody else had ever done.

396
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:16,054
Too many good docs are
getting out of business.

397
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,424
Too many obgyns aren't
able to practice their,

398
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,426
Their love with women
all across this country.

399
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:25,397
We're a litigious
society. Everybody's
suing, it seems like.

400
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,451
There are too many
lawsuits in america...

401
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:33,104
If you have the right
words that evoke your
whole system of thought,

402
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,223
And your way of
understanding an issue,

403
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:39,127
<i>And when that language is</i>
<i>repeated over and over,</i>
<i>the brain changes.</i>

404
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:42,831
The circuitry gets stronger,
and can become permanent.

405
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:46,885
In my line of work you gotta
keep repeating things over
and over and over again,

406
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:50,288
For the truth to sink in.

407
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:53,625
To kind of catapult
the propaganda.

408
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:55,677
So they would get their
message out there,

409
00:24:55,728 --> 00:25:01,132
<i>And then the public</i>
<i>would pressure their</i>
<i>local legislators</i>

410
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,637
<i>To enact caps on damages</i>
<i>and other kinds of</i>
<i>liability limits.</i>

411
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:08,690
So there was a direct link
between the pr that was done,

412
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,560
<i>And ultimately the</i>
<i>passage of laws.</i>

413
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,259
<i>That's</i>
<i>for everybody?</i>

414
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,293
<i>Yeah.</i>

415
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,494
<i>All right!</i>

416
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:36,501
We got 16 candles we
have to put in here, because
you're 16 years old.

417
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,104
So pick up one.

418
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:45,060
This has to be the top.
Turn it around, so that you
have a hold of this part,

419
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,562
And then you're going
to put it in up there.

420
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,564
Any place you want.

421
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,016
Put it there.

422
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:56,071
Okay, now let me show
you what you need to do,
you need to take...

423
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,822
Don't laugh.

424
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,526
They're not, they're not gonna
laugh. Take a hold of it,
here I'll help you.

425
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:03,628
<i>I had no</i>
<i>idea what tort reform was.</i>

426
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:07,882
I had no idea that there
were caps on damages
here in nebraska,

427
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,435
Um, prior to colin's case.

428
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:14,839
Caps on damages,
I think, is something
that exists when there...

429
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,343
When there is misuse
in the system, so I,

430
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:22,981
I would trust, just as
someone has the right to
access the courts, uh,

431
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:27,402
There should be a body
overseeing it, and
regulating it, and uh,

432
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,521
And that's what a cap is.

433
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,724
A cap is, is public
oversight on abuse.

434
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:36,728
No, it's a, it's a limit
for how much money you
can get from, like,

435
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:40,532
The tobacco company that
killed your wife because
of lung cancer or...

436
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,233
Right.

437
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:45,036
I don't know, you can only
sue your doctor for so
much, right, isn't that...

438
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,089
Right, because there's
abuse, and so you have
to set a limit.

439
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:54,078
One of the most common
so-called tort reforms is
what's called caps on damages,

440
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:58,967
Or limits on the amount of
money that a jury or a judge
can award to somebody

441
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,419
After they've been hurt
and won their case.

442
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:04,973
Their opportunity to
get compensation is
strictly limited.

443
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:10,595
I, I want to be honest with
you, I'm not advocating caps
on malpractice awards.

444
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,651
Which I believe, uh,
I personally believe

445
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,871
Can be unfair to people
who've, uh, been
wrongfully harmed.

446
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,910
Wow, you're
a big helper.

447
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,078
I know that.

448
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:33,134
I was 36 weeks along, um,

449
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:36,287
Pregnant with
identical twin boys,

450
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:42,460
<i>And I noticed the night</i>
<i>before my regularly scheduled</i>
<i>doctor's appointment,</i>

451
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:46,014
<i>That the movement...Normally</i>
<i>when I'd go to bed the,</i>

452
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,400
<i>The babies would be really</i>
<i>moving around a lot,</i>

453
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,269
<i>And I noticed that</i>
<i>they weren't moving</i>
<i>around very much,</i>

454
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:55,156
And I just kind of felt
like, you know, this
is kind of weird.

455
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:59,694
And I, I'm going to the
doctor in the morning,
I'll talk to her about it.

456
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,147
And I went in, and I told her,
and she's like, well let's
listen to the heartbeats,

457
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,333
And she listened
to the heartbeats,

458
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:08,086
And, um, she said, you know,
the heartbeats are normal,

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,072
Every, you know, it
sounds, you know,
everything looks good.

460
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,259
<i>And so, um,</i>
<i>I was reassured...</i>

461
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:28,056
It's really important to
determine how many placentas,

462
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,110
When you're pregnant
with twins, that if
there's only one placenta,

463
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,812
<i>Then it's a high-risk</i>
<i>pregnancy.</i>

464
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:37,482
<i>So when I went in with</i>
<i>my concern on Monday,</i>

465
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,819
It should have been
immediately followed up
with an ultrasound,

466
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,620
And, you know,
a stress test.

467
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:45,407
And had they done that,
they would have seen
what was happening was

468
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,409
The twin-to-twin
transfusion syndrome,

469
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,380
Where one baby starts
getting everything, and the
other baby's getting nothing.

470
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:57,218
<i>Um, the next day, the</i>
<i>movement was less,</i>

471
00:28:57,253 --> 00:29:01,339
And then the, the next day,
the movement was even less,

472
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:04,259
And I became, I started to
become really concerned,

473
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:09,881
<i>And I called the doctor's</i>
<i>office. And, um, we're going</i>
<i>to see dr. Knolla's partner.</i>

474
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,150
<i>He said "come on, let's</i>
<i>go do an ultrasound."</i>

475
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:16,070
<i>And he showed the</i>
<i>heartbeat of one of the</i>
<i>babies, and it was so slow,</i>

476
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,239
<i>It was, like, almost</i>
<i>gonna stop.</i>

477
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:22,226
And he said, you know,
"there's not a lot of fluid
around one of the babies,

478
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,579
"and we need to deliver
the babies right away."

479
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:47,886
<i>Colin suffered, uh,</i>
<i>severe brain damage to</i>
<i>all areas of the brain.</i>

480
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,105
They just said that it must
have been from a lack of
oxygen or, or whatever,

481
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,276
But they didn't really
say how it happened
or why it happened,

482
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:58,813
Or give us any
further background,

483
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:03,651
And I guess that kind of led
us to keep asking questions,
and keep looking for answers.

484
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:07,956
Well, I've got one son that's
perfectly normal, he's a,
you know, a normal child,

485
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,293
<i>And I've got one son who has</i>
<i>severe brain damage, and they</i>
<i>were born at the same time.</i>

486
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:14,462
<i>You know, what happened here?</i>

487
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:17,281
The gourleys also never
knew that before they went
to see dr. Knolla,

488
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,167
She'd been in court before.

489
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,387
Sued two other times,
both for malpractice.

490
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,790
<i>According to court</i>
<i>records in 1987 and 1989,</i>

491
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:28,927
<i>Dr. Knolla was accused</i>
<i>of botching two pelvic</i>
<i>operations.</i>

492
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:33,130
<i>It appears both cases</i>
<i>were settled secretly,</i>
<i>but legally, out of court.</i>

493
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:40,688
<i>At trial, it</i>
<i>came out that the injury was</i>
<i>caused by a lack of blood flow</i>

494
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,391
<i>From the placenta</i>
<i>through the cord,</i>

495
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,711
And oxygen depletion
of the brain for five
to eight minutes

496
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,146
<i>Is what caused the damage.</i>

497
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:52,817
So not knowing,
I mean looking back,

498
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:56,254
All that time was so
critical, you know.

499
00:30:56,288 --> 00:31:00,592
It was, I mean had they
just, you know, delivered
him right away...

500
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:07,015
<i>And the nurses testified</i>
<i>that the doctor had called</i>
<i>over to the hospital</i>

501
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:11,052
<i>And they'd had the or</i>
<i>prepared and ready, but</i>
<i>the doctors weren't there.</i>

502
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,605
<i>You know, you just start</i>
<i>thinking all these things,</i>

503
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,026
And why didn't they do
an ultrasound on that
Monday, you know?

504
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,544
And then, you know,

505
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:24,616
<i>I went through, for</i>
<i>about three years, of</i>
<i>"why didn't I just ask?"</i>

506
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,570
You know, I kind
of blamed myself,

507
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,371
<i>For a while, um,</i>

508
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:38,046
you know,
but you, you just want
to change what happened,

509
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,916
And knowing that it
was preventable.

510
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:49,924
<i>The economists at</i>
<i>the time said that he</i>
<i>would need $6 million,</i>

511
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,060
<i>At the time of the trial,</i>

512
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:55,763
<i>For him to have enough</i>
<i>money to take care of him</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

513
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:00,652
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

514
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,894
<i>In most instances</i>
<i>when you have a lawsuit where</i>
<i>a cap statute is involved,</i>

515
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,931
The jury doesn't know
that there's a cap statute.

516
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:35,436
So if the jury renders an
award which is higher than
the cap statute,

517
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,722
<i>The trial judge,</i>
<i>after the trial,</i>

518
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:41,209
<i>Then reduces the verdict</i>
<i>to the amount of the cap.</i>

519
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:45,780
And so it actually,
it takes away the
power of the jury

520
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:50,618
To make a determination as to
what a fair and reasonable
amount should be for damages.

521
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,820
That's in the bill of rights,

522
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:56,040
That juries, not legislators,

523
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,960
Get to determine questions
of fact in the court room,

524
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:03,831
And one of the most important
issues of fact decided in
a civil jury trial

525
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:08,553
Is what the appropriate
damages are to compensate
someone who has been injured

526
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,506
Due to the fault of another,
you would agree with that?

527
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,807
I don't
disagree with that.

528
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:17,595
So, so why does the
u.S. Chamber spend
so much money

529
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:22,150
Trying to convince us
that we know more

530
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:25,803
About the value of
someone's injury or death

531
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:28,472
Than the people who
elected us to congress,

532
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,993
Who go into jury boxes
all over this country,

533
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:34,829
Under the seventh amendment
to the bill of rights?

534
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:39,483
<i>The judge ruled that</i>
<i>the cap here in nebraska</i>
<i>was unconstitutional,</i>

535
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,788
That, um, it violated your
rights to a jury trial.

536
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,775
<i>And then the doctors</i>
<i>and the insurance company</i>
<i>appealed the case</i>

537
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,877
<i>To the nebraska supreme court,</i>

538
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:56,100
And the nebraska supreme
court came back and found
the cap constitutional.

539
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:59,003
I've been involved in
the tort reform issues in
nebraska for a long time,

540
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:02,339
But most recently as a
member of the professional
liability committee

541
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:04,559
Of the nebraska medical
association,

542
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,946
And subsequent to that,
the colorado physicians
insurance company,

543
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,733
Which is the major malpractice
carrier for this region.

544
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:15,670
<i>In nebraska, we have a total</i>
<i>cap that includes all damages,</i>

545
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:18,256
Whether it be economic
or non-economic damages.

546
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,410
So caps on damages can be
three kinds. There can be
caps on punitive damages

547
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:23,861
<i>In some states,</i>

548
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,647
<i>There's caps on non-economic</i>
<i>damages in many states,</i>

549
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:30,301
<i>And in a very, very few</i>
<i>states there could be caps</i>
<i>on the entire amount</i>

550
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,503
<i>That a plaintiff can get.</i>

551
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,339
Economic damages, you can
think about those as your
out-of-pocket cost.

552
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:38,192
<i>They're your health care</i>
<i>expenses, your lost wages,</i>

553
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:44,432
And non-economic damages
are for pain, suffering, the
loss of enjoyment of life,

554
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:48,219
The harm that's been done
to them that is difficult
to measure in money.

555
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:50,321
But there needs to
be some reason,

556
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,907
When it comes to
non-economic damages
in the system.

557
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:59,614
And that's why I've proposed
a hard cap of $250,000 on
non-economic damages.

558
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:07,889
<i>I think a cap</i>
<i>on non-economic damages of</i>
<i>$250,000 makes some sense</i>

559
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:12,293
For most of the states in the
United States, 'cause there's
such a soft and squishy type

560
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:16,547
Of, of, of, damages, and
difficult to determine, I
think that makes some sense.

561
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:20,852
It's an arbitrary number
that bears no relationship

562
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:24,055
To the harm that the
plaintiff suffered,

563
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:29,377
And also, it has a
disproportionate impact on
people in certain situations.

564
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:34,415
<i>If you've been</i>
<i>blinded, permanently disabled,</i>
<i>disfigured in some way,</i>

565
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:38,236
Or you're a woman and your
reproductive system has
been harmed in some way,

566
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,739
Those injuries are
non-economic in nature,

567
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,458
And someone deserves to
be compensated for that.

568
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:45,710
Okay, guys.

569
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,430
Colin? Colin.

570
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:50,414
Boo!

571
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:55,219
<i>They're identical twins,</i>
<i>but there's nothing really</i>
<i>very identical about 'em.</i>

572
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,789
<i>I mean conner's a, pretty</i>
<i>much a normal boy,</i>

573
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:02,810
I mean he grew up and
played baseball and soccer,

574
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:06,264
<i>And, you know, just did</i>
<i>what boys normally do,</i>

575
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,900
<i>And colin on the other</i>
<i>hand, he grew up,</i>

576
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,269
<i>The first surgery, I think,</i>
<i>was when he was, was he one?</i>

577
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,520
<i>One.</i>

578
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,438
<i>One. He had, he</i>
<i>had to have eye surgery.</i>

579
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:18,409
There was optical nerve
damage in the brain injury.

580
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,245
It was part of the
brain injury. So he, he
doesn't see real well.

581
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,497
<i>And then he started</i>
<i>having to go to therapy,</i>

582
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:25,867
<i>When he was about two,</i>
<i>I think we started</i>
<i>taking him to therapy?</i>

583
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,251
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

584
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,537
<i>And that was</i>
<i>pretty intense,</i>

585
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:31,923
<i>And they finally got</i>
<i>him to where he could</i>
<i>hold his head up,</i>

586
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,541
<i>And then where</i>
<i>he could sit up.</i>

587
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:38,796
<i>Then as he, he grew</i>
<i>older, he's obviously</i>
<i>mentally delayed.</i>

588
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,047
He's...

589
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:42,383
He, he didn't even know
the days of the week.

590
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:48,522
The jury heard the evidence,
and they said okay, well,

591
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:53,561
We're, 5.6 million, I think,
is probably what they, what
he needs, and that was close,

592
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,679
<i>We could've made that work.</i>

593
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,899
<i>I mean, that would have been</i>
<i>enough money that he'd have</i>
<i>people to take care of him,</i>

594
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,502
<i>If we're gone, or whatever.</i>
<i>He would have been okay</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

595
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:07,024
And then the cap comes
in and says, "no, no, no,
no, that's not right."

596
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,026
You get this amount of
money and then, you know,

597
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,746
Pay your lawyers out
of that, and pay your,
some medical bills,

598
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:15,532
<i>And so colin ends up</i>
<i>with a few hundred</i>
<i>thousand dollars.</i>

599
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,387
<i>And so what happens is then,</i>
<i>he goes onto medicaid,</i>

600
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:23,641
And the taxpayers have to pay,
pick up the bill for his care.

601
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:26,143
Dad. Dad!

602
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:27,178
What?

603
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,596
It's falling apart.

604
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,881
It is. Is it getting
your hand all dirty?

605
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,783
No.

606
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,069
Oh, it is broke, look at that.

607
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:39,857
<i>It's not just an</i>
<i>economic need, there are</i>
<i>moral issues involved here.</i>

608
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:44,328
And what a cap does is,
it relieves the wrongdoer,
often a company,

609
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,014
Or a health care provider,

610
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:51,585
<i>Of the responsibility</i>
<i>they have for the damage</i>
<i>that they caused.</i>

611
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,171
Medical groups like the
nebraska medical association

612
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:56,907
Applauded the nebraska supreme
court's decision Friday.

613
00:37:56,925 --> 00:38:00,577
They say it will keep
malpractice insurance
costs down for doctors,

614
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:03,047
And that, in turn, will
keep down medical costs.

615
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:05,416
When states enact
caps on damages,

616
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:09,570
<i>Doctors' insurance premiums</i>
<i>typically do not go down.</i>

617
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:14,041
<i>And it's</i>
<i>interesting that when these</i>
<i>various limitations</i>

618
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:16,894
Are enacted in various states,

619
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:21,782
There's never a requirement
that the insurance companies
pass any savings along

620
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:23,484
To the policy holder.

621
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,237
The insurance companies
are charging still,
I think, a lot of money

622
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:30,408
To doctors in nebraska, and
they're not having to pay out
very much money in nebraska.

623
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:33,911
So what are they,
they're making, it's
their little pot of gold.

624
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,414
The insurance industry says,

625
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,583
"well don't look at us,
it's not our fault that
rates are going up.

626
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:44,388
"it's all those juries and
judges and lawyers and, and
victims that are suing us.

627
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,340
"it's all their fault."

628
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,394
Those excessive jury
awards cost us all money,

629
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,065
And it's part of why, rising,
why there's rising costs, uh,

630
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,851
In the health care,
health care system.

631
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,187
If it was true that medical
malpractice litigation

632
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:01,739
Actually drove up
health care cost,

633
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,326
Then we would expect
that since 2003, when
basically nobody,

634
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,497
<i>No patient was allowed to</i>
<i>hold a doctor or hospital</i>
<i>accountable anymore, in texas,</i>

635
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:13,367
We would expect that health
care costs, heath care
spending would go down.

636
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,819
Well, in fact, the
opposite is true.

637
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,204
<i>Health care spending has</i>
<i>been going up in texas,</i>

638
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,156
<i>At a rate higher than</i>
<i>the national average</i>

639
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:22,460
<i>Since we restricted</i>
<i>patients' rights to</i>
<i>access the courthouse.</i>

640
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,513
So, the myth just doesn't
jive with reality.

641
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:32,887
<i>Over these years there's</i>
<i>a whole lot of things that</i>
<i>I want to say about caps,</i>

642
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:35,639
And, and to say just
how they've affected us

643
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,692
Doesn't really, um,

644
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:41,112
I don't know, it doesn't
really hit the nail on
the head so much.

645
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,564
I mean, it affected us
obviously, I mean we have a,

646
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:50,154
We have a, a son who will
never be able to grow up
and earn his own living,

647
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,856
<i>Never go off to college,</i>
<i>never have his own family.</i>

648
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:55,859
<i>I mean, he'll require care</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

649
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:58,496
And so, how does
the cap affect you?

650
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,833
It, it makes his
future unknown.

651
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:08,522
I mean, you have this person
that you're responsible for,
and that you love,

652
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:13,811
<i>That you don't know, if</i>
<i>you're gone, what's going</i>
<i>to happen to him.</i>

653
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,518
I mean, if it's your
child, take your child,
and say you're gone,

654
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,571
And give him to the state,
and let the state do whatever
they want with him.

655
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,356
And, is that what you
want for your child?

656
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,776
That's not what I
want for my child,

657
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,079
Especially when your child
can't ever grow up and take
care of themselves.

658
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:35,065
They're relying on people
to take care of them.

659
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,335
So, that's how the
cap affects you.

660
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,371
I know that.

661
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,539
Do you want
to come to the table?

662
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,957
No.

663
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,593
<i>In many</i>
<i>respects, these laws violate</i>

664
00:40:45,627 --> 00:40:48,546
<i>State constitutional</i>
<i>provisions that protect</i>
<i>people's rights.</i>

665
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:54,034
<i>And, in order to protect</i>
<i>those new laws against</i>
<i>challenge in the courts,</i>

666
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:57,304
The business community decided
that it was important to them

667
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,090
To stack the deck
in their favor,

668
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,227
Um, with the supreme
courts of various states.

669
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,280
They wanted their
own set of judges who
would be deciding

670
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:10,317
Whether these
restrictions on people's
rights would be upheld.

671
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,553
Watch out, snick.
Watch out, snickers.

672
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,677
<i>My grisham books.</i>
<i>Some of them, anyway.</i>

673
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,848
When was this, this was
written, uh, two years ago,

674
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,067
John decided to
write  <i>the appeal.</i>

675
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:47,271
He talked to me about it,
'cause he wanted me
to help him get the,

676
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,972
Get the details
right in the book.

677
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,158
He likes the books
to be accurate.

678
00:41:51,193 --> 00:41:55,863
It's about, it's interesting,
because it's about uh, it sort
of tracks what I went through.

679
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:59,149
It's about a mississippi
supreme court justice
running for re-election,

680
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:04,121
And, uh, being, uh, attacked
by these out-of-state big
business interest groups

681
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:08,175
That are coming in, trying
to defeat the incumbent
supreme court justice,

682
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,796
So that they can get their
corporate interests on the,
um, you know, on the court.

683
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,682
So, yeah.

684
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:20,437
<i>As the</i>
<i>legislature would try to</i>
<i>effect tort reform,</i>

685
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,689
<i>If it did get into law,</i>

686
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:24,007
Then it came down to
the courts to decide

687
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,110
Whether or not that law
was constitutional.

688
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,512
And, there started to be
decisions around the country

689
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,448
<i>That said that these laws</i>
<i>were not constitutional,</i>
<i>that they went too far.</i>

690
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:34,118
<i>So then,</i>
<i>the businesses decide,</i>

691
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,237
Well we can't pass those laws,

692
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:40,157
What we can do is to
try and have judges who
decide these cases

693
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,993
Be really conservative,
business-oriented judges.

694
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,697
<i>Karl rove developed</i>
<i>this plan, and worked with</i>

00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,370
They put in place a pretty
aggressive campaign,

697
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:56,206
<i>Ranking which states are most</i>
<i>important for them to be in,</i>

698
00:42:56,241 --> 00:43:00,094
<i>And putting tens of millions</i>
<i>of dollars a year into these</i>
<i>elections that often had</i>

699
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,146
Tiny amounts of money.

700
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,383
<i>I started getting</i>
<i>calls from karl in the</i>
<i>middle-to-late 1980s,</i>

701
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:10,554
As he began his
work representing,
at the beginning,

702
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:13,524
State supreme court
candidates in texas.

703
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,909
<i>Rove was able to put together</i>
<i>a franchise, basically,</i>

704
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:20,397
<i>To elect republicans who</i>
<i>he was representing,</i>

705
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:24,535
<i>With a guarantee that</i>
<i>they would have</i>
<i>well-financed races,</i>

706
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:29,123
And business interests got
supreme court judges who were
going to rule their way

707
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:32,509
<i>On business cases,</i>
<i>and on tort cases.</i>

708
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:37,748
<i>By the time you reach</i>
<i>the 1990s, this core of</i>
<i>conservative, republican,</i>

709
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:39,583
<i>Tort-minded judges</i>

710
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:44,655
Were ruling overwhelmingly
for some of the largest
corporate interests in texas.

711
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:53,514
It's a model that they
used, and they exported
to other states.

712
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,982
<i>It's a good payoff.</i>

713
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:58,052
<i>It's a good payoff. You put</i>
<i>money in a judicial race, uh,</i>

714
00:43:58,086 --> 00:44:02,489
You spend $100,000 to help
uh, uh, challenge a, a
judicial candidate,

715
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,108
It can have literally
a million dollar impact
on your company.

716
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:09,463
And it seems that that's
happening more and more
throughout the country.

717
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:14,618
<i>That, uh, our state supreme</i>
<i>courts are reversing civil</i>
<i>juries in this country</i>

718
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,471
<i>At an unprecedented level,</i>

719
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:20,474
After seeing the gifts
of millions of dollars.

720
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:23,960
Last week, the supreme court
reversed a century of law

721
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:27,514
That I believe will open
the floodgates for
special interests,

722
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,967
Including foreign
corporations,

723
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,469
To spend without
limit in our elections.

724
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,770
<i>If you get five</i>
<i>people, in our state we have</i>
<i>nine, so the majority is five,</i>

725
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:55,659
You get five judges that
have that persuasion to be
always with the doctors,

726
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:57,995
Or be always with
the corporations,

727
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,464
<i>You have court reform.</i>

728
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:05,035
And that is more deadly
than tort reform ever
thought about being.

729
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,405
<i>That's what this karl rove</i>
<i>chamber is about,</i>

730
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,858
<i>And they came into</i>
<i>these southern states,</i>

731
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:14,611
And mississippi was a good
state to take on, because
it's a small state,

732
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,480
<i>Not much money,</i>

733
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:20,851
<i>And u.S. Chamber put in</i>
<i>candidates that were</i>
<i>friendly towards them,</i>

734
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:25,539
And they were able to elect
all of them except for one,

735
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:27,825
And that was
oliver diaz's election.

736
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,995
<i>The appeal</i>
<i>was a book I published,</i>

737
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,199
It's a novel, it's
completely fictional, and
it's completely true.

738
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:41,755
Uh, it's the story of the, uh,
purchasing of a supreme court
seat in mississippi.

739
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:45,476
I felt like I kind of lived
through it with oliver,

740
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,545
You know, knowing, because
he was my friend, knowing
what he had gone through.

741
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:59,940
<i>I was born and raised</i>
<i>in biloxi, mississippi.</i>

742
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,877
<i>Lived there all of</i>
<i>my life, and then</i>
<i>went to law school,</i>

743
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:07,898
<i>And after law school,</i>
<i>came back home and started</i>
<i>practicing law there,</i>

744
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:13,069
And in 1987 was elected
to the mississippi house
of representatives

745
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:15,506
And, and started a career
in politics at that point.

746
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,341
I was his campaign
manager.

747
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:31,271
You had these interest
groups that were interested
in electing judges

748
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:33,807
That they deemed to
be pro-business.

749
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:37,361
<i>I was not deemed</i>
<i>to be pro-business,</i>

750
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:41,064
And the u.S. Chamber
mounted a very, very large
and expensive campaign

751
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,233
Against me in 2000.

752
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:46,286
<i>Diaz</i>
<i>even voted to overturn</i>
<i>a cocaine conviction</i>

753
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:49,406
<i>Because evidence of a prior</i>
<i>cocaine sale was allowed.</i>

754
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,860
<i>Oliver diaz. Very</i>
<i>bad judgment.</i>

755
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:56,063
The negative ads are still
running, and that, that part
has not changed,

756
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,582
The, the ads are still
on the television.

757
00:46:58,616 --> 00:46:59,967
It's, it's a terrible
situation.

758
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,835
It is demeaning to the office.

759
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:06,723
It is improper, it should not
have happened. I've, I've told
judge diaz that I've, uh,

760
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:08,425
Done all I can do to
get those stopped.

761
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,460
I don't like it.

762
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:12,479
<i>My opponent, who</i>
<i>was supported by the</i>
<i>u.S. Chamber of commerce,</i>

763
00:47:12,514 --> 00:47:16,600
He had probably
a million dollars
spent on his behalf,

764
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:17,935
Which was not even...
Oh,
it was more.

765
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,302
Yeah, it was more than
a million dollars,

766
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,155
<i>Spent on his behalf, but</i>
<i>it wasn't in his name,</i>

767
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,409
<i>And he didn't report that on</i>
<i>his campaign finance reports.</i>

768
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:28,478
<i>You know,</i>
<i>people think, "oh, the</i>
<i>u.S. Chamber of commerce,"</i>

769
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:33,283
They think of it
representing small chambers
on a national scale.

770
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,503
That really isn't what the
u.S. Chamber of commerce is.

771
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:38,088
So what's the u.S.
Chamber of commerce?

772
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,490
um, I'm
not really sure.

773
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:42,492
Something dealing with
the government.

774
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:48,849
It was my understanding that
it was a government agency,
but I'm not sure of that.

775
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:54,221
Probably they are
getting engaged in,
hmm, managing of...

776
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,840
something.

777
00:47:56,858 --> 00:48:00,527
Trade? Do they engage in
managing trade throughout
the United States?

778
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:01,762
I'd go with that.

779
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:28,305
The u.S. Chamber of
commerce became a very,
very important player

780
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,223
<i>In the tort reform movement,</i>

781
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:35,145
And they have now been
shown to be funneling money
into judicial campaigns.

782
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,931
Here's, here's the way that
campaigns happen, okay?

783
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:43,219
<i>You have your doctors,</i>
<i>hospitals, manufactures,</i>
<i>insurance companies,</i>

784
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:46,156
<i>You got all those folks</i>
<i>kind of quarterbacked by</i>
<i>the chamber of commerce.</i>

785
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,557
<i>That's where the money is.</i>

786
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>There's nobody on the other</i>
<i>side except for trial lawyers,</i>

787
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:54,898
<i>Because the trial lawyers</i>
<i>know the law, and they know</i>
<i>what's going to happen</i>

788
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:56,783
If these judges are elected.

789
00:48:56,834 --> 00:49:00,037
We were playing by a certain
set of rules, there were
campaign finance laws

790
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:03,840
<i>That you had to know where</i>
<i>the money was coming from,</i>

791
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,577
<i>And there were limits on</i>
<i>some of the amounts of</i>
<i>money by who gave it.</i>

792
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:10,631
The trial lawyers are
limited as to how much
money they can put in.

793
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:15,969
<i>If you give more than</i>
<i>$5000, a judge can't</i>
<i>sit on your case.</i>

794
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,355
<i>Whereas if the money</i>
<i>comes from the chamber,</i>

795
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:20,524
<i>All that money was packaged</i>
<i>into a large group,</i>

796
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:24,945
<i>And there's no way</i>
<i>that you can see who it</i>
<i>were that contributes.</i>

797
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:27,064
<i>The chamber puts</i>
<i>in millions of dollars</i>
<i>into state races,</i>

798
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,782
<i>Through some kind</i>
<i>of a front group.</i>

799
00:49:28,816 --> 00:49:32,936
<i>You know, citizens</i>
<i>for a strong ohio, or</i>
<i>partnership for ohio,</i>

800
00:49:32,954 --> 00:49:37,324
Groups that sound like they're
citizens groups, but in fact
are really business groups,

801
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,959
Hiding behind a false veneer.

802
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:41,378
We're doing much, much
better in courts,

803
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:46,133
And in the election of,
of judges to the state
supreme courts,

804
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:49,285
And we're in those races.
We'll spend $19 million

805
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:54,307
In election of those judges
and state attorneys general
in this next election.

806
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:05,468
They spent so much money
against us, they would run
almost every 15 to 20 minutes

807
00:50:05,486 --> 00:50:07,854
<i>On tv, on our local station.</i>

808
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:11,408
So we got to where we just
didn't have the tvs on, and
all of a sudden one morning...

809
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,642
We didn't want
the kids to see

810
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,444
These horrible ads.
We didn't want
them to see 'em,

811
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,581
'cause some of the ads
actually had big money bags
being thrown up on a bench,

812
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,367
<i>That he was bought</i>
<i>and paid for.</i>

813
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,503
<i>Diaz's</i>
<i>campaign took over $100,000</i>

814
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:25,172
<i>From personal</i>
<i>injury lawyers...</i>

815
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:28,175
And so one morning we hear,
you know, just "whoo-hoo!"

816
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:31,712
And our daughter is just,
like, cheering downstairs,
and we come down, and um,

817
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:34,297
she's like,
"we're rich, we're rich!"

818
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:38,218
And she'd seen the ad
with the big bags of money,
you know, on the bench,

819
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,803
And her daddy's name.

820
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,689
<i>The game plan was to</i>
<i>pick out a justice,</i>

821
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:45,675
<i>Try to make that justice</i>
<i>look soft on crime,</i>

822
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:50,147
<i>Take snippets from decisions</i>
<i>that the justice had made,</i>

823
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:55,819
<i>Manipulate those decisions</i>
<i>to make them seem absolutely</i>
<i>outrageous and ridiculous,</i>

824
00:50:55,853 --> 00:51:00,574
And, uh, spend a lot of
money to get that message
out to the voters.

825
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:05,028
<i>The amount of money that's</i>
<i>spent on television in a</i>
<i>political campaign</i>

826
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:07,047
<i>Has an enormous effect</i>
<i>on the outcome.</i>

827
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:08,548
<i>And in fact, in 2000,</i>

828
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:12,586
The statistics showed
that the side that
spent the most money

829
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:15,422
Won about 90% of the time.

830
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:24,931
We had two weeks until,
um, we had to run
again for a run-off,

831
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:29,069
<i>And we find out that</i>
<i>the u.S. Chamber</i>

832
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:32,906
Had literally almost purchased
all of the available airtime,

833
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,076
That there was available
from jackson to
biloxi, mississippi.

834
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:40,197
And what we had to do at the
time was actually take out
loans to finance the campaign,

835
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:44,000
And, um, if you're familiar
with banking at all, um,

836
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:49,422
They generally don't like
to loan money to folks
who may lose an election,

837
00:51:49,457 --> 00:51:53,376
<i>So you have to have</i>
<i>somebody with money that</i>
<i>co-signs on your behalf,</i>

838
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:58,581
<i>And my very good friend</i>
<i>paul minor was willing to step</i>
<i>up and sign a loan at the bank</i>

839
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:02,886
To allow us to compete with
the u.S. Chamber's ads that
were running at the time.

840
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,421
Keith starrett's special
interest group from
washington, dc

841
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:08,091
Recently started attacking
me, and distorting my record,

842
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:11,728
I refuse to be negative, but
I must defend my record.

843
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:17,200
I still don't know how we did
it to this very day, but we
actually won that election.

844
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:21,488
<i>I really honestly thought</i>
<i>when we won and celebrated</i>
<i>that election</i>

845
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:22,656
<i>We had thought that</i>
<i>was a good day.</i>

846
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,208
<i>It turned out to be, probably</i>

847
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:27,978
one of the
worst days of our life,
the election was.

848
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:33,967
<i>Federal prosecutors</i>
<i>decided to investigate me</i>

849
00:52:34,001 --> 00:52:38,788
And used, uh, the loans
that paul minor had
co-signed at the bank,

850
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:43,343
<i>And called that a bribe,</i>
<i>and said that he'd</i>
<i>bribed me as a judge.</i>

851
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:46,062
But what's really
interesting about that is,

852
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:51,351
I never voted for a single
case in which paul minor,
or his law firm,

853
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,370
Or anybody he was
associated with,

854
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:57,140
<i>Had brought before the</i>
<i>supreme court because</i>
<i>of our friendship.</i>

855
00:52:57,158 --> 00:53:00,827
<i>And then that</i>
<i>summer oliver was indicted,</i>

856
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:04,147
<i>And it just kind of</i>
<i>started spiraling</i>
<i>downhill from there.</i>

857
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:08,484
Um, I almost kind of
didn't believe oliver.

858
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:11,538
I said there has to be
something here, you're
not telling me the truth.

859
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:14,975
<i>They wouldn't bring</i>
<i>these charges against</i>
<i>us and do this.</i>

860
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:16,710
<i>All these counts,</i>

861
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,262
<i>You're facing a hundred</i>
<i>and some years in the</i>
<i>federal penitentiary,</i>

862
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:20,513
<i>We have two...</i>

863
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,048
<i>millions of dollars in fines.</i>

864
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,266
<i>Millions of</i>
<i>dollars in fines,</i>

865
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:25,218
<i>We have two small children...</i>

866
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,971
<i>Oliver diaz says</i>
<i>the charges against him</i>
<i>are groundless,</i>

867
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:31,274
<i>Because he withdrew from</i>
<i>all cases involving</i>
<i>paul minor.</i>

868
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,995
<i>Diaz is on leave from</i>
<i>the supreme court until</i>
<i>the case is resolved.</i>

869
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:38,031
<i>The decision</i>
<i>to prosecute justice diaz</i>

870
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:41,651
<i>May have been motivated</i>
<i>by tort reform politics.</i>

871
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:45,705
It may have been motivated
by an effort to

872
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,041
Remove justice diaz
from the supreme court

873
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:52,913
Where he often voted
for ordinary citizens
and against corporations,

874
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:58,134
But it certainly was not
a prosecution that was
based on the evidence,

875
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:01,254
Because the evidence
did not support it.

876
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:05,508
Do you think
that oliver was prosecuted
for political reasons?

877
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,812
sure. I don't think
there's any doubt about that.

878
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,063
We thought
we were just targeted,

879
00:54:10,097 --> 00:54:11,147
And this was just us,

880
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:13,767
And this political
prosecution was just us.

881
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,820
We later found out
that this happened
all over the country,

882
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:23,893
And those other judges were,
that won or were successful,
were also targeted.

883
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:28,031
<i>After a three month</i>
<i>trial, I was completely</i>
<i>acquitted of all charges.</i>

884
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:31,918
<i>The jury returned</i>
<i>not guilty verdicts</i>
<i>on everything,</i>

885
00:54:31,953 --> 00:54:35,372
But, uh, three days
after my trial,

886
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:39,042
I was re-indicted on
tax evasion charges.

887
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,711
<i>So I had to go through</i>
<i>another federal trial</i>

888
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,680
<i>After that first</i>
<i>three-month trial,</i>

889
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:47,050
<i>And had a week-long trial</i>
<i>this time on tax charges,</i>

890
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:50,804
And after a 15-minute
deliberation time by the jury,

891
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:53,807
I was fully acquitted
a second time.

892
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:56,026
<i>I was finally cleared to</i>
<i>return to the bench,</i>

893
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:02,148
But not till after I had
been removed from the bench
for almost three years.

894
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,318
So what they
weren't able to do
through an election,

895
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:09,706
They were able to do
with a federal prosecution,
a federal investigation,

896
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,374
Uh, to keep me
off the bench,

897
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:14,327
<i>Uh, to ruin my reputation,</i>

898
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:18,465
To make it that, uh,
I probably wouldn't
be able to

899
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:21,468
Be elected again to the
mississippi supreme court.

900
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:25,555
Some other people were elected
who were considered to be
much more business-friendly,

901
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:29,309
Uh, justices then had
served on the court in
the years past,

902
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:31,594
And it really, really
did alter things.

903
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,097
In mississippi after the,
the courts swung,

904
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:38,385
<i>I think they went, like,</i>
<i>two years without upholding</i>
<i>a plaintiff verdict.</i>

905
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,653
<i>You know, you might be able</i>
<i>to win with the jury,</i>

906
00:55:40,688 --> 00:55:45,025
But you have no hope
of having that, that verdict
sustained by the courts.

907
00:55:57,238 --> 00:56:00,623
I think the, sort of, the
taint of these charges,

908
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,842
And sort of the residue
of all of that,

909
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:05,762
And the fact that some
people in the public
simply assumed

910
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,881
He was guilty because
he was charged of it,

911
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,849
Caused him to be
defeated for re-election.

912
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:15,221
Also, um, I was not able to,
to raise the funds to,
to compete.

913
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:19,342
I raised about a quarter of
the amount that I'd raised
in my first election.

914
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,811
If two or three million
dollars is being spent,

915
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,030
Or ten million dollars
is being spent,

916
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:26,366
The way it's going now,
ten years from now

917
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,519
They'll be spending a
hundred million dollars
on judicial elections.

918
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:36,359
And it's not really a good
way to have the system work.

919
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:39,879
And there's many people in
the business community who
don't agree with me on that.

920
00:57:05,439 --> 00:57:07,890
<i>Can you tell us</i>
<i>why you're here today</i>
<i>at this reform summit?</i>

921
00:57:07,908 --> 00:57:12,745
We're here to receive
the leadership
achievement award.

922
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,730
Oh, for what?

923
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:18,651
For passing a 208-page
civil justice reform law
in oklahoma,

924
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:22,455
That is going to take
the bull's-eye off the back
of business in our state.

925
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,424
What does that
mean exactly?

926
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,409
It means that we're
protecting our businesses
from frivolous lawsuits.

927
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:28,711
And do you think
there are a lot of
frivolous lawsuits?

928
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:32,748
There are, and we think that
there's a definite cost to
the medical profession

929
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,517
And the cost of doing business

930
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:35,918
Where we have to protect that,

931
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,754
Companies that are now
doing business
in our country

932
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:41,090
From that kind
of invasiveness.

933
00:57:41,108 --> 00:57:42,809
And so who brings these
frivolous lawsuits?

934
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,312
All kinds of people.
People that are
jackpot-justice oriented.

935
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,931
Do you think
tort reform is a good thing
for the american public?

936
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:51,050
Without a doubt.
Why, why is that?

937
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:55,271
There's an incredible amount
of frivolous lawsuits.

938
00:57:55,289 --> 00:58:02,378
It directly impacts
everything from
health care to, um,

939
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:06,833
You know, prices in stores,
and small businesses.

940
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:08,134
It's extremely important.

941
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:10,470
And where do you work,
or what do you do?

942
00:58:10,504 --> 00:58:13,890
Uh, I am a, I'm a lawyer.
Okay, and with a
law firm or...

943
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,175
No, in-house counsel.

944
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:16,509
Oh, for what kind
of company you work?

945
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,394
Uh, pfizer pharmaceuticals.

946
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,564
I think we've just
gone too far.
Too much litigation.

947
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,651
And so who,
who benefits from
having less litigation?

948
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:27,270
Everybody, except
the trial lawyers.

949
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:28,905
And how do you...
Do you want to, like,

950
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,474
Eliminate people's rights
to go to the court system?

951
00:58:31,492 --> 00:58:32,976
I want to give people...

952
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,079
My own preference would
be to give people
rights to sign contracts

953
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:37,947
When they buy products
and so forth,

954
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,783
So the contracts
would determine
what rights they had.

955
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:44,003
Are these things like
the arbitration clauses
that are in contracts,

956
00:58:44,038 --> 00:58:45,321
Like the mandatory
arbitration clauses?

957
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:48,208
Yeah, those are useful
clauses, I believe.

958
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:51,827
Sometimes, um, litigation
is harmful to all of us.

959
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:55,765
And there are better means
to resolve disputes
than through the courts.

960
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,550
You mentioned
a few of them already.

961
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,637
Arbitration is a very
good one, and there
are lots of others.

962
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,338
Uh, but I hope
you'll excuse me,
I do have to run now.

963
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:04,941
No problem, thank you
so much, I appreciate it.

964
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,323
Did she get
any on her head?

965
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:22,625
Yes.

966
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,161
That doesn't go on
your head, baby girl!

967
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,413
Silly.

968
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:31,334
You thirsty?
You want a drink, hon?

969
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,635
Oh, yeah, why not.

970
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,537
Chocolate milk, coke,
orange juice, milk?

971
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,275
Hmm, I'll have coke.

972
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,761
A coke for breakfast, huh?
Uh-huh.

973
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:42,979
All right.

974
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:48,401
Here you go, I'm gonna
make me an orange juice.

975
00:59:48,435 --> 00:59:51,354
<i>I had</i>
<i>never heard of a mandatory</i>
<i>arbitration clause</i>

976
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:56,242
<i>Before I had signed</i>
<i>my employment contract</i>
<i>with halliburton.</i>

977
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:58,911
I worked for halliburton
in houston,

978
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:03,566
And, um, I wanted to help
operation iraqi freedom.

979
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:07,287
My mom was very sick
at home, so I needed
to help support her.

980
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:10,239
<i>They say it's more likely</i>
<i>that you'd get in a car wreck</i>

981
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:13,209
<i>Than something</i>
<i>happening to you in iraq.</i>

982
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:17,747
So as a 19-year-old girl,
you believe your elders,

983
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,084
And you think that
that's probably true, so...

984
01:00:22,102 --> 01:00:24,454
Four years ago
at the age of 19,

985
01:00:24,488 --> 01:00:28,107
Ms. Jamie leigh jones
signed a contract to

986
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:33,062
Become an employee of kbr,
then a halliburton subsidiary.

987
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,897
That contract
contained a clause

988
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:41,321
Which required her to
arbitrate any future dispute
against her employer.

989
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:45,825
This means it would force
her to give up her right
to seek redress

990
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,294
In court if she was wronged.

991
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:51,964
Mandatory arbitration
is, uh,

992
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:55,134
Something that has to be
involved in the case,
isn't it, or something?

993
01:00:55,169 --> 01:00:58,488
Because arbitration is
how the case... Oh...

994
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:00,139
It has something to do
with case files.

995
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:01,841
Have you heard?
No.

996
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,810
I've heard the two
words used separately.

997
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:05,895
Right.

998
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:08,264
Businesses use a number of
devices to keep the public
out of the courts.

999
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,366
<i>One of the devices</i>
<i>they've used is</i>

1000
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:15,021
<i>They've written clauses</i>
<i>into contracts that say</i>
<i>that you cannot go to court.</i>

1001
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:16,756
<i>You can only</i>
<i>go to arbitration.</i>

1002
01:01:16,824 --> 01:01:19,826
What we started to see
was, again and again,

1003
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,997
Our clients had been
forced to sign in the
fine print of contracts

1004
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:28,484
<i>These mandatory arbitration,</i>
<i>or forced arbitration clauses,</i>

1005
01:01:28,502 --> 01:01:31,371
<i>And none of our clients</i>
<i>knew that those</i>
<i>provisions were there</i>

1006
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:34,173
<i>And then it was only after</i>
<i>we got hold of their documents</i>

1007
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,324
That we would say to them,

1008
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:38,177
"hey, did you know
you supposedly agreed

1009
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:40,430
"that you are not allowed
to sue the company?

1010
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:43,165
<i>"do you know that</i>
<i>you agreed that instead</i>
<i>of going to a jury,</i>

1011
01:01:43,183 --> 01:01:45,818
<i>"that you have to go to</i>
<i>a private arbitrator,</i>

1012
01:01:45,853 --> 01:01:49,355
"who's with the company,
that's picked by the company
who cheated you?"

1013
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,392
And when you ask people
about binding arbitration

1014
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:55,778
And "would you knowingly
sign away your rights?"

1015
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:57,897
They say,
"well, of course not."

1016
01:01:57,948 --> 01:02:00,233
And then you ask them, "well,
do you have a cell phone?
Do you have a gym membership?

1017
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:02,568
"do ya, you know,
do you have a credit card?"

1018
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,737
Do you know whether
you've ever agreed to

1019
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:08,040
Mandatory arbitration
in any of your contracts?

1020
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:10,793
Um, I don't believe
I ever have. No.

1021
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:12,545
Do you own, do you
have a credit card?

1022
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:14,213
Well, maybe I have.

1023
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:16,816
When you first sign a contract
with a cell phone company

1024
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,001
Or a credit card company,
or what not,

1025
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,338
There won't be any reference
or any mention of the
arbitration clause,

1026
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,424
But then at some point,
the company decides to add it.

1027
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:28,428
<i>So what they do is,</i>
<i>they send out, in</i>
<i>incredibly tiny print,</i>

1028
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:31,547
<i>A little booklet that</i>
<i>they stick in with the bill.</i>

1029
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:35,217
And what almost everybody
does, is you look at the bill,

1030
01:02:35,235 --> 01:02:36,903
And you throw
everything else away.

1031
01:02:36,937 --> 01:02:39,338
<i>But that's where they send</i>
<i>in the arbitration clause</i>

1032
01:02:39,373 --> 01:02:42,275
<i>And then what they say</i>
<i>is, if you ever use</i>
<i>your phone again,</i>

1033
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:44,644
<i>Or you ever use your</i>
<i>credit card again,</i>

1034
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:48,614
That you've supposedly
"agreed" to mandatory
arbitration.

1035
01:02:48,649 --> 01:02:50,917
<i>What's happened in america,</i>

1036
01:02:50,951 --> 01:02:54,403
<i>Is that entire industries</i>
<i>have all adopted mandatory</i>
<i>arbitration clauses.</i>

1037
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,322
You'll see them in
credit card agreements,

1038
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,724
<i>Checking account agreements,</i>
<i>lending agreements,</i>

1039
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:00,242
<i>Cell phone contracts,</i>

1040
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,128
<i>Virtually anything that's</i>
<i>bought over the internet.</i>

1041
01:03:02,162 --> 01:03:04,397
<i>Computers, books, records.</i>

1042
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:05,631
<i>Virtually all nursing homes.</i>

1043
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:08,000
<i>Nearly every contract</i>
<i>to buy a new car,</i>

1044
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:10,102
<i>Health clubs, tanning salons.</i>

1045
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:14,056
<i>I have a friend who took</i>
<i>her cat in to be boarded</i>
<i>while she went on vacation</i>

1046
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,893
<i>And the kennel made her sign</i>
<i>a mandatory arbitration clause</i>

1047
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:19,479
<i>That if they killed her</i>
<i>cat or did something</i>
<i>horrible to it,</i>

1048
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,063
<i>That she couldn't go to court.</i>

1049
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:22,832
<i>You have no</i>
<i>bargaining power,</i>

1050
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:26,435
<i>You as a consumer or</i>
<i>a worker are forced</i>
<i>into these things</i>

1051
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,205
And you really never had
a choice in the matter.

1052
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,291
Mandatory arbitration is
fast becoming the rule,

1053
01:03:32,326 --> 01:03:34,243
Rather than the exception.

1054
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:38,464
The practice of forcing
employees to use arbitration
has been on the rise.

1055
01:03:38,499 --> 01:03:40,249
There are several
surveys that show

1056
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,502
That more than a third of
the working people in america

1057
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:46,372
<i>Are bound to forced</i>
<i>arbitration clauses.</i>

1058
01:03:46,406 --> 01:03:48,641
<i>In fact far more</i>
<i>american workers</i>

1059
01:03:48,675 --> 01:03:52,428
<i>Are governed by</i>
<i>mandatory forced</i>
<i>arbitration clauses</i>

1060
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:55,932
Than are members of unions
in modern america today.

1061
01:03:58,652 --> 01:04:01,988
I worked for halliburton
in houston for a little
bit over a year

1062
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,807
Before I decided
to go to iraq.

1063
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:06,108
<i>When I was in iraq,</i>

1064
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:09,979
<i>Halliburton and kbr</i>
<i>were the same company.</i>

1065
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:14,417
<i>Those that go over</i>
<i>to iraq get promoted</i>
<i>when they come home.</i>

1066
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:18,704
Also, I mean my goal was
to just work there forever.

1067
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:22,291
I was content there,
until everything happened.

1068
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:28,381
<i>I was told that</i>
<i>I would be housed in</i>
<i>a little trailer house</i>

1069
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:31,517
<i>With one female on one side,</i>
<i>another on one side</i>

1070
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:33,936
<i>And then a bathroom</i>
<i>shared in the middle.</i>

1071
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:36,839
And when I got there,
I was perplexed

1072
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:40,359
Because I was put
in a predominately
all-male barrack.

1073
01:04:40,394 --> 01:04:42,678
<i>I didn't see</i>
<i>any females there.</i>

1074
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:46,348
<i>I emailed some of the managers</i>
<i>that I knew from houston,</i>

1075
01:04:46,366 --> 01:04:49,118
And I told them I was
concerned, that I wanted...

1076
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,855
You know, to be moved
into the living quarters
that I was promised,

1077
01:04:52,873 --> 01:04:57,293
And one guy emailed me
back and just said,
"oh, you'll get over it."

1078
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:01,464
Men had their doors open,
and some were in boxers,

1079
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,232
And they were cat calling.

1080
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:12,892
When I woke up,
I was severely beaten,

1081
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:14,510
My chest was disfigured,

1082
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:17,229
I was bleeding between
my legs, I was naked.

1083
01:05:17,264 --> 01:05:20,566
I washed my hands and
then I saw the bruises
on my wrists,

1084
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:24,270
And I'm starting to put
together that something
major happened to my body.

1085
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,556
And then I go back up
the stairs, down the hall,

1086
01:05:27,574 --> 01:05:31,243
And I looked in my room
and there was a man
in the bottom bunk,

1087
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:34,580
And I don't remember if
he was clothed or anything,

1088
01:05:34,615 --> 01:05:40,853
I was so, like, shocked,
that part...Bits and pieces
of it are gone from me.

1089
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:44,874
It was just,
it was the worst moment
in my entire life.

1090
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:51,263
To actually see a man brazen
enough to still be there
in the room after raping me.

1091
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,050
And it was really hard,

1092
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,886
And I know now
that the reason why
he was still in the room,

1093
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,891
Was because he would be
able to get away with it.

1094
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:04,193
I went to seek medical help

1095
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:09,431
And at the army doctor,
she said that I had been, um,

1096
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,435
Penetrated both
vaginally and anally.

1097
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:18,190
And that the tears down
there were significant.

1098
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:31,170
<i>You've heard a lot about</i>
<i>halliburton lately.</i>

1099
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,889
<i>Criticism is okay,</i>
<i>we can take it.</i>

1100
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:36,008
<i>Criticism is not failure.</i>

1101
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:38,344
<i>Our employees</i>
<i>are doing a great job.</i>

1102
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:41,731
<i>We're feeding the soldiers,</i>
<i>we're rebuilding iraq.</i>

1103
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:42,898
<i>Will things go wrong?</i>

1104
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,067
<i>Sure they will,</i>
<i>it's a war zone.</i>

1105
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:49,021
<i>But when they do, we'll</i>
<i>fix it. We always have.</i>

1106
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:53,526
So then two kbr security
officers took me to a...

1107
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:57,246
It's been called a lot
of things, shipping
container, trailer,

1108
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,749
<i>Essentially</i>
<i>I was imprisoned.</i>

1109
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:02,952
<i>There was two armed guards</i>
<i>outside of my door,</i>

1110
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:08,124
Um, I was begging and pleading
through the door to, you know,
let me get out of there.

1111
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:11,594
And finally, one of
the guards, out of sympathy,
let me use his phone.

1112
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:14,964
I called my father,
who contacted
congressman ted poe.

1113
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,999
Well, it was
almost unbelievable.

1114
01:07:17,017 --> 01:07:22,555
Here she is, a young, uh,
19-year-old, uh, female,

1115
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:26,358
And according to her dad,
uh, she had, uh...

1116
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:29,228
She was locked up in one
of these shipping crates,

1117
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:34,283
So the first thing that
I thought should happen is
get her out of that situation.

1118
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:37,620
You know, uh, send the
troops over to rescue
her, so to speak.

1119
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,956
And uh, the state department,
I thought did
a pretty good job.

1120
01:07:40,991 --> 01:07:44,460
<i>After I was rescued</i>
<i>by federal agents,</i>

1121
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:47,897
<i>They formed a meeting</i>
<i>with kbr management,</i>

1122
01:07:47,931 --> 01:07:51,366
<i>And management told me</i>
<i>that I had two options.</i>

1123
01:07:51,384 --> 01:07:53,085
One, I could
continue working there,

1124
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:56,538
Or two, I could go home
and be terminated.

1125
01:07:56,556 --> 01:08:00,375
<i>I tried to pursue my criminal</i>
<i>case and it didn't work,</i>

1126
01:08:00,393 --> 01:08:04,980
<i>And then I tried to</i>
<i>file a civil suit</i>
<i>and that didn't work out</i>

1127
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:09,468
<i>Because of the</i>
<i>arbitration clause in</i>
<i>my employment contract.</i>

1128
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:21,247
No one would conceive that
this would happen to them,
first of all,

1129
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:23,899
And secondly, no one would
conceive that this would be,

1130
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:29,088
Oh, well then, the company
that sent you over there
and put you in this position,

1131
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:32,174
Uh, where you were raped,

1132
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:35,511
Is also, "you're just
going to have to arbitrate
with us secretly."

1133
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:39,131
I mean, I don't think anyone
could possibly conceive
that that would happen.

1134
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:41,550
Well, whenever you take a case
out of the court system,

1135
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:45,354
You're immediately put into
a biased type of forum.

1136
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:48,190
Arbitration happens to
be extremely biased.

1137
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:50,810
Most arbitrations
take place in secret.

1138
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,311
<i>You have a private judge,</i>

1139
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:54,363
<i>So if you have a credit</i>
<i>card agreement,</i>

1140
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:58,501
<i>The credit card company picks</i>
<i>who the arbitration company</i>
<i>is going to be</i>

1141
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:02,488
And then the arbitration
company picks an individual
arbitrator to hear your case.

1142
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:05,574
The arbitrator wants
repeat business,

1143
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,442
And they only deal
with you once,

1144
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:11,747
But they deal with a bank
of america, or general motors,
or whoever it is,

1145
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:15,251
The businesses,
they deal with them
day in and day out.

1146
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:19,338
<i>And so they're going to</i>
<i>tilt their decisions</i>
<i>toward the businesses.</i>

1147
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,557
<i>There have</i>
<i>been a bunch of examples</i>

1148
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:24,626
Where if the arbitrator
ruled in favor of a consumer,

1149
01:09:24,678 --> 01:09:27,429
Or ruled in favor of
somebody who is an employee,

1150
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:31,317
That they were blackballed,
and they never got to work
again as an arbitrator.

1151
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:33,319
<i>So they set up</i>
<i>systems that are</i>

1152
01:09:33,353 --> 01:09:36,405
<i>Essentially rigged</i>
<i>against the consumers.</i>

1153
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:40,576
Many studies show that
consumers come out
winning these cases

1154
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,644
Maybe less than ten
percent of the time.

1155
01:09:42,662 --> 01:09:46,498
<i>They're almost always</i>
<i>won by the bank or the</i>
<i>credit card company.</i>

1156
01:09:46,533 --> 01:09:49,368
<i>It's impossible to</i>
<i>find out what the reason is</i>

1157
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,770
<i>For an arbitrator ruling</i>
<i>for one side or another.</i>

1158
01:09:51,805 --> 01:09:55,624
They just say this side
wins, this side loses,
and that's it.

1159
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:59,428
And there's no right to
appeal, so I have to take the
final judgment of one guy

1160
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,797
Who's been picked by
my credit card company

1161
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:05,500
To tell me that I'm going
to end up having to pay.

1162
01:10:05,518 --> 01:10:07,353
I'm not okay with that.
Yeah, I'm not okay
with that either.

1163
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:09,772
No. Uh-uh.
That's actually upsetting.

1164
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:12,441
Transparency is a must
in the judicial process,

1165
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:15,527
So if there's no oversight
in that regard,

1166
01:10:15,562 --> 01:10:17,563
I'd be pretty,
I'd be pretty worried.

1167
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:21,200
Until and unless congress
takes action with regard to

1168
01:10:21,234 --> 01:10:23,986
<i>Restricting the use of these</i>
<i>binding arbitration clauses,</i>

1169
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,405
We're all going to be
stuck with these clauses.

1170
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:30,960
Senator al franken
proposing the pentagon
shouldn't hire contractors

1171
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:34,914
That make their employees
agree in advance not to sue

1172
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:37,132
If they're raped
by co-workers.

1173
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:41,887
I just started the jamie leigh
foundation, and I've been
trying to bring awareness

1174
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:44,757
To the situation to help
others through my foundation.

1175
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:46,208
So behind the
scenes up to this point,

1176
01:10:46,226 --> 01:10:48,644
You've been trying to
pursue every legal avenue...

1177
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:51,180
Oh yeah.

1178
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:54,183
<i>I went public because</i>
<i>I wanted to bring awareness</i>
<i>to the situation</i>

1179
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:58,153
<i>That there was a loophole</i>
<i>in our justice system</i>

1180
01:10:58,188 --> 01:11:01,056
<i>That needed to be</i>
<i>fixed very quickly.</i>

1181
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:05,394
<i>If I could just, you</i>
<i>know, get this out there,</i>
<i>what happened to me,</i>

1182
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:10,916
<i>That maybe, you know, people</i>
<i>would change the laws, somehow</i>
<i>the laws would change.</i>

1183
01:11:16,089 --> 01:11:18,040
Hi!
Hi!

1184
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:20,092
Hi. Thank you so much for
all that you've done.

1185
01:11:20,126 --> 01:11:21,844
Thank you for your courage.

1186
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,412
It's just amazing.
Amazing!

1187
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:27,416
Hi, yes. Very nice
to meet you.

1188
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:32,521
Nice to meet you. You
have an incredibly
courageous daughter.

1189
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:33,722
Thank you.

1190
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,691
And also with a tremendous
amount of persistence.

1191
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:37,026
yeah.

1192
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,227
So, way to go.

1193
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:39,445
Thank you.

1194
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:53,042
And you're testifying
tomorrow?

1195
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,576
Yes, sir. Uh-huh.

1196
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,447
I've testified in front
of congress a few times.

1197
01:11:58,465 --> 01:12:00,782
Is it judiciary
committee tomorrow?

1198
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,117
Uh, judiciary, yes.

1199
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:03,135
So that's me.

1200
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:04,386
Yeah.

1201
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,759
I turned to the civil
court system for justice

1202
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,962
When the criminal justice
system was slow to respond.

1203
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:18,567
When my lawyers filed the
suit, um, they were met
with halliburton's response

1204
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:22,021
That all of my claims were
to be decided in arbitration,

1205
01:12:22,072 --> 01:12:26,992
Because I had signed away
my right to a trial by jury
at such an early age.

1206
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:30,863
I had no choice to sign
this contract because
I needed this job.

1207
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:34,083
I had no idea that the clause
was part of the contract,

1208
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:35,484
What the clause
actually meant,

1209
01:12:35,502 --> 01:12:38,787
Or that I would eventually end
up in this horrible situation.

1210
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:43,325
The problem of forcing claims
like mine into a secret system
of binding arbitration

1211
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:45,844
Goes well beyond me.

1212
01:12:45,879 --> 01:12:48,347
Even when victims pursue
their claims in arbitration,

1213
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:51,500
The information is sealed
and kept confidential.

1214
01:12:51,518 --> 01:12:56,138
The system of arbitration
keeps this evidence from
ever coming to public light,

1215
01:12:56,172 --> 01:12:58,107
And allows companies
like halliburton

1216
01:12:58,141 --> 01:13:00,526
To continue to allow the
abuse of their employees

1217
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,345
Without repercussion
or public scrutiny.

1218
01:13:03,363 --> 01:13:06,448
The seminal
question is, should employers
and employees be able to

1219
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:10,786
Engage in mediation and
mandatory binding arbitration
of employment disputes

1220
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,355
As alternatives
to litigation?

1221
01:13:13,373 --> 01:13:16,858
The seminal answer
is, absolutely.

1222
01:13:16,876 --> 01:13:18,994
Adr unemployment programs
are flourishing,

1223
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:23,499
When implemented appropriately
they're decisively in
employees' best interest.

1224
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:26,885
It is a popular concept
for those employers
who've adopted it,

1225
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,504
And adopted it
appropriately.

1226
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:30,672
It provides for more
effective communication...

1227
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,873
Sir, in your
comments...

1228
01:13:31,891 --> 01:13:33,809
Sure.

1229
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:38,097
Uh, would you also tell how
arbitration could be helpful
to somebody like miss jones

1230
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:43,569
When the, when the, uh,
her employer, halliburton
in effect, said that

1231
01:13:43,603 --> 01:13:48,056
Rape and sexual assault
has just to be considered
part of the job?

1232
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:53,395
What we
have in this situation,
I'm not here representing

1233
01:13:53,413 --> 01:13:56,398
Uh, anyone involved
in that case, I'm not
involved in that case,

1234
01:13:56,416 --> 01:13:57,916
Um, you know,

1235
01:13:57,951 --> 01:14:01,837
Miss jones has had
her day in court, and
maybe more than she'd want.

1236
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:04,339
It goes on and on and
on, I understand that.

1237
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:07,909
Uh, what we're talking about
is the concept of adr,

1238
01:14:07,927 --> 01:14:10,245
And dispute resolution
programs overall.

1239
01:14:10,296 --> 01:14:12,581
Senator franken.

1240
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:17,102
Thank you mr. Chairman.
Thank you for calling,
uh, this hearing, uh,

1241
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:19,138
Mr. De bernardo.

1242
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:24,593
You said that the net result
of the use of, uh, arbitration

1243
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:26,895
Is better workplaces.

1244
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,764
Correct.

1245
01:14:29,782 --> 01:14:31,033
Better workplaces?

1246
01:14:32,118 --> 01:14:33,202
Correct.

1247
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:35,237
She was housed with 400 men.

1248
01:14:37,624 --> 01:14:43,295
She told kbr twice that she
was being sexually harassed.

1249
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,048
She was drugged,

1250
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:53,589
By men that the kbr
employment people knew
did this kind of thing.

1251
01:14:54,474 --> 01:14:56,642
She was raped. Gang raped.

1252
01:14:56,676 --> 01:14:59,061
She had to have reconstructive
surgery, sir.

1253
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:06,301
They had this,
this arbitration.

1254
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:11,990
Now, if that created
a better workplace...

1255
01:15:12,025 --> 01:15:18,146
And then, she was locked
in a shipping container
with an armed guard.

1256
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:21,783
Now, my question to you is,
if that's a better workplace,

1257
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,987
What was, what was the
workplace like before?

1258
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:31,376
That's a rhetorical
question, I'm not really
asking that question.

1259
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:36,965
They had binding
arbitration at kbr,

1260
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,017
And because of that,

1261
01:15:39,052 --> 01:15:41,103
And they asserted it,

1262
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:43,222
On cases like this,

1263
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:48,477
And miss jones, in your
foundation you've heard from
other women who were raped,

1264
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:49,561
Is that not true?

1265
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:51,446
Yes, sir, I have.

1266
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:55,984
And uh, and women who,
under arbitration...

1267
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,120
Yes, sir.

1268
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,572
Were, were told to keep
silent, is that right?

1269
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,524
Exactly.

1270
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:05,961
And because of that silence,
you didn't know about anything
like this, did you?

1271
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:09,748
Exactly, I didn't know.
It was not public knowledge.

1272
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,421
And when
mr. De bernardo said that
you had your day in court,

1273
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:17,806
What was your reaction?

1274
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,642
I was livid, sir.

1275
01:16:23,596 --> 01:16:26,648
Four years to fight to get in
court is not a day in court.

1276
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:30,852
Um, I was livid too.

1277
01:16:35,241 --> 01:16:38,059
This is the result
of your binding,

1278
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,081
Mandatory arbitration.

1279
01:16:45,918 --> 01:16:47,119
Mr. De bernardo.

1280
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,255
Thank you.

1281
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:52,924
Mr. Chairman.

1282
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:03,752
As I talk to people
who have been harmed,

1283
01:17:03,803 --> 01:17:07,105
Look, most of them are not
interested in a big payday.

1284
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,924
Most of these people are
interested in accountability,

1285
01:17:09,942 --> 01:17:11,693
And the, and the way our
system is structured,

1286
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:16,598
The only way we have, we have
to hold somebody accountable
is through the courthouse.

1287
01:17:16,616 --> 01:17:18,767
I can't tell you why
people support tort reform.

1288
01:17:18,785 --> 01:17:21,737
I can tell you that if they
have supported tort reform,

1289
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:25,106
And that they
subsequently get hurt,

1290
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:28,493
They're really sorry
that they did.

1291
01:17:29,962 --> 01:17:32,113
<i>There's a story</i>
<i>of a gentleman in waco.</i>

1292
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:37,452
<i>He was harmed, and he sought</i>
<i>to hold the doctor who</i>
<i>harmed him accountable,</i>

1293
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:39,705
And he came to find out
that he couldn't do that,

1294
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,458
<i>And he had voted for the state</i>
<i>constitutional amendment that</i>

1295
01:17:43,476 --> 01:17:46,978
<i>Allowed the legislature to</i>
<i>limit the rights of patients.</i>

1296
01:17:47,013 --> 01:17:48,980
<i>And when he was told,</i>

1297
01:17:49,015 --> 01:17:53,518
"well, you know, proposition
12 is what made this happen,

1298
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,937
"made it so that you couldn't
access the courthouse,"

1299
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,739
He said, "well, I
voted for that!"

1300
01:17:57,774 --> 01:18:00,659
And they said, "well, you
know, a lot of people did.

1301
01:18:00,693 --> 01:18:02,611
<i>"and that's why it's the</i>
<i>law of the land now."</i>

1302
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:05,580
He said, "but that doesn't...
That's not my case,

1303
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:08,116
"that's for those people
who file frivolous lawsuits.

1304
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,669
"that's for those people
who are trying to take
advantage of the system.

1305
01:18:10,703 --> 01:18:14,706
"that's for those people
who are trying to cash in
on some lawsuit lottery.

1306
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:16,341
"that's not what
I'm trying to do.

1307
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:18,093
"I was harmed, and
all I'm trying to do

1308
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,328
"is hold the person who
harmed me accountable."

1309
01:18:20,346 --> 01:18:23,098
And he realized
at that moment,

1310
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:27,552
"what I've been told
all of these years,

1311
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,354
"they think that's me."

1312
01:18:29,389 --> 01:18:34,025
We don't need tort reform,
uh, we need tort respect.

1313
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:39,347
With the, the tort
law is, uh, what makes
this country strong.

1314
01:18:39,365 --> 01:18:43,452
It is tort law and the
bringing of tort lawsuits,

1315
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:48,039
And the rendering of
civil damages, that's
what keeps our toys safe.

1316
01:18:48,074 --> 01:18:51,493
<i>It's what keeps</i>
<i>our cars from horribly</i>
<i>injuring people.</i>

1317
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:56,081
It's what keeps people
from lying, cheating,
and stealing.

1318
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:59,134
If we can't hold perpetrators
of wrongdoing accountable,

1319
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:01,052
None of us are safe
from their actions.

1320
01:19:01,087 --> 01:19:04,239
That's the role that the
civil justice system plays.

1321
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:10,479
<i>The one entity that can</i>
<i>hold businesses, bad doctors</i>
<i>accountable is the civil jury,</i>

1322
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,347
And that's what they're
most afraid of.

1323
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:17,903
Why is it that you support an
effort to limit the ability
of juries to make a decision

1324
01:19:17,937 --> 01:19:20,155
When you're suing business,

1325
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:26,528
But you support the idea that
juries should be allowed to
decide in death penalty cases,

1326
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:30,398
Where the issue is whether or
not some person should die?

1327
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:33,452
Ultimately, it comes down to
whether you trust juries.

1328
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:37,589
<i>Certainly it's the best</i>
<i>system anybody's come up with,</i>
<i>in the history of the world,</i>

1329
01:19:37,623 --> 01:19:40,909
To resolve disputes
involving ordinary people.

1330
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:43,244
And then the question becomes,
what's the alternative?

1331
01:19:43,262 --> 01:19:46,431
So, should we let the
businesses decide? Should
we let arbitrators decide?

1332
01:19:46,466 --> 01:19:51,252
If we give up the civil
jury, uh, as a tool for
holding uh, wrongdoers,

1333
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:55,474
And the business community,
uh, accountable, what's
the alternative?

1334
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:56,975
Who's going to police them?

1335
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:59,060
And the answer is
no one, they're going
to police themselves.

1336
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,029
And that's exactly
what they want.

1337
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:15,443
<i>It really</i>
<i>opened my eyes to</i>
<i>how the system works,</i>

1338
01:20:15,461 --> 01:20:21,783
<i>And, um, the things that I</i>
<i>thought were in place to</i>
<i>protect you have been,</i>

1339
01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:23,284
<i>Have been taken away.</i>

1340
01:20:23,302 --> 01:20:26,638
<i>And I didn't realize</i>
<i>there were caps here,</i>

1341
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:30,308
And I didn't realize
that the doctor wouldn't
have to pay for this,

1342
01:20:30,343 --> 01:20:33,895
That the taxpayers
were going to pay for
colin's damages.

1343
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:55,634
<i>This is a</i>
<i>campaign that's occurring all</i>
<i>across the United States,</i>

1344
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:57,786
<i>It's not only in mississippi.</i>

1345
01:20:59,038 --> 01:21:01,206
They don't want a
level playing field,

1346
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:05,126
<i>And they'll spend millions</i>
<i>of dollars to get these</i>
<i>people in place,</i>

1347
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:10,582
To be sure that the judges
will rule the way that
they want them too.

1348
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:28,083
<i>I still have</i>
<i>flashbacks, I still get jumpy</i>
<i>if someone comes up behind me,</i>

1349
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,368
<i>I have nightmares.</i>

1350
01:21:30,403 --> 01:21:34,739
<i>I wish that I could</i>
<i>confront the men that</i>
<i>did this to my body.</i>

1351
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:38,076
<i>I think that it would be</i>
<i>instrumental to my healing.</i>

1352
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:43,465
The only way I could do
that is if I'm able to face
them in a court of law.

1353
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:47,085
And I hope to do that one day.

1354
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:07,072
I mean, I've heard so many
ridiculous stories about, she
was asking for $30 million or,

1355
01:22:07,106 --> 01:22:09,240
You know, something
equally ridiculous.

1356
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:13,828
<i>Basically, stella told them,</i>
<i>"I want you to cover what</i>
<i>medicare doesn't cover,</i>

1357
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:16,031
"and I want you to get a
better lid on that coffee,

1358
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:18,399
"'cause I don't want this
to happen to another person."

1359
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:21,369
And that was basically
what she was asking for.

1360
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:27,375
When somebody goes to court,
they're doing something
extraordinary that is hidden.

1361
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:32,063
To go to court and to sue
is not a simple procedure.

1362
01:22:32,098 --> 01:22:34,599
<i>You have to go through a</i>
<i>lot of trouble to do it,</i>

1363
01:22:34,634 --> 01:22:38,937
<i>It affects your life,</i>
<i>you're going to be attacked</i>
<i>in all kinds of ways...</i>

1364
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:44,275
<i>Going to court to gain</i>
<i>justice is heroic.</i>

1365
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:47,696
<i>That idea has to be out there.</i>

1366
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:53,151
That is, when you, quote,
win a case, you win
it for other people,

1367
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:56,404
As well as gaining
justice for yourself.
