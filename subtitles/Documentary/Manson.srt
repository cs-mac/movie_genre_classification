2
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,644
I've heard that you get
a lot of letters from kids.

3
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,013
Have you gotten these kind
of visits and letters. -Sure.

4
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,148
- From kids that you don't know?
- Sure.

5
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,517
Why do you think
these kids write you?

6
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,319
Because I am those kids.

7
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,288
What is it
about you that they...

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,990
I am a child.

9
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,327
I never grew up.
I never lived in your society.

10
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,397
I never went to school. I never
had a mother and father.

11
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,333
I raised myself up.

12
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:12,604
What do you think it is about you
that makes people want to be a part of

13
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,473
whatever it is you're a part of?

14
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,180
I'm brand new.

15
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:24,216
Everything I do
is always brand new.

16
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,705
Okay, you get the tickets, I'll
get the reservations. Okay?

17
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,607
Okay, good. Talk to you soon.

18
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,543
- Lindsay.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,878
Um, did you get the Rodel file?

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,380
- Yes. I set it on your desk behind you.
- Okay. Thank you.

21
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,484
Um, also, Pat McGroin called and he said
that he had to push back his meeting.

22
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,254
Pat McGroin.

23
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,356
Yeah. He called earlier today.

24
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,525
"Pat my groin?"

25
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,227
This is my brother.
He's playing a joke on you.

26
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,962
Well, he sounds like a riot.

27
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,165
Anyways, um,
he's coming to town tonight.

28
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,401
So that's why he's
messing with us right now.

29
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,336
I didn't know you had a brother.

30
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,738
Yeah. Conrad.

31
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,507
Never... Never heard the name.

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,701
Uh...

33
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,637
Max drew this
in our class today.

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,241
- Wow.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,911
Is there anything
going on with him at home

36
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,581
that might be upsetting
him in any way or...

37
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,282
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.

38
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,117
Are you, by chance,
going to Los Angeles?

39
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,486
- No.
- No? Sweet.

40
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:46,458
Are you, by chance, going South?
I'm looking for a ride.

41
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,230
Hello?

42
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,933
Can you hear me?

43
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:59,071
If you keep doing this, they're
going to kick you out of school.

44
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,372
Is that what you want?

45
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,674
Max?

46
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,710
Hey, hey!

47
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,546
I'm talking to you.

48
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,322
Hey, baby.

49
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,724
How are you?
Did you have a good day?

50
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,206
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

51
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,128
- You okay?
- I'm good.

52
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,831
Expect for the fact that
our son's a sociopath.

53
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,859
And when does he get here?

54
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,227
I don't know anything.

55
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,528
I don't know
what he's doing here.

56
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,397
I don't know where
we're gonna put him.

57
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,399
What, we can
put him in the office?

58
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,334
I... I wanna work this weekend.

59
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,136
I can't have him in the office.

60
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,638
Well, maybe you shouldn't
work this weekend.

61
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:06,571
It's besides the point.

62
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,707
It could be five in the
morning before he's here.

63
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,044
All right. Then it'll be five in the
morning when he gets here. That's fine.

64
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,012
I'm just saying,
there's like no heads up,

65
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,381
there's no consideration
for anybody else.

66
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,983
It's like with Dad's funeral.

67
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,985
Maybe that's why he's coming.
He's coming to make amends

68
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,787
and apologize for
not being at the funeral.

69
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,090
- Yeah, that's probably why he's coming.
- Oh. Sarcasm.

70
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,658
No, I'm just saying...
I'm, like...

71
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,593
I appreciate the positive
spin, but, like...

72
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,796
I think it'll be fun. It'll
be the first time we've spent

73
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,432
real quality time
with him since...

74
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,901
probably... Well,
probably our wedding.

75
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,304
- Oh, my God.
- What?

76
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,674
The wedding gift
that he gave us?

77
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,576
That... thing.

78
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,244
Oh.

79
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,217
Ow. Fuck.

80
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,399
That's... No,
now you've gone too far.

81
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,564
That's good right there.

82
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,233
- Like that? This?
- Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,203
Ooh, that's a lot.

84
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,604
- It's too much.
- No.

85
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,906
We should maybe, like,
not put it over the mantle.

86
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,175
No, no, no, it's fine. And well,
anywhere you put it in the house,

87
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,010
it's gonna look
out of place, so...

88
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,322
Okay. I just feel like
he's gonna figure it out.

89
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,547
Above the mantle's...

90
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,485
No. No! It's gonna make him
happy to see it there.

91
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,186
Okay.

92
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,775
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,793
- He's in the house.
- Why are you whispering?

94
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,861
'Cause I don't want him
to see what we're doing.

95
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,397
You gotta hide the toolbox, you
gotta get away from the painting.

96
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,965
What... How do you know
he's in the house?

97
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,034
Because the door downstairs is
open, that's how he got in.

98
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,136
- I thought we just left the door open.
- No, no, no, no, no.

99
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,771
He's in here. When we were kids,

100
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,040
he would sneak into the house
before I got home from school,

101
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,443
and he'd scare the fuck out of me.
It's happening right now.

102
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,579
Okay, just...
You need to settle down...

103
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,994
You fucking dick.

104
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,563
Is the knife necessary?

105
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,165
You just shit your pants,
didn't you?

106
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,567
It's good to see you. -Hi.
It's good to see you, too.

107
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,438
Wow. Are you serious?
What's that doing there?

108
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,740
It's hanging up.

109
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,176
That... Wow.

110
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,879
People comment on it
all the time, right?

111
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,080
It's really meaningful.

112
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,582
That was so nice of you guys.

113
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,252
I don't paint anymore,
but that one's not bad.

114
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,686
What are you talking about?

115
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,955
I don't paint, you know.
It's like, what's the point?

116
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,025
You quit? Like, you quit
being an artist? -Why?

117
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,263
Well, um, I'm writing a book
called<i> On The Road</i> and...

118
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,831
- Two?<i> On The Road 2?</i>
<i>- On The Road 2.</i>

119
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,767
I know who Jack... Jack Kerouac is.
I know. I know.

120
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,303
I mean, seriously,
I actually sold all my stuff,

121
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,205
and, um, just...
Got rid of everything,

122
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,809
all my art supply stuff, my records, and...
Yeah, anyway.

123
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,779
Wait, what about your boss? Your
boss is cool with you doing this?

124
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,582
Like, she just is cool with
you taking three weeks off?

125
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,885
Well, you're gonna love this,
but I actually quit my job.

126
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,488
That makes me feel so much better
that you've quit your job.

127
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,923
- I think it's awesome.
- I know!

128
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,493
How irresponsible to quit
your job at the bookstore!

129
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,428
No, it's not irresponsible.

130
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,365
This is the time in your life where you're
supposed to be untethering yourself.

131
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,067
You know, when you're 40
you gotta break free.

132
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,502
You're being sarcastic
and it's just mean.

133
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,269
I'm just... I'm...

134
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,971
- I'm not being mean.
- You are being mean!

135
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,673
You're being sarcastic
and condescending.

136
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,275
You don't have anything
to worry about. All right?

137
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,579
I am worried. You...
You don't have a house,

138
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,849
you don't have any possessions,
you don't have a job.

139
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,120
I have a job with an environmental
organization in Death Valley.

140
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,722
- Are you serious?
- Oh.

141
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,458
Yeah. I just thought I'd pass
through and say hi to you guys.

142
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,161
That's really good. I'm
happy for you. -Yeah.

143
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,101
You wanna come,
get set up in the office?

144
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,637
- Why?
- For sleeping.

145
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,341
Um, well, I just
thought I'd camp out there.

146
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,976
You're gonna camp
in the backyard?

147
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,011
Is that okay?

148
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:17,482
Um, I guess. All right, well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to bed.

149
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,250
I have to get up early.
I have a huge day tomorrow.

150
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,886
Speaking of that, I wanted to
talk to you about tomorrow.

151
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,622
Uh, I mean, I know it's Friday,

152
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,957
but I was hoping you could
move some things around.

153
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,694
Because I have an idea.
Something for us to do.

154
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,397
- Okay.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,132
Well, you know Charles Manson?

156
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,736
Uh, yeah,
I know who Charles Manson is.

157
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:40,105
Well, there are these sites
all around the city,

158
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,341
um, that I was hoping we could go to.
I have it all mapped out.

159
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:47,078
It's amazing 'cause, like, no one
knows that, like, right there,

160
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,503
you know, that's the
LaBianca house, you know.

161
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,482
Or the Tate house.

162
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,985
Wait, these are
the murder site houses?

163
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,389
You... You're acting so uptight,
this is a thing people do.

164
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,559
No, they don't. No, this is the thing
that weird conspiracy people do.

165
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,763
Trust me, I have friends that come
into LA all the time. We've never...

166
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,765
Manson has never even come up.

167
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,403
Okay. Uh, guilty, Your Honor.
I am interested in this,

168
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:15,507
and you're my brother, and I just
thought we could do this together.

169
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,595
I'm just gonna
be in town tomorrow.

170
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,845
Then I'm going out to my job.

171
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,619
<i>Charles Manson set into motion
a wave of terror in Southern California.</i>

172
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,188
<i>In two nights,
Manson's murderous spree</i>

173
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,059
<i>took the lives of at least seven
people, including actress Sharon Tate.</i>

174
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,028
<i>Manson was portrayed as
a guitar-playing ex-convict</i>

175
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,666
<i>with a following of runaway young
women, his so-called family members.</i>

176
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,736
<i>The cult, or family,
spoke of launching a holy war</i>

177
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,337
<i>against the rich
and the powerful.</i>

178
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,308
<i>The Tate-LaBianca murders
were bizarre and merciless.</i>

179
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,478
<i>They triggered a public panic
and raised the specter</i>

180
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,515
<i>of drug-crazed youths slaughtering
their victims at random.</i>

181
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,255
Hey.

182
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,459
What are you doing in my yard?

183
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,095
It's mine.

184
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,697
You remember me?
I'm your uncle, Conrad.

185
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,934
No? Oh. How old are you now?

186
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,170
Mmm.

187
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,806
Eight? Seven? Six? Five?

188
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,076
You're going back in time.
You're a time traveler.

189
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,178
Seven? Wow.

190
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,714
He's always been into stuff like this.
Like, even when he was a kid,

191
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,616
he was into "Faces of Death".
You know what that is?

192
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,284
Yeah. It's horrible.

193
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,286
Yeah, and like,
death metal, and...

194
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,689
I don't know. He was into
9/11 for a long time.

195
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,890
It's just, he's like...

196
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:43,361
Just anything with death in it, you know.
He's like all about it.

197
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,730
- So.
- What's the camera for?

198
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,266
I was thinking I could get
him to take some pictures.

199
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,567
- In an artistic way?
- Yeah.

200
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,702
Oh, okay.

201
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,538
Get the ball rolling,
kinda, inspire him.

202
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,573
Well, that's kind of sweet.

203
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,309
What's the painting you put up?

204
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,979
What do you mean?
You haven't seen that before?

205
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,147
No.

206
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,048
Huh. Oh.

207
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,250
Figures.

208
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,785
What's it about?

209
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:11,623
Well, it was... It was a way
to show how I felt growing up.

210
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,359
Like, I felt sort of
like this little kid there,

211
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,662
with a weird face that didn't belong.

212
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,064
Why didn't you belong?

213
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,034
Well... You know
I was adopted, right?

214
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,202
No.

215
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,105
My parents, your grandparents,
they couldn't have kids.

216
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,673
And so they adopted me.

217
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,408
But then
a couple of years later,

218
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,077
your grandma got pregnant
with your dad.

219
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,679
He's their real son.

220
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:39,484
And they were so happy that he was born,
that, um, they sort of forgot about me.

221
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,885
That's not nice.

222
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,288
No.

223
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,962
Okay, so I've got
the whole day planned out.

224
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,798
First we go to the Tate house
then the LaBianca house.

225
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,803
Then, if you're into it, um, tomorrow, we
could drive out to the desert together.

226
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,672
What's that book?

227
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,508
Well, this is<i> Helter Skelter.</i>
You know, the classic.

228
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,910
It's got all, um,
the police reports

229
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,946
and testimonies,
stuff like that.

230
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,215
- It's actually Mom and Dads'.
- Really?

231
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,818
Yeah, it was in Dad's office. I went
into it one day and I opened it up.

232
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,221
It was just, like,
so weird, you know,

233
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,190
these dead bodies, they're
all whited out, you know.

234
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,294
It's almost more scary that they
don't show you what the thing is.

235
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,230
And then there's all these
pictures of Charlie

236
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,398
from all the different times
he was in prison.

237
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,100
And then there are
the Manson Girls,

238
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,870
who are just so fucking hot.
Look at that.

239
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,038
But at the same time, you know
that if you got with them,

240
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,875
they could probably cut your
dick off, too, right?

241
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,444
That sounds...
Sounds very enticing.

242
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,281
It's got everything. It's got
murder, sex, it's got it all.

243
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,617
What about, um... What's
going on with those kids?

244
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:49,721
The Manson Girls have kids. Most
of them were Charlie's, actually.

245
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,389
Wow.

246
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,192
Oh! Dude, um, turn here.

247
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,261
Oh, my God.

248
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,531
I can't believe that
we're at the Sharon Tate house.

249
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:04,068
Look, look. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. -Yeah?

250
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,336
Look what I got.

251
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,705
What... What is that?

252
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,808
You wanna maybe
shoot some photos?

253
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,511
Turn it into
an art project, maybe.

254
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,447
- Yeah. Maybe. Cool.
- Yeah.

255
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,954
The amount of
excitement you have right now

256
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,722
is like, seriously
disturbing to me.

257
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,191
Oh, my God.

258
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,760
Hello.

259
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,261
Dude, this is like
a historic spot.

260
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,497
I can't believe
we can just walk right up.

261
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,967
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

262
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,769
That's enough. We can just...

263
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,638
Do you have to go
right up to the thing?

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,540
Why? It's a public street.

265
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,975
I don't think it is.

266
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,811
It's just like in the books.

267
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,914
The gate is here,
everything. Do you see that?

268
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,091
That's where Sharon Tate's
house was, right up there.

269
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,619
That's where it happened.

270
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,120
Man, I wish I could get closer.

271
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,389
We don't need to get closer than this.
This is fine.

272
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,959
Well, good thing is lot of
the stuff happened here.

273
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,661
Oh, my God!
This is probably the same

274
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,698
pole that Tex climbed up. See, they
thought there was gonna be an alarm,

275
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,201
so he climbed up with wire cutters,
and he snipped all the wires.

276
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,138
He jumped over, and then right then
there was this young kid driving away.

277
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,474
He was just randomly
there that night.

278
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,942
Never been there before.

279
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,912
And Tex, like, starts stabbing
him through the window.

280
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,880
But he scooches back,
put his hands up.

281
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,483
So Tex has to shoot him
four times in the chest.

282
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna go back to the car.

283
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,588
- Why? Hey.
- Because...

284
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,190
Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

285
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,025
No. You can do whatever you want.
I'm just not gonna be part of it.

286
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,894
Stop, please.
Wait, okay? I'm sorry.

287
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,429
Just take a picture of me.

288
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,165
- All right?
- Why?

289
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,469
I wanna get... I might do a
self portrait from this.

290
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,804
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm serious.

291
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,174
All right. Here.
Let's do it right here.

292
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,111
I want to get the gate at least.

293
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:57,081
Dude, it's the same fucking gate.
That's amazing.

294
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,018
A lot of it
happened on the lawn.

295
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,421
Okay, stop talking so I can
take the photograph, will you?

296
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,703
Okay, hold on, hold on.

297
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,625
Hold on.

298
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,460
This guy's gonna call the cops.

299
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,098
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

300
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,933
- God damn it.
- Oh! Come on.

301
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,202
Charles Manson killed
people right here.

302
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,104
You have to be
fucking respectful about that.

303
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,106
He wasn't even here that night.

304
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,976
He wasn't at the Tate house
or the LaBianca house.

305
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,244
- Well...
- He didn't kill anyone.

306
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,146
Then why is he in jail
for murder?

307
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,614
Exactly!

308
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,516
- I mean, it was a fucking conspiracy.
- Okay. Keep your voice down.

309
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,553
It's because of his ideas. They
couldn't have someone that free

310
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,424
being, living out amongst us, 'cause
it would make everyone else feel like,

311
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,426
"What are you gonna
do with your life?"

312
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,629
Keep your voice down! -I don't give
a shit about those fucking people.

313
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,931
Hey! Charles Manson!

314
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,000
God damn it!

315
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,302
Charles Manson!

316
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,987
Hey.

317
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,526
I'm sensing some tension.

318
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,330
Look, sorry.

319
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,632
Let me take you
out to lunch, okay?

320
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,569
I know a really good place.

321
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,472
Are you gonna talk about
Charles Manson the whole time?

322
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,142
I don't have to.

323
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,815
There's like no limit to
the amount you can work,

324
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,750
which is like, part of the deal
when you become a partner.

325
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,488
And, you know, the money
is commensurate with that work.

326
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,823
But it's... It's like,
when do you stop?

327
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,025
You know what I mean?
Like, when does it end?

328
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,361
Hey, guys, I'll just pick
that up when you're ready.

329
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,262
Okay. Thanks.

330
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,197
- I got it. I got it.
- No, I got it.

331
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,332
Come on.

332
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,667
- Really?
- Yes.

333
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,238
All right. Thank you. -I told
you I was taking you out.

334
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,074
So, wait, before we go,
I got to tell you,

335
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,877
um, this table that
we're sitting at...

336
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,879
This very same table.

337
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:12,483
This is the same booth that they ate
at before they went home that night.

338
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,653
Who? What are you talking about?

339
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,591
Sharon Tate and her friends. They ate here
before that same night they went home.

340
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,194
And then,
Tex and the girls came.

341
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,663
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

342
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,166
- Got it. Got it.
- Oh.

343
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,101
So that's why we're here.

344
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,403
Oh, come on.
It's just a fun fact.

345
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,972
You think it's a fun fact,
but it's not.

346
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,342
I mean, it's, like,
really disturbing.

347
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,744
Okay, I'm sorry,

348
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,446
but I mean, it is something that
I've been thinking about that...

349
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,615
I mean, a lot of people
ignore death,

350
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:49,921
and it's something to think
about and not just shove away.

351
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,990
Are you... Do you hear
yourself right now?

352
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:57,828
I mean, you... You're talking about
not ignoring death, and embracing it.

353
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,599
But when it comes to Dad's funeral,
you don't come. Like, what is that?

354
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,569
You know, we weren't
getting along. I mean...

355
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,272
Do you know the last time
that he called me?

356
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,974
When's the last time
you called him?

357
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,809
I gave up calling.

358
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,379
Why? What's the point of calling? And
it's, like, there's nothing going on.

359
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,181
There was no exchange going on.

360
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,884
Even if you're not gonna go to
the funeral for Dad's sake,

361
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,018
you could have come for Mom.

362
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,920
Mom's way better off, you know.

363
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,422
How would you know?

364
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,824
You don't know. You're just
talking out of your ass.

365
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,860
Mom was a fucking basket case.
She found him on the floor.

366
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,763
She was, like, hysterical
for weeks.

367
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:37,134
She was a wreck, I was a wreck. I had to
do the flowers, I had to do the casket,

368
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,703
I had to do the cemetery,

369
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,904
I had to do the announcement,

370
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,472
- I had to do the invites.
- Okay.

371
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,407
You know what I mean? I don't
want to talk to those people.

372
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,109
Okay.

373
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,111
So, you can understand then...

374
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,314
No, I can't understand.

375
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,750
Look, you didn't want
my help, you know.

376
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,987
I mean, you're glad. You're
taking care of everything again,

377
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,688
and you look good,
and Mom loves you.

378
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,925
And that's the dynamic that you
have, and, "Oh, fucking, Connie."

379
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,727
"I know." You know.

380
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,129
I mean, that's fine.

381
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,031
Yeah, that's...
Your dynamic is just like,

382
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:10,701
oh, yeah, it's impossible and,
you know, everybody hates you.

383
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,805
Don't they?

384
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,583
This car taken?

385
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,820
Dude, I'm sorry. Okay?

386
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,556
Look, um...

387
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:37,094
Let's just go back to my house.
I'm gonna go do my thing.

388
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,163
Why don't you take the car?
You can do whatever,

389
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,485
the rest of the stuff
you want to do today.

390
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,139
I think we should smoke together.
All right?

391
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,840
I am not gonna smoke weed.

392
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,109
Why?

393
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,879
- I'm not in the mood for it.
- That's the point.

394
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,481
I think you need this, man.

395
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,517
- You have the day off, right?
- Yeah.

396
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,620
Okay. So let's enjoy the day.

397
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,497
You're right. I didn't
deal with Dad's death. Okay?

398
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,873
It's really good.

399
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,230
How do you feel?

400
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,306
It's pretty good.

401
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,174
What are we doing?

402
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,846
We're going to Leo and Rosemary
LaBianca's old residence.

403
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,717
All right.

404
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,145
- Is that it?
- God.

405
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,847
This is the LaBianca house, man.

406
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,749
Holy shit!

407
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,551
Come on. Come on.

408
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,989
I bet the kitchen is on this side,
and the kitchen is key here, okay?

409
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:48,959
Because that's where they wrote on the
fridge in blood, "Helter Skelter".

410
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,229
Oh. - That
all came from this kitchen.

411
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:54,565
Oh, my God.
I gotta get into the kitchen.

412
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,567
Go, go. Go.

413
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,070
I wish we could get closer.

414
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,572
Get up.

415
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,379
Oh, dude. There's the
owner of the house.

416
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,481
- What do we do?
- I got an idea.

417
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,284
What? What? Are you sure?

418
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,653
- Hey, um, excuse me.
- What are you doing?

419
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,588
Okay, just let me handle it.

420
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,623
Hi.

421
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,360
Um, we are... Can we talk
to you for a second?

422
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,296
No, I'm sorry.

423
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,298
- Oh.
- No.

424
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,700
- Um...
- What are you doing?

425
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,203
Just chill. Um...

426
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:35,272
We are the grandchildren
of the LaBiancas.

427
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,244
You're the grandchildren?

428
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,714
You'll have to forgive me for
being so defensive. -Wow.

429
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:48,152
You can imagine we have a lot of strange
people coming here all the time.

430
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,920
- No problem.
- Yeah.

431
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,022
All is in the past, you know.

432
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,691
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

433
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,994
It's amazing that you let us in.
I just thank you so much.

434
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,930
Yes, what he said.

435
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,500
Nice to meet you. -Good to meet you.
This is Conrad.

436
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,135
- Hi Conrad. I'm Janice.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

437
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,804
Beautiful skin.

438
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,472
Thank you.

439
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,241
Sorry, it's
a little messy in here.

440
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,616
Oh, no, it's beautiful.
What are you talking about?

441
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:13,711
This place is gorgeous.

442
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,747
Oh, well, I like to
keep it neater than this.

443
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,415
This is where the body was.

444
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,884
LaBianca, the guy.

445
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,686
They carved into his stomach.
They stabbed him right here.

446
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,988
Shut the fuck up.

447
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,659
Um, he was just saying
that this area right here,

448
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:32,596
we have a photograph with us
playing with trains right here.

449
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,499
This guy was so cute
in the photos.

450
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,034
- Yes.
- Of course.

451
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,571
Just being in this room is
so cool It's really... -Yes.

452
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,740
You know, special for us.

453
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,209
I'm sure this is not
a subject you're fond of,

454
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,712
but I was just wondering, you
know, after what happened here,

455
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,883
do you ever feel, like, you know,
just creeped out, you know?

456
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,785
No. Not really.

457
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:59,790
It is strange, knowing that Charles
Manson was actually in the house.

458
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,426
Wait. What?

459
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:04,628
Charles Manson was in the house?

460
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,264
Yes. He's the one who broke in.

461
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,866
That's weird,
because I had heard

462
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:12,336
that Charles Manson was not a
part of the murders at all.

463
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:16,507
Well, no, he just came in and tied them
up, but he wasn't part of the murders.

464
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,243
You know, at the Tate house
I told you it was such a mess.

465
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,778
And so they wanted to...

466
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,280
He just wanted to make sure
it was like cleaner... -Yeah.

467
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,216
You know, for... When the...
For the LaBiancas.

468
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,786
Mmmhmm. -I mean, Pop Pop.
You know.

469
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,321
Um...

470
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,923
I must sound like a freak.

471
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:37,695
I just... I mean, I've researched
it because it's our family.

472
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:41,332
Anyway, it fucking sucks that
that happened, obviously.

473
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,467
He's sorry.

474
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,203
Um, do you have... I mean, duh,

475
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,272
obviously, you have a kitchen,

476
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,754
but could we take
a quick look at it?

477
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,043
The kitchen?

478
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,845
Gee, I'm sorry, it's...

479
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,449
It's a real mess. Right now
I'd really rather you didn't.

480
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,051
I mean, I don't mind
if it's a little messy.

481
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,252
Maybe some other time.

482
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,188
But, you know, it's fine.
Like, I mean...

483
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,590
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

484
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,459
This is more than enough.

485
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,695
Well, I mean, this was
kind of the whole point.

486
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,097
I guess, just 'cause
of the memories.

487
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,102
But... -She doesn't want
us to go in the kitchen.

488
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,503
Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

489
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,605
No, it's all right.
I understand.

490
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,073
Maybe another time.

491
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:25,843
You know what? Thank you so
much for doing this for us.

492
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,844
You're very welcome.

493
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,146
You know, I actually
wanted to let you know,

494
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,916
when we were coming in, I saw that your
retaining wall right at the front here

495
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,351
was sloping a little bit.

496
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,220
So, on the way out
maybe I could show you that.

497
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,867
'Cause my wife and I went
through the same thing.

498
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:38,756
It was really easy to fix.

499
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:39,623
- Really?
- Yeah.

500
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,358
Did you need to go
to the bathroom?

501
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
Um, you had to go.

502
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,295
Oh, yeah. Okay, great.
I'll go to the bathroom.

503
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,597
- Yeah.
- I'll met you guys at...

504
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,032
- Cool.
- The retaining wall.

505
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,600
- Just over here?
- To the left.

506
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,201
This is so easy to fix.

507
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,603
Is it the one with the bricks?

508
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:54,471
Yeah, you gotta
catch it now, though.

509
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,592
Hey.

510
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,429
- Who are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

511
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,431
I'm sorry. I just... You're...

512
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,666
Is that
a Charlie Manson t-shirt?

513
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,670
Hey! Nick! Dude, abort!

514
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,972
- What are you doing?
- Get the hell out of here!

515
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,774
Hey!

516
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,578
Frank!
Frank, what are you doing?

517
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,514
I wake up from my nap
and this guy's in our kitchen

518
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,851
taking pictures
in a Charlie Manson shirt.

519
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,819
What?

520
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,688
- I'm sorry. I can explain.
- Explain!

521
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,770
Hey. Excuse me.

522
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,208
This is why we end up feeling
like prisoners in our own home.

523
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,113
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

524
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:12,716
I mean, you did choose to live here.
I mean...

525
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:17,454
I had no idea what we'd be getting
ourselves into when we bought this place.

526
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,389
I don't understand you.

527
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,592
A horrible thing happened here!

528
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,761
And you want to celebrate that?

529
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,131
Haven't you ever lost anyone?

530
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,639
I was, like, telling somebody
the other day my dad's dead.

531
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:38,542
I was, like, trying to be cool about it.
Mmmhmm.

532
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,645
But it's, like, weird
to say it, you know.

533
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:45,649
I don't know. It's just weird.

534
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:49,319
But here we are,
here, a perfect family.

535
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:52,990
This is the best shot
of you guys.

536
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,926
Like, you, Mom and Dad. This is,
like, what's always in my head.

537
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,428
Yeah. I hate that fucking photo.

538
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,863
You do?

539
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,366
- Yes.
- Why?

540
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,702
You can see how he fucking felt about me.
He's not even touching me.

541
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,572
He's just posing
for a photograph, man.

542
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:12,376
Okay, do you want to fucking argue
about the composition of the photo?

543
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:16,480
We're talking about reality, and
how the guy was kind of a dick.

544
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:21,084
I personally think that you expected
Dad to do everything for you as a kid.

545
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,988
- But, like...
- No, just to love me, maybe.

546
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,624
He's an army guy, all right?

547
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:32,329
And he has, you know, he has that power
thing, and that's part of his setup.

548
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,133
Like, you had to add that to that
a little bit, if you want...

549
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,135
That's not love.

550
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:41,705
That's not raising someone
to be their own person.

551
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,208
That's making
a little fucking clone.

552
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,910
So, uh, so what,
I'm dad's little soldier?

553
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,512
That's basically how you see me?

554
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,681
I mean, you have a kid,
you got the wife.

555
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,282
You know, everything,
which is good. I'm just...

556
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,351
- Yeah, I have a kid and a wife.
- It's a lot of good things.

557
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,788
You made him happy, he gave you
money because you were going

558
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,525
to "law school" and that's such a
great thing to do. -"Law school?"

559
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:05,162
You don't put air quotes around law school.
It's a real thing.

560
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,498
Which is how I earn a living
and buy food

561
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,634
to put inside the people
inside the house.

562
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,903
Yeah, it seems like it's
working out great for you.

563
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,012
That's it, huh? Hey!

564
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,949
You know, dad wasn't
the only one in the family

565
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,386
who treated me like
a fucking outcast, okay?

566
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,155
You did your fair share of
treating me like a piece of shit.

567
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,409
Do you know
where the Melatonin is?

568
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,745
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

569
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,782
I don't understand
how it disappears.

570
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,351
Like, who takes the Melatonin?

571
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,976
You seem really agitated.
Is something wrong?

572
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,329
Conrad basically thinks that I threw him
under the bus our entire childhood.

573
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,165
And that I got
special treatment.

574
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,069
Yeah.

575
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,605
What do you mean, "Yeah"?

576
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,342
You know that you and your dad
had a really strong bond, right?

577
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,945
Mmmhmm. -And I can
understand how Connie

578
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,514
probably felt
excluded from you guys.

579
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,450
Okay, he excluded himself.

580
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,118
But that doesn't... Why?

581
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,822
That's what he does. He likes to,
like, act like the outsider,

582
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:41,818
and like, push people away,
and poke and prod people.

583
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:43,260
He gets off on that shit.

584
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,495
Why would he get off
on something like that?

585
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,864
Because he's
messed up in the head.

586
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,633
- Genetically, probably.
- Dude.

587
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,569
Like, I looked into
his adoption one time,

588
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:55,005
and it said that he
was a ward of the state.

589
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,773
That's so mean. Stop it.

590
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,408
You asked me, and my answer is

591
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,345
I think there's some weird
chemistry going on in his brain.

592
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,817
Well, I think that
no matter what Connie,

593
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,086
or anyone ever does,

594
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,488
they will never
measure up for you.

595
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,090
No one's good enough.

596
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,527
Great. Okay.

597
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,397
Can I get a pillow?

598
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,234
Good talk.

599
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,774
I'm just a messenger
of the truth.

600
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,075
God's messenger?

601
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,445
Life's messenger.
But we use the word "God".

602
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,382
"God" hooks
all the other words up.

603
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,284
I'm the pope.
I'm ten times the pope.

604
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,919
I'm 50 times the pope.

605
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,555
But I'm the pope
in the hills and the mountains.

606
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,090
<i>I'm already out of here.</i>

607
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,926
<i>This enclosure here?
I'm out of here.</i>

608
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,862
<i>My body is stuck here,</i>

609
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,231
<i>but my thought is already gone.</i>

610
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,973
Cool. Battle?

611
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,742
Mmm-hmm. Wanna meet him?
We're friends.

612
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,310
Oh, cool.

613
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,713
I'm so
glad that we're friends now.

614
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:14,451
I've been watching you and I like
the way you fight. I admire you.

615
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,520
- Here!
- Escape! Chuck!

616
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,089
What's this?

617
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,626
Oh, this is a book,
uh,<i> Helter Skelter.</i>

618
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,994
Are there pictures?

619
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,663
Um, yeah. Um, a couple.

620
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,233
Hold on, hold on. Let me see
which ones are okay to look at.

621
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,235
Wait, wait.

622
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,639
Yeah, there's a nice
picture of a family.

623
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,941
Are they real
brothers and sisters?

624
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,876
No, they're, um,

625
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,512
they're not a real family. It's
actually better than a real family

626
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,015
because they went out
and found each other.

627
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,451
What are they doing
in the middle of this desert?

628
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:51,354
Well, they... They wanted
to get away from society

629
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,757
and from people
that didn't understand them,

630
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,827
you know, because that was
like hurting them,

631
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,829
other peoples
perception of them.

632
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:02,399
So they went out here
and they got a big bus,

633
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:04,067
and you know, they cared
about the environment.

634
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,636
They wanted to get back
into touch with something,

635
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,039
you know, more real.

636
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,808
What are all of these
dead people?

637
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,480
Oh, um, they're just some people
who just, I don't know...

638
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,949
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

639
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,317
Like Grandpa?

640
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,920
No. Grandpa died
because he had a heart attack.

641
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,756
Um, these people
were actually killed.

642
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,625
But Grandpa, like,
killed himself in a way

643
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,863
because he was... worked
himself up all the time.

644
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:34,264
What are you guys talking about?

645
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,633
Oh, nothing, just
hanging out, playing...

646
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,202
We're reading<i> Helter Skelter.</i>

647
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,639
There's really cool pictures
of dead people.

648
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,182
All right, before you start,

649
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,185
I was just looking at the book,
he asked me questions.

650
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,987
He's curious.
What am I gonna fucking say?

651
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,755
- You're showing him dead bodies?
- I was trying to...

652
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,423
You're showing him
the Manson family?

653
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:02,225
What else are
you gonna show him?

654
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,361
I'm sorry, but he's the one
who kept asking me questions.

655
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:07,631
He's a child. He's gonna want
to do whatever you want to do.

656
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,166
You just say no.

657
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,134
If he wants to look at it you just say no.
That's what you do.

658
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,937
Why? I'm not gonna
fucking lie to him.

659
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,406
Why don't you just
open up Internet fucking porn

660
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,108
and show him everything that's out there.

661
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,943
It's not funny, dude.
He's having a really hard time

662
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,045
and I don't need you
putting your shit on him.

663
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,247
Okay. Well, why is he
having a hard time?

664
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,184
"Why is he having a hard
time?" He's a child.

665
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,353
Growing up is hard.
People have hard times.

666
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,924
Okay, yeah. It has nothing to
do with like how you treat him.

667
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:36,459
You are so clueless right now,

668
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,461
you have no idea
what you're talking about.

669
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:41,464
You don't... -What are these
words coming out of my mouth?

670
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,101
Oh, my God, dude. You are so
fucking out of touch with reality.

671
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,337
- I can't even deal with it.
- Yeah, fuck you.

672
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,440
Are you gonna go
to your job or not?

673
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,142
Okay. That's it?

674
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,711
What else?

675
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah, all right. Cool.

676
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,970
So, um,

677
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,505
I'm gonna drive you
out there, okay?

678
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,242
Okay. I mean...

679
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,643
What?

680
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,578
She guilted you into it?

681
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,648
Kind of, yeah.

682
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,573
Who's this?

683
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,743
Is it okay?

684
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,378
Yeah, it's pretty good.

685
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,581
It's Charlie.

686
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,550
That's him singing?

687
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,353
Oh, it was his main thing.
He was so into music.

688
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,888
That's what he wanted to do.

689
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,390
Like, in LA, he knew Neil Young,

690
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,093
and like, Dennis Wilson of the
Beach Boys really liked him.

691
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,629
He was so close to
getting a record contract.

692
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,864
I mean, I don't know,
it just fell through.

693
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,333
Yeah.

694
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,836
He's like a frustrated
artist, basically.

695
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:05,408
I mean,
every artist is frustrated.

696
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,411
You know,
like, it's frustrating.

697
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,480
Is that how you feel
about your stuff?

698
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,250
Boo-ya.

699
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,720
I mean, you know,
it's like, what's the point?

700
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,756
Well, I mean, you know, the point is
you've been doing it your whole life

701
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,191
and you're really good at it.

702
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,228
Dude.

703
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,865
- Okay.
- What?

704
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,969
You are. You've been amazing
at it since you were a kid.

705
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,871
Like the painting
in your house, right?

706
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,607
Yeah, it's fucking amazing.

707
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,575
Fuck.

708
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,435
Shit.

709
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,489
Fuck!

710
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:01,558
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

711
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,926
A cop.

712
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,230
Pull over.

713
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,232
I wasn't even
fucking doing anything!

714
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,934
Well, pull over.

715
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,669
Dude, I can't. I can't!

716
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,670
Why?

717
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,638
- Pull over.
- Fucking shit! Okay!

718
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,749
Dude, um,
we got to switch seats.

719
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,219
What? -Dude, come on,
switch seats with me.

720
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:32,155
Why? -I just... I was
trying to help you out.

721
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,326
- Roll it down.
- Okay.

722
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,729
Hello. Hi.

723
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,364
Do you know why
I pulled you over, sir?

724
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,601
Um, yeah, I know I might
have swerved a little bit.

725
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,003
But I was just, like,
dropped a CD.

726
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,873
You know, it got all scratched up
and I was trying to clean it off.

727
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:54,344
Anyway, but it's back in there, we're fine.
Thank you for the reminder.

728
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,714
Uh-huh. Can I see your license,
registration and insurance, please?

729
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,784
It's really not necessary.
I mean...

730
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,220
Here's the registration
and insurance.

731
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,889
Sir, please keep
your hands on the wheel.

732
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,457
Okay.

733
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,826
Just do what he says.

734
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,461
And the license, sir?

735
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,766
You do not have a drivers license,
is that what I understand?

736
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,168
No. Are you gonna
give me a big lecture now?

737
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,705
Do you realize it is a serious offense
to operate a vehicle without a license?

738
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,141
I can take you in right now
and impound this vehicle.

739
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,011
I'm so happy
you have such power over me.

740
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,712
Have you been drinking, sir?

741
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,215
No, I have not
been drinking, sir.

742
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,383
All right, watch the tone.

743
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,351
We've just had
a really tough ride.

744
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,754
My brother and I
are not getting along well.

745
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,589
Okay, I need you to put
your hands on the hood, please.

746
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,058
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Do not resist me.

747
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,293
Do not resist me.

748
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,495
I'm not fucking... Jesus Christ!

749
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,997
- Do you have a weapon on you?
- No!

750
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,800
Does that feel good,
to fucking grab me, you pig?

751
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:51,734
Stop talking!

752
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,510
You're free to go.

753
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,151
Jesus, that guy was such a dick.

754
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,954
The cop that you called a pig?

755
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,057
He was.

756
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,193
How much was it?

757
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,462
Um, it was not cheap.

758
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,931
Shit. How much?

759
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,633
- Thousand.
- Thousand?

760
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,734
Yeah.

761
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,103
I talked them
down to 600, though.

762
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,237
- Really?
- Yeah.

763
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,539
- That's great.
- I know, it's what I do.

764
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,274
All right.
Here, I'll pay you back.

765
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,809
Hey. Hey.

766
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,514
Three, four, five...

767
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:39,949
Six.

768
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,785
What are you doing with
thousands of dollars?

769
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,089
I told you, I sold all my stuff.

770
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:49,371
You can keep it. You're
gonna need it more than me.

771
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:22,859
This is, um, not what I had in
mind when you said "their office."

772
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,129
It's a home office.
They work out of their home.

773
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,697
Jesus. All right.

774
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,135
This is probably it.

775
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:34,203
I don't think anybody's here.

776
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,579
Hello. We're coming in.

777
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,416
Hello, it's Conrad.

778
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:47,717
Careful.

779
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,986
There's probably like
a dog in here or something.

780
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,688
Oh, my God.

781
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,356
Hello?

782
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,024
There's nobody in here.

783
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,763
Can't you just call them?

784
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,965
They don't give out
their phone number.

785
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:03,966
Why not?

786
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,069
Because they're...
They have to be careful.

787
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:10,773
They... They have a website, but they don't
give out their email and phone number.

788
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,875
Why do they have to be careful?

789
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,044
Because they're an environmental group.
They get harassed.

790
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,080
Environmental groups
don't get harassed.

791
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:18,381
- You're so naive.
- Look.

792
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,683
This doesn't feel like a job.
It feels like a terrorist thing.

793
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:23,653
Dude, it's a non-profit.
What do you want me to say?

794
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:25,822
Just help me look around.

795
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,057
- For what?
- I don't know. Just...

796
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,960
Clues.

797
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,018
Blackbird and Sunshine.

798
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,324
Whoa. Come here.

799
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,759
What?

800
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,662
- What is it?
- An address.

801
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,604
That's 6259 right there.

802
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,172
It's gonna be right here.

803
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,614
Is that it?

804
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:25,948
Yeah, that's it.

805
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,785
What? That's
a fucking tattoo parlor.

806
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,187
They probably have tattoos.

807
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,022
Okay. So what do we do?

808
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,925
Do you have the photo? -Yeah, but
we can't just wave it around,

809
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,426
like, "Oh, FBI."

810
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,728
Right.

811
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,264
Um... Oh, what if
we did, like, a bait-and-switch?

812
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:42,498
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

813
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,666
You know what I'm talking about?

814
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,201
No. What do you mean?

815
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:48,638
So this is your first tattoo?

816
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,939
- Yeah.
- Okay.

817
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,607
All right, yeah,
you look kind of Irish.

818
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,676
Maybe some of those
Celtic designs, or

819
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,646
you could go with something
a little more American.

820
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,617
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

821
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,423
Hey, I was wondering if you could take
a look at this photograph right here.

822
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:10,827
I'm a little busy right now, dude.
Can it wait a second?

823
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,062
Sure. No problem.

824
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,098
You, uh,

825
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,600
doing a pentagram?

826
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,937
You want one?

827
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,306
- Maybe I do.
- Looks like it'd suit you.

828
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,008
What can I help you with, man?

829
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,910
I'm just looking for this guy.
He's a buddy of mine.

830
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,478
Haven't seen him in a long time.

831
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,713
Does he come around here at all?

832
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,048
Never seen him.

833
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,983
You?

834
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,393
Anything else
we can help you with?

835
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,289
No.

836
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,361
Excuse me. Have you seen
this gentleman right here?

837
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,530
Uh... No, sorry, pal.

838
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:49,098
Cool. Thanks, man.

839
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,603
Fucking cop.

840
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:57,006
I know that guy in the picture from
somewhere but I can't think of where.

841
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,742
It's that creepy guy who's
always chilling at The Palms.

842
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,377
Dude at the bar.

843
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,346
He's a scary motherfucker.

844
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,856
Seriously, when I
said bait-and-switch,

845
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,492
I was mostly just trying
to, like, make you feel good.

846
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,427
'Cause you were so panicked.

847
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,329
Dude, it was
exactly as you said.

848
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:23,466
The... You left,
and I'm like, "What the..."

849
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,548
I was like, "I'm right here."

850
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,605
Well, no one would ever
believe that we're together.

851
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,140
Yeah.

852
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,013
All right. Check it out.

853
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,718
You're a nut, man.

854
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,722
He's not going to come, man.

855
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,357
Stop worrying.
He'll either come,

856
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,626
or we'll talk to those people
and we'll figure it out, okay?

857
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,528
- Don't mind hanging out?
- No, I don't.

858
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,697
I'm enjoying myself.

859
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,365
I'm enjoying
whooping your fucking ass.

860
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,701
Listen to this.
You wanna hear a sound?

861
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,102
Listen to this sound.

862
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,208
Right?

863
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,443
Oh, God.

864
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:12,448
So...

865
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,653
I got to tell you. I am sorry
about what happened with Max.

866
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,689
I was not trying to...

867
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,824
You know, that wasn't my plan.

868
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,460
The book was there, he asked me.

869
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:28,364
I mean, I know I shouldn't
have, but I told him.

870
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:31,567
I get it. I get it.
I'm sorry I yelled.

871
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,003
You know, I'm... I overreacted.

872
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,973
And I'm just...
I'm worried about him.

873
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:40,843
He's, you know... Sometimes I
worry he's not totally normal.

874
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:44,180
You know? I mean, he's, like...
Talks about death a lot.

875
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,649
- Mmm-hmm.
- And he's into weird stuff.

876
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,086
He drew this picture
with people, like,

877
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,189
you know, bleeding
out of their faces. Right?

878
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:55,658
Well, Dad died.

879
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,560
- Yeah.
- He's dealing with that.

880
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:00,882
You know, he's working
it out in the drawings.

881
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,133
Yeah.

882
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,168
He's dealing with
the idea of death.

883
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,404
It's like a real thing
for him now.

884
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:09,839
He's fine.

885
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,907
I mean, he will be.

886
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,349
You got to be there
for him, though.

887
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,179
That's fucking deep, man.

888
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,416
You just dropped it
on me just now.

889
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:24,954
It's true.

890
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,759
- Dude.
- What?

891
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:31,193
That's Blackbird.

892
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,313
That's him.
I'm gonna check it out.

893
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,275
Why is this girl
wearing a Manson t-shirt?

894
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,978
- Is she?
- Yeah.

895
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,114
She's wearing the same
t-shirt that you had on.

896
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:55,718
I... I hadn't noticed that.

897
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,219
I'm gonna just go over
and talk to him.

898
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,555
Wait, wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

899
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,824
I...

900
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,070
I don't know. I mean...
I'll tell you after, okay?

901
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:04,994
I just gotta talk...

902
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:07,730
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Talk to me first.

903
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,366
Talk to me first. What is that?

904
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:13,169
Tell me what the fuck is going
on with that Manson t-shirt.

905
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:16,205
Okay, the environmental group,

906
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,708
they have a slight
association with Charlie.

907
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,577
He just started the group.

908
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,345
He started
the environmental group?

909
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:27,349
Yes. This group is picking up on the
positive aspects of his philosophy.

910
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,685
He was actually
talking about the environment,

911
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,087
you know,
before a lot of people.

912
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,089
You're coming out here
to work with Charles Manson?

913
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,357
- Dude.
- See, I knew.

914
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,693
I fucking bring up Charles Manson
and you fucking freak out.

915
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,095
Everybody freaks out!

916
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:41,897
Everybody freaks out when you
bring up Charles Manson!

917
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,134
Fuck! Where did he go? Oh.

918
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,904
Shit.

919
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,541
Come on! He's getting away.

920
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,643
Okay, here's the deal.

921
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,512
I am willing to follow this guy,

922
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,714
but you don't get out of
the car until I say so.

923
00:51:58,716 --> 00:51:59,949
That's him!

924
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,184
Okay, okay. All right.

925
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,886
Shit, go around this guy.

926
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,521
All right, I'm not
gonna get too close.

927
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:08,090
Yeah, yeah. -We'll just wait and
let's just see what happens.

928
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:09,692
What is the plan?
What are we doing?

929
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,294
I gotta show him this letter
I have, and it'll be fine.

930
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,164
- Blackbird should know who I am.
- What's with the names?

931
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,565
Blackbird.

932
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,734
Charlie gives
everybody nicknames.

933
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,536
He's turning, he's turning.

934
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:21,737
Go, go, go.

935
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,272
Nice!

936
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,578
Where the fuck did he go?

937
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,280
Go... Go faster.

938
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.

939
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,699
He must have gone around back.

940
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,868
Hold on a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

941
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,471
Where'd he go?

942
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,273
- Hello?
- He was just here.

943
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,141
Can you slow down?

944
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,275
Hey!

945
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,995
Fuck!

946
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,365
Shit!

947
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,737
Go, go, go!

948
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,539
Hey!

949
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,074
Motherfucker!

950
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,511
Hey! Hey! Leave him alone!

951
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,979
Wait! I'm Conrad!

952
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,547
I've been writing to Charlie!

953
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,116
He told me! He told me I
could work with you guys!

954
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,219
I'm Conrad Morgan!

955
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,354
Please don't hurt us.

956
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,490
Morgan?

957
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,628
You're Captain Morgan?

958
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:55,864
Yes. -Charlie fucking talks
about you all the time.

959
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,366
Every day.

960
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:00,202
- Every day he talks about you.
- Okay. Yeah.

961
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,204
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

962
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,041
Lean back. This eye.

963
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,577
Okay. -You've gotta just
keep it open for me.

964
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,046
Okay. No, you have to open it.

965
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,048
- It's, like, burning.
- There we go. Quickly.

966
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,651
Okay, go. -It sees the
thing and it retracts.

967
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:19,722
I know. They're like
two little angry clams.

968
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:22,791
What?

969
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:24,893
They're chomping down.

970
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,629
- Other eye.
- Okay.

971
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,732
One, two...

972
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,700
Now blink that eye.

973
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,137
Breathe. In through your nose.

974
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,539
Out through your mouth.

975
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,082
Now I can see you.

976
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,052
Good.

977
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:52,288
You look better.

978
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,858
Your eyes are so blue,
like icicles.

979
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,197
I'm gonna go
put this stuff away.

980
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,033
Thanks.

981
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,741
Oh, my God.

982
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,576
What did she say?

983
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:18,647
She said, "I don't mind
that you saw me naked."

984
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,317
You can't do that.

985
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,152
I think that's
Blackbird's girlfriend.

986
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,287
I don't know. I don't think so.

987
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:29,458
I'm afraid you're gonna get hit in the
head with a fucking lead pipe, you know.

988
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,630
And what's with...
You wrote a letter to Manson?

989
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,501
- Yeah.
- And he wrote you back?

990
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:43,906
You know, I mean, we have stuff
in common, like, you know, he...

991
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,208
never knew
who his dad was and stuff,

992
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,011
and had a tough time growing up.

993
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,381
I know it sounds weird,
but, yeah, just...

994
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,651
I was not doing that well
and I wrote him,

995
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,387
and he wrote me back and...

996
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,422
that's pretty cool.

997
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:03,992
The things he said, it was...
It helped me a lot.

998
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,394
And what did he say?

999
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,134
Conrad, come here.

1000
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:14,470
I'm gonna talk a walk with you.
There's something I want to show you.

1001
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:16,912
Something that you're probably
gonna be pretty excited to see.

1002
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,907
Can my brother come?

1003
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,944
Suit yourself.

1004
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,719
Conrad, I don't know
if you're aware of this,

1005
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:35,090
but, uh, they threw Charlie into
solitary couple of weeks ago.

1006
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,426
- So I haven't been able to reach him.
- Uh-huh.

1007
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,728
He's supposed to
get out pretty soon,

1008
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,097
but you never know with
these fucking pigs up there.

1009
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,332
Yeah.

1010
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,534
Why'd they
throw him in solitary?

1011
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,237
Why?

1012
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,642
You think they
need a reason why?

1013
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,745
Yeah, they don't need a reason,
you know, with Charlie.

1014
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,047
Well, he's in the legal system.
I would think that they'd

1015
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,550
have to have a reason to put
him in solitary confinement.

1016
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,420
They like blaming Charlie.

1017
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,555
He's their Christ on the cross.

1018
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,225
And they ain't
never gonna take him down.

1019
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,598
- I don't get it.
- Don't be a jerk.

1020
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,355
Holy shit.
Is that what I think it is?

1021
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:42,491
Sure is.

1022
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,794
Oh, God.

1023
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,897
- What is it?
- It's the bus.

1024
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,033
The Manson family bus.

1025
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:58,507
I can't believe it still exists!

1026
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,715
Can I go inside?

1027
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:07,916
Sure.

1028
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,022
I'll just be a minute.

1029
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,504
Well.

1030
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:31,440
Jesus Christ.
I can't believe it.

1031
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,610
Is this the same stove?

1032
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,645
- This is the original?
- Yeah. That's it.

1033
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,747
- Oh, my God.
- Nothing changed.

1034
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,853
Piece of history.

1035
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,522
Why don't you try.

1036
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,024
Charlie's old seat over there?

1037
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,794
All right.

1038
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:03,105
Charlie drove everywhere
in this thing.

1039
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:05,908
Drove all over California,
stopped by the side of the road,

1040
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,645
picked up kids that had been kicked
out of their homes, you know.

1041
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,047
Yeah. He helped a lot of people.

1042
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,386
You know, this world is more of a
mess now even than it was then.

1043
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:21,490
We got these guys down at Washington,
can't get out of their own way.

1044
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:24,359
Rich people,
snacking on the poor.

1045
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,696
We got fire coming out
of our water faucets

1046
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,698
'cause of all the fracking
that's going on.

1047
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,302
We got fish belly-up
in the rivers and streams.

1048
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,744
We do a lot of talking about it.

1049
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,410
But we're not doing very much
about any of those things.

1050
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,149
That's one beautiful place, huh?

1051
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:50,485
Yeah.

1052
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:54,790
Well, I'm working with some
people, they're gonna preserve and protect

1053
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,258
every bit of this.

1054
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,728
And you're gonna be a real
good addition to the group.

1055
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,698
Welcome home, brother.

1056
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:25,020
Hey, y'all. Welcome home.

1057
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:26,688
Hey, beautiful.

1058
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,725
Nice night for a walk.

1059
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,427
Yeah. We had a good time.

1060
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,869
Hello, y'all.

1061
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:46,475
It's who you've been waiting for.
This is Conrad.

1062
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:58,487
Uh, well, first off,
thank you so much for

1063
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:01,323
welcoming me into this.

1064
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,426
Um, I guess like
a lot of us, maybe...

1065
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:07,129
I've been struggling
to find my way.

1066
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,698
And, um...

1067
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,500
Well, you found your
way here, that's good.

1068
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:12,801
Yeah. Thanks.

1069
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:14,670
And we sure do
need you, don't we?

1070
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,638
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

1071
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,776
Thanks. I feel
a part of you guys. Right?

1072
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,645
I mean...

1073
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:25,414
Look at you bunch of freaks.

1074
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,149
Right?

1075
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,851
That's what they think.
We're not the crazy ones.

1076
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,889
And it is so good
to be here around people

1077
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,224
who don't have
all that fucking judgment.

1078
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:39,394
And are okay with seeming crazy.

1079
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:42,764
Anyway, thank you. I...

1080
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:46,368
I feel like I've found,
uh, you know, a home.

1081
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,704
- Thank you.
- Hear, hear.

1082
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,844
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

1083
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:31,213
- That's a nice fire, right?
- Yeah.

1084
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,614
You having a good time?

1085
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:35,550
Listen, um,
what the hell is going on?

1086
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,286
Charlie told them about me,

1087
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:41,423
and, you know... -What did
he tell them about you?

1088
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,525
Just about me, you know,
and just...

1089
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,560
I mean, stuff that... Whatever.

1090
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,763
I'm not gonna go into it 'cause it's like,
annoying, to you, I know. I don't wanna...

1091
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,966
No, I kind of feel like... Are
you not telling me something?

1092
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:54,202
No, it's just, you know, the...

1093
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:56,938
Well, it's like a personal
connection that we have.

1094
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,643
Look, um... -Dude, just
come in and have a drink.

1095
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:04,746
I gotta go, man.
I gotta get back.

1096
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,414
- It's getting late.
- Okay.

1097
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,883
Then, I guess, "See ya."

1098
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:10,185
No, I just...
What I'm trying to say is

1099
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:12,888
I don't... I feel weird
about leaving you here.

1100
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,323
Well, 'cause you're judging them.
Come on in, have a drink.

1101
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,892
- I'm not judging them.
- Connie.

1102
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,560
Connie, I've been
looking for you.

1103
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:19,828
Hi. How you doing?

1104
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,563
- Come back inside.
- Okay.

1105
01:03:21,565 --> 01:03:23,999
Dude, come on in.

1106
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,868
- Come on. I wanna talk to you.
- Come in.

1107
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,870
Just give it an hour, man.

1108
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,640
He's shy.

1109
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,790
You haven't seen the site?
Have you seen our new site?

1110
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,225
- No.
- Have you seen the lab?

1111
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,861
It's really good.
You did a bang up job.

1112
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,699
- Hey.
- Hey, man. What's up?

1113
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:33,735
You're, uh, you're Conrad's
brother, aren't you?

1114
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:36,538
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, he's off the hook.

1115
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,406
He's absolutely amazing.

1116
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,975
Yeah. Awesome.

1117
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,677
- Is this your website for the group?
- Yeah.

1118
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,013
This is our new website.

1119
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,384
- It says<i> Helter Skelter.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

1120
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:54,089
Yeah. How does that fit in
with the environmental thing?

1121
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:57,993
Helter Skelter is basically, it's
what's going on in the world right now.

1122
01:04:57,995 --> 01:04:59,628
It's the chaos that's happening.

1123
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,364
We're trying to stop it from
happening, but it's happening.

1124
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,399
It's happening fast.

1125
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,203
Do you feel that?

1126
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,906
It feels so good.

1127
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,009
Yeah.

1128
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:17,112
When I'm around you
I feel like...

1129
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,114
Like, even if you're
far away from me,

1130
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:22,951
like, on the other side of the room,
I feel like I'm touching you.

1131
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,686
Wow.

1132
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,222
You just met me.

1133
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,124
I don't think so.

1134
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,494
Yeah, I feel like that, too.

1135
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:36,998
That's why we can even talk about it.
That's why we even notice it.

1136
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,935
You know? -It's actually
been a long time for me.

1137
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:43,038
You know, feeling
like this with somebody.

1138
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,641
I don't know,
I felt it like right...

1139
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:49,611
I mean, not when
I was pepper-spraying you.

1140
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:53,848
- Shortly thereafter.
- Right. Shortly thereafter.

1141
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,216
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1142
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:59,187
Give a guy a minute before
you fall in love with him.

1143
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,623
Yeah.

1144
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,145
Well, you'll be easy
to fall in love with.

1145
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,929
You're so strong.

1146
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,264
Jeez.

1147
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,801
You're so brave.

1148
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,804
You're so beautiful.

1149
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,348
Uh, do you know
where my brother is?

1150
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,658
Uh, no.

1151
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,626
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1152
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,396
Hey, Nick.
Can I ask you a question?

1153
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:47,635
Your brother tells me that you might
be able to give us some legal advice.

1154
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:48,803
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1155
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,605
Yeah, what do you wanna know?

1156
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,474
- He said you're a lawyer.
- Yeah.

1157
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:56,478
We wanna file a petition
for a new parole hearing.

1158
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,181
Yeah. I mean, I'm not a criminal
lawyer, so, you know...

1159
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,916
I could look at papers, maybe.

1160
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,219
That would be excellent.
That'd be great. Thank you.

1161
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,489
Of course.

1162
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:09,391
I wanna get him out of there.

1163
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:13,728
I wanna get him introduced
and reunited with his son.

1164
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,197
Oh. Who's his son?

1165
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,401
Come here.

1166
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,107
You know,
maybe you don't know this,

1167
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:29,277
but old Charlie,
he had quite a few kids.

1168
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:32,280
And they locked him up and
they took all the kids away.

1169
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,802
And they put them
with new families.

1170
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,885
Like yours.

1171
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,722
Yeah, I think
my parents would have known.

1172
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,458
I mean, they have to
reveal that legally.

1173
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:47,328
They didn't reveal anything back then.
Nothing.

1174
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:52,634
Conrad was a ward of the state and he
was adopted just like a normal kid.

1175
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:56,237
See that baby?
That's your brother.

1176
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,358
I need to talk to my brother.

1177
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,094
- Okay.
- Um...

1178
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,196
I'm gonna go back
out to the party.

1179
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,932
- Okay. I'll meet up with you. All right.
- I'll see you later.

1180
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:26,601
Um, you kind of
interrupted something, man.

1181
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,970
Is it true?

1182
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:31,339
Blackbird fucking
told me just now.

1183
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,209
That's real?

1184
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:35,944
Yeah.

1185
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,712
You're not gonna
fucking tell me?

1186
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:41,416
I don't know, man. I just, like,
fucking can't say anything.

1187
01:08:41,418 --> 01:08:44,319
I mean, you're... Look at how
you're fucking reacting!

1188
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,020
Hey, Conrad.

1189
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:47,522
Charlie's on the phone.

1190
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,261
Dude, I gotta go.

1191
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,806
Hey.

1192
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,541
Yeah, he's right here.

1193
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,345
I'm gonna put him on.

1194
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,550
He's out of solitary.

1195
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,722
Hi.

1196
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:23,124
Yeah, good to talk to you, man.

1197
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,094
What the fuck, man?

1198
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,130
What are you doing, man?

1199
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:31,633
Get your shit,
get in the fucking car now.

1200
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:33,635
I sense you're very angry, man.

1201
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,436
This is not really the time.

1202
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:37,472
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1203
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:40,708
Yeah, I'm out of my mind 'cause I want
to have a fucking phone-call, man.

1204
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,478
Sorry, everyone. Um, can we
get him back on the line?

1205
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,446
You're not
fucking talking to him!

1206
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:47,850
Okay! Dude, maybe just
have a fucking drink.

1207
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:52,120
Why don't you just get in the car and
drive the fuck out of here? All right?

1208
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,624
Do not pick it up!
Do not pick that phone up!

1209
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:59,260
You're trying to just
fucking fuck this up for me.

1210
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,064
Fine. Pick it up!

1211
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,533
Pick it up, you fucking idiot!

1212
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,135
I mean...

1213
01:10:07,137 --> 01:10:10,405
I'm just trying to talk
to my father here. Okay?

1214
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,443
Hello.

1215
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:17,278
Dad was right about you.

1216
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,258
Fuck!

1217
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:10,064
Imagine if we had
a baby together.

1218
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:12,133
Can we name it "Manson"?

1219
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,839
What?

1220
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,675
What?

1221
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,076
- Nothing.
- Is that weird?

1222
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,711
- No, it's...
- That was weird.

1223
01:11:23,713 --> 01:11:25,413
That's just a lot.

1224
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,849
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to say that.

1225
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,318
I didn't...

1226
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,687
Forget I said that. Okay?

1227
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,823
- It's okay. Yeah.
- Everyone's Manson.

1228
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,759
Man's son, you know?

1229
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,827
- Son of man.
- Every baby.

1230
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:42,463
Every baby is man's son.

1231
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:46,066
You know, Charlie always say
that everything is love.

1232
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:47,769
Everything is love.

1233
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,103
Hmm.

1234
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,074
Even how you
just felt right then.

1235
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:56,444
Even that, that
pulling away part is love.

1236
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:00,573
You can feel that way with me.

1237
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,916
Hey. What are you doing here?

1238
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,285
I'm getting back to work.

1239
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:45,887
What do you mean
you're getting back to work?

1240
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:47,555
Hey, look at me. What happened?

1241
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,425
Um...

1242
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:52,994
Just... -Just stop working.
What happened?

1243
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,563
Um... I need to do this.

1244
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:58,833
Tell me what's going on. Why are you here?
What happened?

1245
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,673
What happened?

1246
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:09,316
What are you doing? You're acting crazy.
What's going on?

1247
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,428
Are you okay? What happened?
Are you okay?

1248
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,786
I fucked up.

1249
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,655
I fucked it up.

1250
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,890
Baby, what happened?

1251
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,727
What happened? Are you okay?

1252
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,165
I'm fine. I'm just
a horrible person.

1253
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:34,268
What are you talking about?
You're not a horrible person.

1254
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,738
I don't know what to do.

1255
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:55,283
Conrad, come on.
We're running late.

1256
01:15:55,285 --> 01:15:56,565
Be right there.

1257
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,128
I wanna see my brother.

1258
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,411
I don't think
he wants to see you.

1259
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,132
Connie!

1260
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,833
He went to visit Charlie.

1261
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,570
Connie's dad.

1262
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,706
That's a whole new look for you.

1263
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,207
Yeah. Uh...

1264
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:23,144
Hopefully, he doesn't
think I'm an idiot, you know.

1265
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:25,212
I think he'll like it.

1266
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:26,881
Make him feel right at home.

1267
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,065
Home sweet home.

1268
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,173
We're here for
the visiting hours.

1269
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,151
ID?

1270
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:09,023
Okay.

1271
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,366
Hey, Connie!

1272
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,001
Connie!

1273
01:17:20,003 --> 01:17:22,003
Hey. Sir, can I get in here?

1274
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:23,204
Not without a pass.

1275
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:24,639
Just go home, Nick.

1276
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:26,207
Dude, come here.
I need to talk to you.

1277
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:28,075
Just one second. Please!

1278
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,277
Fuck him. We got five minutes.

1279
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,612
Let's go. We gotta go.

1280
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:33,414
- Connie!
- I gotta go!

1281
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:36,651
No, no, no, no, no, no! Please! I just
need to talk to you for one minute!

1282
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:39,153
It's so important.
Just one minute!

1283
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,756
I'm gonna
handle this, all right?

1284
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,127
Oh. Oh, God.

1285
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,030
What?

1286
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:50,564
Did he shave your head?

1287
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,133
No!

1288
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:55,069
Is this another fucking thing
you're gonna come down on me about?

1289
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,004
No. Look...

1290
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,205
What?

1291
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,107
Okay.

1292
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,945
That stuff with Dad that
you were talking about before.

1293
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,650
Dad was an asshole to you.

1294
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:12,687
He treated you like a piece
of shit, and I did, too.

1295
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:15,122
And I threw you under the bus.

1296
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,825
And... I'm just...

1297
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:19,994
I'm ashamed.

1298
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,765
I came to tell you
that you're right about me.

1299
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,368
And about me being like Dad.

1300
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,770
And about the way
that I am with you,

1301
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:32,252
and the way that I am with Max.

1302
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,943
And I just...

1303
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,612
I... You're right,
and I'm sorry.

1304
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,216
I'm not gonna
do it anymore. Okay?

1305
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,952
Okay. -I'm gonna be a
really good brother to you.

1306
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,854
I don't know how
to fucking do that,

1307
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:49,557
but I can, like,
follow your lead.

1308
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:54,829
You know how long I've been
wanting you to say that?

1309
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,532
Conrad, come on! We gotta go.

1310
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:00,434
Come on. Come out here
and give me a fucking hug, dude.

1311
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:03,916
Let's get in the car, let's
get some fucking McDonald's.

1312
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:07,174
That's, like, the funnest
thing you can think of?

1313
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:10,711
I don't fucking know how to have fun, dude.
That's why I need you, dude!

1314
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,747
I need a fucking Happy Meal.

1315
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:15,883
Come on, just come on.
Let's get in the fucking car.

1316
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:17,818
Dude...

1317
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,021
I... I gotta go in, man.

1318
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,891
You're going in there?

1319
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,026
He's my dad.

1320
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:28,129
I gotta see this
through, all right?

1321
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,769
I'm sorry, I'm fucking...

1322
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,272
Charles Manson's son.

1323
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,008
It's fucked up, but that's
who I am, you know.

1324
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,211
It would mean a lot
if you understood.

1325
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,715
- Or try.
- Okay.

1326
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,317
I know what I'm doing.

1327
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,954
All right. I'm gonna go inside
and see Charles Manson.

1328
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,858
And I'll be back out.

1329
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,394
And we'll talk.

1330
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,129
We'll still be brothers.
All right?

1331
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,032
All right.

1332
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:10,905
I love you.

1333
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,776
Ah, I can't say it.

1334
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,477
<i>Somewhere out there,
there's at least one son,</i>

1335
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,379
<i>that we know of,
that's your child.</i>

1336
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:55,549
<i>Look in that camera. What
would you say to that kid?</i>

1337
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,518
<i>What do you say
to your son out there?</i>

1338
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,855
<i>This could be the first time
he's ever seeing his father.</i>

1339
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,023
<i>What do you say to him?</i>

1340
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,426
<i>You gotta catch it
on your own, boy.</i>

1341
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,730
<i>Train's hard. The road's rough.</i>

1342
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,167
<i>And that's it?</i>

1343
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:16,437
<i>That's all I knew. That's
all anyone ever told me.</i>

1344
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,544
<i>And you wanna hear something?</i>

1345
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:26,113
<i>He'll do it better than me.</i>

1346
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:29,884
<i>Whatever he does.
He'll do it a little better.</i>

1347
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,152
<i>Kids do, don't they?</i>

1348
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:34,622
<i>Yeah. That's what
makes them such a gas.</i>

1349
