01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,340
I've been kind of a pain lately.

913
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:35,843
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

too good this year.

915

- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it...

916
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:44,393
because I really like my family.

917
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:47,020
Even though sometimes
I say I don't.

918
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:50,566
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

919
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:55,153
I think so. How you feel about
your family is a complicated thing.

920
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,740
Especially with an older brother.

921
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:03,120
Deep down you always love 'em,
but you forget that you love 'em.

922

And you can hurt them,
and they can hurt you.

923
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:09,751
And that's not just
because you're young.

that I'm here right now?

Sure.

926
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:18,844
I came to hear my granddaughter sing,
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

- No. I'm not welcome.

- Oh, you're always welcome at church.

929

I'm not welcome with my son.

930
01:10:31,148 --> 01:10:35,819
Years back, before you and
your family moved on the block...

931
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:38,405
I had an argument with my son.

932
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:42,784
- How old is he?
- Oh, he's grown up.

933
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:45,495
We lost our tempers...

934
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:48,582
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

935
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:53,587
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

936
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,507
If you miss 'em,
why don't you call him?

937
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:59,301
I'm afraid if I call 'im,
he won't talk to me.

938
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,637
How do you know?

939
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,723
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

940
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:08,519
No offense, but -- ain't you
a little old to be afraid?

941
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:12,147
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

942
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,483
You're never too old
to be afraid.

943
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:17,361
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

944
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,906
It's dark, there's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

945
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:24,409
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

946
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,954
Basements are like that.

947
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:29,957
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry...

948
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,042
and I found out
it's not so bad.

949
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,419
All this time
I've been worrying about it...

950
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:36,797
but if you turn on the lights,
it's no big deal.

951
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,343
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

952
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,512
What if he won't talk to me?

953
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,932
At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it...

954
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:49,643
and you won't have to be
afraid anymore.

955
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:53,313
I don't care how mad I was,
I'd talk to my dad...
