1
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,167
- This is craps, man.
- Filming already?

2
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:07,320
Yeah. This thing's awesome.
Are you nervous?

3
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,854
I don't get nervous.  I hope
I don't get typhoid or something.

4
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:15,255
Ah, okay.
Pop quiz, ready?

5
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:18,448
Number 1, what's gonna
happen if we run out of food?

6
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,944
At least we're gonna
be the 4 eggs and more.

7
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,693
- Nice.
- Aha.

8
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,549
Alright, number 2.

9
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:29,551
What if there's bears?

10
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:36,066
- Stop, drop and roll.
- Nice.

11
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:39,050
Well, let me ask you, you not even a
little excited about going camping?

12
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:43,231
No. In fact I'd be happy just to turn
around and go back home right now.

13
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:45,726
Ryan, you're not comprehending
how much shit can go wrong.

14
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:46,849
Seriously.
You gotta think about it.

15
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:48,933
You got poison ivy ...

16
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,939
you got rattlesnakes,
coyotes...

17
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:55,334
no toilets, which is completely
disgusting and unsanitary.

18
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,180
Am I the only one who cares
about that, by the way?

19
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:01,038
What if one of the girls gets her
periods?  What you gonna do?

20
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:03,948
- What do you do when you get your period?
- I use tampon.

21
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:07,297
Look at that guy!
Look, look, look!

22
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,960
Are you joking me?

23
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:13,431
- What is he doing?
- He must be insane.

24
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:17,683
And you really worried
about the people like that?

25
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:18,935
That's good.

26
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,141
Get all the way in.

27
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:24,943
Hello!

28
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:28,181
- Hello, hello!
- I see you guys playing video games?

29
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,148
Yes.

30
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,950
Ryan, move!

31
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,188
- Ryan! God damn it!
- Toby, where is your sister?

32
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,177
She's upstairs.

33
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:04,956
Really?

34
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,157
Hi!

35
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:10,195
- Why you are filming already?
- Because it's a documentary.

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,198
On Brett, not me packing.

37
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,100
But this is coverage.

38
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,965
And that's cleavage.

39
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,969
You want cleavage?

40
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,789
- What? Oh my God. You're insane.
- You'll delete that, right?

41
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:23,744
- Yeah, not even rolling.
- Okay.

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,048
- Baby, my bathroom is disaster.
- Give me a kiss.

43
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:31,808
- No.
- Kiss the lens.

44
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:35,389
- Don't kiss the lens!
- You just told me to kiss it!

45
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,549
Give me a kiss.

46
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:39,960
I love you.

47
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,733
Get out, I'm packing.

48
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,801
I love you
and you tell me to get out.

49
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,748
I love you back,
but I'm packing.

50
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:47,867
- You want me to be ready?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:51,440
- Looks like you're all set.
- Are you gonna help me carry this?

52
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:54,355
No.  Because I'm making
a documentary...

53
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,137
And I have to hold the
camera the whole time, so...

54
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,666
So left you lying the whole weekend?

55
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:00,583
Tough enough!

56
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,639
I'm booming and I'm
making a documentary.

57
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:04,453
Yup.

58
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,982
Alright, documentary
man, let's go.

59
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,958
Okay.

60
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,315
I like that gay little wave you did.

61
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:14,236
- ... and her five year old!
- Here you go, Brett!

62
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,686
- Come on, I say we go.
- Here, it's really heavy.

63
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,654
Hey kid. You gonna feed
the dog this time, right?

64
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,873
- Chapatito.
- Thanks.

65
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,976
On the next episode of Ashley ...

66
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,744
Ashley's penis ...
talks to her vagina.

67
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:38,057
This guy gonna just let
you use this thing for free?

68
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:39,894
- Yeah.
- How does he even have an RV?

69
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,997
- The guy is fucking loaded.
- How?

70
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,064
He does porn.

71
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,966
Oh my God.
Well, that's interesting.

72
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,742
- Look at him go.
- Girls, come on, he's gone.

73
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,973
Tell me the camera
thing isn't annoying?

74
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,876
- Yeah, it's annoying.
- I totally think it's fun.

75
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,877
- It's fucking stupid.
- It's fun!

76
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,080
- No.
- Look how skinny Ryan's legs are.

77
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:01,017
- Look at him manoeuvre.
- Can I do anything for you, Brett?

78
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,052
Not even a little bit.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,588
Now Abi, I have something
very strange to tell you.

80
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,056
- What is that?
- Your boyfriend is a dork.

81
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,060
- You're a dork.
- He's not a dork, he's a moron.

82
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:12,230
- You're secretly in love with him, Brett.
- I'm secretly in love with you, Abi.

83
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:14,144
- I knew it!
- Give me the caddy.

84
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,060
Check this out.

85
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,899
- Fancy.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,908
- He didn't make the bed, though.
- This is disgusting.

87
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,181
Jesus!

88
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,572
Are you sure you
can drive this thing?

89
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:35,255
Yeah .. I can, but I'm not
going to.  I have to shoot.

90
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,958
- So Brett going to drive it?
- I'm not driving.

91
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,520
No, the documentary is about Brett...

92
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,641
And... Ashley's leg's to
short to reach the pedal.

93
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,859
I'm not driving this.
There's no way I can drive this.

94
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,986
But that's the only option, honey.

95
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,483
I'm not driving.

96
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:51,973
- Come on.
- You guys are dicks.

97
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,978
- Thanks, love you!
- We're all going to die.

98
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:05,007
- What are you filming?
- I'm filming the ocean.

99
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,320
- So this is like a documentary?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,962
I'm not going to put any like...
corn syrup in my mouth.

101
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,354
Well, just anything
that I don't want it...

102
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:15,700
It was ketchup.
It was ketchup.

103
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,969
Oh fucking...
Give me that!

104
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:21,508
What did you do, hit your heads?

105
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,656
Dude, you almost broke
the goddamn camera!

106
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,544
- Was that a "No Trespassing" sign?
- No.

107
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,279
- Can you even spell "trespassing"?
- Yes

108
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,518
- Spell it.
- No. I don't want to.  I just saw a ...

109
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:32,358
- Spell "trespassing"! Try it!
- No!

110
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:39,184
I've lived in stools
smaller than this.

111
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:49,973
Alright ... We're here!

112
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,975
Exterior ...
RV ... day.

113
00:06:56,214 --> 00:07:00,173
Birds chirp. The camera
pans around to reveal ...

114
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,177
our heroes.

115
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,727
Watch your step.

116
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,016
We're here!

117
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,996
Hello!

118
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,967
Well, what do you think?

119
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,262
This one look more like setting
up here.  This is where we camp.

120
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,070
True, we're leaving the RV.
We camp about a half mile in.

121
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,266
How are we getting our shit up there?

122
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:25,731
- Hand carry, buddy.
- Oh my God.

123
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:27,072
The fucking bag is killing me, man.

124
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,981
It's fucking ... scraping on my back.

125
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,508
My ankle's all fucked up.

126
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,061
- What's the matter?
- I'm gonna take 5 seconds, man.

127
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,613
- Oh, man, come on.
- No, it's fucked up, seriously.

128
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,192
It gonna be night time by
the time we get to campsite.

129
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:48,038
- What did you do to your ankle again?
- I fucked it up at the gym.

130
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,847
It's funny?

131
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,242
You got a gym membership?

132
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,584
Look at that!

133
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,174
- Dick... Look at this!
- What?

134
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:59,707
- You think it's funny?
- That's... Wow, that looks really bad.

135
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:07,327
Don't release the pressure?

136
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:10,162
Okay, I just peed in my
pants, a little bit right?

137
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,091
Beautiful!

138
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,766
- What do you guys, think?
- I love it!

139
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:24,007
I mean we can keep hiking,
maybe find a better spot.

140
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,208
This is awesome!

141
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,156
Why do we have an RV if we
are not going to sleep in it?

142
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,145
It doesn't make any sense.

143
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:37,988
Why I need it to charge batteries
and stuff like that and ...

144
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:41,996
That won't roughing
it, I know, so ...

145
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,700
Tell the audience why you committed

146
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:45,999
to doing this documentary.

147
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:49,004
Because Ryan has a way with words.

148
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,011
And he told me it would be fun.

149
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,603
And you're not having fun?

150
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:55,203
Hey listen pal, I'm just
glad you got booze.

151
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,747
By the way, if this movie
is just a compilation ...

152
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,715
of seeing me getting
drunk and falling down

153
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,185
is not going to be good, it's going
to be boring.  It's a stupid concept.

154
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:04,768
I've got a plan.

155
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,303
Okay, this side has to go this way.

156
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:21,008
Here we go.  This is
the front, this is the back.

157
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:23,309
Like this...
There you go!

158
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,262
I am teaching you
how to pitch a tent.

159
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,482
And now let's put the sticks in this.

160
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,564
- Where?
- Stick it in the hole.

161
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,312
I'm probably the
smartest out of all four.

162
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:35,383
- No.
- Ryan is the dumbest.

163
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,310
Here, I got it.

164
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,856
I figured it out. I did...
I thought about it.  I figured...

165
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,218
Illuminate the campsite!

166
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,994
Hey, wait, Ryan,
don't put the spud in.

167
00:11:10,063 --> 00:11:12,930
- It's going to set fire to propane.
- You set it up over there.

168
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:17,102
Abi.  Really, with you two?
Are you kidding me?

169
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,308
- Group situation.
- I'm surprised you not caught fire yet.

170
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:21,074
I know.

171
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,952
Hey, girls, we need to...
Let's get something for the camera.

172
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,013
I'm making a movie, so...

173
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,017
- What do you want?
- Wait!  I got it.

174
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:29,017
I got it.

175
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,455
Everyone loves
watching girls make out.

176
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,157
I think they should make out, right?

177
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,618
There!  Here we go, yeah!

178
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,190
- Oh my God, that was so weak.
- That really sucked.

179
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,200
- It wasn't good.
- Shut up!

180
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,034
So weak.

181
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,095
Alright, well, if we kiss,
then you two have to kiss.

182
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,670
- Yeah, sure of course.
- I'm not going to do it.

183
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,028
Pinky said he'll do it.
Do it.

184
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,766
- That's fine. Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

185
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,246
- Big deal. Okay.
- It's not over. You better do it.

186
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,814
- Go, go.
- Do it.

187
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,361
That's it.  Go!

188
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,936
Go for it.

189
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,020
Just go for it!

190
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,179
What the ... oh my God?

191
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,762
Oh my God.

192
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,028
My God!

193
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,865
Dude, I got kind of a boner.

194
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,032
Oh my God.

195
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,291
Alright, it's your turn.

196
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,095
- I-I-I seriously don't...
- Do it!

197
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,506
- I will not gonna kiss you, man.
- You swore!

198
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,099
Do it.

199
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:23,110
Ryan, they gave me boner.

200
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,177
And I did pinky swear.

201
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:27,626
- Now kiss Ryan with your boner.
- Eeew.

202
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,253
I know, man, I think
we owe them a kiss.

203
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,016
I didn't pinky swear.

204
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:34,121
I think I'm coming in.

205
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:36,438
- Do it.
- Yeah, I'm coming in.

206
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:38,406
- Brett, don't.
- No, I'm coming in for a kiss.

207
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:42,130
He's not just an asshole!
Ashley, Abi ...

208
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:45,770
- What's your name?
- Take the camera. Just take the camera!

209
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:46,905
Why?

210
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,438
Smell this.

211
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,112
I don't want to touch it,
I don't want to touch it!

212
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,787
- Come on. Smell it.
- Get it away from me.

213
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,106
Did you hear that?

214
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:59,013
- What?
- Listen.

215
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,287
Okay, Abi,
Where did Ryan go?

216
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:03,223
I don't know, he said
he wanted to go pee.

217
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,412
Ryan?

218
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,026
Ryan!

219
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,551
Oh my God!

220
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,031
Oh my God!
It's an alien gorilla!

221
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,054
- That is the scariest thing...
- Where did you get that?

222
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,241
Come on, you guys,
weren't a little bit scared at all?

223
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,054
You know?  Brett, there's so
much wildlife out there.

224
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:33,113
- It could be anything.
- Wild life like what?

225
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:40,829
There's no bears up here, okay?
And, coyotes...

226
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,139
Coyotes aren't going to
come here to this camp.

227
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,476
That was definitely not a coyote.

228
00:13:56,483 --> 00:14:00,311
- No, that was a fucking coyote!
- No, it sounded like a person.

229
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,053
Shut the fuck up.

230
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,003
And if it was a coyote, why
would it be out here all by itself?

231
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:07,317
- Where are the other ones?
- I don't know, but the...

232
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,264
It's a fucking coyote, dude.
Come on.

233
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,130
This is fucking retarded.

234
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:16,133
Ryan just take the camera.

235
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,030
Don't really know what
I'm supposed to do here.

236
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:14,034
Ryan told me to talk to the camera
like I was talking to an audience.

237
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,231
Who like talked to
an audience before?

238
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,342
Might come out a little weird.

239
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,171
I'll go and cut right there.

240
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,189
I don't know what to say.
Will you come help me?

241
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,023
- No.
- Brett.  Come help.

242
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,117
- Oh, Ashley, it's easy.
- Okay.

243
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:40,028
- Alright ... Favorite color?
- Green.

244
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:42,225
- Mother's maiden name?
- Esterson.

245
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:46,232
- Favorite type of movie?
- Musicals!

246
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,573
Biggest fear?

247
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:49,892
Horses!

248
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,485
Hmm. Favorite porno?

249
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,342
You want to get going?

250
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:01,054
Brett. What you got?

251
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:03,506
- What?
- A wheat?

252
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:06,949
- No, this is a stick, buddy.
- Good. Do me a favor.

253
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,390
Run after Abi... and just kind of
stick it down the back of her shirt.

254
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,433
- No.
- No, it's going to tickle. Go, go.

255
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,341
Wow!  Look how pretty
this is, you guys.

256
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,187
Come on, Brett, you gotta
like this.  Look at this.

257
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,559
- It's pretty cool.
- It's gorgeous, man.

258
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,058
What?

259
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,096
- What?
- Did you see that?

260
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,162
What's going on?

261
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:41,400
- Yoh!
- There's something over here!

262
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,228
Look there, it just moved.

263
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,033
Hold on.
I don't see anything.

264
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,291
Right there.

265
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,677
- That's a fucking bush, Ashley.
- No, it just moved.

266
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,081
No, it's a fucking bush.

267
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:56,047
Oh God!

268
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,336
- Where are you going?
- Don't go down there.

269
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:07,261
Oh shit!

270
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,254
Ryan, I don't want to
be going down here!

271
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:13,268
Brett!

272
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,034
- What?
- Where was it?

273
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,129
You're out of your mind, man!
Get out of the ravine!

274
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,244
Are you serious?

275
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,209
I don't feel safe here at all.
Let's get out of here.

276
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:24,564
Honey, whatever it is, I'm sure it's
going to be a lot more afraid of us ...

277
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,084
than we gonna be of it.
Brett!  Which way did it go?

278
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,144
Ryan, I'm not playing
this game with you, man.

279
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,347
Ryan, let's just get
back to the camp.

280
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:36,081
Did you hear that?

281
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,161
Ryan, I don't want to be
down here anymore!

282
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:41,456
Ryan.  Jesus... Ryan!
I'm getting out of here. Come on.

283
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,038
Ryan, come on!

284
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,869
What the hell is your problem, Ryan?

285
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:01,054
- Good. You're alive.
- Brett, did you hear that?

286
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,020
I don't care, Ryan.
I don't care about your fucking camera.

287
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:09,097
You're not... Get it in your head, man.
Think about your girlfriend.

288
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,857
You bring her down there?

289
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,064
Oh my God...

290
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,982
Come on, turn around.
Look at the lens.

291
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:21,922
Tell the audience what
you're thinking right now.

292
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,050
Well, I'm thinking of going
back to the city, Ryan.

293
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,888
Well, hey, junior?
City is this way, okay?

294
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:32,298
I can't go to the bathroom?

295
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:35,359
That's breaking the rules
to your bullshit documentary?

296
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,865
Ryan...
Don't follow me with the camera, man.

297
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,631
What's your fucking problem?
You're in my head, man.

298
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,609
You're fucking with me on every turn.
What did you have to offer me?

299
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,139
- Why did I do to you?
- What, the gorilla suit?

300
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,008
Jesus!  Speaking of which ...
What the fuck was that thing, man?

301
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,311
Is there someone fucking with us?
Well, was it an animal?  You're...?

302
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:54,044
- I don't know! That's what makes it so...
- You're not even a little bit afraid!

303
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,146
No, well ...

304
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:58,151
You know, you call me your friend,
You call us your friends ...

305
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:02,087
This is not how you treat your fucking
friends, man.  Your girlfriend's here.

306
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:07,162
Honey, why are you doing this?

307
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,199
Do you have any idea what
documentary filmmakers go through?

308
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,902
Okay, if I want this
thing to pay off...

309
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,270
I've got to look at
it as an outsider.

310
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,010
- So what do you feel?
- I'm not happy with you.

311
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,369
Not me, with Brett.
What's going on?

312
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,040
Fine.  You know
anything about this trip?

313
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,836
I think that you have complete tunnel
vision when it come to this stupid project,

314
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,955
and you're not actually seeing all
the weird crap that's going on around us.

315
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,349
You don't think people are
over-reacting a little bit.

316
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,351
Fine.  What were
those noises last night?

317
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:37,360
Coyotes.

318
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,930
No, they were not coyotes.
It sounded like a person.

319
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:41,110
Then campers or something.

320
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,995
As far is honey, we are not
the first people to come up here.

321
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:46,071
Fine.  What was that thing
in the ravine we just saw?

322
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,266
Exactly.

323
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:55,116
I finally have something to talk
about in this documentary, okay.

324
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:58,319
I.. it's important to me to find out
what everybody's feeling.

325
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:02,556
Fine, I felt...
confused and scared,

326
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,858
and I don't know what
the hell we saw today.

327
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,129
What about Brett?

328
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,066
He feels the same way, man.
He's fed up.

329
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,067
With this trip?

330
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:15,370
No, Ryan, he's fed up with you.

331
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:19,877
Alright, yeah.  I'll give you something
for your fucking movie, Ryan.

332
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:20,677
Thank you.

333
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,015
This is a movie made by
a self-righteous prick...

334
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,119
who cares more... about
the success of his movie

335
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:30,087
than the safety of his friends.

336
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,086
Fuck you, Ryan.

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,262
<i>So typical of Brett.
He is completely over-reacting.</i>

338
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:49,759
<i>When he gets like this, the best
thing to do is just leave him alone...</i>

339
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:53,937
<i>Let him cool down.
I'll check on him a little bit...</i>

340
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,802
<i>to see if we can have
a good time tonight.</i>

341
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:01,088
What are you doing?

342
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:13,057
<i>It's got this screw loose, and
I just can't separate it.  In reality ...</i>

343
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,130
<i>these things they want
to see on camera.</i>

344
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:15,862
<i>What do you mean?</i>

345
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:18,724
<i>Hey look look.
This is not something we have...</i>

346
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,976
<i>We have at a baseball game...</i>

347
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,713
<i>There was this guy in front of us.
He was like, you know...**</i>

348
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,315
by the pain in the ass.  He was
getting in front by yelling and...

349
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,117
he was fuck...
he was annoyed.

350
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,200
I was annoyed.
Ryan was pissed.

351
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,820
And I was kind of pissed too,
but whatever...

352
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,619
He got... The guy got up
and went to the bathroom.

353
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,682
Ryan takes out a Swiss Army knife

354
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,915
and he starts starts tape signs
to the leg of the bench, okay.

355
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,630
Are you kidding me?

356
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,899
Yeah, so he's like still
standing up or whatever.

357
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,170
The guy comes back, sit
back down and fall back...

358
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,040
and hits his head like he almost
cracked his head open.

359
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,710
And it was like messed up
and I looked at Ryan...

360
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:54,071
He was just watching the game.
Stone cold, nothing...  no emotion.

361
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:56,581
I know it's like...
it's like... fuck.

362
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:59,120
I know he'll get my back in
a platter or whatever but...

363
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,122
- It's like a disconnect.
- Yeah.

364
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,480
That's really weird.

365
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,598
Brett.

366
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,325
- Come on.
- I don't want.

367
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:19,269
- Ash.
- Not tonight, Ryan.

368
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:22,179
Abi?

369
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,227
Come on.

370
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:29,087
- Well, it'll shut you up.
- Here we go.

371
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,098
Yeah, don't make me the other one.

372
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:40,299
Do it.

373
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:44,297
Well, what the hell.

374
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:50,278
Brett, we don't drink alone, man.

375
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:53,075
- Come on, buddy, leave at that.
- Come on.

376
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:55,275
Might as well.
We're stuck here.

377
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:10,133
I turn around and she is
butt naked behind me...

378
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:13,400
like washing me off...
and she's like

379
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,220
"Turn around.
This is so awkward."

380
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:18,100
- See you bathing and all that.
- Why was she naked?

381
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:19,208
I don't know!
I don't know!

382
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:21,376
And that's why Ashley
has new friends now.

383
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:24,273
Ryan, what is your most
embarrassing moment?

384
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,186
Yeah babe, what's your
most embarrassing moment?

385
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:29,077
I got a good one for you.
It's really good.

386
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:31,188
- How come I don't know it.
- Okay.

387
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,309
Stop hogging this baby.

388
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:36,495
I don't think you need it anymore.

389
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,199
You can have this.

390
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,942
- Ashley.
- What are you doing?

391
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,861
Ashley, you fell asleep in the dirt.

392
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,046
- What?
- Abi, move, please.

393
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:53,114
Ryan, look at her.

394
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,080
Honey, oh my God...

395
00:23:57,152 --> 00:24:00,288
Ashley, you look...
You heard him snoring so loud.

396
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:01,623
You were like a gorilla!
You.

397
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:05,286
Ash, it's time to get up. Get up.
Come here. Give me your hand.

398
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:07,195
Oh my God.

399
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,680
Oh, I haven't been sleeping.

400
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,236
Yeah I'm ready.
I have a young memory!

401
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,900
- I think we're having a few.
- I didn't have a fuck...

402
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:15,236
You're cute.

403
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,107
You guys hear that, right?

404
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,308
- Abi!
- Would you guys, shut up.

405
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,183
It's a bear!

406
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,085
Shut up! Ashley, shut up!

407
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,098
Alright ... I'm out.

408
00:24:39,332 --> 00:24:41,095
Brett, hold on.

409
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,113
Brett.

410
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,215
Brett, come on.
Didn't you have a sense.

411
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,181
Okay, so I know you guys
are all freaked up right now.

412
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:07,187
The sun is gonna be up in a few hours.
I’m just gonna stay up and look for her.

413
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:11,095
- What?
- I just heard something.

414
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,102
What?

415
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,105
I don't know,
I just heard something.

416
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,508
- I'm not seeing any...
- Hello there!

417
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:18,609
Jesus!

418
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:22,413
Saw your fire.
Mind if I join you?

419
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,910
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

420
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,291
You guys seen
a lost dog?

421
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:44,104
I'm sorry, a lost dog?
No.

422
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:52,204
Nice camera you got there.
Take a look, okay?

423
00:25:53,148 --> 00:25:54,137
No you can't.

424
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:57,209
Is anything wrong?

425
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:02,124
You tell me.
You're not going to touch it, okay?

426
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:07,130
Sorry... Anyone?

427
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,191
Warm you up.

428
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,211
You gonna... need
more wood for this fire.

429
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:54,173
Good night.

430
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:00,623
Jesus.

431
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,260
He's got a God fucking gun!

432
00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:04,249
And yeah?

433
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:06,930
He's got in his hand
a God fucking gun!

434
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,167
- Why does he have a gun?
- He's just looking for his dog.

435
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:11,130
Ashley, shut up!

436
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,195
I wasn't so sure
we should be up here.

437
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:18,200
Ryan, this is getting really
weird. Let's just go home now.

438
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,468
Right, you think I'm getting on
a trail with that guy on it?  No way.

439
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,211
Ashley, I'll sleep in
your tent tonight.

440
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,350
We leaving first thing
in the morning, Ryan.

441
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:26,113
Let's go.
Get up.

442
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,235
Honey, what you doing?

443
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,374
I'm not staying here by myself.
I gonna sit out there with you.

444
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,207
You don't really think that
anything is going on, do you?

445
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:51,303
You... forget about all
the noises going on.

446
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,314
You saw what everyone
was seeing with me.

447
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:55,317
That thing was not natural.

448
00:27:56,352 --> 00:27:59,252
Yeah.  I don't know
what it was either, but ...

449
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:02,153
Look, you have
nothing to be afraid of.

450
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:06,220
I'm not sitting in here by myself.

451
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,131
Then, will you just
take the camera and

452
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,269
I'll set up the tripod.
Keep it rolling though.

453
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,136
Why do I have to keep it rolling?

454
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,364
Because when you and Brett
and Ashley find out...

455
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,900
that this all is some fucking prank,
I want it all caught on tape, okay?

456
00:28:19,912 --> 00:28:22,001
You're an idiot.
Just give me the camera.

457
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,124
Aah! Ryan! Ryan!

458
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,133
- What?
- Did you shake the tent?

459
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,370
- Did I shake the tent?  No.
- Something just shook the tent!

460
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,736
It just came from behind
and started shaking the tent!

461
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:45,737
Did you get it on tape?

462
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:49,378
No, I didn't get anything on film!
Are you kidding me right now?

463
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:51,143
Okay, give me the camera.

464
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,143
I'll take a look.

465
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:51,135
WHAT IS THAT?

466
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:06,130
Did you hear that?

467
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:18,144
LISTEN

468
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,154
Did you see what it was?

469
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:36,228
No, nothing.
I didn't see anything.

470
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:41,226
I heard footsteps and then
something shook the tent right after.

471
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,135
Well, whatever it was, it's gone.

472
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:51,246
Hey, let's sit by the campfire.

473
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:55,146
All right.

474
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:36,799
Abi, get the camera!

475
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:38,359
Ryan! No!

476
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,505
- Ryan!
- What the hell was that?

477
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,335
I don't know.

478
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:47,138
- Where is Ryan?
- He went out there.

479
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,236
Look, I'm going back. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm over it.

480
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:52,140
Ashley, come on.
We're going back to the RV.

481
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:55,185
- Now, now, now.
- Go, go, go!

482
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,153
God... Ryan!

483
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,155
Don't leave me!

484
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,249
Your boyfriend is going
to get himself killed, Abi.

485
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:08,256
Abi, turn off the fucking camera!

486
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,372
Really, Abi,
with the camera now?

487
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:15,340
It is the brightest light we have.

488
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:20,345
I have no idea how
Ryan is going to find us.

489
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:23,247
Ryan can fuck and ** himself.

490
00:32:25,185 --> 00:32:28,154
Guys, are we even
on the right trail?

491
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:31,180
What's that?

492
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:39,267
Go!

493
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,835
Go!

494
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:56,250
God, I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

495
00:32:57,188 --> 00:32:59,390
- Did you see anything?
- No! No, I just heard something!

496
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:01,153
Gosh, you didn't see it?

497
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:03,158
Oh God.

498
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:05,296
Why are you still fucking
filming, Abi?  Seriously.

499
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:07,164
Ryan's still out there!

500
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,258
- That guy's is **.
- I know, I know.

501
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:14,172
What the devil.

502
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,248
- Do you see anything?
- No, no no no!

503
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,400
- My God!
- Abi, get away from the door!

504
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,753
It's Ryan!

505
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,456
Where the fuck have you been, Ryan?

506
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,428
- I've been looking for those campers.
- Did you see anything out there?

507
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:35,442
There was something on the
fucking roof.  Was that you?

508
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:37,222
- No, I wasn't on the roof.
- Was that you?

509
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,330
Did you promise it wasn't you?
You promise.

510
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,101
- We got to get the fuck out of here.
- What is this?

511
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,641
There's something on it.
There was something...

512
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,170
Something was chasing
us the entire time.

513
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:47,710
Ryan, if you were **
Are you fucking with this man?

514
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:50,312
Ryan, start up the RV.
I just want to go.

515
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,380
No! Hold on.

516
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:52,811
I can't just leave.

517
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,153
Your fucking tent?  I'll buy
you a new fucking tent.

518
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:55,750
See yourself.  There's
seriously something out there!

519
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:57,077
Okay, seriously, calm down.

520
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,356
Calm down,
calm down everyone.

521
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:02,255
Let's just all take a
minute to chill, okay?

522
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,263
- Give me the camera.
- Unbelievable.

523
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,631
You'll wait until the
morning to get us back.

524
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,367
Get the keys and start the fucking RV!

525
00:34:09,402 --> 00:34:10,892
I'm not fucking
around anymore.

526
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,405
Brett, I'm not leaving
my stuff out there, ok.

527
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,173
- I don't care what you say!
- Shut up!

528
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,612
Ok look! We got 2 options for you, ok.
No. 1, we go get the sheet right now...

529
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:21,883
You don't understand.  There was
something fucking chasing us out there.

530
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,319
Ok, Brett look. We can go get the stuff
right now in the middle of the night, ok.

531
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,679
Or we can go wait till
the morning to get it back.

532
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,773
So you pick.
Right now or in the morning?

533
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:33,315
Fine.
First thing in the fucking morning.

534
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:41,871
Brett!

535
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,177
Brett!

536
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:52,316
- Oh my fucking... Gosh!
- What the hell is she doing?

537
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:55,184
Brett!

538
00:34:57,322 --> 00:34:58,289
Ashley?

539
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:02,351
Brett!

540
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:06,916
Ashley, honey, do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up.

541
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,435
- I can't find Brett.
- It is way too early for this.

542
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,900
Why you can't find Brett?

543
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,406
I woke up this morning and the
door was open. I can't find Brett.

544
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:15,169
Is he taking a shit?

545
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,177
Brett!

546
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:20,364
- Oh my God.
- Stop yelling.

547
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,787
- Make her stop.
- Oh God.

548
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:24,259
- Move!
- We need to go.

549
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:25,583
- We need to find them.
- We need to go. We need to find them.

550
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:27,335
- He's probably at the campsite.
- Okay, let's go.

551
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,611
- Okay, let's go.
- Mike shut up!

552
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:30,319
Oh! Shut up.

553
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,687
- Stop being a dick to her.
- Shut up.

554
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:34,174
Don't tell me to shut up.

555
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:36,292
Let's go!

556
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,976
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

557
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,636
Brett!

558
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,799
- Abi ... Abi hold up.
- What are you doing?

559
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:15,934
Just look at the camera.

560
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:17,736
- What are you doing with that?
- Why are we stopping.

561
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:19,510
- Abi, why are we stopping?
- I'm checking my focus.

562
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,358
You know what?
Brett is missing and

563
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:23,410
we're stopping to
checking your fucking focus...

564
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:25,347
Ryan!  Abi, have him turn it off.
Turn it...

565
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:27,150
- Ashley, stop!
- God!

566
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,208
Ashley, calm the fuck down.

567
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:32,381
- Shut up, Ryan!
- He's at fucking campsite!

568
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:36,841
Brett?

569
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:49,865
Alright, so Ashley,
his pack is gone, so ...

570
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,640
Just like I said, he got here and took
his pack and moved back to the city.

571
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:55,096
- Check it out.
- Ash, what are you doing?

572
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,800
- Ashley, what are you doing?
- I'm checking to see if I have service.

573
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:03,596
- Service?  Are you retarded?
- I expect a little pocket somewhere.

574
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,794
A pocket?
You guys are both retarded.

575
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,810
Oh my God, you're not
going to get service here.

576
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,463
Brett went back to the city.

577
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:12,647
It's a little weird that he's just
left without telling any of us.

578
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:15,788
No. It's not weird. Because I know him.
This is exactly what he would have done.

579
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:16,823
Shut up, Ryan.

580
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:19,473
Oh my God.  Okay, look.
Let's pack up everything.

581
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,128
We'll run into him on the road, okay?

582
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,736
Here.  I'll set down the camera
and help you guys out.

583
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,759
Really you guys?

584
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,765
Ashley? Come on.

585
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:48,558
This is boring.

586
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,960
Abi, could you say something?
Come on.

587
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:55,746
Shut up. Nobody wants to fucking hear
you talk right now. Your voice is annoying.

588
00:37:55,814 --> 00:37:58,851
How are you not worried a
little bit about your friend Brett?

589
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:02,155
Abi, hey, dumb fuck.  I've known
Brett ten fucking years, okay.

590
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,393
- He does this shit all the time!
- Really? Really? Alright. Okay.

591
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:08,190
- You're being a fucking bitch.
- You're being a fucking dick!

592
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:11,660
You're filming all this stupid shit.
It's ain't fucking useful anymore.

593
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:14,296
- Brett's not even here.
- It's on documentary, dipshit!

594
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:17,320
On Brett, dipshit!
Brett's not here.

595
00:38:20,312 --> 00:38:22,710
You know, the subject of documentary
doesn't always start out with...

596
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:26,151
You're a dick!  Fucking
shut the fuck up.  Shut up!

597
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:36,287
30 minutes and nobody's
talk to me.  Really?

598
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:49,336
Ryan, what's wrong with you?
Always good to know you and Brett...

599
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:53,105
Oh my God, will you shut up
about Brett!  Jesus!

600
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,367
Can you go 5 minutes without talking
about your fucking pretend boyfriend, ok?

601
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:59,278
I get it.  We all get it.
You want to fuck him and you did.

602
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:02,416
Maybe if you weren't so fucking
pathetic, he would have fucked you.

603
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:04,377
Fucking a, man.

604
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,189
What is that?

605
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,196
Get out of the way, Ashley.
What the fuck is that?

606
00:39:12,027 --> 00:39:14,296
Oh, you fucking joking me...

607
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,535
I'm going to fucking murder him.
I'm going to fucking kill him.

608
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,500
Brett?

609
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,106
What are we going to do?

610
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:26,908
- Holy shit!
- Oh my God...

611
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:29,278
Look at this fucking place!

612
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:32,079
What are we gonna do?

613
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,405
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to go outside.

614
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:36,126
I'm gonna find whoever's doing this.
I'm gonna kick his fucking ass in.

615
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,720
No, you're not going to leave us.

616
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,259
I thought... Abi, god dammit!
I'm going to go out and find...

617
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,090
Somebody is fucking with us
for the last three days!

618
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:44,260
You can't leave us here by ourselves.

619
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,630
Get the fuck out of the way.
Ashley, get out of the way...

620
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:50,297
before I break this fucking
camera over your goddamn face!

621
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,504
Hey!

622
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,378
Come out here!

623
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:37,982
Get the fuck over here!

624
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:41,379
I'm gonna fucking murder you,
you fucking piece of shit!

625
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:12,390
Brett?

626
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:14,482
Brett?

627
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:24,290
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!

628
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,437
- Did you find Brett?
- Where were you?

629
00:42:26,472 --> 00:42:28,507
- Abi?
- What are you doing?

630
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,970
I'm giving you the camera, okay?

631
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:32,509
Why are you giving me the camera?

632
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:33,828
- I'm gonna go get help.
- What are you doing?

633
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,240
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna go get some help.

634
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:40,416
Ryan, no!
Don't leave us again.

635
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,425
Lock the doors.
I love you.

636
00:42:57,236 --> 00:43:00,699
I don't know why I'm
turning this stupid thing on.

637
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:08,304
But the sun is about to go down
and you're not back yet.

638
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,311
I know you always film the sunset.

639
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,320
I'll film it for you, so you won't
be upset when you get back.

640
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:19,322
Just hurry back.

641
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:26,301
Oh, that's so much better.

642
00:43:26,368 --> 00:43:27,490
It's bright.

643
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:35,308
What do you want to do?

644
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:37,404
About what?

645
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:41,448
Should we just leave?

646
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:48,320
No, I think we should wait
for Ryan to be back.

647
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,325
He'd been out for a long time.

648
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:00,300
Yeah, he's probably got help...

649
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,396
...probably he'll be back now.

650
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,515
What do you think happened to Brett?

651
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,560
We should probably turn the
light off to save the battery.

652
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:21,524
No.

653
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,563
There's no reason to have it on.

654
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:25,581
I don't want to sit here in the dark.

655
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,493
If there is something out there,
it's going to see the light.

656
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:29,962
No, I mean I don't want
to sit here in the dark.

657
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:32,298
Gonna be fine.
It's better to have it off.

658
00:44:38,544 --> 00:44:40,307
Holy fuck!

659
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,464
Oh God, what the fuck is that?

660
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:07,501
- Turn that lights on.
- No.

661
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:09,511
- Lights gotta wait.
- I don't see him.

662
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:16,315
Where is it?

663
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:29,232
- Fucking, what was that?
- I don't know...

664
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:31,336
I don't know what was that...
What was that?

665
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:34,395
Where did he go?

666
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:41,309
Oh my God.

667
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:14,415
Now get up!

668
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:17,342
Get up!

669
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:23,319
Get up! We gotta...
We gotta get going!

670
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:22,320
Stand up!
Come on Abi!

671
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:46,445
Please stop.
Just stop.

672
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,508
Ok, ok turn the light off.
Turn the light off.

673
00:47:52,154 --> 00:47:53,412
We will die.

674
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,414
Oh my God.

675
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:59,329
What has happened?

676
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:00,929
Oh my God.

677
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:05,860
Okay, come on.

678
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,339
- I can't run anymore.
- Get up.

679
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,336
Get up!
Come on!

680
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:36,331
Wait! Abi, there's a... !
there's a way.

681
00:48:44,176 --> 00:48:45,434
Come this way!

682
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:50,370
Abi, this way!

683
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:13,338
Help is going to the end.
Turn... turn the light off.

684
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:16,534
God ... okay.

685
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:21,576
Where the hell are we?

686
00:49:34,564 --> 00:49:36,328
Hello?

687
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,334
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

688
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:43,356
<i>You are in a restricted area.
Do no attempt to run.</i>

689
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:47,341
<i>Stay where you are
and await further instructions.</i>

690
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:48,343
Abi!

691
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,352
Come here.
Come here.

692
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:38,459
Abi, we should run for it.

693
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:06,354
He's behind you!
Run! Run!

694
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:25,511
He's up there!
Oh God, Ashley!

695
00:54:25,546 --> 00:54:27,446
They are everywhere!

696
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,347
Get away from us!

697
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:43,460
Listen.

698
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:51,365
You hear that?

699
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:20,466
Hello?

700
00:56:23,503 --> 00:56:24,562
Abi, it's open.

701
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:28,372
What do we do?

702
00:56:35,618 --> 00:56:37,483
Oh my God!

703
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,355
We can telephone here.
We have to find one.

704
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:51,557
It's closed!

705
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,387
Go upstairs.
Maybe upstairs!

706
00:59:15,524 --> 00:59:18,492
Ashley...
Ashley, we can't get out!

707
00:59:23,132 --> 00:59:25,492
We're trapped!

708
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:27,502
Ash!

709
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:31,266
We really really gonna die, Abi.
We really gonna die.

710
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,371
- Are you okay?
- I **.

711
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,466
We can get out of here.

712
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,880
No, it can't open.

713
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:15,487
Ashley!
You can help me! Help me!

714
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:22,417
Be careful.

715
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:33,402
<i>This is a restricted area.</i>

716
01:00:35,408 --> 01:00:36,466
Can you help us?

717
01:00:38,412 --> 01:00:41,380
How did you find us?
No onions.

718
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:47,405
Yes... I can help you!

719
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:49,390
You can't help me.

720
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:57,592
Get us out of here.

721
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:00,400
You're too much!

722
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:31,596
Go! Go. Go on!
Run!

723
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:33,630
Hurry, the trunk!

724
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:56,395
Fox fire, over.

725
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:59,490
I secured ** and moving your way.

726
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,661
I'm going to the hangar.
Lucy is all over me!

727
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,409
Arrange the helicopter
priority for evac.

728
01:02:30,634 --> 01:02:32,601
Move, move!

729
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,409
Get inside!

730
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,387
This way...

731
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:52,386
Just keep it rolling.

732
01:03:04,437 --> 01:03:05,597
Oh God.

733
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,552
No!  No!

734
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:12,412
Give me the fucking camera!

735
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,587
<i>The key is no longer valid.</i>

736
01:03:26,661 --> 01:03:28,492
Pick it up!
Come on, let's go!

737
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:33,491
Where are we?
Where are we?

738
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,506
Please could you tell us
what's going on?

739
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:29,394
Oh God!

740
01:04:35,434 --> 01:04:38,405
I work here.
No, no please. God!

741
01:04:39,638 --> 01:04:41,402
Do you want to live?

742
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:46,400
Shut up.  Shut up.
Quiet.

743
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:52,453
No, please don't leave me!
Please don't leave me here!

744
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:03,488
Move! Move! Move!

745
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,595
Follow me. Come on.
Come on.

746
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,517
Give me the camera.

747
01:06:09,137 --> 01:06:11,494
I had no idea they had gone this far.

748
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,404
Now, do you see why
this is so important?

749
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:22,616
Shit!

750
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:26,417
These motherfuckers.

751
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:44,402
You gonna die! Die!

752
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:49,407
Go!

753
01:07:46,574 --> 01:07:48,505
Stay where you are!

754
01:07:49,143 --> 01:07:51,411
Weapons drawn down!
Don't move!

755
01:07:51,445 --> 01:07:53,409
Down to the floor!

756
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,456
Get behind me.

757
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:39,652
Move!

758
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,631
We need to get outside.
Oh shit!

759
01:08:48,074 --> 01:08:50,440
Get on your fucking feet!

760
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:57,575
Come on, there's helicopters.
Get that camera out of here!

761
01:09:02,256 --> 01:09:04,422
Go, go, go.

762
01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:40,527
Give me your hand.
Get in. Get in.

Affirmative. I have precious cargo.
Heading your way.

765
01:10:50,273 --> 01:10:54,431

You're gonna be okay.

768
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,348
Go! Go!

769
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:26,395
It's alright.
It's gonna be okay.

770
01:13:30,477 --> 01:13:34,444
I want complete recording of
all activity which is inside the zone.

771
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:37,650
Confirm.

772
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:42,555
You are in a free
fire zone, gentlemen.

773
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,543
Confirm.
We have blood.

774
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:06,372
Proceed with caution.

775
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:24,702
76, are you getting this?

776
01:14:24,737 --> 01:14:25,670
Confirm.

777
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:30,437
Appears inhuman.

Don't fire. Don't fire.

782
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,074
Fire!

783
01:16:42,586 --> 01:16:44,450
Care to see the face?

784
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,655
Gentlemen, his face?

785
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,612
Don't move. Don't move.
Hear something?

786
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:39,670
I hear noise.

787
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,615
Watch each other.
