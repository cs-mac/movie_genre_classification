1
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,366
- You suck, Gertrude.
- You suck.

2
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:49,102
Yeah, I suck so bad I just skunked you.

3
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,072
Which means, you gotta eat your pills.

4
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,553
- You're supposed to be nice to me.
- I am nice to you.

5
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:59,552
- It's not my fault you got no game.
- You suck, Travis.

6
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:03,723
I know.

7
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,194
Hey there, Travis.

8
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,301
- I'll check on you later.
- All right.

9
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,627
<i>Travis,</i>

10
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,496
you've been talking about seeing the world

11
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,976
the whole time you've been here.

12
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:24,614
Think of it as an opportunity to
finally fulfill that.

13
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:29,109
- Well, then you're firing me.
- Not firing, laying off.

14
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:32,345
And I'm not laying you off,
the state is laying you off.

15
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,080
All these budget cuts.

16
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:36,349
They're clear-cutting
the part-time positions.

17
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,818
This has nothing to do with you.

18
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,020
My advice, Travis, go see the world.

19
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,857
Get that out of your system
like you've always wanted.

20
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:46,059
Maybe you come back,
they may be hiring again.

21
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,994
<i>- Home! Bring them home!
- Home! Bring them home!</i>

22
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:50,463
- Bring them home!
- Bring them home!

23
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,899
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

24
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,201
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

25
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,105
- I can't believe they fired me yesterday.
- Come on, man. It was a nursing home.

26
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,208
- It's a retirement home.
- Yeah, that's what I said. A nursing home.

27
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,676
It's better for the world than insurance.

28
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:06,813
- Hey, I'm carrying a sign, aren't I?
- Great.

29
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:09,015
Listen, not to get new-agey or nothing,

30
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,684
but I think this is something that
was supposed to happen to you, you know?

31
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,587
Force you out of your comfort zone,
make you mix it up a little bit.

32
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,096
- I don't need to mix it
up, I need to get paid.

33
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,457
- Get innovative then, man.

34
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,092
Don't tell me you don't know how to do that.

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,828
Back in college when you were
doing all that test subject shit.

36
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,637
Selling your sperm.

37
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,146
I never sold my sperm.

38
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:31,116
'Cause nobody in their right mind
would pay for a piece of those genes.

39
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,705
You know what?

40
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:36,342
Whoever said peace rallies is
where the action is, doesn't know shit.

41
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,290
- This is a fucking dyke-fest.
- Not all of them.

42
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:44,454
No. Not happening.

43
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:49,560
What's happening?

44
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,786
- Hey. Hey!

45
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,264
- I got friends out
there, you son of a bitch!

46
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:00,700
- Fucking liberal pussy!
- Enough.

47
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,802
- Get your fucking hands off me, man.
- Enough! Enough!

48
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,305
Guys like me go over there
and die for a living.

49
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,308
- Hey!
- Tee off, go ahead.

50
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:12,153
It's your issue, man. It's your issue, man.
Not mine.

51
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,913
Come on.

52
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:15,148
- Hypocrite!
- Let's go.

53
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:19,790
Fucking hypocrite! Go on!
Spread all your lies!

54
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,289
You got a captive audience,
you fucking hippie liberal!

55
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:26,634
Go on,
with all your propaganda and diatribes.

56
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,177
Thanks.

57
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:41,279
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

58
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,358
I'm all right.

59
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:48,648
<i>My dad sat me down
and had me watch Red Dawn</i>

60
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:51,317
so that I would understand
just how bad things would get

61
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,456
if the Communists took over.

62
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,992
I sort of dug that flick.

63
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:01,373
Then it was narco-traffickers,
Islamo-Fascists.

64
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:04,964
Bad guys just keep changing their faces
and we keep going to war.

65
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,478
- And then...
- We keep protesting.

66
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:11,751
- United we stand.
- Cheers.

67
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,352
This is a big moment, Travis.

68
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:25,051
You've just witnessed
the last anti-war diatribe

69
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,320
- the world's ever gonna hear from me.
- Wow.

70
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:31,199
You know what I've realized?
Real war's in here.

71
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:34,227
You just figured that out?

72
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,963
No, I've known it for a while.

73
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:39,079
- But I'm finally gonna
do something about it.

74
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,047
- And what's that?

75
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,214
I'm going to India.

76
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,308
I figure I'll do some yoga,

77
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,877
some time in an ashram,

78
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,925
have sex with my guru.

79
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,719
We'll both agree afterwards that
it was a mistake, of course.

80
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,425
Of course.

81
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:08,828
Maybe you should go. We could meet up.

82
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:13,833
Well, a trip like that
would be a pretty penny,

83
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:16,449
- which I don't got.
- Could knock over a liquor store.

84
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,516
I think I could come up with something
slightly more legit.

85
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,821
Such as?

86
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,855
You don't wanna know.

87
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,781
I think I can handle it.

88
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:32,558
I mean, I think I'm intellectually
limber enough.

89
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,398
Can I see you again?

90
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:18,668
- Michael Barris.
- Travis, hey.

91
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:23,816
- Smart man.
- What?

92
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:28,341
- You wore a suit. That's a smart move.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:32,078
- I heard there's not many spots.
- Do I need to sign here or print my name?

94
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:35,093
- Just a signature will do.
- Thanks, boo. Love the jacket.

95
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,495
We are strangers in a strange land, brother.

96
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:45,458
First off, what we will be doing here,
for those of you that don't know,

97
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:49,696
will be a behavioral experiment,
in which we will be simulating

98
00:08:49,844 --> 00:08:52,899
the conditions of life
inside a state penitentiary.

99
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,235
Now, our only requirement is that
none of you have ever served any time.

100
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,705
If you have, we'd like to
thank you for your interest,

101
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:00,473
but you do not fit our profile.

102
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,743
Now, we will be conducting
a short series of tests in a moment,

103
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,912
but before we do
I would just like to take a beat

104
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,382
and let you know that
although the actual experiment

105
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,185
will be conducted
in an utterly secure environment

106
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,254
and the participants
will be safe at all times,

107
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:18,591
some of the subjects
will be deprived of their civil rights...

108
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,960
It's a flying man...
for the entire two weeks.

109
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,262
What's his name?

110
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,574
- Flying Man.
- Now, let's get to the tests, shall we?

111
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,649
- No history of incarceration?
- No.

112
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:34,213
- Violence?
- No.

113
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,980
- Never?
- No.

114
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:43,220
- What about religion?
- No.

115
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:48,154
No? Religion's not usually
a yes or no question, Mr. Hunt.

116
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:52,291
People tend to find all sorts of gray areas
in which to couch their answers.

117
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, nothing gray here.

118
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,810
So, how do you base
your ethical decisions, then?

119
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:01,837
Here.

120
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:06,580
I was in Boy Scouts,
and drill team in high school,

121
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:10,209
various church groups.

122
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:13,155
- You were devout, then?
- Still am.

123
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:17,455
And what about
absolute right and wrong in the universe?

124
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,600
Well, I guess,

125
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:30,404
if I believe in God,
then I would have to, right?

126
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,966
Yeah, you know, I only got three rules,

127
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:38,676
eat twat, smoke pot, and smile a lot.

128
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:46,312
It's just a short slide-show
we'd like you to watch.

129
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,792
It's perfectly safe, I assure you.

130
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,630
<i>The sheriff's deputies had escorted
Duceppe back to Baton Rouge.</i>

131
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:07,834
<i>I am convinced that
when these animals are herded together</i>

132
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,609
<i>their instincts warn them of...</i>

133
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,616
<i>...California hotel, where FBI agents...</i>

134
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:03,100
- Are you okay to move on, Mr. Hunt?
- Yep. I'm good.

135
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,520
You wouldn't have hit him.

136
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:32,654
Who?

137
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,798
The guy at the rally.

138
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:40,970
You wouldn't have hit him.

139
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:45,641
These knuckles, they're pristine.

140
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:50,674
- You calling me a pussy?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:57,913
- It's a compliment.
- Cool.

142
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:04,188
I'll be gone by the time
you get out, you know.

143
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,493
I know.

144
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:22,004
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi.

145
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:27,515
- Varanasi.
- How soon can you be there?

146
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,786
Twelfth? Thirteenth?

147
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,827
Thirteenth.

148
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:39,893
Dashashwamedh Ghat on the 13th, 6:00 p. m.

149
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,361
- Hey, you made it.
- Good to see you.

150
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,739
- Yeah.
- I was hoping I'd have someone to talk to.

151
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:56,240
I can't help but think that
this says something about us.

152
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,915
I think it says we need money.

153
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,549
- Sorry.
- Hey, how's it going?

154
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,972
- It's the beginning.
- Game on.

155
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,366
So let's move on to the topic of women.
What's that word mean to you?

156
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:29,004
Women? What?

157
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,681
Everything on God's green earth

158
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,318
and possibly beyond what's been
discovered in our universe yet?

159
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:47,490
I don't know.

160
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,940
<i>Look, it's only a dog.
So, what're you worried about?</i>

161
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:09,942
<i>Worried? Who's worried?
I'm only worried about you.</i>

162
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,116
<i>Look, I'll stay here and protect the car,
and you go take a look.</i>

163
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:23,133
Hey, chickenshit, we got a draft!

164
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,836
Didn't you hear me, chickenshit?

165
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:30,132
We got a draft. Close the window!

166
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,518
I fell asleep. How far did we drive?

167
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:25,964
This is a fucking spot.

168
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:30,289
Gentlemen, they're waiting inside.

169
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:34,026
You mind if I just grab my bag?
There's some stuff in there that I need.

170
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:37,302
You'll have everything you need inside.

171
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:53,012
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

172
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,221
The next two weeks
will be a new experience for you.

173
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:01,334
Now as I said before,
some of you will have no civil rights.

174
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:03,969
Do not underestimate that.

175
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,732
If any of you wanna leave,
now is your last chance.

176
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,566
No?

177
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,367
Good.

178
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:18,704
Again, your safety is
our number one priority.

179
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,874
If there is any violence, any at all,

180
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:25,355
the experiment
will be immediately terminated.

181
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,919
Clear?

182
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,882
Now, when I call your name, please stand.

183
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,828
Dernier, Bosch,

184
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:37,194
Helweg, Sandberg,

185
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:42,141
Chase, and Barris.

186
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,031
Good.

187
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,275
So the rest of you,
please stand up and follow the yellow line.

188
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:55,444
- Later, pal.
- Good luck, gentlemen. And I thank you.

189
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,187
So what do you think, Girl Scouts?
Prisoners or guards?

190
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,227
I think we just got our answer.

191
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:14,627
Nothing is to come or
go from the cell block.

192
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:16,902
Nothing from the outside world.

193
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:21,267
If you look in your lockers,
you will see a printout with the five rules

194
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:23,669
that the prisoners are
to follow at all times.

195
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,580
Please read them aloud with me.

196
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,239
"Rule number one:

197
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:31,877
"Prisoners must eat three meals a day
and all food must be consumed.

198
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,980
"Two: There will be 30 minutes of rec daily.

199
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:40,119
"Three: Prisoners are allowed only
in prisoner-designated areas.

200
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:44,223
"Four: Prisoners must speak
only when spoken to.

201
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:50,071
"And five: Prisoners must not touch
the guards under any circumstances. "

202
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:54,770
Those that break the rules
must be punished commensurately.

203
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,043
What does "commensurate" mean?

204
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:00,739
This experiment is not about individuals.

205
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,575
If any one person leaves, it's over.

206
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:05,611
If a prisoner does break the rules,

207
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,248
you will have 30 minutes to choose
proper disciplinary action.

208
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,318
If you fail to do so,
that red light will come on,

209
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:16,300
the experiment will be terminated,
and you will not get paid.

210
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,958
- What did you say?
- You either maintain strict order,

211
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:22,267
or you don't get paid.

212
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:25,070
I will see you in two weeks.

213
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:47,894
- Sorry, man.
- For what?

214
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:50,627
- All this.
- Don't sweat it.

215
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:55,427
All right, turn around. Gotta do the front.

216
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:57,763
What? Nobody else had to turn around.

217
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,765
What's the problem, Boy George,

218
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,334
you afraid we gonna see that
you got no dick?

219
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:05,383
- Fuck you.
- Hey, man. Quit being a fag, huh?

220
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,387
Maybe if we drop the soap...

221
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:13,414
All right, girls. Everyone on the line!

222
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:17,122
- Which one?
- I don't know.

223
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,993
That one. That line.

224
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:24,957
- How you doing?
- Gotta be honest,

225
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:28,768
you guys are the most suck-ass guards
I've ever seen.

226
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:35,746
Yeah, well, you can blow me
and the entire state of Kentucky.

227
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,777
Kentucky?

228
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,606
All right, look, we
gotta stop fucking around

229
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:43,279
or they might end this thing
before it even begins.

230
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,457
I didn't come all the way out here
not to get paid.

231
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:52,931
"From now on inmates will be addressed
only by their inmate numbers. "

232
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,891
That's awesome.

233
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,526
Wow.

234
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,593
The only other thing
that you girls need to know

235
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:07,976
is, "Prisoners will find cell
assignments attached to each cell. "

236
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:12,337
- Are we supposed to do that?
- Yes, Tinker Bell.

237
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,577
- Now?
- Yes.

238
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,542
Now run along. Run along, find your homes.

239
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,343
- Okay.
- Going.

240
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:21,517
- Okay, guys...
- This ain't a love-in. Get moving.

241
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:24,429
Waiting for a bus? Come on!

242
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:31,997
Hey, Travis.

243
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,076
Seventeen.

244
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,545
Seventy-seven.

245
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:51,219
Wow, I feel dangerous
just wearing this outfit.

246
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,545
- You look dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.

247
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,548
Yeah, you are massively
messing with me, right?

248
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:58,095
- No.
- No?

249
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,490
- Benjy Putterman.
- How you doing? Travis.

250
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:02,824
Novelist.

251
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,840
- Novelist, huh?
- Graphic novelist, actually.

252
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:16,309
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

253
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,539
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get so
much material from this place.

254
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,986
- This is ripping!
- Yeah.

255
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,294
Ripping.

256
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,459
So, what drew you to this experiment?

257
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,195
Cash-dollars.

258
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,964
My mother.

259
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:40,534
It was her idea?

260
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:43,840
She broke her hip,

261
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:46,798
I needed to pay the rent.

262
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,436
Do you live with your mother?

263
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:49,874
Yes.

264
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,713
And how old are you?

265
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:55,011
Forty-two.

266
00:22:55,655 --> 00:22:58,243
So, what drew you
to this experiment, Mr. Chase?

267
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:01,383
Pussy. Pussy drew me to the experiment.

268
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:04,516
It's a male-only experiment, Mr. Chase.

269
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:07,986
It's the pussy I'm gonna get
with the 14 grand once I'm done.

270
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:10,034
How many sexual partners have you had?

271
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,239
I lost track when I was, like, 17.

272
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:18,072
Were they male or female?

273
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,037
Female.

274
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:23,639
So, what drew you to
this experiment, Mr. Nix?

275
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:26,477
I'm just trying to make an honest buck, man.

276
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:28,543
Escape.

277
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:31,317
Come on, you big boy.

278
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,349
Throw it down.

279
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,722
Seventy-seven.

280
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:40,695
- Flying Man?
- No.

281
00:23:41,468 --> 00:23:42,821
You guys go ahead.

282
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:45,301
Oh, hell no. These knees are busted.

283
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:48,331
Hey, how about it, redwood? Throw it down?

284
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,740
- Wait.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

285
00:23:56,349 --> 00:23:59,648
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

286
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,841
- Bosch, you all right?
- I'm all right.

287
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:05,457
- Let's get you out of here.
- I thought he was looking.

288
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,649
- Come on.
- I did.

289
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:11,362
- You all right, big man. You all right.
- It's all right. It was an accident.

290
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:13,358
It's all right.

291
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:21,293
What the fuck was that guy thinking, huh?

292
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:24,376
I'm okay. I'm okay. He didn't mean it.

293
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:27,141
- Sure you're all right?
- It's just a bloody nose.

294
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,648
Let's just go back to work. Please.

295
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:34,539
I don't know.

296
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:38,110
- I think we gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?

297
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:41,125
I'm talking about rule number five.

298
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:44,087
Prisoners are not supposed to touch us.

299
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:49,324
Well, technically, he didn't touch us.
The ball did.

300
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,400
Look at your face, man.

301
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:56,330
I mean, we all heard what they said.
We gotta keep the order.

302
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,401
Respond commensurately.

303
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:04,380
They saw it. They know it was an accident.

304
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:08,618
- I agree.
- Are you sure about that?

305
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:11,977
Look, I just don't want that light
to come on in 30 minutes

306
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,979
because we didn't do what
we were supposed to do.

307
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,615
- I got 14 grand on the line.
- Yeah, we all got 14 grand on the line.

308
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,492
Come on.

309
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,197
We're not talking about
crucifying the man here.

310
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,262
The word's commensurate.

311
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,995
Which means,

312
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:33,579
if what the man did was small potatoes,

313
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:37,235
we respond in kind.

314
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:40,216
Small potatoes for small potatoes.

315
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:42,286
Either that,

316
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,458
or we wait till that light goes on.

317
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,291
Push-ups, ten.

318
00:25:57,403 --> 00:25:59,234
Do them now.

319
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,770
I just need a little civility, that's all.

320
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,469
It was an accident.

321
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,417
This is not a fucking negotiation.
Do the push-ups.

322
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:22,320
Just a little civility,
brother. Just a little.

323
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:30,165
All right, everyone, ten push-ups.

324
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:39,544
You heard the man. Let's go.

325
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:43,444
Do it! Come on, do it!

326
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:45,340
Yeah, follow your little brother.

327
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,045
There we are.

328
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,876
Count them out.

329
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:54,212
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

330
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,249
...four, five, six... four, five, six...

331
00:26:57,397 --> 00:27:01,019
...seven, eight, nine, ten...
seven, eight, nine, ten.

332
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:05,570
What did that tell you, huh?
Tater Tots for Tater Tots.

333
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:08,640
And you, you ought to be a cop, dude.

334
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:11,797
- Looked more like a drill sergeant to me.
- Yeah.

335
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:14,299
<i>Like that guy out of Full Metal Jacket.</i>

336
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,335
- "Give me 20, maggot!"
- Fuck you.

337
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:19,971
I'm almost embarrassed for them,
to be honest.

338
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,679
You know, stepping and fetching like that.

339
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:26,486
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

340
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,592
Just.

341
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,429
I guess we got our verdict.

342
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,772
I'm not mad, you know?

343
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,806
At them.

344
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:49,780
They keep making us do push-ups like this,
we'll be all swoll.

345
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:51,770
All of us are.

346
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:54,944
You know, get paid and get in shape.

347
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:59,119
- You got a girl, 17?
- No.

348
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:00,281
What about you?

349
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,594
- I'm at the start of something.
- Yeah?

350
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:07,231
Me too. Feels good, doesn't it?

351
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:10,831
- Good and bad.
- Mine's a barista.

352
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:14,392
Wouldn't think a guy like me
could pull a barista, would you?

353
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,303
What exactly do you write, anyway?

354
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,972
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

355
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,734
<i>Yeah, Flying Man's my next big launch.</i>

356
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:24,042
<i>- Flying Man?
- Yep.</i>

357
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:27,509
The man who flies.

358
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:31,446
- What's he do besides fly?
- See that?

359
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:34,746
What you just said,
"What else he do besides fly?"

360
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:38,483
That's how jaded people have become.
We're talking about flying here.

361
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:41,920
Like a human being, actually flying.

362
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:45,724
And no cape, nothing.
Just flying, you know?

363
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:47,959
Like you or me in this cell
just kind of taking off

364
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:50,795
like nothing could limit us.
Like we could just go, go, go.

365
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,343
Tell me, honestly,
who is not gonna want to read that?

366
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:56,968
I shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
My agent would kill me if he knew I was.

367
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:59,204
- You got an agent, huh?
- Yeah, couple.

368
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,539
How you like that, 77?

369
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:05,020
Looks like we got a heavy hitter
in the box with us.

370
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:07,854
Yeah, we do.

371
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:12,090
9:00, ladies! Lights out!

372
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,733
- Really, come on.
- What?

373
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:59,309
- What is it?
- Move along, fuck-butt.

374
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:04,981
Yum, yum, come on, people. Move along!

375
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,952
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta clean your plate.

376
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:50,926
Come on, man. That's not gonna happen.

377
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:54,753
What are you?
Spokesman for the union now?

378
00:30:54,901 --> 00:30:56,421
Look, nobody's trying to be difficult.

379
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:00,005
We'll eat everything else, just not that.

380
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:03,403
I mean, look at it.
It literally might be dog shit.

381
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:13,747
It's beans. Come on, eat them.

382
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:16,374
Come on, guys.

383
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:18,743
It's not like I'm being
unreasonable here, right?

384
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:21,413
I mean, we got rules, okay?

385
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:24,783
Rule number one:
You gotta clean your plate.

386
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,485
Rule number six says,
"You gotta eat dog shit. "

387
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,897
It's not dog shit.

388
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,061
It's dog shit.

389
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:38,630
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause you gotta eat it anyway.

390
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:41,406
Okay, I'm gonna just...
Oh, my God. My dog shit!

391
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,536
You fucking shit. Out of there.

392
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:48,106
Look, okay, memo to Adolf,
uniform's not real. Okay, baby?

393
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,586
<i>Hey, Moulin Rouge, you gotta eat it.</i>

394
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:54,049
Nobody's leaving here
until their plates are clean.

395
00:31:54,927 --> 00:31:56,986
You heard the man, huh?

396
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:00,962
The word is clean.

397
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:08,233
- Clean? Is that the word?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:13,406
Now it's clean.

399
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:20,813
He just earned you guys
some more push-ups.

400
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:24,742
Push-ups. You heard the man! Push-ups!

401
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,290
I'll give you push-ups. Push this up!

402
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,262
Complete wrong move, ass-licker.

403
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,836
Step back!

404
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:50,111
- You shouldn't have done that!

405
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:52,409
- Keep it up, girls. Get
it out of your system.

406
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:55,140
That's right, you goose-stepping pussy!

407
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:57,976
I will see you girls tonight.

408
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:01,025
Feel the wrath of Flying Man!

409
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:03,120
Flying Man?

410
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,323
Yeah.

411
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:14,139
This is our house, bitches!
This is our house!

412
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:18,396
Only reason,
only fucking reason they did that

413
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:22,167
was 'cause they knew
they weren't gonna get their asses kicked.

414
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:26,445
You take away someone's fear
of getting punched in the fucking mouth,

415
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:29,574
all of a sudden,
they're the biggest cocksuckers

416
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:31,587
on the fucking planet.

417
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:35,413
That may be true, but
the rules are the rules.

418
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:36,926
We don't use violence.

419
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,922
Well, we obviously gotta do something.

420
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,559
I mean, we are being tested
just as much as they are.

421
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:50,835
They made me look like a fucking pussy
is what they did.

422
00:33:51,243 --> 00:33:52,335
Yeah.

423
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:54,537
I got an idea.

424
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:59,547
I pledged for a fraternity once.

425
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,583
And during Hell Week, the brothers,

426
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,143
they would break down our will.

427
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:08,920
They would try to humble us
for the initiation that was gonna come.

428
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:13,117
I mean, the rules,
they were pretty much the same as here.

429
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:15,927
I mean, they couldn't hurt us.

430
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:19,194
But they could do something much worse,

431
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,630
they could humiliate us.

432
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,138
That's what we have to do.

433
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,879
Is we have to humiliate them.

434
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,135
What? What are you doing?

435
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:13,978
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- That is for inciting them.

436
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,390
- What? What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

437
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:20,563
You need to shut up. All right?

438
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:33,601
There will be no more incidents

439
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:36,410
like there was today.

440
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,245
Is that understood?

441
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:44,514
I said, is that understood?

442
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,644
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,818
Yes, what? 'Cause I can't hear you.

444
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,426
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

445
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:03,739
Who's the bitches now, bitches?

446
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:10,209
Great job, guys. Great job.

447
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:12,510
- Dude, I...
- Great job.

448
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,755
- Nice speech.
- Good job, good job.

449
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:21,560
I'll catch up later.

450
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:36,463
Excuse me? Excuse me?

451
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:43,599
I'm having heat flashes.
I think my blood sugar is low.

452
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:49,772
Capote, just shut the fuck up, okay?

453
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:57,944
- What are you talking about, man?
- I'm having low blood sugar.

454
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:02,518
If I gotta say "Shut the fuck up"
one more time...

455
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:16,464
You all right?

456
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:33,122
Okay, everybody's had their fun.

457
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:41,559
I'm gonna suggest

458
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:45,069
that we act like gentlemen
for the rest of the way.

459
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:47,100
That we play by the rules

460
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:51,639
these last 11 days.

461
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,877
And everybody can go home happily
with their money.

462
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,477
How's that sound?

463
00:39:10,295 --> 00:39:11,694
Where is 51?

464
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:17,295
Where's 51?

465
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:23,397
Let's go.

466
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:30,943
I need sugar.

467
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:36,140
Look, diabetic.
Says he's diabetic on his application.

468
00:39:36,288 --> 00:39:38,576
So he needs insulin, that's what it is.

469
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,887
No, no, no. Look.
It says he regulates it through diet.

470
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:45,416
Yeah, man, it's in his own words.

471
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,964
He's the one that filled this out.

472
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:53,357
This is not a big deal. It's not.

473
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,660
I mean, my fucking grandma
has basically the same thing,

474
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:57,762
and she just gets moody in between meals.

475
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,936
Trust me, this is not a big deal.

476
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:04,669
Fifty-one, you need to get up.

477
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:06,837
Let's go, come on. Get up.

478
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,543
Hey, I wanna do this.

479
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:11,976
I do. I just need a Twix bar.

480
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:13,878
There's one in my bag if you can find it.

481
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:16,790
Twix bar. Is that what you wanna eat?

482
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:22,061
Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Come on!

483
00:40:22,701 --> 00:40:25,226
- Are you kidding me?
- You're all right.

484
00:40:27,406 --> 00:40:31,262
- Hey, why don't you let the man be?
- You know the rules, 77.

485
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,131
All prisoners must participate in rec.

486
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:38,545
And you do not address me
unless I have spoken to you first.

487
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:41,149
The man... Look at him.

488
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,153
The man can't do it.

489
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:55,130
You do understand that
this is a prison experiment, right?

490
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,754
Yes.

491
00:40:56,902 --> 00:41:01,703
And you do understand
the roles that we've been given?

492
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:05,143
- Obviously.
- You are a prisoner.

493
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:11,677
You don't give orders, we give orders.

494
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:15,780
Have I made myself completely clear
to you now?

495
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:23,158
Let the man lie down.

496
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:32,931
Do I need to escalate matters right now?

497
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:36,273
Is that what I should do?

498
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,872
What is that supposed to mean?

499
00:41:40,345 --> 00:41:44,213
It means that you won't shut up.

500
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:50,915
And I am trying to figure out
how I'm supposed to deal with that.

501
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:57,748
- Why don't you try being rational?
- How is this for rational?

502
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,183
Do I look rational now? Do I?

503
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:00,108
- Let's put the sugar
in him real quick, man.

504
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:00,885
- Put it away.

505
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:01,986
Do I look rational now?

506
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:06,127
You hit me and the experiment is over.

507
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:09,897
You know that and I know that.

508
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:13,664
Easy now, brother. Come on.

509
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:15,499
Okay. It's okay.

510
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:18,377
All right, everyone, back in their cell.

511
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:20,905
Let's go, guards!
Get them back in their cells!

512
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:22,850
- Let's go.
- Get in!

513
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:24,611
I don't need an escort.

514
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,814
This ain't right! I ain't playing that shit.

515
00:42:29,962 --> 00:42:31,259
Go. Move!

516
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:08,596
<i>What do you think they want from us?</i>

517
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:13,302
Why would you run a prison experiment?

518
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,168
Throw some animals in a cage

519
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:22,712
and you get to find out which one
of us is gonna be the lions

520
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:25,773
and which ones are gonna get gut.

521
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:32,347
I like to think we're slightly higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys.

522
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:36,013
It don't matter how
evolved you think we are.

523
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:40,791
You lock up any animal long enough
and the strong's gonna eat the weak.

524
00:43:41,033 --> 00:43:42,762
That's just the way it is.

525
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:49,003
You learn that in prison, 17?

526
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,766
- You must think I'm somebody else, slick.
- No.

527
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:59,069
Just that tattoo you got
there is an Aryan tat,

528
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:02,744
so I figured, you know,
you probably got that in the pen.

529
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:11,192
Expert in the penitentiary system,
are you, boy?

530
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:14,752
I just watch a lot of Discovery Channel.

531
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,166
You will not interfere
with my ability to make a paycheck.

532
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,664
You understand?

533
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:29,379
We're cool. No sweat.

534
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,551
So, what were you in for anyway?

535
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:47,630
- Did you really just ask me that?
- Yeah. I just asked you that.

536
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:52,466
- You better pump your brakes, boy.
- Oh, yeah?

537
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:56,771
- Why's that?
- Lf you don't start respecting the guards,

538
00:44:57,342 --> 00:44:59,867
you're gonna have a serious problem.

539
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:05,014
- They're not guards.
- No, they're guards all right.

540
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,911
And them up there,
they're getting exactly what they want.

541
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:15,622
I suggest you stop protecting your friend.

542
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:17,915
What's right is right, man.

543
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:21,089
Last thing a man wants to be in the pen
is right.

544
00:45:21,266 --> 00:45:22,494
Dudes, they...

545
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:26,468
They start digging in
and getting all righteous then.

546
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:31,839
That only leads to one place.
Go along to get along, man.

547
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:37,144
Whatever fire you got in your belly,
you're best to let it go.

548
00:45:38,717 --> 00:45:39,945
Trust me.

549
00:45:41,653 --> 00:45:43,018
Let it go.

550
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:44,723
<i>All I know</i>

551
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:50,962
is homie lost his shit back there.

552
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:54,932
- It was just a show.
- For you, maybe.

553
00:45:56,168 --> 00:46:00,291
- Half those fuckers, they were ready to go.
- They weren't gonna do anything.

554
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,066
How well do you know them?

555
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,128
The assholes outnumber us, for one.

556
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:06,263
If they wanted to take the advantage,
they could.

557
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:09,175
Us out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere, we're on our own.

558
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:11,635
The experimenters,
they wouldn't let anything happen.

559
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:13,808
How well do you know them?

560
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:21,723
Seventy-seven, he's the ringleader.

561
00:46:22,928 --> 00:46:27,797
Either way, if it keeps going like this,
someone's gonna throw down.

562
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:32,089
Look, guys, guys. If anyone gets
hurt, this experiment is over.

563
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:33,257
None of us will get paid.

564
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:35,896
Well, we gotta put the clamps on this thing
once and for all then.

565
00:46:36,808 --> 00:46:38,400
What're you thinking?

566
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:42,877
You wanna know how to reach these guys?

567
00:46:44,182 --> 00:46:45,171
How?

568
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,844
You scare 'em.

569
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:35,098
Comfortable?

570
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:43,167
Helweg?

571
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:48,473
Come on...

572
00:47:56,488 --> 00:48:00,219
The prisoners, they listen to you.

573
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:06,920
For some reason they look to you
like you're the leader.

574
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,355
I got news for you.

575
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:13,057
In here,

576
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:16,766
you're the leader of shit.

577
00:48:19,044 --> 00:48:21,832
This place, it belongs to us.

578
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,005
It belongs to us.

579
00:48:26,418 --> 00:48:30,081
Hey, there are all kinds of things
that we could do to you

580
00:48:31,756 --> 00:48:35,487
to make you hip to that fact.

581
00:48:46,805 --> 00:48:52,766
So, do we have the proper respect

582
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:54,807
for authority now?

583
00:48:56,681 --> 00:48:59,377
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

584
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,745
This stuff is going right through me.

585
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:42,880
- Saddle up, gentlemen!
- Fuck!

586
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:44,815
You want to send a message?

587
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:48,091
Then send a message. Saddle up.

588
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:52,531
Saddle up!

589
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:57,330
What the hell...

590
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,978
You okay?

591
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,434
That was colossally fucked up.

592
00:51:33,104 --> 00:51:35,368
I mean, you are shit-ass nuts,
you know that?

593
00:51:37,275 --> 00:51:39,641
And that's a good thing, Barris.

594
00:51:40,779 --> 00:51:46,911
The light, it didn't come on. They
saw it, and it's not coming on.

595
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:54,723
We did what we did, we sent a message,
but it never leaves this place.

596
00:51:55,026 --> 00:51:56,516
I got something to say.

597
00:51:57,996 --> 00:52:02,330
If anything happens like that again,
anything at all,

598
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:05,695
I'm out of here.

599
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:10,872
You make a unilateral decision like that,

600
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:16,944
it could cost the rest of us 100 grand.

601
00:52:20,452 --> 00:52:22,113
I don't care, sir.

602
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,198
Let it go.

603
00:52:57,789 --> 00:52:58,742
Scenario.

604
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:03,146
Someone harms someone you love.
Rapes them, kills them.

605
00:53:03,294 --> 00:53:04,625
The law fails to prosecute.

606
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:09,326
This person is free.
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

607
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:13,123
- Would you consider that justice?
- I don't think on those terms.

608
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:17,527
Justice is what keeps us safe
as a society. Ordered.

609
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:23,341
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.
An eye for an eye for an eye.

610
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:28,572
It takes a turning of the cheek
for this species to evolve.

611
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,408
So, you're the one who knows
what it's going to take

612
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:33,490
for the human species to evolve.

613
00:53:33,658 --> 00:53:36,413
Just regurgitating what people
a lot smarter than me have been saying

614
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:39,291
for a long, long time.

615
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:15,490
Hey.

616
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:23,967
Look what I found. Take it.
That ought to boost your blood sugar.

617
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,063
No, it won't.

618
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:29,199
Yeah, there's a lot of
carbohydrates in there.

619
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:34,341
It's like the world's cheapest bread.
It's going to turn to sugar. Trust me.

620
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,080
Yeah, it won't turn to insulin, though.

621
00:54:39,424 --> 00:54:41,358
I thought you didn't need insulin.

622
00:54:41,859 --> 00:54:42,917
Fibbed.

623
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:48,682
If they wouldn't let
me bring it down here,

624
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:52,101
I figured I could tough it out.

625
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:54,269
Jesus Christ.

626
00:54:56,274 --> 00:54:57,994
- Benjy...
- Fifty-one.

627
00:54:58,142 --> 00:55:01,565
Listen, you can't play around with this.
I got to let them know immediately.

628
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:03,166
I mean, they need to know.
I got to get you out of here.

629
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:04,303
No.

630
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:07,074
You don't understand. You could die.

631
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:10,748
Not if I get the insulin.

632
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,322
Why are you doing this?

633
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:24,268
Flying Man is a fraud.

634
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:26,823
Don't say that.

635
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:33,274
Yeah. It's stupid. It's a stupid,
shitty, fat lie. Just like me.

636
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:35,604
He's just a man that flies.

637
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:46,147
I need this. I need to stop being a fraud.

638
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:52,051
I need for once to have something
to show for myself.

639
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:59,433
Please, 77. Please.

640
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,868
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus!

641
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:41,000
Nothing.

642
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,479
- Don't beat your shit off next to me.
- I'm not beating my shit. Fuck off.

643
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:25,987
I'll give you a thousand of my own money.

644
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:29,620
He should just go.

645
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:36,299
Listen, man, there's insulin in his bag.
Can you get it?

646
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:42,933
You know that's not allowed.

647
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:46,875
I'll give you two. Two thousand.

648
00:57:52,617 --> 00:57:54,949
Two thousand, man. He needs it.

649
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:06,929
I don't need the money.

650
00:58:39,163 --> 00:58:42,860
Twenty-two. Get up.

651
00:58:44,635 --> 00:58:46,330
Captain wants to see you.

652
00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:13,422
Lucky for us, there's no cameras in here.

653
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:16,786
What?

654
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:20,995
All right, so if we're going to do this,
you can't tell anybody.

655
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:24,374
The fuck are you talking about?

656
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:28,871
All I want is a blow job. That's it.

657
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:31,271
No, no, no, no.

658
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,205
Come on. Just get down on your knees.

659
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:36,547
Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...

660
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:40,176
First, you get down on your
knees, all right? All right?

661
00:59:40,324 --> 00:59:41,544
I want to go back to my cell.

662
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:44,354
You will soon enough.
But first you're going to suck my dick.

663
00:59:44,762 --> 00:59:45,949
Suck it yourself.

664
00:59:46,097 --> 00:59:49,760
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your fucking knees.

665
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:54,257
What's going on in here?

666
00:59:54,405 --> 00:59:55,429
Nothing.

667
00:59:55,706 --> 00:59:57,674
What is that prisoner doing out of his cell?

668
00:59:57,909 --> 01:00:01,606
He had something to tell me
about number 77.

669
01:00:02,113 --> 01:00:04,501
He didn't want to say it
in front of the others.

670
01:00:04,649 --> 01:00:06,269
- Seventy-seven?
- Yeah.

671
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:08,282
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

672
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:10,477
No, I'm asking him. Is that true?

673
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:12,308
It's true. It's true.

674
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:15,857
Barris. Thank God I found you.
You got to come quick.

675
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:25,824
See?

676
01:00:32,476 --> 01:00:33,534
Why?

677
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:46,686
What were you doing back there?

678
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:49,782
Nothing.

679
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:52,921
I need you to empty your pockets
for me then.

680
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:59,234
Empty your pockets, Bosch.
Empty that pocket right there.

681
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:22,489
You know that nothing from the outside
world enters into this cell block.

682
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:25,359
- You know that, right?
- I mean, I was...

683
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:27,587
Quiet. Shut up.

684
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:35,065
They're trying to get you to undermine me.
I know you would never do that.

685
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,971
Who asked you to do that?

686
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:42,102
You tell me and all will be forgiven.

687
01:01:44,515 --> 01:01:45,982
Who told you?

688
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,285
We need to talk later about this.

689
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:30,218
Later.

690
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:55,776
As you can see,

691
01:02:58,055 --> 01:02:59,647
I'm a reasonable man.

692
01:03:00,257 --> 01:03:04,216
I'm not the monster that you
somehow conjured up in your head.

693
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,828
I've been given a position,

694
01:03:13,537 --> 01:03:15,232
didn't ask for it.

695
01:03:17,575 --> 01:03:22,308
In some ways it would've been easier
if I was just a prisoner.

696
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:26,116
- Like you.
- I doubt that very much.

697
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:28,237
You broke the rules again, 77.

698
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:29,939
The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin...

699
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:31,474
"The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin. "

700
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:32,987
"Guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin. "

701
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,143
Did you hear that?

702
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:36,350
A guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin!

703
01:03:37,995 --> 01:03:39,215
Really?

704
01:03:39,363 --> 01:03:42,264
When you speak, can you hear yourself?

705
01:03:47,404 --> 01:03:50,567
What do you think is on
the other side of those cameras?

706
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:55,336
We are being watched

707
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,878
24 hours a day by people
who know what they are doing.

708
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:04,186
Do you think that if
there was even a chance,

709
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:06,621
just the littlest bit of a chance,

710
01:04:07,825 --> 01:04:10,123
that somebody'd die,
that they would let it happen?

711
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:13,696
He's perfectly safe, your friend.

712
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:20,568
They will keep him perfectly safe.

713
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,271
When this is over,
you know what you ought to do?

714
01:04:26,677 --> 01:04:27,769
No.

715
01:04:28,946 --> 01:04:31,176
You ought to take this money,

716
01:04:31,982 --> 01:04:35,474
take a little time off
from whatever it is that you do.

717
01:04:36,587 --> 01:04:40,421
Check into a nice, clean mental facility

718
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:44,692
where experts can properly diagnose
what exactly is wrong with you.

719
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:47,383
Maybe you could suggest to me
a mental facility,

720
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:51,433
because obviously you're running around
in a mental facility inside of your head.

721
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:53,523
You're letting this guy
fucking run the show?

722
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:54,991
You're still not following the rules.

723
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:56,800
- You need help.
- Still arguing about the rules.

724
01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:01,211
I'm not trying to instigate anything.
You need to get help, okay?

725
01:05:01,712 --> 01:05:04,044
You need some fucking help.

726
01:05:05,783 --> 01:05:07,614
You know what I need?

727
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:12,781
I need you to clean that toilet.

728
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:19,294
- That's what I need.
- Enough. Enough of this shit, man.

729
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,361
Toilet! It's not cleaning itself.

730
01:05:23,534 --> 01:05:26,489
Let's just stop this, all right, guys?
Let's stop.

731
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:28,161
You're in charge.
Does that make you happy?

732
01:05:28,572 --> 01:05:33,009
Toilet! I need you to clean my toilet!

733
01:05:33,177 --> 01:05:35,668
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

734
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,512
Fuck. You.

735
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:43,577
I don't normally like to use profanity,
but fuck you!

736
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:45,811
Fuck...

737
01:05:55,866 --> 01:05:58,164
You are a prisoner, 77.

738
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,531
But your pride is getting in the way.

739
01:06:04,908 --> 01:06:09,743
I think I need you to say it for me.

740
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:13,614
Say, "I am a prisoner. "

741
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:15,411
Fuck you.

742
01:06:22,393 --> 01:06:23,621
Say it.

743
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:25,921
Fuck...

744
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:39,865
Say it.

745
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:50,311
Go to hell.

746
01:07:09,673 --> 01:07:11,300
Stop it, please.

747
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:16,339
Then say it for me.

748
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:22,274
I...

749
01:07:24,722 --> 01:07:26,849
I am...

750
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:31,557
A prisoner. A prisoner.

751
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:36,591
A prisoner. I am a prisoner.

752
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:41,562
Yes. Yes. Yes, 77.

753
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:47,301
That is exactly what you are.

754
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:37,719
Hey. Talk to you for a minute?

755
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:46,623
Come on.

756
01:09:54,938 --> 01:09:56,235
Let's go.

757
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:13,253
- How come we can't talk back in the room?
- Some of the guys just wouldn't wait.

758
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:21,589
Whatever you guys are going to do,
please don't do it.

759
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:55,110
I think it's pretty
clear by now there will be

760
01:10:55,111 --> 01:10:58,125
a zero tolerance for breaking the rules.

761
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:12,271
Bosch will be joining the prison population.

762
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:17,112
He will be referred to now as Prisoner 76.

763
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:22,114
Is there a problem with that, Prisoner 77?

764
01:11:25,495 --> 01:11:26,587
Good.

765
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:34,798
I am an equitable man. Equitable. Equitable.

766
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:41,997
<i>Not once, not once
can you accuse me</i>

767
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:43,432
<i>of breaking the rules.</i>

768
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:47,107
<i>The rules, they help us
because they guide us...</i>

769
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:54,683
<i>So that we can exist. So that we can exist.</i>

770
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:57,017
Exist in this world.

771
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:02,088
Everybody's not happy
with their lot in life.

772
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:05,467
They have a position, he has a position,

773
01:12:05,736 --> 01:12:09,672
and all of you, all of you,
you have your positions.

774
01:12:10,641 --> 01:12:16,204
And I, I have a position.
Without the rules, there's chaos.

775
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:23,584
Put that back on.

776
01:12:34,965 --> 01:12:37,957
I said, put that back on, 77.

777
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:45,807
Did you hear me, 77?

778
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:53,881
Put it back on! You put that back on.
You get back in the line.

779
01:12:54,384 --> 01:12:58,343
Don't take another step. What're you doing?
Just let him go by? Stop him!

780
01:12:59,456 --> 01:13:02,578
Open the gate. You in there.

781
01:13:02,726 --> 01:13:03,750
- We're done.
- Seventy-seven.

782
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:05,918
You hear me? We're done.

783
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:07,895
We're done.

784
01:13:12,402 --> 01:13:16,429
Nobody speaks to them,
do you hear me? Nobody.

785
01:13:16,773 --> 01:13:20,563
Nobody can speak to them.
You don't say one single word to them!

786
01:13:20,711 --> 01:13:24,900
That's rule number one now.
Nobody speaks to them!

787
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:26,675
That's my friend!

788
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:48,857
You fucking lowlife! You piece of shit!

789
01:13:49,005 --> 01:13:51,060
You couldn't just shut the fuck up,
could you?

790
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,335
You brought this on your fucking self!

791
01:13:53,844 --> 01:13:55,209
Fuck you!

792
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:59,835
Divide the prisoners up. Isolate
them so they can't communicate.

793
01:13:59,983 --> 01:14:03,475
The only strength in numbers
I want inside this place is ours.

794
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:58,822
How the fuck can you
listen to that shit?

795
01:14:58,823 --> 01:15:01,905
I can't even fucking think.

796
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:03,373
All I know is I'm out of here.

797
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:07,803
You do know that any decisions we make,

798
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:08,937
we make together?

799
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:10,279
Well, this thing's over.

800
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:11,907
We used violence
and the experiment's done.

801
01:15:12,055 --> 01:15:14,100
Is it? It's been a lot
longer than half an hour

802
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:16,145
and red light hasn't come on yet.

803
01:15:16,293 --> 01:15:17,446
So fucking what?

804
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:19,538
If you think about this rationally,

805
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:21,483
it was the prisoners
who did the violence.

806
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:23,652
We just responded commensurately.

807
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,497
Fuck commensurately.
And fuck that fucking red light!

808
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:30,202
How can you say that?

809
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,395
The red light,
that's the only thing that we have!

810
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:34,532
Don't you realize that?

811
01:15:38,014 --> 01:15:41,142
It's the only way that we can know.

812
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:46,312
Where's my music?

813
01:15:59,202 --> 01:16:01,568
You can feel what's happening, right?

814
01:16:02,572 --> 01:16:05,564
You're fucking crazy. You know that?

815
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,868
Can you feel it?

816
01:16:44,347 --> 01:16:50,343
What? Camera? Camera.

817
01:16:55,392 --> 01:16:58,514
Why? Why would you have...

818
01:16:58,662 --> 01:17:01,722
Why don't you stop this? Why?

819
01:17:27,157 --> 01:17:30,257
I'll fucking kill you. Kill. I'll

820
01:17:30,258 --> 01:17:33,357
fucking kill you.

821
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:57,840
I'm going to take that tape off of you.

822
01:17:57,988 --> 01:18:00,980
And you're going to give me what I want.
Okay?

823
01:18:03,493 --> 01:18:04,517
Fuck you.

824
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:10,622
You're a fucking faggot. You know that.

825
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:19,842
Aren't you afraid? Yeah. Yeah.

826
01:18:21,478 --> 01:18:22,911
I know you.

827
01:18:39,596 --> 01:18:44,898
You didn't think I would see?
You didn't think I was smart enough?

828
01:18:51,775 --> 01:18:53,470
Please don't hit me again.

829
01:18:53,743 --> 01:18:55,506
Hey, I was going to try to be nice.

830
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:07,389
Fucking kill you.

831
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:19,662
Please.

832
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,702
You know, if your mouth
doesn't want to play nice,

833
01:19:29,212 --> 01:19:31,840
we'll just have to use the other end.

834
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:47,749
No. No, no, please. Wait, wait. Time out.

835
01:19:47,897 --> 01:19:51,162
- Shut up!
- Time out, time out.

836
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:23,758
No. Please don't do this.

837
01:20:26,035 --> 01:20:27,024
Hi.

838
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:40,445
Go to sleep, motherfucker, go to sleep.

839
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:43,541
You think fags are funny?
Who's funny now?

840
01:20:53,496 --> 01:20:59,298
- Hey, kid. You all right?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

841
01:21:12,115 --> 01:21:13,707
You still want to go along and get along?

842
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,410
Fuck no.

843
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:24,488
These boys must think I'm somebody else.

844
01:21:37,473 --> 01:21:38,963
Everybody's out, man.

845
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:44,346
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

846
01:22:05,868 --> 01:22:08,063
No, no, no. Come on.

847
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,681
Barris, we got trouble.

848
01:22:32,028 --> 01:22:33,052
Coming for you!

849
01:22:33,563 --> 01:22:34,552
Jesus.

850
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:03,384
Jesus. What'll we do?

851
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:05,921
We get ready.

852
01:23:08,598 --> 01:23:12,796
You're fucking losing it, man.
They outnumber us two to one.

853
01:23:20,276 --> 01:23:25,043
Maybe, but they're still prisoners.
And they're still scared of us.

854
01:23:27,684 --> 01:23:29,675
We're the authority here.

855
01:23:32,555 --> 01:23:35,217
Does that look like they give a fuck?

856
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,858
Fuck your authority.

857
01:23:41,698 --> 01:23:43,666
About fucking time.

858
01:24:28,411 --> 01:24:32,033
What're you doing? What are you doing?
We got to stand and fight!

859
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:35,912
This is our world!
You cannot take it from us! No!

860
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:37,378
Why are you doing this?

861
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:39,817
We're still guards! Guards!

862
01:24:59,409 --> 01:25:01,309
This is your fault!

863
01:29:41,424 --> 01:29:45,656
You still think we're higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys?

864
01:29:54,103 --> 01:29:55,297
Yeah.

865
01:29:57,973 --> 01:30:00,874
'Cause we can still do something about it.

866
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:06,267
<i>The facility is actively leased</i>

867
01:30:06,415 --> 01:30:10,071
<i>by a corporate think-tank
reported to have ties to the government.</i>

868
01:30:10,219 --> 01:30:12,307
A spokesperson with the Monad Corporation

869
01:30:12,455 --> 01:30:15,343
tells us the facility has been used
for psychological testing.

870
01:30:15,491 --> 01:30:18,313
Yes, we'll testify. Whatever it takes.

871
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:21,382
A guy died in there.
A guy named Benjy Putterman.

872
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:24,152
<i>...arrested the lead researcher,
a Dr. John Archalata,</i>

873
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,421
<i>and charged him with manslaughter.</i>

874
01:30:26,569 --> 01:30:28,696
<i>We'll bring you more
as the situation develops.</i>
