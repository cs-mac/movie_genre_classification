<i>Roger Ebert:
We all are born</i>

<i>how we were raised.</i>

7

We're kind of
stuck inside that person,

8
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,255
and the purpose of
civilization and growth,

9
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,623
is to be able to reach out

10
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,326
and empathize a little bit
with other people.

11
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,429
<i>And for me, the movies
are like a machine</i>

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,364
<i>that generates empathy.</i>

13
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,600
<i>It lets you understand
a little bit more</i>

<i>about different hopes,
aspirations, dreams and fears.</i>

15

69

<i>In grade school,

<i>When I went home with it,

<i>you could put your by-line

My parents finally
had to take it away from me.

79
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,846
Everything was by Roger Ebert.

91
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,177
<i>"Boy, there's no money to send

92
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,980

<i>I wouldn't be

96

<i>"Roger, there's
professors over there,</i>

<i>that's what you

99

101
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,503
I think his father recognized
early on that Roger had a gift.

102

<i>I joined "The Daily Illini,"

106
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,684
<i>It was in every sense

<i>that made the building tremble.</i>

110
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,559
<i>As editor, I was a case study:</i>

111
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,763
<i>tactless, egotistical,
merciless, and a showboat.</i>

112
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,532
<i>Nack:
And he was.</i>

113
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,134
<i>But it worked
because he could back it up.</i>

114
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:20,505
It was intimidating
to the members of the staff

115
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,512
because he was like, uh,
a mature writer at that time.

116
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,081
Now here, when those
four children were killed

117
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,816
in the church bombing
in Birmingham,

118
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,618
there was a huge protest
around the country.

119
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,954
<i>Male news reporter: Four hundred students
gathered on the university quadrangle</i>

<i>to protest the bombing

121
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:43,628
<i>Nack: And Roger was the voice
of outrage on this campus.</i>

122
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,263
<i>He started off
his column by quoting</i>

123
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,
who said, to George Wallace,</i>

124

"The blood of these innocent
children is on your hands."

125
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,839
That ended the quote.

126
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,708
Then Roger began
his column by saying,

127
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,745
"That is not entirely the truth.

128
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,180
The blood is on so many hands

129
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:07,251
that history will weep
in the telling.

130

And it is not new blood.

131
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,890
It is old, very old.

132
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,693
And as Lady Macbeth discovered,

133
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,629
it will not ever wash away."

134
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,333
<i>That began a column written
by a 21-year-old guy,</i>

135
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:26,671
<i>and he said it better
than anybody said it all week.</i>

136
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:31,943
Roger was editor
on November 22nd, 1963,

137
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,312
when John F. Kennedy was shot.

138
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,647
<i>At around two o'clock

139
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,783
<i>the presses rolled,</i>

140
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,085
<i>gigantic presses,

<i>chug and chug,</i>

142
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,855
<i>and Ebert was doing
what editors do</i>

143
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,158
<i>at the end of the day:
check out the pages.</i>

144
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,129
<i>And he opens it up and there's
a picture of John F. Kennedy,</i>

145
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,866
<i>and an ad of a pilgrim

<i>pointed at Kennedy's head.</i>

147
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:02,106
Ebert said,
"We gotta switch this."

148
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:06,277
The pressman said like,
"Hear that sound, Roger?

149
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,981
That's the sound
of newspapers being printed."

150
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:14,085
<i>Unlike in movies,
you didn't stop the presses.</i>

151
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:18,756
And Ebert said, "We-we-we're
not gonna print that tomorrow.

152
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,360
We gotta stop the presses."

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,995
<i>Ebert became famous
to us for that,</i>

154
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,864
<i>because, you know,
here was a kid</i>

155
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:30,101
<i>taking control
of an adult situation</i>

156
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,909
and making a news judgment,
an important one.

157
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,679
<i>Roger: Chicago was the great
city over the horizon.</i>

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,381
<i>We read Chicago's newspapers</i>

159
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,850
<i>and listened to its powerful
AM radio stations.</i>

160
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,752
<i>Jack Egan: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

161
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,120
<i>it's midnight here in Chicago.</i>

162
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,855
<i>Roger:
Long after midnight,</i>

163
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,757
<i>I listened
to Jack Egan broadcasting live.</i>

164
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,993
<i>Egan: ...Chez Lounge and the
world famous Chez Paree.</i>

165
00:09:55,994 --> 00:10:00,131
<i>Roger: Chatting with Martin and
Lewis, or Rosemary Clooney.</i>

166
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,234
<i>I'd been accepted
as a PhD candidate in English</i>

167
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,307
<i>by the University of Chicago,
but I needed a job.</i>

168
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,776
<i>I got a part time job
at the Sun-Times,</i>

169
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,044
<i>and then five months later,</i>

170
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,746
<i>the film critic retired
and they gave me the job.</i>

171
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,248
<i>I did not apply for it.</i>

172
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,451
Newspaper film critics
had been interchangeable.

173
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,219
Uh, some papers had by-lines

174
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,921
that different people
wrote under.

175
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,123
<i>For example,
the Tribune had Mae Tinee,</i>

176
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,426
<i>and that could be who ever went
to the movies that day.</i>

177
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,362
<i>Because Mae Tinee really
spelled out "matinee."</i>

178
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:35,132
<i>I was at that time the youngest
daily film critic in America.</i>

179
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,468
<i>And it was a real good time
to be a movie critic.</i>

180
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:40,480
Armed robbery.

181
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,953
<i>( Roger speaking )</i>

182
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:57,755
Bet you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.

183
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:01,192
<i>( Roger speaking )</i>

184
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,927

185
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,396
<i>It is also

186
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,198
<i>filled with sympathy,</i>

187
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>nauseating,
funny, heartbreaking.</i>

188
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,470
- Hey! What's your name, anyhow?
- Clyde Barrow.

189
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,239
<i>- And astonishingly beautiful.
- Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.</i>

190
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,944
Pleased to meet you.

191
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,411
<i>Roger:
The fact that the story</i>

192
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,481
<i>is set 35 years ago
doesn't mean a thing.</i>

193
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,018
<i>It had to be set sometime,
but it was made now.</i>

194
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,522
<i>And it's about us.</i>

195
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,824
Roger was the most facile writer
I ever came across.

196
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,093
Anybody that
has ever seen him work.

197
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:37,762
He could, he could knock out

198
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:42,833
<i>a full thought out movie review
in 30 minutes.</i>

199
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,269
<i>Fast and furious.</i>

200
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,371
<i>Rick Kogan: There were so
many reporters that formed</i>

201
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,875
easy quick friendships
because they were smart,

202
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,444
they were good writers,
they were literate,

203
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,645
and they could tell
a good story in a saloon.

204
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,383
<i>Roger:
O'Rourke's was our stage,</i>

205
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,153
<i>and we displayed
our personas there nightly.</i>

206
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,455
<i>It was a shabby
street corner tavern</i>

207
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,891
<i>on a dicey stretch
of North Avenue,</i>

208
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,392
<i>a block after Chicago's Old Town</i>

209
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,996
<i>stopped being a tourist haven.</i>

210
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,098
<i>When a roomer
who lived upstairs died,</i>

211
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,300
<i>his body
was discovered when maggots</i>

212
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,269
<i>started to drop
through the ceiling.</i>

213
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,204
<i>For many years, I drank there</i>

214
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,907
<i>more or less every night
when I was in town.</i>

215
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,058
<i>So did a lot of people.</i>

216
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,844
<i>McHugh:
We all sat at the same place.</i>

217
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,579
<i>The newspaper guys here,</i>

218
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,347
<i>the druggies in the middle,</i>

219
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,951
<i>the surly staff
at the very end of the bar.</i>

220
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:39,290
Roger has always been attracted
to weird types.

221
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,559
I mean, you should see
some of the women

222
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,062
that he's hauled in
to O'Rourke's over the years.

223
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,530
<i>Bruce Elliot:
Back in the old days,</i>

224
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:49,099
<i>Roger had, probably
the worst taste in women</i>

225
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,534
<i>of any man I've ever known.</i>

226
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,571
They were either gold diggers,

227
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,040
opportunists, or psychos.

228
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,876
Yeah, I met Roger one time
with a woman

229
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,445
that looked like
a young Linda Ronstadt,

230
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,048
and when she was gone
from the table briefly,

231
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,449
I said, "Who is that?"

232
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,453
And he said,
"She's a hired lady."

233
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,589
<i>And I said, "A hooker?"</i>

234
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,190
<i>( laughs )</i>

235
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,460
And he said, "Now you take care
of her when I leave."

236
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:19,067
And he left town.
And anyway...

237
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,400
<i>McHugh:
Roger, he used to hang</i>

238
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,136
<i>from the lamppost
at the end of the bar.</i>

239
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,638
<i>When he got going,</i>

240
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,307
<i>Roger was one of
the finest storytellers</i>

241
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,543
<i>that I have ever come across.</i>

242
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,211
He would hold court,

243
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:37,281
and it's not like everyone
was invited to join in

244
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,950
and have a colloquy with him.

245
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,585
Since he bought drinks
for everybody

246
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:45,356
when he had the money,
who's not to listen?

247
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,459
<i>Simon: His great friend
was John McHugh.</i>

248
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,228
<i>And I remember a famous argument</i>

249
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:55,466
<i>over who was the more
cosmopolitan of the two.</i>

250
00:13:55,467 --> 00:14:00,037
<i>And Ebert was saying,
"John, I travel the world.</i>

251
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,139
<i>I go to every country in Europe.</i>

252
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,974
<i>I go to Cannes.</i>

253
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,577
<i>I'm a cosmopolitan person."</i>

254
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:12,416
John said, "Ebert, you don't
even speak a foreign language,"

255
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,686
And Ebert said,
"I speak enough to be able

256
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,957
<i>to order two Johnny Walker
Blacks anywhere in the world."</i>

257
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,061
Any sober human being
looking at the two of them

258
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:28,438
<i>would've decided neither was
actually a cosmopolitan figure.</i>

259
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,606
<i>Roger: I discovered there
was nothing like drinking</i>

260
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,641
<i>with a crowd
to make you a member.</i>

261
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:41,278
<i>I copied the idealism
and cynicism of the reporters.</i>

262
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,379
<i>I spoke like they did.</i>

263
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,381
<i>Laughed at the same things.</i>

264
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,287
<i>Felt that I belonged.</i>

265
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,688
<i>Elliot:

<i>Nelson Algren wasn't born here.</i>

267
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,692
<i>Saul Bellow wasn't born here.</i>

268
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,494
But there's a certain kind
of Chicago character

269
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:00,698
that Roger really came
to believe that he was.

270
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,168
<i>♪ Whoa, stayin' out
all night long... ♪</i>

271
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,071
Roger was not just
the chief character

272
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,573
and star of the movie
that was his life.

273
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:14,178
<i>He was also the director,
and he brought in the cast,</i>

274
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,315
<i>and the scenario,
and he orchestrated it.</i>

275
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,184
<i>Elliot:

276
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,520
<i>Those characters, what they did.</i>

00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:26,357
<i>John the garbage man.
Hank the communist.</i>

278
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,060
Remember the night
that Jim Touley

279
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,395
punched J. Robert Nash,

280
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,998
<i>knocked him down
to the bar room floor,</i>

281
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,533
and Nash looked up and he said,
"Nice punch, Jimmy!"

<i>Elliot:

He is a nice guy,

He's not that nice.

<i>I even realized that there was

299
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,586
Watching him
when he pulled out that night

300
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,423
in front of O'Rourke's,
and almost, you know,

301
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,224
ran into the North Avenue bus.

302
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,193
I remember
being in the drug store

303
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,462
that was on
the corner there one morning,

304
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:41,565
and Roger came in, and he looked
like absolute hell.

305
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,367
And I'm like, "Are you okay?

306
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,102
What's the matter?
what's the matter?"

307
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,537
"I'm on a bender.

308
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,272
Can you come have
a drink with me?"

309
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,773
He said to me one time,

310
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:52,242
and I don't think
he'll regard this as a betrayal,

311
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:55,446
that he would walk home
late at night,

312
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,548
<i>after O'Rourke's had closed,</i>

313
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,453
<i>and he would wish he was dead.</i>

314
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,454
<i>Roger:
I found it almost impossible,</i>

315
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,423
<i>once I started,
to stop after one or two.</i>

316
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,193
<i>I'd paid a price in hangovers.</i>

317
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,561
<i>Without hangovers, it's possible</i>

318
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,629
<i>that I would still be drinking.</i>

319
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,734
<i>I would also be unemployed,
unmarried, and probably dead.</i>

320
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:21,872
<i>In August 1979,
I took my last drink.</i>

321
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,609
<i>It was about four o'clock
on a Saturday afternoon.</i>

322
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,345
<i>The hot sun streaming
through the windows.</i>

323
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,414
<i>I put a glass of scotch and soda</i>

324
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,682
<i>down on the living room table,</i>

325
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:35,586
<i>went to bed, and pulled
the blankets over my head.</i>

326
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,855
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

327
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,723
<i>McHugh:
He says, "I quit."</i>

328
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:43,393
And then I realized
it's time for me to quit too.

329
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:46,463
The next time I saw
Roger Ebert, he was in AA.

330
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:49,600
I was drinking very heavily.

331
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,568
<i>Roger:
When I decided to out myself</i>

332
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,470
<i>as a recovering alcoholic,</i>

333
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:55,873
<i>I hadn't taken a drink
for 31 years.</i>

334
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,375
<i>And since my first AA meeting
I attended,</i>

335
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,577
<i>I've never wanted to.</i>

336
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,580
<i>Since surgery in July of 2006,</i>

337
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:07,751
<i>I haven't been able to drink
at all, or eat or speak.</i>

338
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,286
<i>Unless I go insane</i>

339
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,421
<i>and start pouring booze
into my g-tube,</i>

340
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:14,162
<i>I believe I'm reasonably safe.</i>

341

<i>James: By the time I got

346
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,398
<i>Did we get it?</i>

347
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,538
<i>I hope so, too.</i>

348
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,939
<i>Roger:

349
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,875
<i>that I could no longer
eat, drink, or speak,</i>

351
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,648
<i>Not so much, really.</i>

352
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:16,420
<i>I lived in a world of words
long before I was aware of it.</i>

<i>The new reality
took shape slowly.</i>

354
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:23,660
<i>My blog became
my voice, my outlet.</i>

355
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,832
<i>It let loose
the flood of memories.</i>

356
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:31,638
<i>They came pouring forth
in a flood of relief.</i>

357
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:36,473
<i>One day in the spring of 1967,</i>

<i>Roger: The posters displayed
improbably buxom women,</i>

366
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,693
<i>That was when
it first registered</i>

367

374
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:17,714
<i>Meyer offered me
the screenwriting job,</i>

375
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,584

into a delirious adventure.</i>

<i>Donna LaPietra: The most impossible

"How on earth

381
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:39,372
<i>Or be involved with Russ Meyer?</i>

382
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,045
( screaming )

383
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,513

<i>James: What did he love about

Boobs.

386
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,356
The fact that there were
large breasted women involved

387
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:00,794
probably was a plus.

388
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:07,397
You know, we can talk a lot
about the art of cinema,

389
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,334
and what we find in it,

390
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,669
and the sort of the magic

391
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,038
and the dreams
and the glory of it,

392

of earthlier appeals.

You wanna make love?

394

<i>Roger: Meyer wanted

<i>except the kitchen sink.
The movie, he explained,</i>

400
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,525
<i>would simultaneously
be a satire,</i>

401
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:36,693
<i>a serious melodrama,</i>

402
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:39,563
<i>a rock musical, a comedy,</i>

403
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,964
<i>a violent exploitation picture,</i>

404
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,501
<i>a skin flick

<i>of the oft-times nightmarish

- Woman: Don't put it down.</i>

407
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:52,576
I had to review
for the Chicago Sun-Times,

408
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,578
and I think
I gave it three stars,

409
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,912
'cause Roger was my friend.

410
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,681
And somewhere deep
in the piece said,

411
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,816
"This is a new
rating system... ten stars,

412
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,587
so this gets
three out of ten."

413
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,454
This is my happening
and it freaks me out!

<i>Richard Corliss: I reviewed
the film in National Review.</i>

And listed it as one of
the 10 great films of the 1960s.

416
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,832
It was funny, it had
a pulse that raced past

<i>Howard Hawk's film

who-gives-a-shit air,

419
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,607
it was perfect
for the late '60s.

420

You're a groovy boy.

It's beyond it.

424
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,551
You know, this is a title,

425
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:37,421
because you're
gonna go beyond it.

426
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,689
It went over my head.

427
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,057
That doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it.

428
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:44,561

432

There's nothing like a Rolls.

Not even a Bentley.

434
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,544
Not even a Bentley.

435
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,879
Bentley! Rolls!

436
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,079
A Rolls.

A Rolls!

438
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,987
Um, but I did like that editing
in the Bentley.

439
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:13,026
I don't really have
any new confessions.

440
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,726
It is true
that the first 10 years

441
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,894
I came to the conference,

442
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:20,130
I came primarily

444
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,805
That didn't work out.

who coined the term.</i>

459
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,076
<i>I discussed masturbation</i>

460
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,879
<i>with the Greek Ambassador
to the United Nations.</i>

461
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,114
<i>There I asked Ted Turner</i>

462
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,284
<i>how he got so much right
and colorization wrong.</i>

463
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,120
He would hold what was called
Cinema Interruptus.

464
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:21,691
On Monday of World Affairs week,
Roger would show a film.

465
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,127
<i>Tuesday through Friday
he would conduct</i>

466
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:27,130
<i>a shot by shot
discussion of the film.</i>

467
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:30,534
<i>Corliss: To listen to Roger
talk for upwards of five hours</i>

468
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,602
<i>about "In Cold Blood,"
or "The Third Man,"</i>

469
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:35,038
or "Vertigo," or "Citizen Kane,"

470
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,542
<i>he was enlightening
with every new frame.</i>

471
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,177
<i>It was a theatrical experience
of the highest order.</i>

472
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:44,281
<i>( film projector
starts whirring )</i>

473
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,751
<i>Movshovitz: And anybody who
wanted to, at any moment,</i>

474
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,085
<i>could yell out, "Stop,"</i>

475
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:52,289
<i>to ask a question
or make a statement.</i>

476
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,623
Stop!

477
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:55,091
Look at that.

478
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:58,328
Every year we find
something absolutely amazing,

479
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,564
totally amazing in the films.

480
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,932
It's not there, but we find it.

481
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,900
<i>( audience laughs )</i>

482
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:08,338
There was a limit to Roger's
democratizing of film criticism.

483
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,174
<i>A student asked,
"Who do you think you are</i>

484
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,310
<i>that you get to have
all of these opinions?</i>

485
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,146
I saw 'Porky's'
and I think 'Porky's' is great,

486
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,281
so why don't
I get to talk about it?"

487
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:21,151
And Roger said,
"I have two things to say.

488
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,955
<i>First, Marshall Field,
who owns the Chicago Sun-Times,</i>

489
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,857
<i>appointed me film critic...
that's who I am."</i>

490
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:30,327
And he said,
"My other thing is a question.

491
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,934
Would you wanna
listen to you?"

492
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,970
<i>After the year that Roger came</i>

493
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,106
<i>and worked
with a voice synthesizer,</i>

494
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,643
<i>he decided not to come again.</i>

495
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,080
<i>He said it was too hard.</i>

496
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,315
<i>Roger: I won't return
to the conference.</i>

497
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:56,152
<i>It is fueled by speech,
and I am out of gas.</i>

498
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:59,122
<i>But I went there
for my adult lifetime,</i>

499
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:01,865
<i>and had a hell of a good time.</i>

500
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,199
<i>Chaz:
The move is taking place,</i>

501
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,901
and they are loading up
the medical car

502
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,270
to take us over to RIC.

503
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,640
Will you send an email
for me, please?

504
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,108
Come in.

505
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:22,412
Is there a special back elevator
that we go down here or...?

506
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:24,114
Uh, well, actually, yeah.

507
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,983
<i>Because the last time
we took him from this hospital,</i>

508
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,853
we had to push
the chair past the morgue.

509
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,154
- Uh-huh.
- Everything.

510
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:33,725
And we got lost down there.

511
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:38,928
He's excited because he gets
to see a movie he wants to see.

512
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,666
It should be coming over
later today.

513
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,006
So he's happy about that.

514
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,808
I'm glad we don't have
to go under that...

515
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,979
the underground anymore.

516
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,280
Past the morgue.

517
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,319
( laughs )

518
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,023
We're not ready for it!

519
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,893
You've been working away, huh?

520
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,462
You have a lot
of writing to do. Mmm.

521
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,064
<i>I was hoping you could see</i>

522
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:17,033
<i>at least one of them
on a big screen.</i>

523
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:19,769
<i>When he was
in the hospital before,</i>

524
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,907
we took a semi-not sanctioned
trip out of the hospital.

525
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,958
Bundled him up
and took him to the movies.

526
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,278
But I don't know if,

527
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,329
I don't think the doctor
will let you out.

528
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:33,356
Oops.

529
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,191
<i>Roger:
Chaz is a strong woman.</i>

530
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,058
<i>I'd never met anyone like her.</i>

531
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,794
I think it'll be easier.
You can...

532
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,262
<i>She is the love of my life.</i>

533
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,231
Just wanna make sure
that you don't get cold.

534
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:52,135
<i>She saved me from the fate
of living out my life alone,</i>

535
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,474
<i>which is where
I seemed to be heading.</i>

536
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:01,044
<i>Chaz: The first time he actually
saw me was at an AA meeting.</i>

537
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:04,250
And it's the first time
I've ever said it publicly.

538
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,420
<i>Roger became
very public about his...</i>

539
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:14,160
<i>but I felt that it was,
you know, more private for me.</i>

540
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,197
If it doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

541
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:25,769
<i>Roger weighed 300 pounds
when we first started dating.</i>

542
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,838
He didn't care that he was fat.

543
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,407
He thought he was great.

544
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,945
And that was so sexy.

545
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:37,983
I take it, this is not yours.

546
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,383
<i>Roger:
If my cancer had come,</i>

547
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,052
<i>and Chaz had not
been there with me,</i>

548
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:47,257
<i>I can imagine a descent
into lonely decrepitude.</i>

549
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,160
<i>That I am still active,
going places,</i>

550
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,265
<i>moving, is directly
because of her.</i>

551
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:57,233
<i>My instinct was to guard myself.</i>

552
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:01,171
<i>I could never again be
on television as I once was.</i>

553
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,140
<i>She said, "Yes, but people
are interested</i>

554
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,542
<i>in what you have to say,</i>

555
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,281
<i>not in how you say it."</i>

556

<i>James:
With Roger now headed</i>

557

<i>for at least
a couple of weeks of rehab,</i>

558
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:16,519
<i>he suggested I email him
questions in advance</i>

559
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,591
<i>of our major interview
when he gets back home.</i>

560
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:24,029
<i>I sent him the first third
of nine pages of questions.</i>

561
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,563
<i>He emailed me back.</i>

562
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,331
<i>- Chaz: Hello.
- Nurse: Hi, how are you?</i>

563
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,098
- Hi.
- Welcome to RIC.

564
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,534
My name is Jacqueline.

565
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,403
We're gonna be going
right in this room, okay?

566
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,211
<i>- Chaz: Okay.
- Man: How are you?</i>

567
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,378
<i>Roger:
"Question 1: In my life,</i>

568
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:45,148
<i>I inherited certain things
from each of my parents.</i>

569
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,320
<i>What did you inherit
from yours?"</i>

<i>Computerized voice:
From my father I inherited</i>

<i>my pro-labor,
Democratic Party beliefs.</i>

572
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,560
<i>I am politically
my father's child,</i>

573
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,463
<i>and emotionally more
my mother's.</i>

574
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,632
<i>My mother supported me as if</i>

575
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,033
<i>I was the local sports team.</i>

576
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,470
<i>But she was fatalistic.</i>

577
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:10,607
<i>She was permanently scarred
by the Depression,</i>

578
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,509
<i>and constantly predicted
she would end up</i>

579
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,378
<i>in the county poor home.</i>

580
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:19,017
<i>My parents so strongly
encouraged my schoolwork.</i>

581
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,418
<i>We even took
a third paper at home,</i>

582
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:25,555
<i>the "Chicago Daily News,"
for me to read.</i>

583
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,891
<i>When I stood
in the kitchen door,</i>

584
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,226
<i>and used a sentence
with a new word in it,</i>

585
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,228
<i>they would look up
from their coffee</i>

586
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,963
<i>and cigarettes
and actually applaud me.</i>

587
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:37,937
<i>( light applause )</i>

588
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,605
This is the memorable occasion

589
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:46,509
that Roger was given
the Pulitzer Prize.

590
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,245
<i>Simon: Usually, when somebody
won a Pulitzer Prize,</i>

591
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,381
it was, "Who is he to win
a Pulitzer," you know.

592
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,049
"Ah yeah, I'll go
congratulate him, yeah."

593
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,520
<i>But for Roger,
there was real joy.</i>

594
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,490
<i>You know, it was our Roger.</i>

595
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,858
<i>One of us.</i>

596

ever given to a movie critic.

598
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,434
<i>Simon: Roger wrote his
movie reviews as if</i>

599
00:31:11,435 --> 00:31:13,202
<i>he were sitting in the 15th row,</i>

600
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:14,537
<i>taking notes with one hand</i>

601
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,306
<i>and eating popcorn
with the other.</i>

602
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:20,947
<i>But he didn't simplify things.</i>

603
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,282
<i>Roger: "Cries and Whispers" is
like no movie I've seen before,</i>

604
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:29,319
<i>and like no movie Ingmar
Bergman has made before.</i>

605
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,287
<i>It envelops us in a red membrane</i>

606
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:32,288
<i>of passion and fear.</i>

607
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:35,558
<i>And in some way that
I do not fully understand,</i>

608
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,227
<i>it employs taboos
and ancient superstitions</i>

609

<i>to make its effect.</i>

610
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,497
<i>We slip lower in our seats,</i>

611
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:45,535
<i>feeling claustrophobia
and sexual disquiet.</i>

612

<i>Scott: I think the

613
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:51,009
<i>that sort of clear, plain,
Midwestern newspaper style,</i>

615
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,679
encyclopedic learning,

616
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,983
<i>but doesn't condescend,
doesn't pander.</i>

617
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,451
<i>Roger would become</i>

<i>in American letters.</i>

620
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,725
He made it possible
for a bigger audience,

621
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:12,628
a wider audience to appreciate
cinema as an art form.

622
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,031
'Cause he really loved it.

623
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:17,166
Really, really loved films,

624

<i>and he did not get caught up</i>

625

<i>in certain ideologies
about what cinema should be.</i>

626

<i>Nack:

627
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,177
if he had a mind
to go to the New York Times,

628
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:29,779
he could've done that,
the Boston Globe,

629
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,547
the LA Times, no problem.

630

632
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:41,257
<i>Offered him

633
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:43,359
<i>Ebert just kept saying no.</i>

634
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,162
He said, "I'm not gonna
learn new streets..."

635
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:49,031
( laughs )

636
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,637
...which is very Ebert-like.

637
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:56,639
<i>Simon: The Sun-Times went
through rough times.</i>

638

<i>So many people left.</i>

<i>Tom McNamee:
And Roger remained steadfast.</i>

642
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,554
I remember Roger saying,
"I'm not gonna run away."

643
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:13,389
- Right.
- These are my colleagues

644
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,124
and not everybody
can get another job.

645
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,392
If someone
went across the street

646
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:17,693
for a job they were selling out.

647
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:19,595
<i>You didn't even say the Tribune.</i>

648
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:22,265
<i>You'd say
they went across the street.</i>

649
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,501
<i>Simon: It was a huge clash
in political difference</i>

650
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:28,538
<i>between the Sun-Times
and the Tribune.</i>

651
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,607
<i>We were a working class paper.</i>

652
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:35,378
<i>And we reached
the black community.</i>

653
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:39,148
<i>The Tribune was
a very wealthy paper.</i>

654
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,451
<i>I mean,
look at the Tribune tower.</i>

655
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:46,689
<i>This huge gothic structure
studded at its base</i>

656

<i>And you're thinking, what?</i>

659
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:55,832
<i>Did the Tribune guy
go out with a chisel</i>

660
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,634
<i>and steal this thing?</i>

661
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:01,204
<i>Roger: From the day
the Chicago Tribune</i>

662
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,738
<i>made Gene Siskel

663
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,807
<i>we were professional enemies.</i>

664
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:07,343
<i>For the first five years
we knew one another,</i>

665
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,350
<i>Siskel and I hardly spoke.</i>

666
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,750
<i>When Gene and I were asked</i>

667
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,153
<i>to work together on a TV show,</i>

668
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:20,790
<i>we both said we'd
rather do it with someone else.</i>

669
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,495
<i>Anyone else.</i>

670
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,563
The name of our show is "Opening
Soon at a Theatre Near You,"

671
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:29,398
two film critics
talking about the movies.

672
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,467
And this is Roger Ebert
from the Chicago Sun-Times.

673
00:34:31,468 --> 00:34:32,802
And right over here
is Gene Siskel

674
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,704
from the Chicago Tribune
and Chanel 2 news.

675
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,840
<i>Flaum: Gene and Roger were
sitting kind of pinioned,</i>

676
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,442
<i>in director's chairs</i>

677
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,345
looking into the camera
very seriously.

678
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,580
Talking about the movie.

679
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:47,350
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" just had the audience

680
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,851
tearing up the seats with joy.

681
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:51,654
Yeah, and also, tearing up a
little my enjoyment of the film.

682
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,756
They were applauding
even during the credits...

683
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:58,394
<i>Flaum:
It was stiff, and wooden.</i>

684
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,631
But when Foreman backs up
and tries to make his big points

685
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,699
about the establishment
and authority...

686
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,369
<i>Flaum:
But there was something there.</i>

687
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,738
It was interesting
to hear two people

688
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,373
who knew what
they were talking about,

689
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,707
talk about a movie.

690
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,577
"Bride of Freedom"
by Rainer Werner Fassbinder,

691
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,746
one of the new generation
of West German directors.

692
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,515
<i>Flaum: Roger loved the idea of
being on public television.</i>

693
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:21,484
He had been on it before

694
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:25,354
on a show where he introduced
films by Ingmar Berman.

695
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,190
<i>It was awful.</i>

696
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,658
And this movie,
his name is Spiegel,

697
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,393
which is Swedish for mirror.

698
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,528
<i>Flaum: It was a deer
caught in the headlights.</i>

699
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,463
What is real
and what is illusion,

700
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:36,532
and who's being fooled
by the art?

701
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,701
Is it the artist,
or his audience, or both?

702
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:41,276
<i>( inspirational theme playing )</i>

703
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,710
And the movie's ending,
a confrontation

704
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:49,779
with the heavyweight champion
of the world...

705
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,548
<i>Flaum: Roger needed to learn
how to write for television.</i>

706
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:54,684
...emotionally fulfilling scenes
I've seen in a long time.

707
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,819
<i>Flaum:
To keep sentences short.</i>

708
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,688
<i>He would get irritated,
and he would say,</i>

709
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,490
"Thea, I have
a Pulitzer Prize."

710
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,626
And I would say to him,
"Roger, I know that,

711
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,561
but that doesn't mean you know
to write for television."

712
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:06,862
And right through
that last scene

713
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:08,598
I was really loving
"Taxi Driver,"

714
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,434
because up until that point,
the relationship between

715
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,302
De Niro and Sibyl Shepherd
has been electric...

716
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:14,704
<i>Flaum:
Gene was a natural.</i>

717
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,773
<i>He was one of these people.
He could talk to the camera.</i>

718
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:19,508
<i>Marlene Siskel:
He had a huge</i>

719
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:21,244
<i>handle bar mustache.</i>

720
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,511
<i>And so I just said,</i>

721
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:24,280
"That is a funny looking thing

722
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,748
on your face,
get rid of it."

723
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:28,551
<i>Kogan:
I thought, these two guys</i>

724
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:31,420
<i>would never be on television.</i>

725
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:33,856
These are unusual,
odd-looking characters

726
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,726
for the medium, TV,
that's all beautifully quaffed,

727
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,662
and beautiful teeth,
and everything's fine.

728
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,632
And they dressed
like a couple of clowns

729
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,900
<i>if they wore
these outfits today.</i>

730
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:47,870
<i>You couldn't make
Siskel and Ebert</i>

731
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,873
if you were
Dr. Frankenstein.

732
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:54,677
<i>Marlene: I think in the beginning
it was very difficult.</i>

733
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,880
<i>Gene sat in the back row.
Roger had his favorite seat.</i>

734
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:01,820
<i>They left without saying
a word to one another.</i>

735
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,454
<i>Roger:
We both thought of ourselves</i>

736
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:07,890
<i>as full service
one-stop film critics.</i>

737
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,860
<i>We didn't see why
the other one was necessary.</i>

738
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,828
<i>Alone together in an elevator,</i>

739
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:17,333
<i>we would study the numbers
changing above the door.</i>

740
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,935
Their lifestyles couldn't have
been more different.

741
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,904
<i>Roger was single.</i>

742
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,673
<i>He was an only child.</i>

743
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:27,042
<i>Gene, in childhood,
lost both his parents,</i>

744
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:28,778
<i>one after the other.</i>

745
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,016
<i>He was a philosophy major
at Yale.</i>

746
00:37:33,016 --> 00:37:34,784
<i>While Roger was, you know,</i>

747
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,387
<i>one of the good old boy
news reporters.</i>

748
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:41,691
Gene was just was more of a,

749
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:45,428
for lack of a better word,
elegant character.

750
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,396
<i>He caught
the eye of Hugh Hefner,</i>

751
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:52,902
<i>and he was adopted
by the clan at the mansion.</i>

752
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:58,541
<i>And he traveled with Hefner
in the bunny jet.</i>

753
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,743
<i>Even though Roger wrote</i>

754
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:02,678
<i>"Beyond
the Valley of the Dolls",</i>

755
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:06,390
<i>I think Gene lived
the life for a while.</i>

756

<i>Corliss: The perfect matching

758
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,531
really made "Sneak Previews"

00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:26,035
<i>a sitcom about two guys
who lived in a movie theater.</i>

760
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:28,938
And how Roger and I go to the
movies as critics is the subject

761
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,407
of this special take two
program on "Sneak Previews."

762
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,109
<i>- Hi, Gene.
- Hi, Roger.</i>

763
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,544
In every theater I have a
favorite seat I like to sit in.

764
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,113
In the last row,
sort of off to the side.

765
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,449
Not just kind of reading
or speaking criticism,

766
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,984
but acting out these roles.

767
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:44,754
I always choose a seat
that's twice as far back

768
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,524
from the screen
as the screen is wide.

769
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:52,495
Then you must make
a friend of horror.

770
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,931
Horror and moral terror.

771
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:58,501
I think we can save
ourselves a lot of time

772
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,869
if I admit to you right now

773
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,971
that although I think
the last half hour works,

774
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,073
I doubt if I could ever
convince you of that.

775
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,808
And that the first
two hours of the film

776
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,676
consist of some of
the most beautiful,

777
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,812
heartbreaking, tragic,

778
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,581
memorable footage of war
that I've ever seen.

779
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:13,849
I think that you can show

780
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,885
almost anything to do
with Vietnam,

781
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,120
and people feel,
"Oh, my God, the human waste."

782
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,122
That may be true,
but this movie is made

783
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,624
on such an epic scale.

784
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,127
And because
they could get agitated,

785
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,629
<i>that raised the temperature</i>

786
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,669
<i>of the movies
they were discussing.</i>

787
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:34,035
Tremendously boring,

788
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:35,905
boring from the beginning
of the movie.

789
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,706
I just wanna compare
this film to the "Godfather."

790
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,108
Oh no, no, no.
Wait a minute.

791
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:40,209
Now he's not boring at all.

792
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,710
Oh, yes.
Fabulously boring.

793
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,946
- He is fabulously boring?
- I would pass...

794
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:46,182
<i>Scott: There was something
almost transgressive</i>

795
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,551
<i>and exciting about seeing</i>

796
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,554
on TV somebody say,
about a movie,

797
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,823
you know what you might always
want to say to your friend,

798
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,091
or your girlfriend
or your mother or your sister,

799
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,661
"No, you're wrong.
It's not a good movie."

800
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,863
That's the way
people do relate to films,

801
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:02,898
is in that argumentative
sort of way,

802
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,534
in which if you're right nobody
can tell you that you're wrong.

803
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:08,237
I sit at the desk next to our
music critic at the Sun-Times,

804
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,039
people are
very worshipful of him,

805
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,142
"Oh, what did you think about
Shulty's conducting last night?"

806
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:15,544
And then he will say, and they
will nod like this and go away.

807
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:17,480
And then they'll turn around
and come up to me and say,

808
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,531
"I totally disagree with your
review in this morning's paper."

809
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,855
<i>Flaum: The success of the
show was undeniable,</i>

810
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,657
<i>except we were not on
in two major markets...</i>

811
00:40:28,658 --> 00:40:30,826
New York and Los Angeles.

812
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:32,728
Here I am
at the little popcorn shop

813
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,129
a half a block
from the screening room

814
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,598
where I see all the movies.

815
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,266
This is the Chicago Theater
on State Street.

816
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,801
<i>Flaum:
Their position was,</i>

817
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,736
<i>if there's
gonna be a movie shown,</i>

818
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:42,538
<i>it's not gonna be
two guys from Chicago.</i>

819
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,576
We're gonna have New York
critics, or we're Hollywood.

820
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:48,978
Who are these guys, right?

821
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,146
This is not Andrew Sarris,
and Pauline Kael.

822
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,983
And it's also not,
the kind of the wised up players

823
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,584
who might be in Los Angeles.

824
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:58,035
What do these people
have to tell us about movies?

825
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,128
<i>Computerized voice:
The arrival of Pauline Kael</i>

826
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,864
<i>on the scene
shook everything up.</i>

827
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:10,599
The New Yorker recognized that

828
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,400
maybe this is the time for
a new kind of movie criticism.

829
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:17,806
<i>Computerized voice: Suddenly movie
critics become new players in the game.</i>

830
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,810
You weren't crazy
about "Prince of the City."

831
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,144
( laughing )
No. "Prince of the City."

832
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:25,814
I thought, it really,
as piece of narrative,

833
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:29,718
it's almost a case study
in confusion.

834
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,920
<i>Computerized voice: Kael's
influence shaped how critics</i>

835
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,624
<i>looked at movies
and how people read them.</i>

836
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:40,563
<i>Corliss: Film was taken seriously
and so were film critics.</i>

837
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,197
<i>Andrew Sarris was promoting</i>

838
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:45,768
<i>the idea of director
as the maker of the film,</i>

839
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:50,239
and Pauline Kael,
elevating film writing,

840
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,308
film criticism as an art.

841
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,978
<i>But these were
towering figures, clashing.</i>

842
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,813
<i>Rather like Siskel and Ebert,</i>

843
00:41:57,814 --> 00:42:00,316
<i>but with more intellectual heft.</i>

844
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,984
- ( barks )
- Uh-oh, Gene.

845
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,753
This bowser in the balcony
means it's time for Dog Of The Week.

846
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:05,888
A regular feature
where each of us

847
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,723
picks the week's worst movie.

848
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,825
Well, Roger, you and Spot
may not believe this,

849
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:12,328
but I have just seen
my first nudie Karate film.

850
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,762
- You're kidding.
- No.

851
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:16,000
Roger once said,
"Do you think Pauline Kael

852
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,368
would be working with a dog?"

853
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,972
I don't know Pauline Kael,
I never knew Pauline Kael.

854
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,908
But fuck Pauline Kael.

855
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,910
<i>Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel</i>

856
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:30,679
<i>were the most powerful critics
of all time.</i>

857
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,348
<i>In any realm.</i>

858
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,684
Finally, they had to cave in

859
00:42:35,685 --> 00:42:38,253
and run the show
in New York and L.A.

860
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:41,059
It was a victory we relished,
I have to tell you.

861
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,861
Here to help us
sort the blockbusters

862
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:48,130
from the bombs are the team
of "At the Movies."

863
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:52,301
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

864
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,869
You guys live in Chicago still,
down there in Oprah-land?

865
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,069
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

866
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,672
What I'd like to do
is come to Chicago

867
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:57,806
one night
and we'll just go nuts.

868
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,241
We'll just get stinking drunk.

869
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,811
<i>We'll go out
and eat steaks all night.</i>

870
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,112
My next two guests are
regarded as the most popular,

871
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,847
and most important film critics
in the country.

872
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,383
<i>( upbeat orchestral flourish )</i>

873
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,864
They are the two most influential
movie critics in the country.

874
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,187
<i>( upbeat orchestral flourish )</i>

875
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:14,723
Is there anybody more popular?
We'll find out and ask them.

876
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,860
<i>( upbeat orchestral flourish )</i>

877
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,395
<i>Flaum:
And ultimately,</i>

878
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,397
<i>I think they were
on the Johnny Carson Show</i>

879
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,199
<i>more than just about anybody.</i>

880
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,335
Is there something out there
that is really so bad?

881
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:28,103
<i>( audience laughter )</i>

882
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,271
Roger?

883
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:31,907
I can't really recommend
"Three Amigos."

884
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:34,877
<i>( audience groans )</i>

885
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,945
It's the Christmas picture
I like the least.

886
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,248
<i>( audience groans )</i>

887
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,750
- This is the happy hour.
- Yes.

888
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,952
I don't think I'd asked you if
I knew you were gonna say that.

889
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,821
Chevy Chase has made
a lot of good movies,

890
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:47,156
and God willing, he will make

891
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,857
a lot more good movies
in the future.

892
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:50,426
- With your help.
- Yes, well, I...

893
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,162
<i>- ( audience laughs )
- Yes, with your help.</i>

894
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,997
There is a tendency
for somebody...

895
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,001
<i>( audience laughter )</i>

896
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:01,203
...who is naturally funny,

897
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:06,010
as Chevy is,
to try to get laughs

898
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,812
by standing there
and ad-libbing

899
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,180
when somebody else
is trying to talk.

900
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,915
Johnny:
That's right.

901
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,185
<i>Flaum: The movie studios
went from helping us,</i>

902
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,955
to hating us, to fearing us.

903
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:22,191
The circulations of all
of the newspaper critics,

904
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,159
<i>and all of the magazines,
could not match</i>

905
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,328
<i>the reach
of the show at its height.</i>

906
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,198
It became quite clear very often

907
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,266
that the film companies
cared a lot

908
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,068
about Roger and Gene seeing it,

909
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:35,404
but not so much
about the rest of us.

910
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:39,374
<i>Corliss: Two thumbs up became
everything for a big Hollywood movie.</i>

911
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,210
<i>Back when moviemakers
still thought</i>

912
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,046
critics' enthusiasm
could sell a movie.

913
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:46,415
In 1991,
Richard Corliss published

00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:51,253
a piece in "Film Comment"
about how the show

915
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:56,927
was ruining and vulgarizing
film criticism.

916
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,762
<i>Corliss:
"Will anyone read this story?</i>

917
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,866
<i>It has too many words
and not enough pictures.</i>

918
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,368
<i>Does anyone read this magazine?</i>

919
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:10,239
<i>Every article in it wants
to be a meal, not a McNugget.</i>

920
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,841
Is anyone reading
film criticism?

921
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:15,377
It lacks punch,
the clips, the thumbs.

922
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:17,813
I simply don't want
people to think

923
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:19,114
that what they have to do on TV

924
00:45:19,115 --> 00:45:20,849
is what I am supposed
to do in print.

925
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,985
I don't want junk food

926
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,788
to be the only cuisine
at the banquet."

927
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,325
Etcetera.

928
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:30,359
Ahh...

929
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,294
I really did sound angry there,

930
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:36,398
but it seemed to me that
the Siskel-Ebert effect

931
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:40,035
<i>was that a film
was either good or bad</i>

932
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:42,274
<i>and the rest
didn't matter so much.</i>

933
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,241
<i>Roger: I am the first
to agree with Corliss</i>

934
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:47,811
<i>that the Siskel
and Ebert program</i>

935
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,561
<i>is not in depth film criticism.</i>

936
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:53,515
<i>As indeed, how could it be,
given our time constraints.</i>

937
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,222
<i>( Roger speaking )</i>

938
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,089
<i>But we would have to do it
for our own amusement</i>

939
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,527
<i>because nobody would play it
on television.</i>

940
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,461
<i>The program's purpose
is to provide</i>

941
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,931
<i>exactly what Corliss
says it provides...</i>

942
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,367
<i>information on what's new
at the movies, who's in it,</i>

943
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:15,069
<i>and whether the critic thinks
it's any good or not.</i>

944
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,207
<i>Rosenbaum: If you're talking about
film criticism the serious way,</i>

945
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,476
<i>consumer advice is not
the same thing as criticism.</i>

946
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:24,313
To assume that something
is good for everybody,

947
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:28,450
or bad for everybody
is insulting to everybody.

948
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,252
( tires screeching )

949
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:33,222
<i>Siskel: The subject of "Crash"
left me feeling empty.</i>

950
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,591
<i>"Crash" has some beautiful
bodies on view,</i>

951
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,626
<i>but also some ugly ideas.</i>

952
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:42,564
The car crash is a fertilizing
rather than a destructive event.

953
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:45,167
<i>Roger: When we have an
opinion about a movie,</i>

954
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:47,469
<i>that opinion may light
a bulb over the head</i>

955
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,938
<i>of an ambitious youth
who then understands</i>

956
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:52,608
<i>that people can make up their
own minds about the movies.</i>

957
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,210
I think I liked the movie
a lot more than you did.

958
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,612
I'd like to make it clear
that most people are probably

959
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,814
going to hate it, be repelled
by it or walk out of it,

960
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,350
<i>- just as they did at the Cannes Film Festival.
- Why is that?</i>

961
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,985
Because it's too tough
for them to take.

962
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,586
<i>Flaum:
The reason Roger loved</i>

963
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:06,255
<i>being on television</i>

964
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,557
<i>is that at his heart,</i>

965
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:11,560
<i>he really is a populist.</i>

966
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:15,564
Roger believes that everybody
ought to be able to get a movie.

967
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:20,235
I think they were conscientious
about trying to do

968
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:22,204
what they were doing
as well as they could.

969
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:24,273
And as seriously as they could.

970
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:28,076
<i>But invariably, a show
like Gene and Roger's show</i>

971
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:30,279
<i>becomes part of
that mainstream system.</i>

972
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,247
<i>Announcer: This week,
Siskel and Ebert review</i>

973
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,583
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger
in "Last Action Hero."</i>

974
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:38,387
<i>Rosenbaum: And by and large, the
purpose of mainstream reviewing</i>

975
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,422
<i>is not just to valorize films</i>

976
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:42,391
<i>that get million dollar
ad campaigns.</i>

977
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,292
<i>Announcer:
Spielberg's "Jurassic Park."</i>

978
00:47:45,027 --> 00:47:47,129
But to eliminate
everything else.

979
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,998
I think that
what Gene and Roger did,

980
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,667
was the opposite of that.

981
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,603
<i>Roger went out and he looked
for people like Michael Moore.</i>

982
00:47:54,604 --> 00:47:57,243
<i>He looked for people like me.</i>

983
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:02,285
( speaking Spanish )

984
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:11,353
<i>Scott: As a film critic,
he was somebody</i>

985
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:14,690
<i>who gave life to new voices,
gave life to new visions,</i>

986
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,160
<i>that reflected all
the diversity of this nation.</i>

987
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,429
<i>Different classes,
points of view,</i>

988
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,168
<i>he wanted it all out there.</i>

989
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,402
My assurance to the pet owner

990
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:30,339
that they will be
reunited with their pet.

991
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,141
<i>Errol Morris: My first
film, "Gates of Heaven."</i>

992
00:48:33,142 --> 00:48:34,743
<i>There was a newspaper strike.</i>

993
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:38,313
And so the movie wasn't reviewed

994
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:42,351
by any of the New York
newspapers, which is a disaster.

995
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,486
I miss that
little black kitten so much.

996
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,188
<i>Morris:
I just thought, that's it,</i>

997
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,256
<i>the movie's
just going to vanish.</i>

998
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,292
Both of them wanted
to review it.

999
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:53,662
I was troubled
because the number of theaters

1000
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:56,264
in which it was playing
was extremely small,

1001
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:57,599
and here you have a show
that's being shown

1002
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,534
on 300 some odd public
television stations

1003
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,069
around the country. How are
people gonna get to see it?

1004
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,638
Let's move on to a movie now

1005
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,441
that I think is one of the most
brilliant, weird, and unusual

1006
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:09,244
American documentary films
I've seen in a long time.

1007
00:49:09,245 --> 00:49:11,313
<i>Morris:
And then really out of nowhere,</i>

1008
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:14,216
<i>those guys started reviewing
"Gates of Heaven."</i>

1009
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,219
Well, I agree with you completely.
I think it's a superb film.

1010
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,755
<i>Morris: Then they found an
excuse to review it again.</i>

1011
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,557
There are films that
we call "Buried Treasures."

1012
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:24,526
<i>Morris:
And a third time.</i>

1013
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:26,361
I don't think anyone who's seen
this film can ever forget it.

1014
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:28,230
I believe that I would not

1015
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,138
really have a career
if not for those guys.

1016
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,639
<i>Ramin Bahrani: I made my first film.
I kind of made it alone.</i>

1017
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,142
<i>I didn't know anyone
in the industry.</i>

1018
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,344
I don't even know
how I got Roger's email,

1019
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,513
but I emailed it assuming
no one would answer.

1020
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,748
And he answered.

1021
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,516
<i>And he said, "If your film
gets into Sundance,"</i>

1022
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,384
<i>tell me
and I will watch it there."</i>

1023
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:50,786
So then later the film
did go to Sundance,

1024
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,121
<i>and I emailed him again,
and he said,</i>

1025
00:49:53,122 --> 00:49:55,657
<i>"Yes, I'll come to see it."
Here are the three times.</i>

1026
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,592
<i>He didn't come
the first screening,</i>

1027
00:49:57,593 --> 00:49:59,394
<i>he didn't come
to the 2nd screening.</i>

1028
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:01,496
<i>And the last screening
was Sunday morning, I think,</i>

1029
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:04,599
8:00 a.m., on the last day
of the festival.

1030
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,335
I said he's
probably not even here.

1031
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:09,738
In fact, he was one of
the first people there.

1032
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:11,573
<i>And I was there
with my actor, and he said,</i>

1033
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:13,508
<i>"Do you mind
if I take some pictures</i>

1034
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,344
<i>with you and your actor,
just in case I like the film?</i>

1035
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:18,680
If I don't like it, don't worry,
I'll never use them."

1036
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,222
<i>( Bahrani laughs )</i>

1037
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:29,491
I was, I think, I was maybe
eight or nine or something,

1038
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:33,428
and my aunt Denise,
who was a massive film geek,

1039
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:36,398
who passed
her film geekdom onto me,

1040
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:39,334
found out about
these rehearsals for the Oscars

1041
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:42,270
and one day he walked through.

1042
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:44,573
And I remember saying,
"Thumbs up! Thumbs up!"

1043
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,309
screaming, screaming,
and he came over.

1044
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,344
<i>I grew up.</i>

1045
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:51,580
<i>I made this film
when I was 34 years old.</i>

1046
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,515
<i>It's the first film I ever made.</i>

1047
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:55,887
You're second generation.

1048
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,322
Joshua Tree generation.

1049
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,158
<i>DuVernay:
The film was about my aunt,</i>

1050
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,660
<i>my aunt who took me
to the Oscar's that day.</i>

1051
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:07,329
Nothing wrong with that.

1052
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,331
<i>And about losing someone
that you love.</i>

1053
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,368
<i>And it was Ebert's review
that really got to the heart</i>

1054
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,470
<i>of what I was trying
to articulate.</i>

1055
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:18,473
<i>And just touched me so much,</i>

1056
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:22,485
<i>that I sent him
the picture from the Oscar's.</i>

1057
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:33,692
<i>His reply was,
"We were both younger then."</i>

1058
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:39,461
The next day,
a blog post turned up

1059
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:41,163
<i>where he wrote,</i>

1060
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,632
<i>in a very heartfelt way,
about his own aunt</i>

1061
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:47,702
<i>who kind of gave him the gift
of art and film as well.</i>

1062
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:50,172
<i>You know, I broke down crying.</i>

1063
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,541
<i>And it was a mess.</i>

1064
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,376
It's dangerous as a black woman

1065
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,511
to give something
that you've made

1066
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,246
<i>from your point of view,</i>

1067
00:51:58,247 --> 00:51:59,948
<i>very steeped in your identity
and your personhood</i>

1068
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:03,385
<i>to a white man whose gaze
is usually the exact opposite,</i>

1069
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,788
<i>and to say, you are the carrier
of this film to the public.</i>

1070
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:10,525
You're the one that's gonna
dictate whether it has value.

1071
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:14,429
And you had a lot less fears
around that with Roger.

1072
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,498
<i>'Cause you knew it was someone</i>

1073
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:18,500
<i>who was gonna take it seriously,</i>

1074
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,268
<i>gonna come with
some historical context,</i>

1075
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,305
<i>some cultural nuance.</i>

1076
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,373
I mean, everybody knows
Roger had a black wife.

1077
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:27,342
You know what I mean?
You know.

1078
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:28,910
It's like an honorary brother.

1079
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,413
I mean, you live with a sister.

1080
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,914
That's a whole different
understanding

1081
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:34,516
of black women, right?

1082
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:36,251
So maybe you watch
my film differently.

1083
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:37,819
Every time I see him,

1084
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,288
I'll walk away
with something new, you know.

1085
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:44,960
And every time I sit down
at the table to do the work,

1086
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,661
I think about him,

1087
00:52:46,662 --> 00:52:48,396
<i>because
what if something happened</i>

1088
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:50,532
<i>that I don't get
to see him again.</i>

1089
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:53,535
<i>It was just a few days
before Christmas.</i>

1090
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,840
I said, "Well, Chaz,
can I come there?"

1091
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,375
<i>- Chaz: So...
- Woman: Merry Christmas.</i>

1092
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:01,810
( chuckles )

1093
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,615
Chaz:
Come over and say hi.

1094
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,449
How are you?
Good to see you.

1095
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,850
What are you doing in here?

1096
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:10,452
( laughter )

1097
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,454
Chaz is missing you at home,
you gotta get out.

1098
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:16,258
Oh, I like the glasses.
Get off the road...

1099
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,394
<i>Bahrani: It was nice to see him
interacting with his grandkids.</i>

1100
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:20,696
<i>Chaz:
Grandpa Roger, do you think...</i>

1101
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,331
<i>Bahrani: I know that he
must be in pain physically,</i>

1102
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:26,301
<i>but he ends up being
the happiest guy around.</i>

1103
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:29,404
- From the Christmas stocking.
- Chaz: From Santa.

1104
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:33,275
<i>- Raven Evans: From Santa.
- Chaz: A Lady Gaga toothbrush.</i>

1105
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,779
( laughter )

1106
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:39,447
<i>Raven: I just remember
being so young,</i>

1107
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:42,884
and watching for the first time
so many movies

1108
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:44,953
and him sort of explaining
to me, you know,

1109
00:53:44,954 --> 00:53:48,957
what's important about this one,
or this is a really great movie.

1110
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:51,760
<i>Computerized voice:
Ever heard of this film?</i>

1111
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,529
<i>This movie begins
with seven children</i>

1112
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,631
<i>who are seven,
and check in on them</i>

1113
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:59,836
<i>every seven years
of their lives.</i>

1114
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:03,905
Are they 56 now? Really?

1115
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,640
Oh, my gosh, wow.

1116
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:09,544
All the great conversations
and things that he taught me

1117
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:13,415
about movies and life
and family and books,

1118
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,753
and you know,
all this stuff, I just...

1119
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:21,890
<i>Those experiences
mean a lot to me.</i>

1120
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,327
<i>Chaz: There's another chocolate
bar, chocolate bars.</i>

1121
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,062
So I spoke to Werner,
I said I was coming to see you,

1122
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:29,597
and he sends his regards

1123
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:31,566
and he says
you have to keep writing

1124
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:34,069
because he's
very worried about cinema.

1125
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,905
<i>Chaz: Can you say it the
way Werner would say it?</i>

1126
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,807
<i>- ( laughter )
- Bahrani: Oh, gosh. No.</i>

1127
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,710
- Roger...
- ( with bad German accent) Roger, you must get better.

1128
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,912
You must soldier on, Roger.

1129
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,547
Really bad shape.

1130
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,117
<i>Werner Herzog:
He's the soldier of cinema.</i>

1131
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,086
He's a wounded comrade

1132
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:54,489
who cannot even speak anymore,
and he plows on.

1133
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,963
And that touches
my heart very deeply.

1134
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:04,671
<i>Herzog: I never dedicate
films to anyone.</i>

1135
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,806
<i>I dedicated a film to him
where I ventured out</i>

1136
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:15,577
<i>to the last corner
of this planet,</i>

1137
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:17,012
<i>to Antarctica,</i>

1138
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:19,117
<i>to the ice.</i>

1139
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,391
<i>And from there I bow
my head in his direction.</i>

1140
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,566
<i>He reinforces my courage.</i>

1141
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:40,135
<i>Bahrani:
One time, I went to see Roger.</i>

1142
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,005
He was kind of eager and
bouncing to give me something.

1143
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:48,643
He gave me this letter,
actually from Laura Dern.

1144
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:50,879
"Dear Roger, I want you to know

1145
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,615
that your generosity
and expertise

1146
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,818
at the Sundance Tribute
meant the world to me.

1147
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:57,485
I've tried to come up

1148
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:59,087
with an appropriate way
to thank you.

1149
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:03,458
This box and its contents,
a jigsaw puzzle,

1150
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:04,827
I have treasured for some time.

1151
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:08,196
It was given to me
by the Strasberg family

1152
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:11,132
when Lee Strasberg passed away.

1153
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:15,035
It was Marilyn Monroe's,
who collected puzzles,

1154
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:18,039
and it had been given to her
by Alfred Hitchcock.

1155
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,176
That night at Sundance
you inspired me

1156
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,127
about film and contribution
and I wanted

1157
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:27,649
to pass along film
and connection in some way.

1158
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,917
Thank you again.

1159
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,453
Love to you and Chaz.
Laura."

1160
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,656
And then Roger gave me
this gift, which I refused.

1161
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,191
I said, "You cannot
give me this gift.

1162
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,926
I cannot accept
this gift."

1163
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,495
And then he said, "You're
going to accept the gift,

1164
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:41,936
because you have
to one day give this

1165
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,173
to somebody else
who deserves it."

1166
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:53,541
<i>James:
What's it a jigsaw puzzle of?</i>

1167
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,681
I've always
been terrified to make it.

1168
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:02,784
I mean, this is
the jigsaw puzzle

1169
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:06,061
that Alfred Hitchcock
gave Marilyn Monroe.

1170
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:15,633
<i>( upbeat '50s instrumental
rock music playing )</i>

1171
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,134
<i>Roger:
In the Autumn of 1967,</i>

1172
00:57:20,135 --> 00:57:22,604
<i>I saw a movie
named "I Call First,"</i>

1173
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,177
<i>later to be retitled, "Who's
That Knocking at My Door."</i>

1174
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:30,845
<i>The energy
of the cutting grabbed me.</i>

1175
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:34,148
<i>It was the work
of a natural director.</i>

1176
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:36,818
<i>I wrote a review
suggesting in 10 years</i>

1177
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,053
<i>he would become
the American Fellini.</i>

1178
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:41,923
And I said, "You think
it's gonna take that long?"

1179
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:43,992
And I was serious.
I'm just like, it's over here.

1180
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,261
What are you talking about?
It's right here.

1181
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,831
<i>It was the first
real strong encouragement.</i>

1182
00:57:49,832 --> 00:57:51,933
<i>Yes, there are defects
in the movie.</i>

1183
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:54,569
But he saw something special

1184
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,805
and that had to be nourished.

1185
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,705
As you know,
I carried your review

1186
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:00,040
around with me
when I was in Europe in 1968.

1187
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,709
Oh.

1188
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,278
I kept reading.
Is that really about me?

1189
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,282
You know, wow.

1190
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:10,151
<i>Roger: So refreshing to find
a director and an actor</i>

1191
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:13,721
<i>working right
at the top of their form.</i>

1192
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:16,591
I think "Raging Bull" is one of the
great American pictures of the year.

1193
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:20,929
<i>Roger: His greatest film is
an act of self-redemption.</i>

1194
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,265
<i>In the period before it,
he'd become addicted to cocaine</i>

1195
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,900
<i>and told me
that after an overdose,</i>

1196
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:27,569
<i>he was pronounced dead</i>

1197
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,174
<i>in an emergency room
and resuscitated.</i>

1198
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:35,910
During the '80s was extremely...
I was gone, basically.

1199
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:39,847
Broke, and um, I'd gone through
some bad, bad periods.

1200
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:42,650
<i>My third marriage
had been broken up,</i>

1201
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:44,686
<i>and I was basically alone.</i>

1202
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,821
<i>The only thing that saved me</i>

1203
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:52,093
or made me want
to uh, huh, continue

1204
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,762
just like living, in a way,
was my agent called

1205
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:57,098
and said, "You know, there's
this festival up in Toronto."

1206
00:58:57,099 --> 00:58:58,733
I said, "Yeah."

1207
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:00,802
"Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel,

1208
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,453
they wanna give you
this tribute."

1209
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,174
<i>I was kind of scared.</i>

1210
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:09,277
<i>Could I walk down
this theater aisle</i>

1211
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:12,283
<i>and go up on the stage,
knowing who I am?</i>

1212
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:16,284
<i>But I knew
that they believed in me,</i>

1213
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:18,086
<i>and I have that in my house now,</i>

1214
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,355
<i>in a special place
where only I can see it,</i>

1215
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:25,860
<i>that I pass by every maybe,
five to six minutes, I see it.</i>

1216
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:29,364
<i>But that night, changed it.</i>

1217
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:32,738
<i>And I started
my life again, you know.</i>

1218
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,910
It was...

1219
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:46,714
<i>I didn't feel
inhibited with Roger.</i>

1220
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:48,916
<i>He was that close.</i>

1221
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:53,721
<i>Scott: Roger has, unlike just
about any of the rest of us,</i>

1222
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:56,391
arrived at this point
where he is

1223
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:57,992
kind of the peer of the people,

1224
00:59:57,993 --> 00:59:59,929
of some of the people
that he writes about.

1225
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:03,131
<i>It's very complicated,
I think, when you have</i>

1226
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,667
<i>personal relationships and
friendships with these people,</i>

1227
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,903
<i>because it cannot
but cloud your judgment.</i>

1228
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:10,672
I am infinitely corruptible.

1229
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,975
I do not want to get to know
these people as people.

1230
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:16,210
I wanna think of them
as fictional characters.

1231
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:18,312
I mean,
my obligation is to write

1232
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:20,148
what I think about a movie,

1233
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:23,051
and not to worry
about someone I know

1234
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,787
perching on my shoulder saying,
"No, I wouldn't say that."

1235
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,855
When you look
at the nineteenth century

1236
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:29,257
and the great critics and music,

1237
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:33,327
they hung together,
critics and artists.

1238
01:00:33,328 --> 01:00:35,363
<i>They were in the same circles.</i>

1239
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:38,466
<i>And that helped the critics
and it helped the composers.</i>

1240
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:43,143
<i>Roger brought back that concept
and he was criticized for it.</i>

1241
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:50,311
That was real
distracting for me there,

1242
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:52,380
the way all those pool balls
bounced around like that,

1243
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:54,148
and the scene gets
even worse as it goes on.

1244
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,049
And it's all the more
disappointing

1245
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:57,919
because the "Color of Money"
was directed

1246
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,387
by Martin Scorsese,
who is one of

1247
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,789
the two or three best movie
directors around today.

1248
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,324
Oh.

1249
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,058
Devastating.

1250
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:08,062
It doesn't have the interior
energy, and the drive,

1251
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:10,331
and the obsession of most
of the best Scorsese films.

1252
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,066
The script isn't good.

1253
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:14,802
It's just the standard
sort of predictable narrative.

1254
01:01:14,803 --> 01:01:17,071
I said, I know,
but beautiful cam...

1255
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:18,873
Michael Ballhouse, Paul Newman,

1256
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:21,109
but you know,
they wouldn't accept it.

1257
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,046
That was a way
of condemning and helping.

1258
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:27,482
In other words,
you've done this now, once,

1259
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,084
you may have done it twice,
but watch yourself.

1260
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:35,223
As opposed to
toxic, poisonous, unkind,

1261
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:39,961
ungenerous, lack of charity,
on so many others.

1262
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,032
I think he was a tougher critic
when he was younger.

1263
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:47,502
<i>He could be really cutting,
and relentless,</i>

1264
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,975
<i>and ruthless, and sarcastic.</i>

1265
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,876
You motherfucker!

1266
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,916
Ah! Whoo!

1267
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:02,517
Not a bad movie,
but it's not original,

1268
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,951
and it's not a masterpiece.

1269
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,119
Oh, I think it's very original

1270
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,521
and very close
to being a masterpiece.

1271
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,191
I have never felt a kill
in a movie quite like that.

1272
01:02:10,192 --> 01:02:12,260
Not in "Apocalypse Now,"
not in the "Deer Hunter"?

1273
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,328
No, not like that.
Not like that.

1274
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:15,997
In that case, you're
gonna love the late show

1275
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,565
because they have kills
like that every night

1276
01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:19,300
in black and white
starring John Wayne.

1277
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:21,869
<i>LaPietra: They would get
into their cross talk.</i>

1278
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,139
<i>The camera would stop,
they would still be at it.</i>

1279
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,809
And I disagree particularly
about the part that you like.

1280
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,577
They truly felt it
in their soul.

1281
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:32,880
They could still show them
the error of their ways,

1282
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:34,215
the folly of their thinking.

1283
01:02:34,216 --> 01:02:36,384
"Benji the Hunted" exhausted me.

1284
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,553
This is the first time
I wanted to tell a dog

1285
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,122
to slow down and stop
to smell the flowers.

1286
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:42,390
I don't know, Gene.

1287
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,358
Your review is
the typical sort of

1288
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:47,128
blasé sophisticated
cynical review...

1289
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:48,863
<i>I'll take
the word sophisticated.</i>

1290
01:02:48,864 --> 01:02:50,164
...I would expect
from an adult.

1291
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:52,200
You're wrapping yourself
in the flag of children.

1292
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,868
You're wrapping yourself
in the flag

1293
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:55,069
of the sophisticated
film critic.

1294
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,304
- No, boredom.
- You've seen it all.

1295
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,172
Boredom with Benji running.

1296
01:02:58,173 --> 01:02:59,807
I don't think that any child
is gonna be bored by this movie.

1297
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:02,443
<i>Scott: It was not you know,
gentlemanly, it was not,</i>

1298
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:04,245
<i>"Ah, well, I see
you have a good point."</i>

1299
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:05,913
It was I'm gonna crush you.

1300
01:03:05,914 --> 01:03:07,248
And this is
the show when you give

1301
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,883
"Benji The Hunter" dog
a positive review

1302
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:10,117
and not Kubrick's film?

1303
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:11,485
Now, Gene,
that's totally unfair,

1304
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:14,388
because you realize that
these reviews are relative.

1305
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:16,324
"Benji the Hunter" is not
one-tenth the film...

1306
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,259
- Roger...
- ...that the Kubrick film is

1307
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,127
but you know that you review
films within context.

1308
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,363
And you know it, and you
should be ashamed of yourself.

1309
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:23,832
- No, I'm not.
- Now let's take another look...

1310
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:25,299
They almost didn't care

1311
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,236
what anyone else
thought about anything,

1312
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,438
as long as they could try
to persuade the other.

1313
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:33,073
And I'm not talking about just,
about movie reviews.

1314
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:35,209
I'm talking
about anything in life...

1315
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:38,078
the tie you're wearing,
what you think of that person,

1316
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,314
<i>a book, a restaurant.</i>

1317
01:03:40,315 --> 01:03:42,183
When there was,

1318
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:44,218
and when
wasn't there disagreement,

1319
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:46,354
the coin of
the realm was the quarter.

1320
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,155
It's hard to think of anything

1321
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:50,625
that wasn't decided
by a coin toss.

1322
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:54,228
Were we going to get tuna fish
sandwiches for lunch?

1323
01:03:54,229 --> 01:03:57,298
Who would get one movie,
who would get another movie.

1324
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:59,667
Who got to sit next
to Johnny Carson on the couch.

1325
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:02,370
<i>( jazz theme music playing )</i>

1326
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,372
<i>Flaum: They actually
wanted us to change</i>

1327
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,141
<i>the opening
of the show every week</i>

1328
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,443
<i>so that Roger
would be first one week</i>

1329
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,946
<i>and Gene would be first
the next week. And we said no.</i>

1330
01:04:11,947 --> 01:04:14,248
<i>Lynn Sherr: Why is the
show "Siskel and Ebert"?</i>

1331
01:04:14,249 --> 01:04:16,517
And by the way will it ever be
Ebert and Siskel?

1332
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,219
No.

1333
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,954
<i>You've signed on
to Siskel and...</i>

1334
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:21,422
There's a long story about that.

1335
01:04:21,423 --> 01:04:23,958
A long story.
You know, I'm older,

1336
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,393
I've been a movie critic longer,

1337
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,395
E comes before S
in the alphabet,

1338
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,497
I've got the Pulitzer Prize,

1339
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,933
and yet it's called
Siskel and Ebert.

1340
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,502
And if you wanna know why
that is, you can ask Siskel.

1341
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,239
A flip of the coin.

1342
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:38,940
<i>Kogan:
Gene Siskel was among</i>

1343
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,141
<i>the most competitive people</i>

1344
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,143
<i>on the face of this planet.</i>

1345
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,445
But Roger always
could lord it over Gene

1346
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:46,014
that he had a Pulitzer Prize.

1347
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:49,984
Roger was a bit
of a braggadocio.

1348
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,286
Um, he was a great raconteur.

1349
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:54,956
But frankly,
he was full of himself.

1350
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,692
<i>Nack: Roger was a bit
of a control freak.</i>

1351
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,294
<i>He could not direct Gene Siskel.</i>

1352
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:04,298
He was a rogue planet
in Roger's solar system.

1353
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:08,302
<i>Gene was a source
of madness in Roger's life.</i>

1354
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:10,571
Roger is an only child.

1355
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,506
He was used to getting his way.

1356
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:14,175
Absolutely.

1357
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,411
<i>And he could be a real big baby</i>

1358
01:05:17,412 --> 01:05:19,413
<i>when he didn't get
what he wanted.</i>

1359
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:22,450
<i>Gene, on the other hand,
would just go in there</i>

1360
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,386
and pummel you
until you agree with him,

1361
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:27,989
until you just say, f...
all right, Gene!

1362
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,657
Okay, you're right.
Got it.

1363
01:05:29,658 --> 01:05:31,459
It wasn't a game with him.

1364
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,661
He saw something,
he wanted it to happen.

1365
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:35,463
He made it happen.

1366
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,231
<i>LaPietra:
Gene was very good at reading</i>

1367
01:05:37,232 --> 01:05:39,633
<i>Roger's date book upside down.</i>

1368
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:41,469
<i>As soon as he saw L.A.</i>

1369
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,471
and the date,

1370
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,606
he knew what films
were coming out.

1371
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:47,141
He knew what big star

1372
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:49,176
that Roger would be
going out to interview.

1373
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:52,078
And that's all it took

1374
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,748
<i>for him to make sure</i>

1375
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:56,751
<i>that he got the interview
before Roger got it.</i>

1376
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,352
Fumes you could almost see

1377
01:05:58,353 --> 01:06:00,287
coming out
of Roger's head, you know.

1378
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:04,425
Gene had done him in again,
that wascally wabbit.

1379
01:06:04,426 --> 01:06:06,761
<i>McHugh:
Roger, who was the picture</i>

1380
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,497
<i>of equanimity
for most of his life,</i>

1381
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,700
did all of a sudden,
produce a petulance

1382
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:14,201
that I hadn't seen before.

1383
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:16,570
I thought this movie was awful.

1384
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:19,140
- Oh, no, Roger.
- Dreadful, terrible,

1385
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,775
stupid, idiotic...

1386
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,443
- No, no.
- ...unfunny, labored...

1387
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:26,113
- ...forced, painful, bad.
- Oh, Roger, Roger.

1388
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,415
What happened
to your sense of humor?

1389
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:30,684
I don't think Roger was,
by nature a fighter.

1390
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:33,587
But it's like,
if you have a brother

1391
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:38,128
<i>who likes to fight all the time
so then you learn how to fight.</i>

1392
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,729
<i>McHugh:
And Gene had his number.</i>

1393
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,634
<i>Gene knew the buttons
to push and everything else.</i>

1394
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:48,669
<i>Marlene:
They're in a first class cabin,</i>

1395
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,172
<i>Gene's in one of the front rows.</i>

1396
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,241
<i>Roger's behind him,
and Gene hears</i>

1397
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:58,145
<i>the same old stories that
he's heard over and over again.</i>

1398
01:06:58,146 --> 01:07:00,414
And he's just annoyed.

1399
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:02,183
He writes a little note

1400
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,552
and he gives it
to the flight attendant.

1401
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:08,155
Said, "Would you
pass this to Mr. Ebert?"

1402
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:09,457
So Roger gets the note.

1403
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,625
And it says,
"Dear Mr. Ebert,

1404
01:07:11,626 --> 01:07:17,164
we in the cockpit have noticed
that you are on our flight.

1405
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:19,500
<i>Frankly, we both agree more</i>

1406
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:21,168
<i>with you than your partner,</i>

1407
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:24,705
<i>and we would be so honored
if you would join us</i>

1408
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:27,875
<i>in the cockpit
for a bit of the flight."</i>

1409
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:32,446
I mean, Gene knows
that Roger was really excited.

1410
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:35,349
He gets into the aisle,
and Roger was a big guy then,

1411
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,852
he just kind of
bounds down the aisle,

1412
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:42,189
and gets ready to knock
on the door of the cabin.

1413
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,258
And you know,
the flight attendants

1414
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:47,428
and people are horrified,
and Gene says,

1415
01:07:47,429 --> 01:07:51,904
"Dear Mr. Ebert,
we in the cockpit."

1416
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:57,371
"Gotcha."

1417
01:07:57,372 --> 01:07:59,340
And he finally
tells Gene Siskel,

1418
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:00,608
you know, "You just hate me.

1419
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,443
You just
don't like me," you know.

1420
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:07,314
I mean, that relationship
was absolutely radioactive.

1421
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:10,151
Two thrillers this week
on Siskel and Ebert.

1422
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:11,519
First, we'll review Michael Kane

1423
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,321
and Pierce Brosnan
in "The Fourth Protocol."

1424
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:17,458
And then Gene Hackman and Kevin
Costner star in "No Way Out,"

1425
01:08:17,459 --> 01:08:19,493
and we have third thriller too
if you're interested.

1426
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:20,928
What do you mean, two thrillers?

1427
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:23,697
How about something like this:
It's thriller week

1428
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:26,634
on "Siskel and Ebert"
and we've got three big ones.

1429
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,270
Okay. Ready?

1430
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,471
I guess you're gonna do it.

1431
01:08:30,472 --> 01:08:31,772
We have to rewrite it, don't we?

1432
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:34,575
- Ah, no. Let's...
- You can't ad lib, Gene.

1433
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:37,244
Can we for the last week,
and next week we'll do it?

1434
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:38,512
No, every week counts.

1435
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:40,548
You read it then,
you ad-lib it.

1436
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,650
I'll do nothing.
Let him do whatever he wants.

1437
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:45,519
It's thriller and week on "Siskel
and Ebert And the Movies."

1438
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,388
And we've got three new ones.

1439
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:50,524
Gotta have energy up
and the movie's out.

1440
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:51,959
Why don't you read both parts?

1441
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,327
I'd like to.

1442
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:54,495
I know that.

1443
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:56,230
Please get your energy up.

1444
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:58,666
It's thriller and week on "Siskel
and Ebert And The Movies,"

1445
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,401
and we've got three new ones.

1446
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:01,802
Denis Quaid in "The Big Easy,"

1447
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:03,671
Michael Kane
in "The Fourth Protocol,"

1448
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:07,241
and Kevin Costner and Gene
Hackman in "No Way Out."

1449
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:08,909
Sound a little excited, Gene.

1450
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,811
Sound less excited, Roger.

1451
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:13,716
That's why we're re-doing it
because of what you did.

1452
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,284
It's thriller week on "Siskel
and Ebert At The Movies."

1453
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:21,557
- And we've got three new ones...
- It's called "And The Movies," not At The Movies.

1454
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:24,828
And that's why we're
re-doing it this time.

1455
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,330
It's thriller week on "Siskel
and Ebert And The Movies."

1456
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,698
And we've got three new ones.

and Kevin Costner and Gene
Hackman in "No Way Out."

1460
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:42,509
That's this week
on "Siskel, and Ebert,

01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:45,346
And the Movies,"

<i>Man:

1463

little boys fighting it out

1465

on the playground

1466
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,473

Sometimes, I just stare at him</i>

1511
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:42,826
<i>and say where did this
determination come from?</i>

1512
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:46,593
<i>♪ Stowing away the time... ♪</i>

1513
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:47,861
( turns off music )

1514
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:50,097
<i>Chaz:
Roger had an inner core</i>

1515
01:12:50,098 --> 01:12:52,536
<i>that was made of steel.</i>

1516
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,481
<i>( typing )</i>

1517
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:09,152
<i>James: How have you
kept your spirits up?</i>

1518
01:13:11,152 --> 01:13:13,987
<i>Computerized voice:
I've zeroed in on my work.</i>

1519
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:17,224
<i>When I'm seeing a movie,
or writing the review,</i>

1520
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:19,193
<i>that makes me feel good.</i>

1521
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,930
<i>You know how they talk
about being in the zone?</i>

1522
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,665
<i>When you're doing something</i>

1523
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:27,468
<i>you're good at,
you get in the zone.</i>

1524
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:31,141
<i>It sort of pushes your troubles
to the back of your mind.</i>

1525
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:35,909
<i>Corliss: You have this
tremendous body of work.</i>

1526
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,945
<i>He's been writing for half</i>

1527
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,747
<i>of the history of feature films.</i>

1528
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:44,019
And that's just
one slice of the cake.

1529
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:48,555
<i>A novel in weekly installments.</i>

1530
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:50,123
Just like Dickens.

1531
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:52,626
Not quite of that level.

1532
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:57,698
<i>He wrote a book about how
to keep your computer bug-free.</i>

1533
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,067
<i>Strolls through London.</i>

1534
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:03,136
<i>A book about
the Cannes Film Festival.</i>

1535
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:05,787
<i>Roger: The Cannes Film Festival
is one of those events</i>

1536
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:09,743
<i>like the Super Bowl, Wimbledon,
or the Kentucky Derby</i>

1537
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:12,279
<i>that comes cloaked
in its own legend.</i>

1538
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,115
<i>Roger ( as host ): This is
Cannes on the French Riviera,</i>

1539
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:17,584
a fishing village
since Roman times.

1540
01:14:17,585 --> 01:14:19,152
And every year
in the month of May,

1541
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:21,855
the population grows
by forty thousand

1542
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:24,057
<i>for the world's
most famous film festival.</i>

1543
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:26,894
<i>( instrumental
pop music playing )</i>

1544
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,030
<i>It's been called
the world's biggest party.</i>

1545
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,266
<i>The town of Cannes
is bursting to the seams</i>

1546
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,902
<i>with directors,
producers, and stars.</i>

1547
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,137
<i>- Hi.
- Roger: It wouldn't be a Cannes Film Festival</i>

1548
01:14:37,138 --> 01:14:39,239
without a beautiful blonde
here on the terrace

1549
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,841
of the Carlton Hotel.

1550
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,142
<i>De Los Santos-Reza:
Here was this kid</i>

1551
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:44,177
<i>from southern
Illinois hobnobbing</i>

1552
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:46,980
<i>with all of
the international movie stars.</i>

1553
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:49,216
<i>Roger ( as host ):
That's me with Robert De Niro.</i>

1554
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:51,184
<i>Yes, your faithful correspondent</i>

1555
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,153
<i>is getting
an exclusive interview.</i>

1556
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:55,989
<i>And De Niro was telling me
he's just happy to be here.</i>

1557
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:59,626
He loved that.
He did, and they loved him.

1558
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:01,427
( French accent )
Roger! Roger Ebert!

1559
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:04,898
<i>Roger:
I always wake up very early</i>

1560
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:06,399
<i>in the morning after I arrive.</i>

1561
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:09,269
<i>I walk down the Rou Felix Faure,</i>

1562
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,938
<i>passing the flower sellers,</i>

1563
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,907
<i>the fishmongers
unloading iced oysters,</i>

1564
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:17,110
<i>and at particular cafe,
at a particular table,</i>

1565
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:19,880
<i>I order, in shameful French,</i>

1566
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:23,817
<i>a cafe au lait,
a Perrier, and a croissant.</i>

1567
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:27,688
<i>Such returns are
an important ritual to me.</i>

1568
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,222
He stayed at the same fricken

1569
01:15:29,223 --> 01:15:31,191
little hotel in Cannes,
the Splendid,

1570
01:15:31,192 --> 01:15:34,094
<i>which is a dump,
but he loved it.</i>

1571
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:36,296
<i>Movshovitz: I'd go over and
see him at the Splendid,</i>

1572
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:39,166
and he'd say,
"Tomorrow, be here at ten."

1573
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:43,604
And so we go over to the Swedish
film institute's hotel suite,

1574
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:47,207
and there's Erland Josephson
the actor lying on the bed,

1575
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,910
<i>and he and I talk about
Ingmar Bergman for an hour.</i>

1576
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,813
<i>You know, no interview,
no formality.</i>

1577
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,615
Just yacking.

1578
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:57,019
<i>Roger: If I am lucky,
something extraordinary</i>

1579
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,086
<i>will happen to me
during this festival.</i>

1580
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:01,922
<i>I will see a film that will make</i>

1581
01:16:01,923 --> 01:16:04,157
<i>my spine tingle
with its greatness.</i>

1582
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,059
<i>And I will leave
the theatre speechless.</i>

1583
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,962
( dog whimpers )

1584
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:11,198
<i>It was at Cannes
that I saw Bresson's</i>

1585
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,234
<i>precise,
unforgiving "L'Argent."</i>

1586
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:15,969
<i>Man: L'Argent.</i>

1587
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,839
<i>A film that was
so suspicious of passion</i>

1588
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,909
<i>and emotion,
so cold on its surface,</i>

1589
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,846
<i>that I finally realized
that no man could make</i>

1590
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,889
<i>such distant
and austere films...</i>

1591
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:37,991
<i>There are Dantean levels
to this festival.</i>

1592
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:41,094
<i>At the top level
is the official selection,</i>

1593
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:43,997
<i>films chosen
from all over the world.</i>

1594
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:46,032
<i>Roger ( as host ):
But down, down, down, down here</i>

1595
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:49,068
in the basement of the Palais,
this is the movie super market.

1596
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:51,972
This is where they sell
porno and exploitation

1597
01:16:51,973 --> 01:16:53,740
and horror and action
and violence.

1598
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,343
<i>You take out ads in Variety
saying we will buy...</i>

1599
01:16:56,344 --> 01:16:58,278
<i>- ...movies sight unseen.
- Right.</i>

1600
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:01,882
<i>- Man: Last year, 350 movies.
- Roger: How do you sell them?</i>

1601
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,217
By the title,
by the foot, by the inch?

1602
01:17:04,218 --> 01:17:05,014
By the pound.

1603
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:07,788
Most of us
were writing our stories

1604
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,890
<i>after the festival was over.</i>

1605
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,159
<i>Roger,
anticipating the internet,</i>

1606
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,161
<i>or recalling daily journalism,</i>

1607
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,430
<i>was filing stories
all through the festival.</i>

1608
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,765
For best film, "Kagemusha,"

1609
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:21,268
which is
the Akira Kurosawa film.

1610
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,170
<i>Roger ( as host ):
While photographers are trying</i>

1611
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,772
<i>to get pictures
of stars at the festival,</i>

1612
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,474
<i>would-be stars
and hopefuls are trying</i>

1613
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:30,277
<i>to get their pictures
taken by photographers.</i>

1614
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,279
<i>Roger:
In the dreams of the starlet,</i>

1615
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,449
<i>there's always that scene where
the cigar-chomping producer</i>

1616
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,318
<i>spots a lovely young woman
on the Carlton terrace</i>

1617
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:40,987
<i>and shouts, "Who is that girl?</i>

1618
01:17:40,988 --> 01:17:44,057
<i>I must have her
for my next picture."</i>

1619
01:17:44,058 --> 01:17:48,060
So much of what we did
was not me as the producer

1620
01:17:48,061 --> 01:17:49,930
saying do this, do that,
do that, was Roger.

1621
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,398
<i>He had fabulous ideas.</i>

1622
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:53,834
...topless beaches,
starlets, interviews.

1623
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,270
<i>De Los Santos-Reza: Now, whenever
we were doing something on the show</i>

1624
01:17:57,271 --> 01:17:59,906
<i>that required some creativity...</i>

1625
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:02,075
I don't know why you keep...
that isn't the issue.

1626
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:05,212
<i>It was Gene who would usually
win out that argument,</i>

1627
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,849
<i>and Roger would say,
"Well, uh, fine."</i>

1628
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,050
<i>( French ballad playing )</i>

1629
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:13,954
<i>The Cannes Film Festival
was only Roger.</i>

1630
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:18,228
<i>He loved that he didn't have
to convince someone else.</i>

1631
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,829
<i>Marlene: Roger had
everything he needed.</i>

1632
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:25,932
Gene was just afraid
that at some point

1633
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:29,369
<i>Roger would go it alone
and quit.</i>

1634
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:31,420
<i>LaPietra: And this
literally haunted Gene.</i>

1635
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,440
<i>When the next contract
would come up,</i>

1636
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,909
would Roger not be there?

1637
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:40,280
<i>Flaum: Joe Antelo just sat
down and did the math.</i>

1638
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:43,917
<i>In syndication, we can put
commercials around it.</i>

1639
01:18:43,918 --> 01:18:45,485
So he offered Gene and Roger

1640
01:18:45,486 --> 01:18:47,021
a tremendous amount of money.

1641
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:52,125
Roger didn't go out
and buy a new car or anything.

1642
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:54,326
He moved out of that garage
apartment he had.

1643
01:18:56,197 --> 01:19:00,400
I know that I would hear them
sometimes talk about money,

1644
01:19:00,401 --> 01:19:03,270
<i>like "Hey, big boy, did you get
that check in the mail?"</i>

1645
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:08,441
These guys were Siamese twins
joined at the rear end.

1646
01:19:08,442 --> 01:19:11,144
<i>And they were gonna make
this thing work.</i>

1647
01:19:11,145 --> 01:19:13,580
<i>Marlene: Gene would say,
and this is as they became</i>

1648
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,916
<i>more and more of a team,</i>

1649
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,118
"He's an asshole.

1650
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:20,153
But he's my asshole."

1651
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:22,355
This week on "Siskel and
Ebert and the Movies,"

1652
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:25,158
the science fiction
adventure, "Robocop."

1653
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:27,294
<i>Man:
Why don't we do that again.</i>

1654
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,963
Did you know that for Gene,
speech is a 2nd language?

1655
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:31,531
<i>( laughter )</i>

1656
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:34,434
Roger's first language is,

1657
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:36,603
"Yes, I'll have apple pie
with my order."

1658
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:38,438
He asked the McDonald's girls

1659
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:40,941
if he can have apple pie
with her with the order,

1660
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,509
before they ask him.

1661
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:45,178
And you know what Gene says
when he goes into McDonald's?

1662
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:47,948
Can I have a apple with
thei... with their order?

1663
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:51,050
( laughter )

1664
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:53,253
<i>Man:
Okay, ready?</i>

1665
01:19:53,254 --> 01:19:56,556
You know they don't get
enough shit basically raw.

1666
01:19:56,557 --> 01:19:58,892
- They don't.
- They don't. They're called yuppies now.

1667
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:02,162
They run this goddamn country,
and all of us, all of our r...

1668
01:20:02,163 --> 01:20:04,564
I'm speaking to everyone
who's eavesdropping right now.

1669
01:20:04,565 --> 01:20:07,400
Come on, band together people,
let's overthrow the country.

1670
01:20:07,401 --> 01:20:09,870
Protestants, people
who sort of want a religion.

1671
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:11,071
- Let's stick together.
- I know...

1672
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,339
The Catholics
and the fucking Jews,

1673
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,907
we go back a few years together.

1674
01:20:13,908 --> 01:20:15,408
Come on, we're real.

1675
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:17,344
We're real.
We get down and get dirty.

1676
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,212
- I'll take it. I'll take it.
- We were burning each other

1677
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:21,648
when Martin Luther was only
a gleam in his mother's eye.

1678
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:23,617
I'll take a Bap...
I'll take a Baptist.

1679
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:25,352
I go back 6,000 years.

1680
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,388
I mean Ba... somebody that
has some goddamn passion,

1681
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,123
some blood coursing
through their veins.

1682
01:20:30,124 --> 01:20:31,558
- Case closed.
- Anything.

1683
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:33,193
Right.

1684
01:20:33,194 --> 01:20:35,328
Steve Martin's
new comedy, "Roxanne."

1685
01:20:35,329 --> 01:20:37,497
This week on "Siskel and
Ebert and the Movies."

1686
01:20:37,498 --> 01:20:39,232
You said it a little too fast.

1687
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:42,102
The greatest day for Gene

1688
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,436
was when Roger came in

1689
01:20:43,437 --> 01:20:46,373
to say that
he was going to get married.

1690
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,575
<i>I remember Gene saying to me,</i>

1691
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:51,244
<i>"Can you believe
this is happening?"</i>

1692
01:20:51,245 --> 01:20:53,346
<i>He's gonna have a mortgage.</i>

1693
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:55,315
He's gonna have
to buy furniture.

1694
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:57,117
He's gonna have
all the same things

1695
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,685
that we do to have to deal with.

1696
01:20:58,686 --> 01:21:00,987
He's gonna need the show.

1697
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:02,292
He'll never leave now.

1698
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:07,227
<i>Elliot: Chaz was probably
more life altering</i>

1699
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:09,362
<i>for him than his TV show.</i>

1700
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:12,632
She really, really liked him

1701
01:21:12,633 --> 01:21:14,267
for what he was

1702
01:21:14,268 --> 01:21:15,669
and not who he was.

1703
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,373
<i>Marlene: She changed
his life immeasurably.</i>

1704
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:22,609
<i>She changed his personality.</i>

1705
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:25,445
Hey, I was eight months
pregnant and Roger

1706
01:21:25,446 --> 01:21:28,448
grabbed the cab in front
of me in New York.

1707
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:31,020
He's not that kind of guy now.

1708
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:35,155
<i>I think Gene was so happy</i>

1709
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:39,091
<i>that Roger found his mate.</i>

1710

<i>Chaz: He was 50 years old
when we got married.</i>

1711
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,565
<i>He used to tell me,</i>

1712
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:50,303
<i>"I waited just about
all my life to find you.</i>

1713
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:52,305
<i>And I'm glad I did.</i>

1714
01:21:52,306 --> 01:21:54,374
<i>And I'm never gonna let you go.</i>

1715
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,146

<i>( orchestral music playing )</i>

<i>Chaz: Our wedding was
like a fairytale.</i>

1718
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:09,656
<i>Gene Siskel's
daughters Kate and Kali,</i>

1719

<i>they were our beautiful
little flower girls.</i>

1720
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:18,098
<i>And Roger's idea of a wedding
was like "Father of the Bride,"</i>

1721
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,166
<i>where the father says,</i>

1722
01:22:20,167 --> 01:22:21,534
"Can't you just have the wedding

1723
01:22:21,535 --> 01:22:25,071
in the backyard and put
some brats on the grill?"

<i>( orchestral music continues )</i>

1725
01:22:31,011 --> 01:22:35,215
<i>People who knew me then
would be very surprised</i>

1726
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:38,585
<i>that I would marry a white man,</i>

1727
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:42,155
<i>because I felt that
African-American men had gotten</i>

1728
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:45,225
<i>such a raw deal in this society.</i>

1729
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:49,696
<i>In college, I was the head
of the black student union.</i>

1730
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:53,400
<i>I marched
with Martin Luther King.</i>

1731
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,468
<i>I talked to my mother about it.</i>

1732
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:58,371
"Mom, what do you think
people would say,"

1733
01:22:58,372 --> 01:23:01,107
and she said,
"Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

1734
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:04,477
What do you say?
What does your heart say?"

1735
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:07,380
Chaz and Roger,
you have come together

1736
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:09,115
according
to God's wonderful plan...

1737
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:12,285
<i>Chaz: And as sophisticated
as Roger was,</i>

1738
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:16,222
<i>he didn't know
how his family would take this.</i>

1739
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:21,728
He used to say,
"You know, maybe my uncle Bill,

1740
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:26,533
or my aunt Mary, uh, you know
because you're not Catholic."

1741
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:30,370
I said, "Roger, come on,
if we're gonna have

1742
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:32,405
this relationship,
we have to be serious.

1743
01:23:32,406 --> 01:23:35,742
Not Catholic, or not white?"

1744
01:23:35,743 --> 01:23:38,445
He said, "Yeah, probably
some of that too."

<i>( organ music playing )</i>

1746

<i>After a while though,</i>

1747
01:23:47,354 --> 01:23:50,193
<i>his family
accepted me with open arms.</i>

1748

<i>Nack: He was on a
lifelong quest for love.</i>

He found romantic love
with Chaz.

1750

Hey, I'm just
about to beat up...

1751
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:04,637
And he loved that family,
her kids and her grandkids.

1752
01:24:04,638 --> 01:24:06,673
Hey, you better not drool on me.

1753
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:09,476
<i>Oh, he fit right in perfectly.</i>

Oh, I forgot

<i>Roger: There were no

Okay, try get that pole.

1760

<i>And as a member
of another race, I have</i>

<i>without exception,

1762
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:30,563
<i>The greatest pleasure

and right now we're
about to take the garden walk,

1771
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,522

<i>Roger:
Emile announced that, for him,</i>

1774
01:24:59,493 --> 01:25:01,895
<i>there was no such thing
as getting up too early.</i>

1775
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,330
<i>And every morning,
the two of us would meet</i>

1776
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:07,333
<i>in the hotel lobby and go out
for long walks together.</i>

"Compelled into
an esthetic contemplation...

1808
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,877
he neither understood
nor desired.

1809
01:26:57,878 --> 01:27:00,647
Face to face for
the last time in history,

1810
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:04,417
with something commensurate
to his capacity for wonder..."

1811
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:06,953
<i>Roger: We're both conscious
of the passage of time,</i>

1812
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:09,922
<i>of its flow,
slipping through our fingers,</i>

1813
01:27:09,923 --> 01:27:12,358
<i>like a long silk scarf.</i>

1814
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:14,494
I think this was Roger's
favorite passage

1815
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,629
from all of literature.

1816
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,866
<i>It was really a passage
about the American Dream.</i>

1817
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,302
<i>You can be anything you want.</i>

1818
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:25,905
<i>You know, Roger went from this
small town kid in Urbana</i>

1819
01:27:25,906 --> 01:27:28,341
<i>to this huge national celebrity.</i>

1820
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:31,192
<i>His father was an electrician.
His mother was a housewife.</i>

1821
01:27:33,046 --> 01:27:35,481
<i>But I think
"The Great Gatsby" was also,</i>

1822
01:27:35,482 --> 01:27:37,850
<i>for Roger, about death.</i>

1823
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,753
<i>Death might have
obsessed him a bit.</i>

1824
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:43,990
<i>You know, his father died
fairly young.</i>

1825
01:27:43,991 --> 01:27:46,929
<i>I knew he adored him.</i>

1826
01:27:48,929 --> 01:27:50,705
<i>( James speaking )</i>

1827
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:01,441
<i>Computerized voice: There's an
inescapable parallel between us,</i>

1828
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,544
<i>both my father
and I have cancer.</i>

1829
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,546
<i>My disease may have been started</i>

1830
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:08,414
<i>by childhood
radiation treatments</i>

1831
01:28:08,415 --> 01:28:09,982
<i>for an ear infection.</i>

1832
01:28:09,983 --> 01:28:12,952
<i>I got those
because they loved me.</i>

1833
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:15,023
<i>In my case,
recently discovered tumors</i>

1834
01:28:16,023 --> 01:28:18,828
<i>of the spine have metastasized.</i>

1835
01:28:20,779 --> 01:28:22,829
<i>James: The doctor said
it was these tumors</i>

1836
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,697
<i>that caused the hip fracture.</i>

1837
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:26,733
<i>Roger emailed me
that sharing the news</i>

1838
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:30,087
<i>of the cancer's return
could anger Chaz.</i>

1839
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:49,522
<i>Chaz:
We don't know.</i>

1840
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:52,925
We haven't really
fully discussed this.

1841
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:56,929
It's so new that we,
we really don't know,

1842
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,000
and I'm uncomfortable
talking about it.

1843
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,402
Just sort of
taking it a day at a time,

1844
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:04,537
like I do everything else.

1845
01:29:04,538 --> 01:29:07,974
<i>James:
So, what do the doctors say?</i>

1846
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:10,879
<i>Computerized voice:
Six to sixteen months.</i>

1847
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:13,780
<i>It is likely I will have passed</i>

1848
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:15,086
<i>when the film is ready.</i>

1849
01:29:19,086 --> 01:29:20,753
<i>Chaz:
We'll see.</i>

1850
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:23,489
The radiation
could do its job so well

1851
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:27,166
<i>that he's around a lot longer.</i>

1852
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:38,840
So we'll have the radiation,
and we'll hope for the best.

1853
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,443
<i>Chaz:
I mean, here he is in 2013,</i>

1854
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:46,913
<i>and in 2006,
there were times when they said</i>

1855
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:51,050
he wouldn't be here
the next day, so...

1856
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,953
<i>Computerized voice:
I have no fear of death.</i>

1857
01:29:53,954 --> 01:29:55,023
<i>We all die.</i>

1858
01:29:56,023 --> 01:30:00,059
<i>I consider my remaining days
to be like money in the bank.</i>

1859
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:03,629
<i>When it is all gone,
I will be repossessed.</i>

1860
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:04,931
<i>( Chaz laughs )</i>

1861
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:07,667
<i>When the pain gets
to be unbearable,</i>

1862
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,203
<i>I may not be so jolly.</i>

1863
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:12,939
<i>My senior English
teacher asked me,</i>

1864
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:16,509
<i>"Ebert, why are you always
writing about death?"</i>

1865
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,912
<i>I think it began
in Catholic grade school</i>

1866
01:30:19,913 --> 01:30:21,948
<i>where they place
so much attention</i>

1867
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:23,716
<i>on mortal sin and dying.</i>

1868
01:30:23,717 --> 01:30:27,053
<i>I found it kind of exciting.</i>

1869
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,889
<i>I would have been infuriated
if I missed this</i>

1870
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:32,025
<i>because of an accident,
or sudden death.</i>

1871
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:36,696
<i>This is the third act
and it is an experience.</i>

1872
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:39,064
( Chaz laughs )

1873
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:42,535
So you see, little Ebert
has always been a macabre sort.

1874
01:30:42,536 --> 01:30:45,638
<i>Most people probably
don't know that about him.</i>

1875
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:49,179
Maybe that's why he's jolly,
maybe it's just like, "Okay!"

1876
01:30:52,179 --> 01:30:54,080
<i>( Chaz laughs )</i>

1877
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:56,115
<i>James:
It makes for a better story.</i>

1878
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:57,300
<i>( Chaz chuckles )</i>

1879
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,068
<i>Nack: "Gatsby believed
in the green light</i>

1880
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:19,739
<i>and the orgiastic future that
year by year recedes before us.</i>

1881
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,908
<i>It eluded us then,
but that's no matter...</i>

1882
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:24,877
<i>tomorrow, tomorrow
we will run faster,</i>

1883
01:31:24,878 --> 01:31:26,746
<i>stretch out our arms farther,</i>

1884
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:30,683
<i>and one fine morning
so we beat on.</i>

1885
01:31:30,684 --> 01:31:32,184
<i>Boats against the current,</i>

1886
01:31:32,185 --> 01:31:36,333
<i>borne back ceaselessly
into the past."</i>

1887
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:50,870
<i>Marlene:
On April 30th, 1998,</i>

1888
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,572
<i>Gene was asked to throw out</i>

1889
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:54,140
<i>the first ball of the season</i>

1890
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:56,108
<i>at the White Sox game.</i>

1891
01:31:56,109 --> 01:32:00,913
<i>And he'd had a headache
for some weeks.</i>

1892
01:32:00,914 --> 01:32:05,184
May 8th he was diagnosed,

1893
01:32:05,185 --> 01:32:08,354
terminal brain cancer.

1894
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:12,725
And um, pretty much,

1895
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:15,928
you don't live more than a year.

1896
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:20,336
<i>But on April 30th,
he threw out a damn good pitch.</i>

1897
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:25,705
He didn't really want
the folks at Disney

1898
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:28,009
to know how sick he was.

1899
01:32:29,009 --> 01:32:33,646
He was afraid that if they heard
the words brain tumor,

1900
01:32:33,647 --> 01:32:37,082
they would put
in a substitute for him,

1901
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:39,085
<i>and that would be the end.</i>

1902
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,354
<i>Marlene:
Our mothers knew,</i>

1903
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:43,155
and Gene's siblings,

1904
01:32:43,156 --> 01:32:45,358
and my two sisters knew.

1905
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:46,859
That's it.

1906
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,362
And Roger didn't know.

1907
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:52,000
And that really wounded Roger.

1908
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,102
I don't think it's that he
didn't trust Roger personally.

1909
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:59,105
Nonetheless, when something
like that happens, you take it personally,

1910
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:01,707
how else is there
to take it, you know.

1911
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:05,311
<i>Chaz: Even though he may have
been a few years older than Gene,</i>

1912
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:09,849
<i>Gene was like
the older brother he never had.</i>

1913
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:13,252
And I was so sad
for Roger for not,

1914
01:33:13,253 --> 01:33:16,956
really for not really being able
to tell his brother goodbye.

1915
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:19,992
Gene didn't wanna be seen
as a victim.

1916
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:23,162
But more importantly,
he didn't want

1917
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:28,200
<i>to watch the effect
of his dying on his children.</i>

1918
01:33:28,201 --> 01:33:32,405
<i>And my children celebrated
many things that year,</i>

1919
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:36,108
<i>and had a happy year,</i>

1920
01:33:36,109 --> 01:33:38,744
instead of watching the clock,

1921
01:33:38,745 --> 01:33:40,049
which they would've done.

1922
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:44,250
<i>He wanted to do
just what he was doing.</i>

1923
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:46,786
<i>He wanted to be with his family,</i>

1924
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,888
<i>and go back to work.</i>

1925
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,289
Our next film
is "Meet the Deedles."

1926
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:53,259
And boy, is this
an annoying experience.

1927
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,761
To the point that from now on,
for the rest of my life,

1928
01:33:55,762 --> 01:33:58,764
I may have a negative physical
reaction to hearing the word...

1929
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:00,766
well, it's the title word
in the film.

1930
01:34:00,767 --> 01:34:02,768
- Deedles?
- Oh. Roger, don't.

1931
01:34:02,769 --> 01:34:06,939
<i>Chaz: Toward the end, I said,
"We should go see him."</i>

1932
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:11,777
And we were gonna go
and visit him that Monday,

1933
01:34:11,778 --> 01:34:14,783
but he passed away
that Saturday.

1934
01:34:16,783 --> 01:34:20,953
<i>Flaum: It was a friendship
that he that he cherished,</i>

1935
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:23,126
<i>and it was
a horrible pain for him.</i>

1936
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:28,194
<i>Marlene:
This year on Gene's birthday,</i>

1937
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:32,498
<i>Roger tweeted
every hour on the hour</i>

1938
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:36,802
<i>with links
to memories high and low.</i>

1939
01:34:36,803 --> 01:34:38,804
I was really touched,

1940
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:41,072
and I wrote him a thank you,

1941
01:34:41,073 --> 01:34:44,210
and he sent me this response.

1942
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,346
"Dear Marlene, I'm sick and old

1943
01:34:47,347 --> 01:34:50,416
and find myself thinking
about Gene more than ever.

1944
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:55,354
<i>My stupid ego and maybe his,
complicated the fact</i>

1945
01:34:55,355 --> 01:34:59,358
<i>that I have never met
a smarter or funnier man.</i>

1946
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:02,094
<i>We fought like cats and dogs.</i>

1947
01:35:02,095 --> 01:35:05,097
<i>But there were times
often unobserved,</i>

1948
01:35:05,098 --> 01:35:09,235
<i>like after a long hotel dinner
we had once in Boston,</i>

1949
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:12,274
<i>when I've never felt
closer to a man."</i>

1950
01:35:14,274 --> 01:35:18,244
<i>I think
their relationship evolved.</i>

1951
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,347
<i>They grew to respect each other.</i>

1952
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,387
And I do believe
they did love each other.

1953
01:35:27,387 --> 01:35:31,390
<i>Flaum: After Gene's
funeral, Roger vowed</i>

1954
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:34,393
that he was never gonna keep
any secrets about his health.

1955
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:38,531
He said, "If anything like this
ever happens to me,

1956
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,466
I don't want to hide it,

1957
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:45,137
especially from the people
who mean something to us."

1958
01:35:45,138 --> 01:35:47,538
I've been coming
to this conference for 35 years,

1959
01:35:48,007 --> 01:35:52,912
and this morning I confessed
that I am a sick person.

1960
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:55,848
About two and a half
or three years ago,

1961
01:35:55,849 --> 01:35:58,350
I found a lump under my chin,
and I went to the doctor,

1962
01:35:58,351 --> 01:36:01,120
and it turned out to be
associated with thyroid cancer.

1963
01:36:01,121 --> 01:36:06,125
<i>Chaz: He was in the hospital
maybe two days at the most,</i>

1964
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:07,560
<i>ready to get out.</i>

1965
01:36:07,561 --> 01:36:10,429
<i>Went back to the show,
he's such an optimist,</i>

1966
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:15,100
and he thought, this was
probably the end of it.

1967
01:36:15,101 --> 01:36:18,139
We didn't know that was
just the warm up act.

1968
01:36:19,139 --> 01:36:20,439
<i>Roger:
A few years later,</i>

1969
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,241
<i>I went in for a routine scan</i>

1970
01:36:22,242 --> 01:36:24,443
<i>to check for any new problems.</i>

1971
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:26,378
<i>The news was not good.</i>

1972
01:36:26,379 --> 01:36:29,949
<i>Cancer had been seen
in my right lower jawbone.</i>

1973
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,484
<i>Chaz:
Again he had surgery.</i>

1974
01:36:32,485 --> 01:36:34,453
<i>We were going home.</i>

1975
01:36:34,454 --> 01:36:37,055
<i>Computerized voice:
We were all packed and ready</i>

1976
01:36:37,056 --> 01:36:39,025
<i>to go home just like today.</i>

1977
01:36:40,025 --> 01:36:42,394
<i>Chaz and I
had a Leonard Cohen song</i>

1978
01:36:42,395 --> 01:36:45,898
<i>we both really liked
called "I'm Your Man."</i>

1979
01:36:45,899 --> 01:36:50,169
<i>It's sort of long but I wanted
to play it one last time.</i>

1980
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:53,205

01:37:10,055 --> 01:37:11,423
<i>Computerized voice:

1985
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:14,493
<i>I had a sudden hemorrhage
of an artery.</i>

1986
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:17,963
<i>The doctors rushed me
into the operating room.</i>

1987
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:20,299
The whole thing had burst.

1988
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,370
Uh, his neck,
it just was gushing blood.

1989
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:27,206
There was about 15 doctors
standing there.

1990
01:37:27,207 --> 01:37:29,073
They were
grabbing towels, squeezing

1991
01:37:29,074 --> 01:37:31,412
to get the blood stopped and...

1992
01:37:32,412 --> 01:37:35,514
If he hadn't been
playing that song,

1993
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:37,983
we would've been out
of the hospital already.

2013
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:48,554
<i>Chaz: There were a
series of surgeries,</i>

2014
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:52,191
<i>and his plan
was to return to the show,</i>

<i>to return to broadcasting.</i>

2016

<i>James:
It is a major surgery.</i>

2017
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:58,330
Yes, it is.

2018
01:38:58,331 --> 01:39:00,703
<i>James:
Is it worth it?</i>

2019
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:07,606
( weeping )

2020
01:39:07,607 --> 01:39:09,548
Excuse me.

2021
01:39:15,548 --> 01:39:17,750
( sobbing )
He's very brave about it,

2022
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:19,351
but I'm not.

2023
01:39:19,352 --> 01:39:21,620
I think
it's going to be successful

2024
01:39:21,621 --> 01:39:24,226
and everything's
gonna turn out fine.

2025
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:32,498
<i>Chaz: And the first day or
two he looked in the mirror,</i>

2026
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:35,770
<i>he was very pleased
with what he saw.</i>

2027
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,638
<i>But just like
all the other surgeries,</i>

2028
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:41,140
<i>there was an infection</i>

2029
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:43,811
<i>and they had to undo everything.</i>

2030
01:39:44,811 --> 01:39:48,580
<i>That left him
more debilitated than ever,</i>

2031
01:39:48,581 --> 01:39:52,151
<i>and he just decided
no more surgeries.</i>

2032
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:54,622
<i>No more.</i>

2033
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,257
<i>Roger's not one
to look back and say,</i>

2034
01:39:58,258 --> 01:40:01,393
<i>"Oh, coulda,
woulda, shoulda."</i>

2035
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:03,662
But there were times
when he wrote a note

2036
01:40:03,663 --> 01:40:05,597
that said,

2037
01:40:05,598 --> 01:40:07,800
"Kill me."

2038
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:10,536
I mean, I have that note.

2039
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:12,671
"Kill me."

2040
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,479
And I said, "No. No."

2041
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:23,327
I told him
that was not an option.

2042
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:37,229
<i>Female aide: Oh, you want to walk
until there, or you wanna...?</i>

2043
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:38,664
<i>Okay.</i>

2044
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:42,572
But you know, getting
over there, over that bump...

2045
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:49,241
Okay, who's gonna help him
stand to go up to the stairs?

2046
01:40:49,242 --> 01:40:51,310
I know he wants
to write instructions.

2047
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:53,245
Chaz:
Do you want the walker?

2048
01:40:53,246 --> 01:40:55,147
Yes or no,
do you want the walker?

2049
01:40:55,148 --> 01:40:57,816
No. Okay, then let's get...

2050
01:40:57,817 --> 01:41:00,589
Yeah, but we have
to get up and get going.

2051
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:05,357
<i>Chaz: People would say,
"Ah, don't you get tired?"</i>

2052
01:41:05,358 --> 01:41:06,892
You have to trust us.

2053
01:41:06,893 --> 01:41:09,628
<i>You have to trust that
we know what we're doing.</i>

2054

<i>Chaz:
Yeah, I get tired sometimes.</i>

2055
01:41:11,464 --> 01:41:14,166
"Move this chair
so it faces stairs."

2056
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:17,503
You know, no, no, guess what,
it's a few steps.

2057
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:20,672
You can get out of the chair
and you can walk up the stairs.

2058
01:41:20,673 --> 01:41:22,908
That's what you've
been practicing every day.

2059
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:24,610
You can do this.

2060
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:27,146
<i>Chaz:

Come on, Uncle Roger.

2063
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:31,884
Chaz:
No, he's not gonna do that.

2064

Let me handle it, please.

2065
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,888
I'm gonna pull
the chair out of the way.

2066

who are sick or disabled.</i>

01:50:49,975 --> 01:50:52,944
I don't wanna, I don't,
I don't wanna fight cancer."

2253
01:50:52,945 --> 01:50:54,446
He said, "I am ready to go.

2254
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:59,884
I've had a beautiful life
and death is a part of life.

2255
01:50:59,885 --> 01:51:01,286
And I'm ready to go,

2256
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:04,730
and you must let me go,
you must let me go."

2257
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:14,365
He had signed a DNR,

2258
01:51:14,366 --> 01:51:17,271
a do not resuscitate order.

2259
01:51:19,271 --> 01:51:21,973
He signed it

2260
01:51:21,974 --> 01:51:25,310
while I wasn't there one day.

2261
01:51:25,311 --> 01:51:28,747
And usually we make those kind
of decisions together.

2262
01:51:28,748 --> 01:51:32,317
But I think he knew,

2263
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:35,757
that that
wouldn't have been my choice.

2264
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:40,859
And so,

2265
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,963
when we realized
that he was leaving

2266
01:51:44,964 --> 01:51:48,767
I wanted them to use
the defibrillator.

2267
01:51:48,768 --> 01:51:50,979
And they said no.

2268
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:01,346
And short of going over

2269
01:52:01,347 --> 01:52:05,390
and taking it
and doing it myself, you know...

2270
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:12,540
And I could've screamed

2271
01:52:13,024 --> 01:52:17,094
and made a fuss
and forced them to do it.

2272
01:52:17,095 --> 01:52:22,032
But you know what,
something came over me.

2273
01:52:22,033 --> 01:52:25,470
Roger calls it a wind of peace

2274
01:52:25,471 --> 01:52:27,906
just kind of flowed over me,

2275
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:30,077
and I knew
it was time to accept it.

2276
01:52:32,077 --> 01:52:34,284
And accept that he was leaving.

2277
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:40,288
And so...

2278
01:52:42,288 --> 01:52:47,358
I put on Dave Brubeck
music in the room.

2279
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:49,260
And I had everyone
just settle down.

2280
01:52:49,261 --> 01:52:52,163
<i>( Dave Brubeck's
"Take Five" playing )</i>

2281
01:52:52,164 --> 01:52:55,900
I was sitting next to his bed,

2282
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:59,270
holding his left hand,

2283
01:52:59,271 --> 01:53:01,306
and other people held my hand,

2284
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:04,279
and gathered and formed a circle
around and held hands.

2285
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:11,282
Until the doctor

2286
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:15,420
said that he was going
to call it,

2287
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:19,598
1:40 p.m.
as the time of death.

2288
01:53:25,598 --> 01:53:27,632
I have never seen anything

2289
01:53:27,633 --> 01:53:30,134
so beautiful

2290
01:53:30,135 --> 01:53:32,503
and so serene.

2291
01:53:32,504 --> 01:53:35,974
It became... it was
so peaceful in that room.

2292
01:53:35,975 --> 01:53:38,610
And he... everything just...

2293
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:41,045
everything just relaxed.

2294
01:53:41,046 --> 01:53:45,049
He looked young,
he looked happy,

2295
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:49,654
and those warm hands,
and you know...
