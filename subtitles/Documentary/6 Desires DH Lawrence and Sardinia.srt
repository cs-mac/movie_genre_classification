
1
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,812
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,097
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,976
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,064
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,235
But did he really deserve...

6
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,735
...a place in here?

7
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:28,582
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about colonel Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,796
What, more words?

9
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,501
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,383
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,390
Yes, sir, but about
colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:45,967
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:52,230
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about colonel Lawrence as anybody does.

14
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,193
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:58,065
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:02,692
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:03,982
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:08,910
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,032
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,497
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:17,915
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:20,413
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?

23
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,666
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:25,375
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:27,260
- Knew him? ...
- I never knew him.

26
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:30,928
...He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,276
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:55,819
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,109
That's right.

30
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,577
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,656
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:07,286
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

33
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:12,503
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:15,209
- Here you are, Tosh.
- Thanks.

35
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:20,430
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:24,216
- Is it there?
- Of course.

37
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,054
Headlines.

38
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:29,811
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,817
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,436
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:43,362
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,950
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

43
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:50,451
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

44
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,789
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,800
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,883
And you're balmy!

47
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,976
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,061
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:29,357
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,568
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,110
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,077
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

53
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,497
Lawrence.

54
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:49,494
Yes?

55
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,547
You're supposed to be...

56
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,331
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,250
Always.

58
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,676
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,337
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,466
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:07,224
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,886
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,600
Where are you going?

64
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,353
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,404
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,024
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,692
Sorry.

68
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:29,488
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,955
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,707
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:40,211
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss.

72
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:43,834
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:45,587
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,753
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:51,096
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,843
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:56,178
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,181
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,065
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,394
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,520
...giving military advice.

82
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,689
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:15,693
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to...

84
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:16,741
To what?

85
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,450
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:23,744
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,787
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,370
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,500
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,083
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:36,672
We don't know that.

92
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:41,382
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:46,054
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,686
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,726
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:55,390
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,231
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,109
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,527
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:10,245
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:15,408
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,332
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,252
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

104
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:24,379
Good morning, sir.

105
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,045
Salute.

106
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:31,589
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,592
- It's my manner.
- Your what?

108
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,720
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:40,928
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:44,190
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

111
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:47,811
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,731
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,396
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:57,535
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:59,951
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

116
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:03,788
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,284
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,671
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:16,090
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,471
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,179
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:26,518
Yes, what is it?

123
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:29,474
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,722
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,974
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,986
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:44,280
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:48,697
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,527
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,876
- Two months, then.
- Three.

131
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:59,462
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,338
Thank you, sir.

133
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:07,168
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

134
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:09,301
Shut up and get out.

135
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:16,768
Sir?

136
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,648
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,566
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,321
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

139
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,446
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:39,411
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,490
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,746
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:49,702
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:52,459
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:57,009
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:01,799
That's new.

147
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:04,725
Where are they now?

148
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,851
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:09,556
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:13,478
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,690
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,150
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,904
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.

154
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:27,443
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:31,403
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:38,542
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,274
Here you may drink.

158
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:01,268
One cup.

159
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,656
You do not drink?

160
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,320
No.

161
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,451
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:17,456
I am Bedu.

163
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:22,063
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,690
Yes.

165
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,977
From Cairo?

166
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,860
Yes.

167
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:31,605
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

168
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:35,772
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:37,862
And before?

170
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,990
From Britain?

171
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,664
Yes.

172
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,374
Truly?

173
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,286
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:50,795
Is that a desert country?

175
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:56,126
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:58,923
You are not fat?

177
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:00,800
No.

178
00:22:02,348 --> 00:22:03,925
I'm different.

179
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,331
Here...

180
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:35,618
...take it.

181
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:39,910
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,665
Take it now.

183
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:01,895
Bedu food.

184
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:18,577
Good.

185
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,026
More?

186
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:11,117
- Bedu.
- Where?

187
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,676
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,131
Yes, I know.

189
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,259
- I am not Harith.
- No.

190
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,140
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:20,795
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,632
When you are ready to go...

193
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,973
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:47,279
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:07,833
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:11,669
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,092
Now!

198
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,386
Good?

199
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,475
It's all right.

200
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,815
This is a Harith well.

201
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,727
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,723
Turks?

203
00:29:12,204 --> 00:29:13,319
Bedu.

204
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:30,618
Who is he?
Tafas
(Zia Mohyeddin Actor from Pakistan)

205
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,867
He is dead.

206
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,744
Yes.

207
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:01,123
Why?

208
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:05,416
This my well.

209
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,674
I have drunk from it.

210
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,378
You are welcome.

211
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,418
He was my friend.

212
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:17,516
- That?
- Yes, that.

213
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,858
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

214
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:48,787
His?

215
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:50,663
Mine.

216
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,163
Then I will use it.

217
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,294
Your friend...

218
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,554
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,219
I know.

220
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,055
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,694
I have heard of you.

222
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,065
So...

223
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,282
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:32,986
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:36,947
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

226
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,909
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,244
I can both read and write.

228
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,958
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,053
What is your name?

230
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,594
My name is for my friends.

231
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,144
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,100
You are angry, English.

233
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,700
He was nothing.

234
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:21,785
The well is everything.

235
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,746
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,623
He knew that.

237
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,158
Salaam.

238
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:34,372
Sherif Ali.

239
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:37,840
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:40,582
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:42,219
...a silly people.

242
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:46,932
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:02,100
Come.

244
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,732
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:07,023
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:10,568
Wadi Safra is another day from here.

247
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,953
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:18,074
I will find it with this.

249
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,708
Good army compass.

250
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,210
How if I take it?

251
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:32,923
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:35,472
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,928
My fear is my concern.

254
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,810
Truly.

255
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:46,853
God be with you, English.

256
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:38,271
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

257
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,392
You can hear the girls declare

258
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:43,487
He must be a millionaire

259
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:07,921
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

260
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:27,897
Hey, you!

261
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,409
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

262
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,909
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

263
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,545
How did he know?

264
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,666
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

265
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,963
I'll give him that. No escort?

266
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,666
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

267
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,803
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

268
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,511
Bloody savages.

269
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:12,351
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

270
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:15,141
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

271
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:19,394
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

272
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:24,394
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

273
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:29,607
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

274
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:34,193
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

275
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:37,574
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

276
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:41,830
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

277
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:44,458
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

278
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,338
What I want to say is this:

279
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,211
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

280
00:37:49,426 --> 00:37:51,299
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

281
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:55,258
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

282
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:59,421
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.

283
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:02,559
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to...

284
00:38:05,105 --> 00:38:06,932
Oh, my God.

285
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:09,440
Not again.

286
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,466
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

287
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,885
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

288
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:50,305
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

289
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:20,247
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

290
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,791
Fire back at them.

291
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,935
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

292
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:43,854
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

293
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:47,362
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

294
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:49,987
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

295
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:53,112
You were right and I was wrong.

296
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,446
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

297
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,955
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.

298
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,708
They can hardly come with us.

299
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,253
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

300
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,328
Lawrence.

301
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,997
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

302
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:15,293
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

303
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:19,796
First the guns, and now this.

304
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:15,676
Cigarette?

305
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:17,355
I'm sorry.

306
00:42:28,073 --> 00:42:29,982
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

307
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:32,237
Umph off.

308
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,912
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

309
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:54,757
Hold it, Jenkins!

310
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,510
Jenkins!

311
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:11,566
Lawrence?

312
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:15,320
You have no servant.

313
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,062
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

314
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:22,023
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

315
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,277
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

316
00:43:24,537 --> 00:43:27,621
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

317
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:55,137
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

318
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:59,060
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

319
00:43:59,983 --> 00:44:05,356
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

320
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:10,908
Others do battle in His cause.

321
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,488
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

322
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,914
And observe the prayers.

323
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:25,545
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

324
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:30,580
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

325
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:36,425
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...

326
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,091
Greetings, Ali.

327
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:40,098
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

328
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,561
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

329
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:47,264
Yes, my lord.

330
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:52,063
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

331
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:54,601
"By the noonday brightness...

332
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,985
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

333
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,646
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

334
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,315
...neither hath He been displeased.

335
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:06,870
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

336
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:10,621
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

337
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,122
...and thou be satisfied."

338
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,462
So?

339
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:19,621
Yes, colonel.

340
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,750
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

341
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:26,680
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

342
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,802
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

343
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,016
You could supply us through Aqaba!

344
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:35,013
Aqaba!

345
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:38,482
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

346
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,682
- But you can't!
- You could.

347
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,771
You mean, the navy?

348
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,986
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

349
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,232
Can you imagine what that means?

350
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:52,199
Yes, I can imagine.

351
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,621
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

352
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,368
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

353
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,789
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

354
00:46:04,003 --> 00:46:05,829
You can see that, sir, surely.

355
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:09,000
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

356
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:11,255
It is of little consequence to us.

357
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,798
I must ask you not to speak like that.

358
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:16,674
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

359
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:19,716
Possibly.

360
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,639
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.

361
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:26,515
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

362
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,936
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

363
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,060
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

364
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,188
No. Guns. Artillery.

365
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:38,695
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

366
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:41,991
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

367
00:46:42,243 --> 00:46:45,907
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

368
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:47,822
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

369
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:52,160
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

370
00:46:53,836 --> 00:46:57,963
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

371
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:04,635
I think it is far from Damascus.

372
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:08,255
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

373
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:11,468
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

374
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:13,470
Yes, my lord.

375
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,144
It is beautiful, is it not?

376
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:18,104
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

377
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:22,436
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

378
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:27,734
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

379
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,277
Small population compared with some.

380
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:33,657
It's small, but it's great. And why?

381
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,745
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

382
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:41,159
Because it has a navy, because of this,
the English go where they please...

383
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,990
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

384
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,370
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

385
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,871
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

386
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,207
But I would like to hear his opinion.

387
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:53,881
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

388
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:57,551
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

389
00:47:57,806 --> 00:48:03,047
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

390
00:48:04,186 --> 00:48:07,850
My lord, I think...

391
00:48:08,773 --> 00:48:10,979
I think your book is right.

392
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:15,687
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

393
00:48:15,946 --> 00:48:19,646
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.

394
00:48:19,907 --> 00:48:22,149
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

395
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:25,326
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

396
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:27,701
And this is the way you should
fight now.

397
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:29,533
I don't know.

398
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,032
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

399
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:36,961
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

400
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:39,371
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.

401
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,671
No, colonel.

402
00:48:41,925 --> 00:48:45,175
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

403
00:48:45,428 --> 00:48:48,512
They must say their say.

404
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,634
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

405
00:48:54,853 --> 00:48:57,390
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

406
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:00,184
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

407
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:04,143
You tread heavily...

408
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:07,905
...but you speak the truth.

409
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:13,030
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

410
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,201
...it is late.

411
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:36,463
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?

412
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:38,594
In effect, my lord, yes.

413
00:49:38,848 --> 00:49:40,840
And I must do it...

414
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:45,223
...because the Turks have
European guns.

415
00:49:45,478 --> 00:49:48,147
But I fear to do it...

416
00:49:49,023 --> 00:49:51,264
...upon my soul I do.

417
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:57,362
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

418
00:49:57,613 --> 00:50:00,779
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

419
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:02,942
Then you must deny it to them.

420
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:06,783
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?

421
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,330
To England and to other things.

422
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:13,197
To England and Arabia both?

423
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,251
And is that possible?

424
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:26,219
I think you are another of these
desert-loving English.

425
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,593
Doughty, Stanhope...

426
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:31,506
...Gordon of Khartoum.

427
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:34,013
No Arab loves the desert.

428
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:39,226
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

429
00:50:40,315 --> 00:50:42,771
And no man needs nothing.

430
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:49,479
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

431
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,322
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

432
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:57,787
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

433
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,365
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

434
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,080
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

435
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:06,043
...when London was a village.

436
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,082
Yes, you were great.

437
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,462
Nine centuries ago.

438
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:13,875
Time to be great again, my lord.

439
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:17,385
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

440
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:21,386
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

441
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:24,884
But my father is old...

442
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,603
...and I...

443
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:33,021
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

444
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:37,814
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

445
00:51:39,156 --> 00:51:43,023
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

446
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:44,315
...or...

447
00:51:44,577 --> 00:51:45,952
Or?

448
00:51:46,454 --> 00:51:50,118
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

449
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,829
We need a miracle.

450
00:54:58,071 --> 00:54:59,102
Aqaba.

451
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:04,027
Aqaba.

452
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,493
From the land.

453
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:09,245
You are mad.

454
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:14,034
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

455
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:15,496
That's right.

456
00:55:15,794 --> 00:55:18,000
The Nefud cannot be crossed.

457
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:20,086
I'll cross it if you will.

458
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:24,461
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

459
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:27,505
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.

460
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:31,759
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

461
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:33,677
Fifty men?

462
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:36,472
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

463
00:55:36,728 --> 00:55:39,100
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...

464
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:42,391
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

465
00:55:43,192 --> 00:55:45,517
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

466
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:48,855
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

467
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,355
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...

468
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:55,735
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

469
00:55:55,994 --> 00:56:00,122
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

470
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:04,079
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

471
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:09,328
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

472
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:12,210
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

473
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:17,628
Aqaba's over there.

474
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,429
It's only a matter of going.

475
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,884
You are mad.

476
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:35,562
And where are you going, lieutenant?

477
00:56:36,903 --> 00:56:38,942
With 50 of my men.

478
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:41,776
To work your miracle.

479
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:46,409
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

480
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,693
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

481
00:56:49,914 --> 00:56:51,622
Why not you?

482
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,250
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

483
00:56:56,503 --> 00:56:58,744
Yes, I must.

484
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:02,041
But I will spare these to you.

485
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:07,051
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

486
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,628
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

487
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:15,048
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

488
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,341
No.

489
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:30,188
Since you do know...

490
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:34,232
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

491
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,909
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

492
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,872
But in whose name do you ride?

493
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:13,076
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

494
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,539
They were here. I caught them.

495
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,668
Why are you here? Boy!

496
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:20,788
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

497
01:00:21,048 --> 01:00:23,668
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

498
01:00:23,925 --> 01:00:25,751
You have been tracking us.

499
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,668
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

500
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,968
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

501
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:34,140
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

502
01:00:34,392 --> 01:00:37,013
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

503
01:00:37,228 --> 01:00:38,508
Don't do that.

504
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:43,687
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

505
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:47,021
Be warned. They are not suitable.

506
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:51,019
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

507
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:56,072
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

508
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:02,908
One shilling, every week?

509
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,743
That is fair.

510
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:06,740
- Each?
- No.

511
01:01:07,002 --> 01:01:08,580
- That is too much.
- All right.

512
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:21,382
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

513
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,067
There is the railway.

514
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,856
And that is the desert.

515
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:46,023
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

516
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:49,528
For the camels, no water at all.

517
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,286
If the camels die...

518
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:54,999
...we die.

519
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:58,753
And in 20 days they will start to die.

520
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:07,508
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

521
01:04:39,554 --> 01:04:41,261
I was thinking.

522
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:43,221
You were drifting.

523
01:04:45,183 --> 01:04:48,848
Yes. It will not happen again.

524
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:52,810
Be warned, you were drifting.

525
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:55,521
It will not happen again.

526
01:05:57,619 --> 01:05:59,527
That water is wasted.

527
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,246
From now on,
we must travel by night...

528
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:10,419
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

529
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:13,078
A few hours each day.

530
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:16,833
Why don't we start now?

531
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:19,756
No. We will rest now.

532
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:22,711
Three hours.

533
01:06:22,973 --> 01:06:24,348
Fine.

534
01:06:24,975 --> 01:06:26,433
I'll wake you.

535
01:08:44,924 --> 01:08:46,466
Do we rest here?

536
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:49,883
There is no rest now short of water.

537
01:08:50,178 --> 01:08:52,171
The other side of that.

538
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:55,512
And how much of that is there?

539
01:08:55,808 --> 01:08:57,385
I'm not sure.

540
01:08:58,519 --> 01:09:02,812
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

541
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,146
This is the sun's anvil.

542
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,013
Have we done it?

543
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:43,347
No, but we're off the anvil.

544
01:10:44,231 --> 01:10:45,809
Thank God for that anyway.

545
01:10:46,025 --> 01:10:47,898
Yes, thank Him.

546
01:10:48,193 --> 01:10:51,775
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

547
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,310
I know.

548
01:10:56,658 --> 01:10:58,152
We've done it.

549
01:10:58,410 --> 01:10:59,987
God willing.

550
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:04,161
When do we reach the wells?

551
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:07,706
God willing, midday.

552
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,578
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

553
01:11:15,299 --> 01:11:16,876
Gasim's.

554
01:11:20,804 --> 01:11:22,511
What's happened to him?

555
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:24,800
God knows.

556
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:28,342
Why don't you stop?

557
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:32,309
For what? He will be dead by midday.

558
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:39,400
We must go back.

559
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:42,523
What for, to die with Gasim?

560
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:46,064
In one hour comes the sun.

561
01:11:47,576 --> 01:11:52,237
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

562
01:11:52,496 --> 01:11:53,777
I can.

563
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,283
Take the boys.

564
01:12:02,171 --> 01:12:04,626
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

565
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,128
Gasim you have killed already.

566
01:12:07,634 --> 01:12:08,962
Get out of my way.

567
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:13,169
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

568
01:12:13,389 --> 01:12:14,717
Nothing is written!

569
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:19,261
Go back, then!

570
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,971
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

571
01:12:24,023 --> 01:12:25,896
English blasphemer!

572
01:12:26,983 --> 01:12:28,608
Aqaba?

573
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,901
Was it Aqaba?

574
01:12:31,737 --> 01:12:34,442
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

575
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:38,116
Go back, blasphemer...

576
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,658
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

577
01:12:41,078 --> 01:12:42,786
I shall be at Aqaba.

578
01:12:43,038 --> 01:12:45,078
That is written.

579
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:46,946
In here.

580
01:12:56,842 --> 01:12:58,633
English!

581
01:12:58,843 --> 01:13:00,503
English!

582
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:36,463
Lawrence! Daud!

583
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:46,986
Nothing is written.

584
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:20,761
Al Lawrence.

585
01:22:25,188 --> 01:22:26,599
Farraj.

586
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:28,895
Wash.

587
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:07,805
Al Lawrence.

588
01:23:08,266 --> 01:23:12,891
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

589
01:23:17,523 --> 01:23:20,524
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

590
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:23,480
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.

591
01:23:25,488 --> 01:23:28,109
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

592
01:23:34,454 --> 01:23:37,205
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

593
01:23:37,457 --> 01:23:40,208
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

594
01:23:40,584 --> 01:23:43,336
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

595
01:23:43,545 --> 01:23:44,790
No.

596
01:23:46,965 --> 01:23:48,708
You have an elder brother.

597
01:23:50,301 --> 01:23:55,425
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:23:56,973 --> 01:23:58,882
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:02,094
I see.

600
01:24:02,603 --> 01:24:03,978
I'm sorry.

601
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:09,852
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:24:12,402 --> 01:24:14,940
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:24:16,281 --> 01:24:17,988
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:25,031
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

605
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:57,765
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:12,158
Very fine.

607
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,248
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:25:18,499 --> 01:25:20,906
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

609
01:25:26,089 --> 01:25:31,129
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:42,426
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:27:34,528 --> 01:27:36,188
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:27:37,573 --> 01:27:39,150
As you see.

613
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,481
Are you alone?

614
01:27:41,951 --> 01:27:43,529
Almost.

615
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:54,623
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:27:54,879 --> 01:27:56,254
Yours?

617
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:01,674
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:28:03,427 --> 01:28:06,262
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,888
Other? What other?

620
01:28:09,224 --> 01:28:13,435
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,103
He must be a great hero.

622
01:28:19,357 --> 01:28:21,065
He is.

623
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:24,442
He wouldn't refuse water to men coming
out of Nefud Desert.

624
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,896
Now, would he not?

625
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:32,325
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:36,696
Here is my help.

627
01:29:02,393 --> 01:29:05,062
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:10,061
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

629
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:12,020
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:29:12,985 --> 01:29:14,479
And is he Harith?

631
01:29:14,737 --> 01:29:16,943
No, Father, English.

632
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:21,533
Son...

633
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:24,444
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:27,162
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:29:27,956 --> 01:29:29,035
Tell them.

636
01:30:38,973 --> 01:30:40,633
- Empty that!
- Do not!

637
01:30:42,893 --> 01:30:45,099
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:30:45,854 --> 01:30:47,893
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:31:04,077 --> 01:31:05,358
Harith.

640
01:31:06,288 --> 01:31:07,450
Ali.

641
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:10,370
Does your father still steal?

642
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:13,699
No.

643
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:18,290
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:22,673
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:25,924
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:31:26,388 --> 01:31:29,305
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

647
01:31:29,849 --> 01:31:32,256
I knew your father well.

648
01:31:32,726 --> 01:31:34,553
Did you know your own?

649
01:31:37,897 --> 01:31:42,642
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:31:43,152 --> 01:31:46,235
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:50,566
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:31:51,075 --> 01:31:54,159
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:31:57,288 --> 01:31:58,451
Call off your men.

654
01:32:04,044 --> 01:32:06,665
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:32:06,963 --> 01:32:09,086
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,586
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:32:13,844 --> 01:32:15,836
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:20,840
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:32:30,316 --> 01:32:33,482
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

660
01:32:33,735 --> 01:32:35,229
Is he your tongue?

661
01:32:35,945 --> 01:32:37,736
We do desire it.

662
01:32:40,908 --> 01:32:43,992
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:47,363
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:32:47,622 --> 01:32:52,330
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:32:53,126 --> 01:32:57,538
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks
to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:32:58,798 --> 01:33:00,042
But...

667
01:33:00,549 --> 01:33:01,829
...dine with me.

668
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:04,670
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:33:05,512 --> 01:33:08,002
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:33:08,806 --> 01:33:13,551
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:35:53,192 --> 01:35:56,857
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:35:57,237 --> 01:35:59,609
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:02,444
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:04,781
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:36:05,953 --> 01:36:09,653
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:12,702
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:15,871
But I...
I cannot serve.

678
01:36:16,754 --> 01:36:19,789
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:36:20,006 --> 01:36:22,046
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:36:27,054 --> 01:36:30,505
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:36:31,015 --> 01:36:32,047
No?

682
01:36:33,101 --> 01:36:35,769
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

683
01:36:36,353 --> 01:36:37,812
The Arabs?

684
01:36:38,605 --> 01:36:42,898
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:45,101
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:36:45,778 --> 01:36:47,272
But the Arabs?

687
01:36:47,696 --> 01:36:49,902
What tribe is that?

688
01:36:51,574 --> 01:36:55,737
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:36:55,953 --> 01:36:57,992
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:36:58,205 --> 01:37:00,114
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:37:00,331 --> 01:37:02,656
Who work only for profit.

692
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,535
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:07,373
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:37:07,587 --> 01:37:08,750
Serve?

695
01:37:09,172 --> 01:37:10,251
I serve?

696
01:37:10,465 --> 01:37:13,134
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:20,138
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:37:20,431 --> 01:37:22,223
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

699
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:25,599
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

700
01:37:30,231 --> 01:37:34,359
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:37:34,818 --> 01:37:38,317
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:42,693
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:37:42,908 --> 01:37:47,036
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:37:47,245 --> 01:37:51,408
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:38:00,131 --> 01:38:01,294
Is that service?

706
01:38:01,841 --> 01:38:03,086
No.

707
01:38:09,848 --> 01:38:13,346
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:38:13,559 --> 01:38:16,263
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:38:16,478 --> 01:38:20,641
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:38:20,857 --> 01:38:24,605
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:38:24,818 --> 01:38:26,609
Why should they wish to?

712
01:38:28,822 --> 01:38:29,853
Now...

713
01:38:30,448 --> 01:38:34,659
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:37,110
...a servant's wages.

715
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:41,326
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:45,620
...100 golden guineas.

717
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:50,003
150, Auda.

718
01:38:50,214 --> 01:38:53,131
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

719
01:38:53,342 --> 01:38:55,630
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:38:55,844 --> 01:38:59,212
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:03,214
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

722
01:39:03,434 --> 01:39:05,426
In Aqaba.

723
01:39:06,686 --> 01:39:09,391
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

724
01:39:10,273 --> 01:39:13,143
You trouble me like women.

725
01:39:13,525 --> 01:39:16,692
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda won't come to Aqaba.

726
01:39:17,362 --> 01:39:18,476
- For money?
- No.

727
01:39:18,863 --> 01:39:20,026
- For Feisal?
- No!

728
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,275
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:39:24,076 --> 01:39:25,949
He will come...

730
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:29,195
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:34,830
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:39:36,253 --> 01:39:39,668
Make God your agent!

733
01:39:41,048 --> 01:39:43,206
Aqaba!

734
01:39:43,425 --> 01:39:45,085
Aqaba!

735
01:40:00,773 --> 01:40:02,765
God be with you.

736
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:07,395
God be with you.

737
01:40:20,873 --> 01:40:23,410
God be with you.

738
01:40:23,834 --> 01:40:25,909
God be with you.

739
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,898
Yes.

740
01:43:23,191 --> 01:43:24,270
Aqaba.

741
01:43:25,902 --> 01:43:28,570
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,697
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

743
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:35,659
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:44:03,558 --> 01:44:06,309
He killed. He dies.

745
01:44:07,019 --> 01:44:09,225
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:44:11,898 --> 01:44:14,934
- One of our men murdered Auda's man.
- Why?

747
01:44:15,151 --> 01:44:18,187
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

748
01:44:18,654 --> 01:44:19,852
Ali!

749
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,107
It is an ancient wound.

750
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:25,277
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

751
01:44:29,746 --> 01:44:31,904
It is the law, Lawrence.

752
01:44:32,123 --> 01:44:34,412
The law says the man must die.

753
01:44:35,376 --> 01:44:38,412
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

754
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:40,701
Yes.

755
01:44:44,175 --> 01:44:45,752
Sherif Ali!

756
01:44:45,968 --> 01:44:48,921
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

757
01:44:49,346 --> 01:44:52,548
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

758
01:44:58,729 --> 01:45:01,350
Then I will execute the law.

759
01:45:02,357 --> 01:45:04,479
I have no tribe.

760
01:45:05,734 --> 01:45:08,023
And no one is offended.

761
01:45:20,455 --> 01:45:21,486
Gasim.

762
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:27,418
Did you do it?

763
01:45:54,358 --> 01:45:55,982
Well, Lawrence...

764
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:04,901
What ails the Englishman?

765
01:46:05,117 --> 01:46:08,568
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

766
01:46:08,787 --> 01:46:10,779
It was written, then.

767
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:13,615
Better to have left him.

768
01:46:17,294 --> 01:46:20,579
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

769
01:46:21,005 --> 01:46:23,294
Besides, it was necessary.

770
01:46:24,341 --> 01:46:26,583
You gave life and you took it.

771
01:46:27,135 --> 01:46:28,713
The writing is still yours.

772
01:47:05,876 --> 01:47:07,998
Auda Abu Tayi!

773
01:50:23,999 --> 01:50:26,205
The miracle is accomplished.

774
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:28,834
Garlands for the conqueror.

775
01:50:49,979 --> 01:50:53,145
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

776
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,648
I'm none of those things, Ali.

777
01:50:55,858 --> 01:50:58,527
- What, then?
- Don't know.

778
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:00,850
Thanks.

779
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:04,570
My God, I love this country.

780
01:51:06,242 --> 01:51:07,273
What!

781
01:51:08,327 --> 01:51:10,200
No gold in Aqaba!

782
01:51:11,538 --> 01:51:13,945
Auda, I found it!

783
01:51:23,173 --> 01:51:24,797
That's a pity.

784
01:51:28,344 --> 01:51:30,881
Ali, get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

785
01:51:31,096 --> 01:51:33,587
Tell Feisal to find boats,
any boats...

786
01:51:33,807 --> 01:51:36,973
...and bring the Arab army here
to Aqaba, quickly.

787
01:51:37,184 --> 01:51:38,347
And you?

788
01:51:39,144 --> 01:51:41,682
I'm going to tell the generals...

789
01:51:42,147 --> 01:51:43,973
...in Cairo.

790
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:46,515
Yes, cross Sinai.

791
01:51:46,776 --> 01:51:47,807
Come on!

792
01:51:48,152 --> 01:51:49,480
Sinai?

793
01:51:49,987 --> 01:51:51,267
Yes.

794
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:55,444
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

795
01:52:00,746 --> 01:52:04,873
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

796
01:52:05,124 --> 01:52:07,994
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

797
01:52:08,752 --> 01:52:10,032
I see.

798
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:13,795
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

799
01:52:14,007 --> 01:52:18,217
You'll wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity...

800
01:52:18,844 --> 01:52:21,085
...and then they will believe you.

801
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,802
You're an ignorant man.

802
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:45,282
Paper.

803
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,991
Paper!

804
01:52:50,745 --> 01:52:53,414
There is no gold in Aqaba.

805
01:52:54,499 --> 01:52:56,325
No gold.

806
01:52:57,751 --> 01:52:59,660
No great box!

807
01:53:03,881 --> 01:53:06,170
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?

808
01:53:06,759 --> 01:53:09,047
For my pleasure, as you said.

809
01:53:10,303 --> 01:53:12,794
But gold is honorable...

810
01:53:13,890 --> 01:53:16,559
...and Lawrence promised gold.

811
01:53:17,643 --> 01:53:18,805
Lawrence lied.

812
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:22,181
See, Auda.

813
01:53:24,857 --> 01:53:26,980
"The Crown of England...

814
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:30,517
...promises to pay...

815
01:53:31,529 --> 01:53:35,941
...5000 golden guineas...

816
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:41,158
...to Auda Abu Tayi."

817
01:53:42,288 --> 01:53:46,581
Signed in His Majesty's absence...

818
01:53:46,834 --> 01:53:48,244
...by...

819
01:53:49,961 --> 01:53:51,159
...me.

820
01:53:52,255 --> 01:53:54,377
In 10 days...

821
01:53:55,132 --> 01:53:57,208
...I'll be back with the gold.

822
01:53:58,343 --> 01:54:03,088
With gold, with guns, with everything.

823
01:54:04,181 --> 01:54:05,759
Ten days.

824
01:54:07,017 --> 01:54:08,677
You'll cross Sinai?

825
01:54:08,977 --> 01:54:10,352
Why not?

826
01:54:11,062 --> 01:54:12,805
Moses did.

827
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:17,647
And you will take the children?

828
01:54:18,902 --> 01:54:20,312
Moses did.

829
01:54:20,528 --> 01:54:22,236
Moses was a prophet...

830
01:54:22,738 --> 01:54:25,359
...and beloved of God.

831
01:54:30,662 --> 01:54:34,741
He said there was gold here.
He lied.

832
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:38,911
He is not perfect.

833
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:51,417
Lord, can we not rest?

834
01:54:51,637 --> 01:54:54,757
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

835
01:54:57,017 --> 01:54:58,725
Have you two slept in beds?

836
01:54:58,935 --> 01:55:00,180
Farraj?

837
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:02,050
Daud?

838
01:55:03,272 --> 01:55:04,980
With sheets?

839
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:10,351
Tomorrow the finest sheets
in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.

840
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,898
I promise.

841
01:55:12,154 --> 01:55:14,775
Then it shall be so, lord.

842
01:55:36,133 --> 01:55:37,508
Look!

843
01:55:44,264 --> 01:55:45,842
Pillar of fire.

844
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:51,052
No, lord. Dust.

845
01:56:40,645 --> 01:56:42,139
My compass.

846
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:45,261
No matter.

847
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:49,438
If we ride west,
we must strike the canal.

848
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,945
Due west.

849
01:57:12,588 --> 01:57:14,046
Come on!

850
01:57:47,492 --> 01:57:50,113
Lawrence!

851
01:58:02,838 --> 01:58:04,118
Farraj!

852
01:58:14,389 --> 01:58:17,259
Farraj, don't! Don't!

853
01:58:18,351 --> 01:58:19,726
Don't!

854
01:59:55,181 --> 01:59:56,379
Why do you walk?

855
01:59:59,143 --> 02:00:01,052
But why, lord?

856
02:00:12,362 --> 02:00:13,642
But why, lord?

857
02:00:13,863 --> 02:00:17,314
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

858
02:00:43,054 --> 02:00:45,545
Lawrence, look!

859
02:01:54,488 --> 02:01:56,528
It's all right, Farraj.

860
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:58,282
It's all right.

861
02:03:10,176 --> 02:03:12,085
Who are you?

862
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:16,884
Who are you?

863
02:03:52,295 --> 02:03:54,868
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

864
02:04:13,062 --> 02:04:14,639
You taking him in there?

865
02:04:15,772 --> 02:04:17,147
Yes.

866
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:39,041
Here!

867
02:04:41,002 --> 02:04:43,327
Here. You!

868
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,379
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

869
02:04:49,133 --> 02:04:50,627
We are thirsty.

870
02:04:52,428 --> 02:04:54,883
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

871
02:04:55,347 --> 02:04:58,431
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.

872
02:04:59,684 --> 02:05:01,972
You can't take him in there, sir.

873
02:05:05,605 --> 02:05:08,178
What do you think you look like?

874
02:05:26,873 --> 02:05:28,497
No, no. You must go.

875
02:05:28,708 --> 02:05:30,285
No, no. Go, effendi, go!

876
02:05:32,127 --> 02:05:34,914
Get out! You must get out! Get out!

877
02:05:36,548 --> 02:05:40,794
We want two large glasses of lemonade.

878
02:05:41,052 --> 02:05:44,883
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.

879
02:05:50,226 --> 02:05:54,093
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.

880
02:05:54,396 --> 02:05:58,014
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.

881
02:05:58,316 --> 02:06:01,020
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

882
02:06:01,694 --> 02:06:04,231
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.

883
02:06:06,364 --> 02:06:08,072
What's going on?

884
02:06:11,035 --> 02:06:14,948
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

885
02:06:16,289 --> 02:06:17,866
Explain yourself.

886
02:06:18,583 --> 02:06:20,326
We've taken Aqaba.

887
02:06:20,876 --> 02:06:23,545
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

888
02:06:23,795 --> 02:06:28,291
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.

889
02:06:29,008 --> 02:06:30,383
We have.

890
02:06:32,136 --> 02:06:34,009
He likes your lemonade.

891
02:06:34,346 --> 02:06:36,303
You mean the Turks have gone?

892
02:06:36,598 --> 02:06:39,515
No, they're still there
but they've no boots.

893
02:06:40,059 --> 02:06:44,138
Prisoners, sir. We took them
prisoners. The entire garrison.

894
02:06:44,646 --> 02:06:46,852
That's not true. We killed some.

895
02:06:47,106 --> 02:06:51,020
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.

896
02:06:52,361 --> 02:06:55,278
There's been a lot of killing
one way or another.

897
02:06:57,365 --> 02:07:00,864
Cross my heart and hope to die,
it's all perfectly true.

898
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:03,869
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

899
02:07:04,246 --> 02:07:06,037
I did it.

900
02:07:11,293 --> 02:07:12,953
You'd better talk to Allenby.

901
02:07:13,211 --> 02:07:15,998
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.

902
02:07:16,214 --> 02:07:18,502
That's a step in the right direction.

903
02:07:19,258 --> 02:07:22,009
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

904
02:07:22,302 --> 02:07:25,007
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

905
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:29,640
Right. You want a bed yourself,
don't you?

906
02:07:29,892 --> 02:07:31,884
See Allenby first, though.

907
02:07:32,561 --> 02:07:34,185
Will he see me?

908
02:07:34,979 --> 02:07:36,473
I think so.

909
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:38,767
Do that, then.

910
02:07:43,653 --> 02:07:46,274
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

911
02:07:46,489 --> 02:07:49,110
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

912
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:02,124
"Undisciplined.

913
02:08:04,004 --> 02:08:05,960
Unpunctual.

914
02:08:07,089 --> 02:08:09,046
Untidy.

915
02:08:10,884 --> 02:08:13,007
Several languages.

916
02:08:14,304 --> 02:08:16,296
Knowledge of music...

917
02:08:17,181 --> 02:08:18,924
...literature.

918
02:08:20,017 --> 02:08:21,974
Knowledge of...

919
02:08:23,353 --> 02:08:25,096
Knowledge of..."

920
02:08:28,357 --> 02:08:31,311
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

921
02:08:31,943 --> 02:08:35,063
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

922
02:08:35,363 --> 02:08:38,032
- Sir.
- Sir.

923
02:08:38,282 --> 02:08:39,610
Then why did you?

924
02:08:39,825 --> 02:08:42,316
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

925
02:08:42,536 --> 02:08:45,073
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

926
02:08:45,288 --> 02:08:49,451
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.

927
02:08:49,666 --> 02:08:54,244
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

928
02:08:54,837 --> 02:08:55,868
True.

929
02:08:56,088 --> 02:09:00,714
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

930
02:09:01,593 --> 02:09:03,965
Am I going for Jerusalem?

931
02:09:04,304 --> 02:09:05,501
Yes.

932
02:09:07,848 --> 02:09:09,259
Very well.

933
02:09:09,516 --> 02:09:11,758
Aqaba behind my right.

934
02:09:12,018 --> 02:09:14,888
It threatened EI' Arsh and Gaza.

935
02:09:16,355 --> 02:09:17,600
Anything else?

936
02:09:17,815 --> 02:09:19,060
Yes.

937
02:09:19,358 --> 02:09:21,765
Aqaba's linked with Medina.

938
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:25,354
Do you think we should shift them
out of Medina now?

939
02:09:25,613 --> 02:09:29,147
No. I think you should
leave them there.

940
02:09:29,366 --> 02:09:31,358
You acted without orders, you know.

941
02:09:32,077 --> 02:09:36,287
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

942
02:09:36,497 --> 02:09:38,869
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.

943
02:09:39,082 --> 02:09:41,407
Yes, I know.

944
02:09:41,668 --> 02:09:43,245
Already?

945
02:09:43,503 --> 02:09:44,701
Yes.

946
02:09:46,464 --> 02:09:49,085
I'm promoting you major.

947
02:09:50,092 --> 02:09:52,333
I don't think that's a very good idea.

948
02:09:52,552 --> 02:09:55,636
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...

949
02:09:55,846 --> 02:09:59,511
...and carry on the good work.

950
02:10:00,016 --> 02:10:02,851
No. Thank you, sir.

951
02:10:03,353 --> 02:10:07,302
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

952
02:10:07,523 --> 02:10:08,898
Let me see now...

953
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:14,309
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

954
02:10:14,529 --> 02:10:16,770
One was a boy.

955
02:10:16,989 --> 02:10:18,447
That was...

956
02:10:20,033 --> 02:10:21,907
...yesterday.

957
02:10:22,118 --> 02:10:24,157
I led him into a quicksand.

958
02:10:24,412 --> 02:10:26,071
The other was a man.

959
02:10:26,413 --> 02:10:28,322
That was...

960
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:30,995
...before Aqaba, anyway.

961
02:10:31,668 --> 02:10:34,337
I had to execute him with my pistol.

962
02:10:34,837 --> 02:10:37,921
There was something about it
I didn't like.

963
02:10:38,173 --> 02:10:41,292
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

964
02:10:43,553 --> 02:10:45,924
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.

965
02:10:46,138 --> 02:10:48,214
No. Something else.

966
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:51,474
What, then?

967
02:10:52,352 --> 02:10:54,723
I enjoyed it.

968
02:11:02,235 --> 02:11:05,769
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.

969
02:11:07,531 --> 02:11:11,148
What do you mean coming dressed
like that? Amateur theatricals?

970
02:11:11,367 --> 02:11:13,075
Yes. Entirely.

971
02:11:13,327 --> 02:11:16,447
Let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is.

972
02:11:16,747 --> 02:11:18,786
Fascinating gear they wear.

973
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,282
How would I look in this, Harry?

974
02:11:21,501 --> 02:11:25,000
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

975
02:11:25,879 --> 02:11:30,007
What I'm trying to say
is I don't think I'm fit for it.

976
02:11:30,216 --> 02:11:33,086
Really? What do you think, Dryden?

977
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:38,714
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said
it couldn't be done.

978
02:11:39,057 --> 02:11:42,057
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

979
02:11:43,227 --> 02:11:46,560
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

980
02:11:46,897 --> 02:11:49,814
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

981
02:11:50,024 --> 02:11:53,144
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.

982
02:11:54,695 --> 02:11:56,568
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

983
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:59,401
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.

984
02:12:03,452 --> 02:12:06,868
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

985
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:11,373
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.

986
02:12:11,584 --> 02:12:14,620
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

987
02:12:20,341 --> 02:12:21,919
Come on, then.

988
02:12:25,554 --> 02:12:27,345
You're a clever man, sir.

989
02:12:27,639 --> 02:12:31,257
No, but I know a good thing
when I see one.

990
02:12:31,517 --> 02:12:34,222
That's fair, surely?

991
02:12:54,745 --> 02:12:59,821
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.

992
02:13:00,083 --> 02:13:02,371
- Bravo.
- You know better?

993
02:13:21,934 --> 02:13:24,769
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

994
02:13:24,978 --> 02:13:27,386
We should do very well indeed,
shouldn't we?

995
02:14:03,969 --> 02:14:06,376
Easy, gentlemen, please.

996
02:14:07,597 --> 02:14:09,803
- Give us a drink.
- Of course, sir.

997
02:14:10,308 --> 02:14:13,890
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

998
02:14:14,686 --> 02:14:15,849
Tracy.

999
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:19,604
Shall we go outside?

1000
02:14:30,741 --> 02:14:34,026
So you hold bound the Turkish
desert army?

1001
02:14:34,286 --> 02:14:35,317
Yes.

1002
02:14:35,537 --> 02:14:37,862
With 1000 Arabs?

1003
02:14:38,956 --> 02:14:42,076
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.

1004
02:14:42,292 --> 02:14:44,285
Delivered anywhere, day or night.

1005
02:14:44,836 --> 02:14:46,496
It means 1000 camels.

1006
02:14:46,796 --> 02:14:51,042
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1007
02:14:51,592 --> 02:14:55,375
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.

1008
02:14:55,970 --> 02:14:57,879
I'll smash his railways.

1009
02:14:58,097 --> 02:15:00,635
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1010
02:15:00,891 --> 02:15:03,678
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.

1011
02:15:03,935 --> 02:15:06,307
You are going back, then?

1012
02:15:09,148 --> 02:15:10,393
Yes.

1013
02:15:10,774 --> 02:15:13,099
Of course I'm going back.

1014
02:15:17,447 --> 02:15:19,902
Well, if we can see it,
so can the Turk.

1015
02:15:20,157 --> 02:15:24,403
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits...

1016
02:15:24,619 --> 02:15:25,782
...he'll withdraw.

1017
02:15:25,995 --> 02:15:28,747
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1018
02:15:28,956 --> 02:15:31,494
If he gets out now,
he'll never get back again.

1019
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:34,241
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1020
02:15:34,878 --> 02:15:37,084
Arabia's for the Arabs now.

1021
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:45,418
That's what I've told them anyway.

1022
02:15:45,887 --> 02:15:47,713
That's what they think.

1023
02:15:48,181 --> 02:15:51,430
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1024
02:15:54,394 --> 02:15:56,682
They've only one suspicion.

1025
02:15:57,105 --> 02:16:01,481
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1026
02:16:01,733 --> 02:16:06,229
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1027
02:16:06,446 --> 02:16:07,477
Have we?

1028
02:16:08,030 --> 02:16:10,188
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1029
02:16:10,407 --> 02:16:13,527
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1030
02:16:14,494 --> 02:16:16,782
Difficult question, sir.

1031
02:16:18,789 --> 02:16:22,573
I want to know, sir,
if I can tell them in your name...

1032
02:16:22,793 --> 02:16:26,161
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.

1033
02:16:27,255 --> 02:16:28,749
Certainly.

1034
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:49,721
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.

1035
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:51,103
Right.

1036
02:16:51,358 --> 02:16:54,726
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1037
02:16:55,737 --> 02:16:59,105
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1038
02:16:59,323 --> 02:17:00,900
More money.

1039
02:17:01,199 --> 02:17:04,402
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.

1040
02:17:04,619 --> 02:17:07,323
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1041
02:17:07,538 --> 02:17:10,373
A couple of armoured cars.

1042
02:17:10,582 --> 02:17:11,957
Right.

1043
02:17:12,667 --> 02:17:14,245
Field artillery.

1044
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:17,796
Right.

1045
02:17:20,716 --> 02:17:23,004
I'll give you every
blessed thing I can...

1046
02:17:23,218 --> 02:17:26,135
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.

1047
02:17:26,345 --> 02:17:29,050
Thank you for your hospitality,
gentlemen.

1048
02:18:04,711 --> 02:18:06,584
Congratulations!

1049
02:18:16,887 --> 02:18:19,971
Are you really going to give them
artillery, sir?

1050
02:18:20,182 --> 02:18:22,008
I was wondering that, sir.

1051
02:18:22,225 --> 02:18:24,431
Might be difficult to get it back.

1052
02:18:24,685 --> 02:18:28,220
Give them artillery and you've made
them independent.

1053
02:18:28,439 --> 02:18:30,395
Then I can't give it to them, can I?

1054
02:18:30,649 --> 02:18:32,558
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.

1055
02:18:32,817 --> 02:18:35,568
I've got orders to obey, thank God.

1056
02:18:35,778 --> 02:18:37,735
Not like that poor devil.

1057
02:18:38,238 --> 02:18:39,816
He's riding the whirlwind.

1058
02:18:40,031 --> 02:18:42,237
Let's hope we're not.

1059
02:24:12,057 --> 02:24:15,260
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?

1060
02:24:15,810 --> 02:24:17,055
To Prince Feisal.

1061
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:20,056
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.

1062
02:24:20,314 --> 02:24:21,642
You know him though?

1063
02:24:21,857 --> 02:24:25,308
He is my master. I am his servant.

1064
02:24:28,529 --> 02:24:29,809
Can you read?

1065
02:24:38,496 --> 02:24:42,991
Chicago Courier is my paper,
but my work is syndicated in America.

1066
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:46,784
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.

1067
02:25:00,973 --> 02:25:02,135
Now...

1068
02:25:03,350 --> 02:25:07,299
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1069
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,642
Not altogether, sir, no.

1070
02:25:09,938 --> 02:25:14,267
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1071
02:25:14,484 --> 02:25:17,603
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1072
02:25:17,862 --> 02:25:19,024
I don't know.

1073
02:25:19,697 --> 02:25:22,365
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1074
02:25:22,616 --> 02:25:26,447
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1075
02:25:27,411 --> 02:25:29,984
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1076
02:25:30,581 --> 02:25:32,656
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.

1077
02:25:33,083 --> 02:25:35,656
In Mellaha now? They move fast.

1078
02:25:35,877 --> 02:25:37,157
They do.

1079
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:40,586
But not so fast as we do,
you will find.

1080
02:25:40,923 --> 02:25:42,381
Myself...

1081
02:25:43,008 --> 02:25:44,916
...I am going to Cairo.

1082
02:25:45,134 --> 02:25:47,127
- As you know.
- Yes.

1083
02:25:47,345 --> 02:25:49,835
There's work for me there
of a different kind.

1084
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:51,634
Yes.

1085
02:25:55,184 --> 02:25:57,556
I know you've been
given no artillery.

1086
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:00,558
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1087
02:26:00,772 --> 02:26:02,812
It restricts us to small things.

1088
02:26:03,024 --> 02:26:04,304
It's intended to.

1089
02:26:07,028 --> 02:26:08,652
Do you know General Allenby?

1090
02:26:09,655 --> 02:26:13,106
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1091
02:26:13,408 --> 02:26:16,112
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1092
02:26:16,369 --> 02:26:19,286
Slim customer. It's very good.

1093
02:26:19,538 --> 02:26:24,116
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.

1094
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:27,874
Your Highness, we Americans were
once a colonial people.

1095
02:26:28,087 --> 02:26:30,494
We naturally feel
sympathetic to any people...

1096
02:26:30,714 --> 02:26:32,920
...who struggle for their freedom.

1097
02:26:33,133 --> 02:26:35,339
Very gratifying.

1098
02:26:38,095 --> 02:26:42,424
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1099
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:44,929
I badly want a story to tell.

1100
02:26:45,184 --> 02:26:48,932
Ah, now you are talking turkey,
are you not?

1101
02:26:49,605 --> 02:26:52,475
I will give you a guide and a letter.

1102
02:26:52,690 --> 02:26:54,647
And before I leave here...

1103
02:26:54,901 --> 02:26:57,225
...which must be presently...

1104
02:26:57,444 --> 02:27:00,979
...I will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you.

1105
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:06,025
You know that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1106
02:27:06,243 --> 02:27:07,358
I do, sir.

1107
02:27:07,578 --> 02:27:10,531
Major Lawrence is in charge
of all this, is he?

1108
02:27:10,747 --> 02:27:13,238
My army is made up of tribes.

1109
02:27:13,458 --> 02:27:16,458
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1110
02:27:16,669 --> 02:27:19,835
Your people do think very highly
of Major Lawrence?

1111
02:27:20,046 --> 02:27:23,082
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1112
02:27:23,716 --> 02:27:27,049
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1113
02:27:27,886 --> 02:27:31,302
...the man who gives victory
in battle is prized...

1114
02:27:31,514 --> 02:27:34,135
...beyond every other man.

1115
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:37,970
One figure I can give you
from my head...

1116
02:27:38,187 --> 02:27:41,851
...because it never leaves my head.

1117
02:27:42,357 --> 02:27:46,401
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1118
02:27:47,361 --> 02:27:49,768
...37 wounded...

1119
02:27:52,323 --> 02:27:55,656
...156 dead.

1120
02:27:57,244 --> 02:28:02,036
You remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded.

1121
02:28:02,248 --> 02:28:03,528
Yeah.

1122
02:28:03,833 --> 02:28:05,243
Four times as many.

1123
02:28:05,459 --> 02:28:10,204
That's because those too badly wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1124
02:28:10,422 --> 02:28:12,912
We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1125
02:28:13,382 --> 02:28:17,047
- You mean...?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.

1126
02:28:17,553 --> 02:28:20,921
In their eyes, we are not
soldiers but rebels.

1127
02:28:21,139 --> 02:28:25,634
Rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code...

1128
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:27,760
...and are treated harshly.

1129
02:28:28,437 --> 02:28:29,551
How harshly?

1130
02:28:29,813 --> 02:28:32,730
More harshly than I hope
you can imagine.

1131
02:28:33,482 --> 02:28:34,514
I see.

1132
02:28:34,733 --> 02:28:37,936
Our own prisoners are taken care of
until the British...

1133
02:28:38,153 --> 02:28:41,984
...can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1134
02:28:42,198 --> 02:28:46,277
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1135
02:28:47,286 --> 02:28:49,907
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1136
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:51,740
Why should you suppose?

1137
02:28:51,956 --> 02:28:54,411
It's just that I heard
in Cairo that...

1138
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:57,080
...Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1139
02:28:57,294 --> 02:28:58,954
That is exactly so.

1140
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:02,669
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1141
02:29:03,007 --> 02:29:05,877
With me, it is merely good manners.

1142
02:29:06,093 --> 02:29:10,220
You may judge which motive
is the more reliable.

1143
02:29:10,847 --> 02:29:14,262
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1144
02:29:18,353 --> 02:29:20,013
Thank you, sir.

1145
02:29:20,230 --> 02:29:21,973
Can you manage the letter...?

1146
02:29:22,231 --> 02:29:25,101
I'll do everything I have said...

1147
02:29:25,317 --> 02:29:28,851
...if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest...

1148
02:29:29,112 --> 02:29:31,484
...in my people and Major Lawrence.

1149
02:29:33,407 --> 02:29:36,526
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1150
02:29:36,743 --> 02:29:39,281
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.

1151
02:29:39,579 --> 02:29:40,610
Oh, no.

1152
02:29:40,872 --> 02:29:44,655
But influential men back home believe
it's time for America...

1153
02:29:44,875 --> 02:29:47,626
...to lend her weight to
the struggle against Germany.

1154
02:29:47,836 --> 02:29:49,828
And Turkey.

1155
02:29:50,129 --> 02:29:54,423
I've been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is...

1156
02:29:54,967 --> 02:29:57,374
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.

1157
02:29:57,594 --> 02:30:00,630
But to show it in its
more adventurous aspects.

1158
02:30:00,847 --> 02:30:04,429
You look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1159
02:30:06,018 --> 02:30:07,844
All right. Yes.

1160
02:30:08,478 --> 02:30:10,102
Lawrence is your man.

1161
02:30:49,971 --> 02:30:51,002
Stop!

1162
02:31:10,404 --> 02:31:12,029
Stop it!

1163
02:31:12,823 --> 02:31:14,234
Stop it!

1164
02:31:22,414 --> 02:31:23,908
Come on, men!

1165
02:32:33,098 --> 02:32:34,378
Lawrence!

1166
02:32:55,116 --> 02:32:57,109
Good God! God!

1167
02:33:43,448 --> 02:33:48,240
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed
with a sword before.

1168
02:33:48,536 --> 02:33:50,742
Why don't you take a picture?

1169
02:33:51,163 --> 02:33:52,408
Wish I had.

1170
02:33:56,667 --> 02:33:58,873
How is it with thee, Lawrence?

1171
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,119
Am I in this?

1172
02:34:03,131 --> 02:34:04,874
Did you take his picture?

1173
02:34:05,091 --> 02:34:06,371
Yeah.

1174
02:34:10,762 --> 02:34:14,925
You are using up your nine lives
very quickly.

1175
02:34:17,435 --> 02:34:19,474
Charming company you keep.

1176
02:34:19,728 --> 02:34:20,973
Auda?

1177
02:34:21,772 --> 02:34:26,812
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1178
02:34:27,193 --> 02:34:29,232
He thinks you're a kind of thief.

1179
02:34:29,486 --> 02:34:31,609
It's all right to take your picture?

1180
02:34:32,197 --> 02:34:33,691
- All right.
- Okay.

1181
02:34:33,907 --> 02:34:35,365
Just walk.

1182
02:35:35,583 --> 02:35:37,705
Major Lawrence!

1183
02:35:38,335 --> 02:35:41,039
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1184
02:35:49,052 --> 02:35:51,673
This looting has got to stop!

1185
02:35:51,930 --> 02:35:53,258
It is customary.

1186
02:35:53,514 --> 02:35:57,097
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.

1187
02:35:57,351 --> 02:35:59,592
I would not say that to Auda.

1188
02:36:00,103 --> 02:36:02,854
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1189
02:36:03,106 --> 02:36:05,857
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?

1190
02:36:06,775 --> 02:36:10,060
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.

1191
02:36:14,865 --> 02:36:18,993
Well, there's another lot you've
seen the last of.

1192
02:36:19,244 --> 02:36:20,868
They'll come back.

1193
02:36:21,704 --> 02:36:24,658
He says they'll come back.
Will they?

1194
02:36:24,915 --> 02:36:27,121
Not this year, Lawrence.

1195
02:36:27,835 --> 02:36:32,247
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you
think you'll have left? 200?

1196
02:36:32,505 --> 02:36:35,256
- Less.
- Well, then?

1197
02:36:35,633 --> 02:36:37,958
I said, they'll come back.

1198
02:36:38,677 --> 02:36:39,839
You badly hurt?

1199
02:36:41,387 --> 02:36:43,179
Not hurt at all.

1200
02:36:43,389 --> 02:36:47,552
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1201
02:37:03,281 --> 02:37:07,147
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.

1202
02:37:07,576 --> 02:37:11,110
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1203
02:37:11,829 --> 02:37:16,289
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1204
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:19,247
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1205
02:37:21,546 --> 02:37:22,826
Did I answer well?

1206
02:37:23,214 --> 02:37:27,377
You answered without saying anything.
That's politics.

1207
02:37:28,635 --> 02:37:30,343
You learn quickly.

1208
02:37:31,638 --> 02:37:33,844
I have a good teacher.

1209
02:37:36,433 --> 02:37:37,808
Yeah.

1210
02:37:45,566 --> 02:37:47,392
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1211
02:37:47,609 --> 02:37:52,436
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do...

1212
02:37:52,697 --> 02:37:55,733
...may I put two questions to you,
straight?

1213
02:37:55,991 --> 02:37:59,324
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight.

1214
02:37:59,577 --> 02:38:00,740
One.

1215
02:38:01,204 --> 02:38:05,117
What, in your opinion, do these people
hope to gain from this war?

1216
02:38:05,416 --> 02:38:07,823
They hope to gain their freedom.

1217
02:38:09,169 --> 02:38:10,200
Freedom.

1218
02:38:11,462 --> 02:38:14,297
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1219
02:38:14,548 --> 02:38:18,213
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.

1220
02:38:18,968 --> 02:38:21,174
I'm going to give it to them.

1221
02:38:22,847 --> 02:38:24,045
The second question?

1222
02:38:25,641 --> 02:38:28,677
Well, I was going to ask...

1223
02:38:29,185 --> 02:38:33,134
...what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert?

1224
02:38:35,149 --> 02:38:36,311
It's clean.

1225
02:38:40,028 --> 02:38:41,605
Well, now...

1226
02:38:42,446 --> 02:38:44,604
...that's a very illuminating answer.

1227
02:38:44,948 --> 02:38:46,608
May I...

1228
02:38:47,242 --> 02:38:49,733
...take one farewell picture?

1229
02:38:50,536 --> 02:38:53,620
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.

1230
02:38:53,872 --> 02:38:56,826
One clock for two lamps.

1231
02:38:57,334 --> 02:38:58,532
A fair bargain.

1232
02:38:58,793 --> 02:39:01,414
Fair? I robbed him.

1233
02:39:12,847 --> 02:39:14,340
Trash.

1234
02:39:15,474 --> 02:39:17,929
I must find something honorable.

1235
02:39:18,184 --> 02:39:19,762
Honorable?

1236
02:39:20,353 --> 02:39:24,136
The year is running out, Brighton.

1237
02:39:28,526 --> 02:39:31,527
I must find something honorable.

1238
02:42:03,029 --> 02:42:05,235
Now you may blow up my train.

1239
02:42:05,490 --> 02:42:07,198
And what will you do now?

1240
02:42:07,450 --> 02:42:11,992
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1241
02:42:12,788 --> 02:42:14,780
They will carry my toys too, see?

1242
02:42:15,165 --> 02:42:18,248
Major Lawrence will campaign
this winter.

1243
02:42:18,501 --> 02:42:21,869
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1244
02:42:22,087 --> 02:42:26,713
Of course. When Lawrence has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1245
02:42:26,966 --> 02:42:29,504
When you've got what you want,
you will go home.

1246
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,384
No, I shan't, Auda.

1247
02:42:32,179 --> 02:42:33,589
Then you are a fool.

1248
02:42:34,264 --> 02:42:37,264
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1249
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:40,556
Give thanks to God, Brighton...

1250
02:42:40,811 --> 02:42:43,895
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.

1251
02:42:45,148 --> 02:42:47,223
You are an impudent rascal.

1252
02:42:48,776 --> 02:42:53,069
I must go, Lawrence, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1253
02:43:03,496 --> 02:43:05,204
Like talking to a brick wall.

1254
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:16,549
So what will you do now?
What can you do?

1255
02:43:17,216 --> 02:43:18,924
I'll go north.

1256
02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:22,087
That's what Allenby wants.

1257
02:43:22,345 --> 02:43:26,425
Allenby wanted the Arab army
behind Deraa.

1258
02:43:26,682 --> 02:43:28,924
Then that's where I'll take it.

1259
02:43:29,935 --> 02:43:34,810
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1260
02:43:35,064 --> 02:43:36,227
Won't we?

1261
02:44:08,717 --> 02:44:09,748
Train, Farraj.

1262
02:44:10,802 --> 02:44:12,296
Yeah, Lawrence.

1263
02:44:41,536 --> 02:44:43,363
Hide yourself, my friend.

1264
02:44:52,587 --> 02:44:53,997
Detonator.

1265
02:45:07,516 --> 02:45:09,224
All right, fetch another.

1266
02:45:09,434 --> 02:45:13,182
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.

1267
02:45:18,650 --> 02:45:20,061
Farraj?

1268
02:45:30,327 --> 02:45:33,410
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1269
02:45:46,924 --> 02:45:48,168
He cannot ride.

1270
02:45:58,892 --> 02:46:01,762
If they take him alive, you know what
they'll do to him.

1271
02:46:14,155 --> 02:46:16,562
Daud will be angry with you.

1272
02:46:17,616 --> 02:46:19,489
Salute him for me.

1273
02:46:39,259 --> 02:46:40,966
What will you do now?

1274
02:46:42,386 --> 02:46:43,880
Go north.

1275
02:46:44,138 --> 02:46:45,548
With twenty?

1276
02:46:46,431 --> 02:46:48,887
What would you recommend me to do?

1277
02:46:50,643 --> 02:46:52,635
What would you recommend?

1278
02:46:57,607 --> 02:46:59,932
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.

1279
02:47:00,151 --> 02:47:02,025
He's lied, in fact.

1280
02:47:03,362 --> 02:47:07,062
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have
done anything he hasn't done.

1281
02:47:07,324 --> 02:47:09,945
Then there is an Arab north army.

1282
02:47:11,494 --> 02:47:15,989
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?

1283
02:47:16,373 --> 02:47:20,370
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1284
02:47:21,794 --> 02:47:24,332
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?

1285
02:47:25,672 --> 02:47:27,250
No.

1286
02:47:28,299 --> 02:47:32,047
He would if he could, I think.

1287
02:47:33,804 --> 02:47:37,255
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.

1288
02:47:37,974 --> 02:47:40,216
What matters is I believed it.

1289
02:47:40,476 --> 02:47:42,184
The Turks believe it.

1290
02:47:42,436 --> 02:47:45,805
They are offering 20,000 pounds
for him.

1291
02:47:47,774 --> 02:47:49,565
Good heavens.

1292
02:47:50,026 --> 02:47:53,726
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Well, he's a brave man...

1293
02:47:53,946 --> 02:47:58,322
Surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1294
02:47:59,534 --> 02:48:02,285
I wonder if they'd offer that much
for me.

1295
02:48:03,996 --> 02:48:08,123
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1296
02:48:08,374 --> 02:48:10,331
I wouldn't be surprised.

1297
02:48:10,585 --> 02:48:14,202
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1298
02:48:29,809 --> 02:48:32,382
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1299
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:36,186
One more failure and you will find
yourself alone.

1300
02:48:37,607 --> 02:48:41,106
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1301
02:48:41,360 --> 02:48:43,566
So say they love you.

1302
02:48:43,987 --> 02:48:46,478
The more reason to be thrifty
with them.

1303
02:48:46,698 --> 02:48:49,817
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1304
02:48:50,034 --> 02:48:52,192
They must move mountains,
walk on water.

1305
02:48:52,453 --> 02:48:55,655
That's right. That's right.

1306
02:48:56,289 --> 02:48:58,780
Who are you to know what can be done?

1307
02:48:59,250 --> 02:49:02,868
If we'd done what you thought could
be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.

1308
02:49:03,462 --> 02:49:07,922
Whatever I ask them to do can be done.
They know that if you don't.

1309
02:49:10,009 --> 02:49:12,962
Do you think I'm just anybody?

1310
02:49:13,470 --> 02:49:14,845
Do you?

1311
02:49:18,057 --> 02:49:21,390
My friends, who will walk on water
with me?

1312
02:49:24,855 --> 02:49:29,231
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1313
02:49:29,442 --> 02:49:31,517
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1314
02:49:31,777 --> 02:49:35,477
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1315
02:49:35,739 --> 02:49:37,612
I told the English generals...

1316
02:49:37,865 --> 02:49:41,483
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1317
02:49:41,952 --> 02:49:44,028
Or perhaps you are here...

1318
02:49:44,663 --> 02:49:46,620
...for the English generals.

1319
02:49:48,666 --> 02:49:50,326
Who says this?

1320
02:49:50,584 --> 02:49:51,959
Rumour.

1321
02:49:53,253 --> 02:49:55,744
That is not an argument.

1322
02:49:56,005 --> 02:49:58,211
Oh, argument.

1323
02:49:58,424 --> 02:50:01,793
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa...

1324
02:50:02,052 --> 02:50:04,459
...while the Arabs argue.

1325
02:50:06,389 --> 02:50:09,508
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1326
02:50:09,892 --> 02:50:13,675
Yes. If one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes.

1327
02:50:22,903 --> 02:50:24,148
It's madness.

1328
02:50:27,615 --> 02:50:29,406
What are you looking for?

1329
02:50:29,658 --> 02:50:32,114
Some way to announce myself.

1330
02:50:32,369 --> 02:50:34,278
Be patient with him, God.

1331
02:50:47,715 --> 02:50:51,961
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1332
02:50:52,177 --> 02:50:53,457
Halt!

1333
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:54,918
Walk on.

1334
02:50:55,138 --> 02:50:57,011
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1335
02:50:58,140 --> 02:51:00,346
You and you.

1336
02:52:41,476 --> 02:52:42,507
You.

1337
02:52:59,074 --> 02:53:01,066
You have blue eyes.

1338
02:53:01,993 --> 02:53:06,204
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1339
02:53:06,455 --> 02:53:09,705
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1340
02:53:10,625 --> 02:53:12,167
How old are you?

1341
02:53:12,418 --> 02:53:15,454
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1342
02:53:15,671 --> 02:53:17,545
I think.

1343
02:53:17,798 --> 02:53:22,340
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.

1344
02:53:23,594 --> 02:53:25,670
It's an interesting face.

1345
02:53:30,350 --> 02:53:32,757
I am surrounded by cattle.

1346
02:53:33,436 --> 02:53:37,136
He wouldn't know an interesting face
from a sow's belly.

1347
02:53:38,148 --> 02:53:42,145
I have been is Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1348
02:53:42,360 --> 02:53:46,737
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1349
02:53:46,947 --> 02:53:48,821
...isolated.

1350
02:53:50,700 --> 02:53:53,321
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about.

1351
02:53:53,578 --> 02:53:55,285
No, effendi.

1352
02:53:57,873 --> 02:53:59,248
Have you?

1353
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:01,745
No.

1354
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:04,287
That would be too...

1355
02:54:04,545 --> 02:54:06,122
...lucky.

1356
02:54:30,608 --> 02:54:32,399
Where did you get that?

1357
02:54:34,278 --> 02:54:38,441
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.

1358
02:54:40,533 --> 02:54:42,739
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1359
02:54:42,994 --> 02:54:44,903
Yes, you are a deserter.

1360
02:54:45,996 --> 02:54:48,238
But from which army?

1361
02:54:50,750 --> 02:54:53,038
Not that it matters at all.

1362
02:54:53,336 --> 02:54:55,707
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1363
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:09,137
Your skin is very fair.

1364
02:55:28,031 --> 02:55:29,311
Beat him.

1365
02:57:03,861 --> 02:57:05,236
To me!

1366
02:59:07,713 --> 02:59:09,291
Sleep.

1367
02:59:11,049 --> 02:59:12,627
Sleep.

1368
02:59:24,394 --> 02:59:25,769
Eat.

1369
02:59:31,608 --> 02:59:32,853
Eat.

1370
02:59:36,696 --> 02:59:39,530
You have a body, like other men.

1371
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:49,111
Good.

1372
02:59:50,249 --> 02:59:52,040
Then sleep.

1373
03:00:05,553 --> 03:00:06,833
Better?

1374
03:00:07,430 --> 03:00:10,181
Much better. You were right.

1375
03:00:10,432 --> 03:00:12,590
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?

1376
03:00:13,560 --> 03:00:15,599
Oh, I've learned all right.

1377
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:23,107
I'm going, Ali.

1378
03:00:24,194 --> 03:00:26,269
- Why?
- Why?

1379
03:00:27,571 --> 03:00:28,852
Heavens.

1380
03:00:29,114 --> 03:00:30,395
Why?

1381
03:00:31,324 --> 03:00:33,530
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.

1382
03:00:33,785 --> 03:00:35,824
And the end of the Arab revolt?

1383
03:00:36,078 --> 03:00:39,198
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.

1384
03:00:39,456 --> 03:00:42,492
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.

1385
03:00:42,751 --> 03:00:45,751
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.

1386
03:00:46,003 --> 03:00:47,912
You proved it.

1387
03:00:48,172 --> 03:00:50,330
Look, Ali. Look.

1388
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:54,374
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.

1389
03:00:55,178 --> 03:00:57,466
And there's nothing I can do about it.

1390
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:00,349
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.

1391
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,559
He can...

1392
03:01:03,768 --> 03:01:06,685
...but he can't want what he wants.

1393
03:01:07,605 --> 03:01:10,854
This is the stuff that decides what
he wants.

1394
03:01:13,651 --> 03:01:17,435
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.

1395
03:01:17,696 --> 03:01:21,610
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.

1396
03:01:21,866 --> 03:01:24,618
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1397
03:01:24,827 --> 03:01:28,361
Well, any man is what I am.

1398
03:01:29,373 --> 03:01:33,370
And I'm going back to Allenby to
ask him for a job...

1399
03:01:33,626 --> 03:01:35,665
...that any man can do.

1400
03:01:35,961 --> 03:01:37,870
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1401
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:40,834
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

1402
03:01:42,425 --> 03:01:45,876
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1403
03:01:47,638 --> 03:01:52,180
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just...

1404
03:01:52,433 --> 03:01:54,011
...ordinarily...

1405
03:01:54,685 --> 03:01:56,096
...happy.

1406
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:01,517
Can I take this?

1407
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:04,059
It is not clean.

1408
03:02:04,318 --> 03:02:07,354
No, but it's warm.

1409
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:09,024
And these...

1410
03:02:09,281 --> 03:02:13,194
...having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1411
03:02:14,702 --> 03:02:19,908
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1412
03:02:22,125 --> 03:02:24,331
And let me go back to mine.

1413
03:02:53,484 --> 03:02:56,568
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1414
03:03:02,450 --> 03:03:04,276
Mind if I join you?

1415
03:03:05,119 --> 03:03:06,779
Honoured, sir.

1416
03:03:09,122 --> 03:03:12,407
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1417
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,538
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1418
03:03:15,794 --> 03:03:18,036
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1419
03:03:18,296 --> 03:03:21,629
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1420
03:03:21,883 --> 03:03:24,290
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.

1421
03:03:24,510 --> 03:03:25,968
Jolly good.

1422
03:03:26,803 --> 03:03:30,753
Well, I have to go up there.

1423
03:03:31,766 --> 03:03:34,221
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.

1424
03:03:34,477 --> 03:03:36,184
Bloody wogs.

1425
03:03:37,604 --> 03:03:39,513
Yes, probably.

1426
03:03:40,231 --> 03:03:42,603
Jolly good about the squash court.

1427
03:03:45,361 --> 03:03:47,851
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?

1428
03:04:01,082 --> 03:04:02,244
Morning.

1429
03:04:02,541 --> 03:04:04,333
- Good morning.
- Good to be back.

1430
03:04:04,585 --> 03:04:07,669
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.

1431
03:04:10,923 --> 03:04:12,252
Hello.

1432
03:04:12,883 --> 03:04:16,003
Morning. You're to go right in.

1433
03:04:28,021 --> 03:04:29,266
Lawrence.

1434
03:04:31,274 --> 03:04:33,811
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1435
03:04:34,485 --> 03:04:35,516
Sir.

1436
03:04:41,657 --> 03:04:43,531
Well, general, I will leave you.

1437
03:04:43,784 --> 03:04:46,654
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make...

1438
03:04:46,953 --> 03:04:50,737
...about my people
and their weakness...

1439
03:04:50,998 --> 03:04:55,790
...and the need to keep them
in the British interest.

1440
03:04:58,296 --> 03:05:01,830
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.

1441
03:05:02,049 --> 03:05:04,088
I told you, no such treaty exists.

1442
03:05:04,343 --> 03:05:08,803
Yes, general, you have lied
most bravely, but not convincingly.

1443
03:05:09,013 --> 03:05:11,053
I know this treaty does exist.

1444
03:05:11,265 --> 03:05:12,296
Treaty, sir?

1445
03:05:15,394 --> 03:05:17,386
He does it better than you, general.

1446
03:05:17,645 --> 03:05:20,930
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1447
03:05:35,118 --> 03:05:36,743
You really don't know?

1448
03:05:39,038 --> 03:05:41,031
Then what the devil's this?

1449
03:05:42,082 --> 03:05:45,949
It's my request
for release from Arabia, sir.

1450
03:05:46,169 --> 03:05:50,036
Why? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1451
03:05:50,256 --> 03:05:51,370
No.

1452
03:05:52,383 --> 03:05:55,549
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1453
03:05:57,345 --> 03:05:58,756
Well, now...

1454
03:05:59,180 --> 03:06:02,216
Mr. Sykes is as English civil servant.

1455
03:06:02,474 --> 03:06:05,558
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1456
03:06:05,769 --> 03:06:09,980
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war...

1457
03:06:10,231 --> 03:06:13,599
...France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1458
03:06:13,859 --> 03:06:15,602
Including Arabia.

1459
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:19,940
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1460
03:06:20,156 --> 03:06:23,275
An agreement to that effect.

1461
03:06:23,909 --> 03:06:27,491
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1462
03:06:27,745 --> 03:06:30,497
And let's have
no displays of indignation.

1463
03:06:30,748 --> 03:06:33,867
You may not have known,
but you certainly had suspicions.

1464
03:06:34,376 --> 03:06:37,709
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1465
03:06:37,920 --> 03:06:42,380
And a man who tells lies, like me,
merely hides the truth.

1466
03:06:42,633 --> 03:06:47,341
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1467
03:06:47,929 --> 03:06:51,214
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.

1468
03:06:51,724 --> 03:06:54,131
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1469
03:06:55,602 --> 03:06:57,594
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1470
03:06:57,854 --> 03:07:00,179
That's my reason for resigning.

1471
03:07:01,482 --> 03:07:03,106
It's personal.

1472
03:07:03,317 --> 03:07:05,523
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1473
03:07:05,777 --> 03:07:08,861
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.

1474
03:07:09,113 --> 03:07:12,481
And as it happens,
a damned important one. Are you mad?

1475
03:07:12,741 --> 03:07:15,944
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1476
03:07:16,202 --> 03:07:17,482
That's my reason too.

1477
03:07:18,412 --> 03:07:23,453
Look, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month...

1478
03:07:23,667 --> 03:07:25,624
...and you are part of it.

1479
03:07:26,127 --> 03:07:29,792
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1480
03:07:30,047 --> 03:07:33,914
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1481
03:07:34,676 --> 03:07:36,715
What about your Arab friends?

1482
03:07:36,928 --> 03:07:40,759
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1483
03:07:40,973 --> 03:07:43,179
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?

1484
03:07:43,391 --> 03:07:48,516
I've told you, I just want
my ration of common humanity.

1485
03:07:48,771 --> 03:07:51,688
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1486
03:07:54,401 --> 03:07:57,152
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.

1487
03:07:57,403 --> 03:07:59,526
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1488
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:01,488
Thank you, sir.

1489
03:08:02,574 --> 03:08:04,780
Why don't we...?

1490
03:08:07,370 --> 03:08:09,196
There's blood on your back.

1491
03:08:10,456 --> 03:08:13,575
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1492
03:08:14,751 --> 03:08:16,909
Tell me what happened.

1493
03:08:21,882 --> 03:08:24,004
Say, what goes on in there?

1494
03:08:24,801 --> 03:08:26,710
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1495
03:08:26,928 --> 03:08:30,378
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?

1496
03:08:30,597 --> 03:08:34,546
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1497
03:08:34,809 --> 03:08:38,676
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.

1498
03:08:38,938 --> 03:08:42,353
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.

1499
03:08:42,607 --> 03:08:45,312
When the war's over,
he can be anything he wants.

1500
03:08:45,568 --> 03:08:49,861
Yes. Well, at the moment
he wants to be somebody else.

1501
03:08:50,364 --> 03:08:53,198
Will you kindly allow me to pass?

1502
03:08:53,783 --> 03:08:56,238
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.

1503
03:08:56,494 --> 03:08:59,280
Always walking away, aren't you?

1504
03:08:59,538 --> 03:09:01,080
Well, I'll tell you.

1505
03:09:01,289 --> 03:09:04,243
It's a clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1506
03:09:04,459 --> 03:09:07,376
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...

1507
03:09:07,628 --> 03:09:10,379
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.

1508
03:09:11,214 --> 03:09:14,250
I believe your name will
be a household word...

1509
03:09:14,759 --> 03:09:18,423
...when you'd have to go to the
war museum to find who Allenby was.

1510
03:09:19,304 --> 03:09:22,175
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.

1511
03:09:22,807 --> 03:09:24,301
Leave me alone.

1512
03:09:24,559 --> 03:09:27,096
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1513
03:09:27,311 --> 03:09:29,884
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1514
03:09:30,147 --> 03:09:32,898
All right, I'm extraordinary.

1515
03:09:34,901 --> 03:09:35,980
What of it?

1516
03:09:36,360 --> 03:09:39,065
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1517
03:09:39,279 --> 03:09:42,399
It's a terrible thing
for a man to funk it if he has.

1518
03:09:42,615 --> 03:09:44,738
Are you speaking from experience?

1519
03:09:45,034 --> 03:09:46,197
No.

1520
03:09:46,577 --> 03:09:48,450
You're guessing, then.

1521
03:09:49,580 --> 03:09:50,955
Suppose you're wrong.

1522
03:09:51,206 --> 03:09:54,290
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1523
03:09:55,084 --> 03:09:58,038
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...

1524
03:10:00,630 --> 03:10:01,661
The 16th?

1525
03:10:02,007 --> 03:10:04,924
Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.

1526
03:10:05,218 --> 03:10:08,052
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1527
03:10:09,263 --> 03:10:12,216
They won't be coming for money,
not the best of them.

1528
03:10:12,515 --> 03:10:14,721
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1529
03:10:15,810 --> 03:10:17,849
Which I'm going to give them.

1530
03:10:18,562 --> 03:10:20,353
That's all I want.

1531
03:10:21,398 --> 03:10:24,315
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1532
03:10:24,525 --> 03:10:28,818
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1533
03:10:29,071 --> 03:10:32,237
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.

1534
03:10:32,490 --> 03:10:34,862
Tell the politicians
to burn their paper now.

1535
03:10:35,076 --> 03:10:36,404
Fair enough.

1536
03:10:36,911 --> 03:10:39,828
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?

1537
03:10:40,539 --> 03:10:42,447
It's going to happen.

1538
03:10:43,166 --> 03:10:45,241
I shall want quite a lot of money.

1539
03:10:45,960 --> 03:10:47,667
All there is.

1540
03:10:48,170 --> 03:10:49,747
Not that much.

1541
03:10:53,049 --> 03:10:55,800
The best of them won't come for money.

1542
03:10:57,803 --> 03:10:59,083
They'll come for me.

1543
03:11:17,569 --> 03:11:18,849
No pictures!

1544
03:11:19,112 --> 03:11:21,437
It's not for you, it's for Lawrence.

1545
03:11:21,698 --> 03:11:25,861
He doesn't mind having his picture
taken. He doesn't mind at all.

1546
03:11:26,076 --> 03:11:28,318
Well, there's only one Lawrence.

1547
03:11:32,790 --> 03:11:35,411
Have you met Lawrence
since he's come back?

1548
03:11:35,668 --> 03:11:36,699
Yes.

1549
03:11:36,919 --> 03:11:39,492
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1550
03:11:39,713 --> 03:11:42,583
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1551
03:11:47,386 --> 03:11:51,050
What did that Turkish general
do to him in Deraa?

1552
03:11:51,764 --> 03:11:56,509
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1553
03:11:58,228 --> 03:12:00,766
What did the English
do to him in Jerusalem?

1554
03:12:01,022 --> 03:12:02,730
Search me. Ask Lawrence.

1555
03:12:02,940 --> 03:12:04,849
- I did.
- What did he say?

1556
03:12:05,109 --> 03:12:06,686
He laughed.

1557
03:12:07,194 --> 03:12:09,815
He told me to gather the Harith here.

1558
03:12:10,405 --> 03:12:11,947
He offered me money.

1559
03:12:12,198 --> 03:12:13,775
Did you take it?

1560
03:12:14,575 --> 03:12:17,148
No. But many did.

1561
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:57,984
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1562
03:12:58,653 --> 03:13:01,322
There is not a man
without a price on his head.

1563
03:13:01,572 --> 03:13:05,190
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1564
03:13:05,450 --> 03:13:07,407
The sheiks will hang these men.

1565
03:13:07,661 --> 03:13:09,452
These men are mine.

1566
03:13:09,954 --> 03:13:14,283
Lawrence, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1567
03:13:14,625 --> 03:13:18,040
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1568
03:13:18,294 --> 03:13:21,248
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1569
03:13:21,505 --> 03:13:23,379
Aye, but for what?

1570
03:13:23,591 --> 03:13:25,797
Sherif, for Lawrence.

1571
03:13:28,887 --> 03:13:32,220
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1572
03:13:32,473 --> 03:13:35,224
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.

1573
03:13:35,475 --> 03:13:38,429
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!

1574
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:44,266
Damascus!

1575
03:13:44,525 --> 03:13:46,600
Damascus! Damascus!

1576
03:13:46,860 --> 03:13:49,896
Damascus! Damascus!

1577
03:14:23,765 --> 03:14:27,348
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1578
03:14:27,602 --> 03:14:31,220
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.

1579
03:14:31,439 --> 03:14:35,138
If the enemy's retreating in
any order, which we'll assume...

1580
03:14:35,358 --> 03:14:36,188
Certainly.

1581
03:14:36,401 --> 03:14:38,227
He can't be far from Mallud...

1582
03:14:38,903 --> 03:14:43,196
...in which case I can have him
within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1583
03:14:43,448 --> 03:14:45,441
Splendid. Philip.

1584
03:14:45,867 --> 03:14:48,536
These are the last infantry supports
going up now.

1585
03:14:48,786 --> 03:14:52,320
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1586
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:56,657
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1587
03:14:56,876 --> 03:14:57,907
Any questions?

1588
03:14:58,378 --> 03:15:02,457
This Arab army on the right, sir,
what's it consist of?

1589
03:15:02,965 --> 03:15:05,171
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.

1590
03:15:05,383 --> 03:15:07,257
Where are they now?

1591
03:15:07,969 --> 03:15:12,879
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.

1592
03:15:13,182 --> 03:15:15,470
Pound them, Charley.

1593
03:15:16,101 --> 03:15:17,476
Pound them.

1594
03:15:28,069 --> 03:15:30,856
God help the men who lie under that.

1595
03:15:31,113 --> 03:15:32,737
They're Turks.

1596
03:15:32,948 --> 03:15:34,608
God help them.

1597
03:16:17,318 --> 03:16:21,066
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1598
03:16:21,321 --> 03:16:22,352
Cocky?

1599
03:16:22,781 --> 03:16:24,607
More than cocky, sir.

1600
03:16:24,866 --> 03:16:28,199
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1601
03:16:28,452 --> 03:16:31,903
I tell you, sir, I think
he'll get to Damascus before we do.

1602
03:16:32,581 --> 03:16:34,407
- Unless...
- Unless?

1603
03:16:34,624 --> 03:16:38,491
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1604
03:16:38,753 --> 03:16:41,706
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1605
03:16:44,716 --> 03:16:46,922
I wonder where they are now.

1606
03:18:28,969 --> 03:18:30,131
No prisoners.

1607
03:18:33,640 --> 03:18:35,762
Damascus, Lawrence.

1608
03:18:45,650 --> 03:18:48,484
Lawrence, not this.

1609
03:18:49,194 --> 03:18:53,238
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.

1610
03:18:53,948 --> 03:18:55,572
No prisoners.

1611
03:19:05,666 --> 03:19:07,290
This was Talaal's village.

1612
03:19:11,504 --> 03:19:13,497
Talaal!

1613
03:19:23,514 --> 03:19:24,759
Talaal!

1614
03:19:33,815 --> 03:19:35,807
No prisoners!

1615
03:19:36,275 --> 03:19:37,354
No prisoners!

1616
03:19:49,244 --> 03:19:50,275
God.

1617
03:19:54,332 --> 03:19:55,411
God.

1618
03:19:57,543 --> 03:19:58,740
God!

1619
03:22:16,199 --> 03:22:19,365
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!

1620
03:23:56,741 --> 03:23:57,986
Major!

1621
03:23:58,618 --> 03:24:00,277
Major Lawrence!

1622
03:24:05,957 --> 03:24:07,581
Jesus wept.

1623
03:24:23,180 --> 03:24:24,425
Jesus wept.

1624
03:24:26,349 --> 03:24:28,388
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1625
03:24:29,018 --> 03:24:31,769
Surely you know
the Arabs are a barbarous people.

1626
03:24:32,020 --> 03:24:33,847
Barbarous and cruel.

1627
03:24:34,648 --> 03:24:36,556
Who but they?

1628
03:24:36,941 --> 03:24:38,269
Who but they?

1629
03:24:40,611 --> 03:24:43,018
Oh, you rotten man.

1630
03:24:44,072 --> 03:24:48,449
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1631
03:24:50,577 --> 03:24:52,653
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1632
03:25:19,143 --> 03:25:22,642
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.

1633
03:25:23,104 --> 03:25:24,764
Damascus!

1634
03:25:24,981 --> 03:25:26,854
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1635
03:25:27,108 --> 03:25:28,483
Tell him.

1636
03:25:29,485 --> 03:25:31,192
Remind him.

1637
03:25:32,070 --> 03:25:35,154
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.

1638
03:25:35,990 --> 03:25:38,279
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1639
03:25:39,576 --> 03:25:41,403
They are not ripe.

1640
03:25:47,333 --> 03:25:49,372
General salute!

1641
03:25:49,585 --> 03:25:51,826
Present arms!

1642
03:26:06,182 --> 03:26:08,055
Port arms!

1643
03:26:10,852 --> 03:26:12,726
Lawrence is behind it, sir.

1644
03:26:12,979 --> 03:26:15,814
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1645
03:26:22,153 --> 03:26:23,945
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1646
03:26:24,155 --> 03:26:26,029
They've been here a day and a night.

1647
03:26:26,282 --> 03:26:28,773
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.

1648
03:26:29,034 --> 03:26:32,901
He's set up his own headquarters
in the town hall.

1649
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:35,656
What else beside the town hall?

1650
03:26:35,915 --> 03:26:38,785
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse...

1651
03:26:39,043 --> 03:26:41,450
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1652
03:26:41,670 --> 03:26:44,587
They call themselves
the Arab National Council...

1653
03:26:44,797 --> 03:26:46,457
...and they're in the town hall.

1654
03:26:46,716 --> 03:26:49,586
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.

1655
03:26:51,303 --> 03:26:52,761
What should we do?

1656
03:26:53,012 --> 03:26:55,384
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.

1657
03:26:56,265 --> 03:26:58,139
How about that, Dryden?

1658
03:26:59,893 --> 03:27:02,644
Not unless you want
a full-scale rising.

1659
03:27:03,396 --> 03:27:06,432
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1660
03:27:06,649 --> 03:27:08,688
By special train in two days' time.

1661
03:27:08,942 --> 03:27:10,021
Two days.

1662
03:27:10,235 --> 03:27:13,817
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1663
03:27:14,072 --> 03:27:16,111
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1664
03:27:16,323 --> 03:27:19,739
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.

1665
03:27:19,993 --> 03:27:23,611
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1666
03:27:23,871 --> 03:27:28,165
And Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1667
03:27:28,542 --> 03:27:30,166
Does that apply to technical units?

1668
03:27:30,418 --> 03:27:32,541
Technical units particularly.

1669
03:27:32,795 --> 03:27:34,040
Yes, sir.

1670
03:27:34,714 --> 03:27:36,124
Medicals too, sir?

1671
03:27:36,382 --> 03:27:38,588
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1672
03:27:38,926 --> 03:27:40,669
Medicals too.

1673
03:28:21,002 --> 03:28:22,579
We here...

1674
03:28:22,795 --> 03:28:25,665
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...

1675
03:28:25,881 --> 03:28:29,047
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...

1676
03:28:29,342 --> 03:28:32,793
...of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1677
03:28:33,054 --> 03:28:35,093
He insulted me.

1678
03:28:36,223 --> 03:28:40,303
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat...

1679
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:43,395
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.

1680
03:28:43,854 --> 03:28:47,602
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1681
03:28:47,816 --> 03:28:51,350
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1682
03:28:53,821 --> 03:28:56,146
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1683
03:28:57,074 --> 03:29:00,525
You speak to me of bloodshed?

1684
03:29:03,287 --> 03:29:07,201
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.

1685
03:29:07,457 --> 03:29:08,655
Humbly?

1686
03:29:09,167 --> 03:29:10,578
Humbly, Harith?

1687
03:29:10,835 --> 03:29:12,827
Yes, humbly.

1688
03:29:13,212 --> 03:29:15,335
This is a new trick.

1689
03:29:16,340 --> 03:29:17,999
Why is there no electricity?

1690
03:29:18,967 --> 03:29:21,718
I have been to that
electrical house, Lawrence.

1691
03:29:21,969 --> 03:29:24,840
There are three large machines.

1692
03:29:25,097 --> 03:29:27,422
He means generators!

1693
03:29:27,933 --> 03:29:29,095
So.

1694
03:29:29,517 --> 03:29:31,225
One of them is burning.

1695
03:29:31,477 --> 03:29:34,597
They are of an incredible size,
but helpless.

1696
03:29:34,897 --> 03:29:37,648
It is so of all machines.

1697
03:29:37,858 --> 03:29:41,855
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1698
03:29:44,530 --> 03:29:47,696
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.

1699
03:29:47,949 --> 03:29:51,614
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1700
03:29:51,869 --> 03:29:53,067
Take...

1701
03:29:57,207 --> 03:29:58,452
Fire has broken out.

1702
03:29:58,667 --> 03:30:00,208
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1703
03:30:00,460 --> 03:30:03,330
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1704
03:30:03,587 --> 03:30:05,295
Then use the fire brigade!

1705
03:30:05,547 --> 03:30:08,417
We have tried,
but there is no force in the water.

1706
03:30:08,675 --> 03:30:10,169
Then you must carry it.

1707
03:30:10,426 --> 03:30:14,755
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1708
03:30:27,065 --> 03:30:30,599
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1709
03:30:33,487 --> 03:30:35,195
This afternoon!

1710
03:30:58,925 --> 03:31:02,922
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1711
03:31:03,137 --> 03:31:07,086
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1712
03:31:07,307 --> 03:31:10,224
All I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1713
03:31:11,685 --> 03:31:12,966
Sorry, sir.

1714
03:31:15,230 --> 03:31:16,890
Maybe it's the bulb.

1715
03:31:21,569 --> 03:31:22,731
No, sir.

1716
03:31:23,153 --> 03:31:24,813
It's the power.

1717
03:31:40,001 --> 03:31:41,411
They're leaving.

1718
03:31:42,086 --> 03:31:43,793
That's it, then.

1719
03:31:44,296 --> 03:31:46,418
Marvellous-looking beggars,
aren't they?

1720
03:32:07,607 --> 03:32:10,477
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.

1721
03:32:10,776 --> 03:32:12,768
- Come where?
- Back.

1722
03:32:17,198 --> 03:32:19,440
I know your heart.

1723
03:32:27,874 --> 03:32:29,498
What is it?

1724
03:32:30,501 --> 03:32:32,161
Is it this?

1725
03:32:34,921 --> 03:32:38,005
I tell you, this is nothing.

1726
03:32:51,185 --> 03:32:52,844
Is it the blood?

1727
03:32:53,645 --> 03:32:56,764
The desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of.

1728
03:32:58,316 --> 03:33:02,644
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1729
03:33:03,737 --> 03:33:05,017
Hear me, God.

1730
03:33:06,739 --> 03:33:10,571
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.

1731
03:33:27,465 --> 03:33:28,710
What about you?

1732
03:33:29,717 --> 03:33:33,334
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1733
03:33:35,847 --> 03:33:37,222
A very low occupation.

1734
03:33:37,723 --> 03:33:40,759
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1735
03:33:49,733 --> 03:33:52,650
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1736
03:33:52,861 --> 03:33:54,734
It's what I came for.

1737
03:33:58,240 --> 03:33:59,521
And then...

1738
03:34:01,910 --> 03:34:03,285
...it would be something.

1739
03:34:03,536 --> 03:34:04,734
Yes.

1740
03:34:05,413 --> 03:34:06,611
Much.

1741
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:28,087
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1742
03:34:28,307 --> 03:34:29,587
- You love him.
- I fear him.

1743
03:34:29,850 --> 03:34:31,641
Then why do you weep?

1744
03:34:32,018 --> 03:34:34,141
If I fear him, who love him...

1745
03:34:34,354 --> 03:34:37,271
...how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1746
03:34:37,648 --> 03:34:40,767
Take your hand away, Howeitat!

1747
03:34:43,194 --> 03:34:46,645
So you are not yet
entirely politician.

1748
03:34:46,906 --> 03:34:47,736
Not yet.

1749
03:34:47,990 --> 03:34:52,319
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1750
03:34:52,911 --> 03:34:54,784
And Allah be thanked.

1751
03:34:55,288 --> 03:34:56,698
I'll tell thee what...

1752
03:34:56,956 --> 03:35:00,289
...being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1753
03:35:21,768 --> 03:35:25,101
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.

1754
03:35:25,396 --> 03:35:28,183
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1755
03:35:28,440 --> 03:35:32,769
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.

1756
03:35:33,027 --> 03:35:36,063
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1757
03:35:36,322 --> 03:35:37,899
No, sir, I will not.

1758
03:35:38,824 --> 03:35:40,448
Control yourself.

1759
03:35:40,951 --> 03:35:44,034
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1760
03:35:44,996 --> 03:35:47,284
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1761
03:35:47,498 --> 03:35:50,332
But you forgot
the Turkish Military Hospital.

1762
03:35:50,709 --> 03:35:55,169
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1763
03:35:55,838 --> 03:36:00,464
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1764
03:36:07,181 --> 03:36:08,639
What's it like?

1765
03:37:25,454 --> 03:37:27,530
This is outrageous!

1766
03:37:28,623 --> 03:37:30,532
Outrageous!

1767
03:37:33,753 --> 03:37:35,496
Outrageous!

1768
03:37:36,588 --> 03:37:38,794
You filthy little wog!

1769
03:37:49,307 --> 03:37:53,387
My friend Lawrence,
if I may call him that.

1770
03:37:53,644 --> 03:37:56,099
"My friend Lawrence."

1771
03:37:56,355 --> 03:38:00,933
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1772
03:38:01,150 --> 03:38:03,819
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1773
03:38:04,069 --> 03:38:09,146
He pines for the Gothic cottages
of Surrey, is it not?

1774
03:38:09,407 --> 03:38:13,025
Already in imagination,
he catches trout...

1775
03:38:13,285 --> 03:38:16,784
...and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1776
03:38:17,039 --> 03:38:20,489
That's me you're describing, sir,
not Colonel Lawrence.

1777
03:38:21,417 --> 03:38:23,623
You're promoted colonel.

1778
03:38:23,836 --> 03:38:26,291
Yes. What for?

1779
03:38:26,505 --> 03:38:29,707
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.

1780
03:38:29,924 --> 03:38:34,052
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home.

1781
03:38:34,637 --> 03:38:36,925
Then, thank you.

1782
03:38:41,142 --> 03:38:42,387
Well, then...

1783
03:38:42,977 --> 03:38:44,008
...Godspeed.

1784
03:38:44,520 --> 03:38:48,433
There's nothing further here
for a warrior.

1785
03:38:48,732 --> 03:38:52,811
We drive bargains. Old men's work.

1786
03:38:53,068 --> 03:38:57,445
Young men make wars, and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men.

1787
03:38:57,697 --> 03:39:01,148
Courage and hope for the future.

1788
03:39:01,367 --> 03:39:04,071
Then old men make the peace.

1789
03:39:05,162 --> 03:39:08,079
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1790
03:39:08,289 --> 03:39:10,745
Mistrust and caution.

1791
03:39:11,667 --> 03:39:13,494
It must be so.

1792
03:39:29,932 --> 03:39:34,510
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1793
03:39:44,278 --> 03:39:47,942
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1794
03:39:48,198 --> 03:39:49,941
The pumping plant I must retain.

1795
03:39:50,158 --> 03:39:52,695
If you retain it,
there will be no water.

1796
03:39:52,952 --> 03:39:56,651
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.

1797
03:39:56,913 --> 03:40:00,780
I shall not, and if your men
attempt it, my men will resist it.

1798
03:40:01,042 --> 03:40:02,701
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.

1799
03:40:02,918 --> 03:40:05,325
It's a thing that
makes an ugly incident.

1800
03:40:05,670 --> 03:40:07,497
I'm sure your government...

1801
03:40:07,755 --> 03:40:11,622
...does not wish to appear at
the peace conference as an aggressor.

1802
03:40:13,886 --> 03:40:15,380
I say!

1803
03:40:16,805 --> 03:40:18,714
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1804
03:40:21,058 --> 03:40:23,300
May I shake your hand, sir?

1805
03:40:24,436 --> 03:40:27,057
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1806
03:40:30,691 --> 03:40:32,897
Haven't we met before?

1807
03:40:33,152 --> 03:40:34,729
Don't think so, sir.

1808
03:40:34,945 --> 03:40:37,696
No, no, sir, I should remember that.

1809
03:40:42,910 --> 03:40:47,073
It is widely known the Arab Council
took power in my name.

1810
03:40:47,288 --> 03:40:49,281
They have no power. It's illusory.

1811
03:40:49,540 --> 03:40:51,995
Illusions can be very powerful.

1812
03:40:52,376 --> 03:40:53,953
Particularly...

1813
03:40:54,878 --> 03:40:57,499
...when they take this form.

1814
03:40:59,632 --> 03:41:02,632
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus...

1815
03:41:02,885 --> 03:41:04,841
...liberated by the Arab army.

1816
03:41:05,387 --> 03:41:08,423
Led, may I remind you,
by a British-serving officer.

1817
03:41:08,973 --> 03:41:14,014
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence
is a sword with two edges.

1818
03:41:14,269 --> 03:41:17,305
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1819
03:41:20,941 --> 03:41:23,147
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1820
03:41:23,985 --> 03:41:26,274
You are merely a general.

1821
03:41:28,864 --> 03:41:30,358
I must be a king.

1822
03:41:33,368 --> 03:41:35,242
Excuse me, sir.

1823
03:41:49,882 --> 03:41:51,127
Well?

1824
03:41:52,009 --> 03:41:53,419
Well...

1825
03:41:53,844 --> 03:41:56,761
...it seems we're to have
a British waterworks...

1826
03:41:56,971 --> 03:41:59,213
...with an Arab flag on it.

1827
03:41:59,432 --> 03:42:01,340
Do you think it was worth it?

1828
03:42:01,558 --> 03:42:04,179
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1829
03:42:04,519 --> 03:42:05,717
Yes, sir.

1830
03:42:05,979 --> 03:42:07,603
So you keep saying.

1831
03:42:07,813 --> 03:42:09,438
You, I suspect...

1832
03:42:09,940 --> 03:42:13,807
...are chief architect
of this compromise.

1833
03:42:14,277 --> 03:42:17,361
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1834
03:42:18,072 --> 03:42:22,318
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1835
03:43:00,357 --> 03:43:03,441
Well, sir. Going home.

1836
03:43:05,778 --> 03:43:07,403
Home, sir.

1837
03:43:14,452 --> 03:43:18,034
 # Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you #

1838
03:43:18,289 --> 03:43:21,455
# Though it breaks my heart to go #

1839	
03:43:21,600 --> 03:43:25,1000
Thank you for downloading
