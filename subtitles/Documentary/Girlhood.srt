00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:59,089
CHILDHOOD

2
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:07,864
Bye, girls.

3
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:25,548
Bye, girls.

4
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,729
Farida!

5
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
Hello, Farida!

6
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:45,567
- Shut up. - Come talk.

7
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,321
Farida!

8
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,157
Goodbye.

9
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,143
Hello.

10
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,394
Hola, Marieme.

11
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,864
- What is it? - Good.

12
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,730
Have you come to see my brother?

13
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,785
No, he wants to know.

14
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,998
We'll see.

15
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,292
Yes, we'll see.

16
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,345
Yes?

17
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,189
It's me.

18
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,291
Hello.

19
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:36,549
- Has she already gone? - Yes, an hour ago.

20
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,301
What's in the pasta?

21
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,595
I tried something new.

22
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,807
Salmon and cayenne.

23
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,101
- The salmon is good. - Yes.

24
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,228
- Want more? - No.

25
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,855
- Your watering? - Yes.

26
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,566
Come, the Mini. After going to bed.

27
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,317
I do not.

28
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,860
Would you like dessert?

29
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,863
Babybel.

30
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,449
After going to bed.

31
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,868
No I do not want.

32
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,828
Damel.

33
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,122
Leave it open.

34
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,386
Brush thoroughly.

35
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,060
Continue.

36
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,479
Would you spit?

37
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,576
Have you seen Djibril?

38
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,870
No.

39
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,665
He shut himself in his room.

40
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,129
Do you bra?

41
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,879
No.

42
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,716
Oh ... They've grown up, huh?

43
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,468
Add off.

44
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,428
They really visible.

45
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,899
- Let me see. - Do you have anything else to do?

46
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:11,974
Show me, baby, I'm serious.

47
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,059
- No ... - Stop.

48
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,518
- Let me see. - Stop.

49
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,272
They have grown so much!

50
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:23,819
- Let me see. - I will not. Stick.

51
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,073
- Stop! - Let me see.

52
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:56,434
Make Djibril seen?

53
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:58,769
I do not think so.

54
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,356
Did you told Mom?

55
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,028
Do not. Use only great t.

56
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,370
- Stay away! - Location.

57
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:04,249
- Go to bed, I said. - Let me finish the game.

58
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:06,809
No vocational training.

59
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,812
Your rating is too bad.

60
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,856
I'll grade.

61
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:16,569
You already have done. You can not take three times.

62
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,322
- You must continue. - In high school then.

63
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,160
Here is a list of vocational training and schools. Read it.

64
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,122
No, I want to go to high school.

65
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:33,335
- It is impossible. - Please please.

66
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,629
Let me go there.

67
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,424
- I can not. - It's not my fault.

68
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,175
I promise.

69
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:43,762
Whose fault is it then, Marieme?

70
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,389
Dime.

71
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,228
Is it my fault, maybe?

72
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,149
No. But let me go there.

73
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,735
There is good training.

74
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,530
When you find a job faster.

75
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,282
You can leave.

76
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,328
Move away from home? You can not. You do not understand.

77
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,998
Understand what? Tell me.

78
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,959
Is there something I should know?

79
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:21,423
Take all of this. Please read.

80
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:26,011
I do not. I want to be like everyone else. Normal.

81
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,432
It's a little late for that.

82
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,403
You there!

83
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,949
Come here.

84
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,665
What do you do?

85
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,503
- Saca. - You want to sit with us?

86
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,050
Why is that?

87
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,428
You look sad.

88
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:11,971
What?

89
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,224
I'll be interested.

90
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:18,478
What's your name?

91
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,605
Marieme.

92
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:24,025
Lady ... Adiatou ... Fily ...

93
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,572
Want to be in Paris?

94
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,827
I'm talking to you!

95
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:38,539
I am not interested.

96
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,000
She is not interested.

97
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:46,422
You do not know what losing. Stick.

98
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,217
What nerve!

99
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,470
Worse than that.

100
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,240
How is the situation?

101
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:17,827
- What? - It's great.

102
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:28,212
- Whenever you're with your posse. - Likewise.

103
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,673
- Exactly. - Always together.

104
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:33,595
I heard that I started to fight with some girls.

105
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,552
Bullshit!

106
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,264
- It must be said anyway. - Wait.

107
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,016
What did they say exactly?

108
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,351
You were skraja.

109
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:44,927
Extreme?

110
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:47,314
It was that skraja ?!

111
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,357
We dress them anytime.

112
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:53,236
Says girl who always takes selfies?

113
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,738
She makes duck places in the toilet.

114
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,449
- Caidy! - There it is.

115
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:03,037
It is not true. What we do quickly.

116
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,122
See you, guys.

117
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,917
- See you. - We'll see.

118
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,927
We're going to Paris.

119
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,550
Zombie ...

120
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,801
Try it.

121
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:29,437
- As follows? - Yes.

122
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,399
We could have changed us.

123
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,155
You're scared of me?

124
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,450
Are you afraid of me or what?

125
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,336
You really take?

126
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,714
- Leggings are out. - Leggings 2008.

127
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,050
You are so childish ...

128
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,344
Vamos, eh.

129
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,688
What are your pants?

130
00:17:57,139 --> 00:17:59,159
- Skim Pants! - What she trying to prove?

131
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:02,110
- Your sister. - What she trying to prove?

132
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,822
The bride bag worth 500 stylish leather.

133
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,199
- I agree. - Red and striking.

134
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,286
But I hate shoes.

135
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,205
I agree.

136
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:17,792
All right.

137
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:21,712
This is perfect for you, Fily.

138
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,716
- I'll buy it for you. - Really?

139
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,302
She thinks I'm a pot.

140
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:37,561
Miss ...

141
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,856
- Can I help? - No, thanks.

142
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:02,377
Why are you following it?

143
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,005
Do you do this to everyone?

144
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:09,300
Do you think we're here to steal this crap?

145
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,636
You think you do not have any money? We are losers?

146
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,639
What do you know, your slave business?

147
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:18,559
Come on, now approached.

148
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,785
His back baby!

149
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,789
She made me so mad!

150
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,502
Adiatou did this ...

151
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,921
Fily did that.

152
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,215
Poor cow.

153
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,307
Check them out.

154
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:01,841
How is the situation?

155
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:03,142
Chicks ...

156
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,187
Who she babbles about?

157
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,721
Is!

158
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,483
- Who are you talking to? - You!

159
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,279
Who are you talking to?

160
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,030
She is absolutely crazy!

161
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,950
Is there a problem? Will it make?

162
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,080
You are ridiculous!

163
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:26,749
Shut up and get over here!

164
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,211
If you have a little courage, review the slopes.

165
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,673
No, you have to come here, pundhuvud!

166
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,345
The small has a big mouth. Go to hell!

167
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:41,639
Your damn bitches!

168
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,483
Fuck you, bitch!

169
00:20:52,933 --> 00:20:54,359
Check out ekorrfejset!

170
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,279
Get everything, you're dead!

171
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:01,533
- They are very sick. - Crazy.

172
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:05,537
- He took the knife? - It would have been crazy!

173
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,541
She thinks it's ASKUL!

174
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:11,959
Absolutely.

175
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:16,381
- It would have been crazy! - She wanted to eat Fily.

176
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,841
I promise ...

177
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,428
She came with death threats.

178
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,813
Check.

179
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,776
Follow me.

180
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,238
- Check! - Turn around.

181
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,451
Huka now.

182
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,379
She digs.

183
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,591
Give it all you got, Marieme.

184
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,885
Play dead.

185
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:07,680
Posing.

186
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:44,257
- The mobile phone is so cool. - Superb, eh?

187
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,426
Where did you get that?

188
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:48,261
A friend gave it to me.

189
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,847
He fell off a truck?

190
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:54,058
Yes, probably.

191
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,811
- Can I get it? - Not on your life!

192
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:59,730
It's just a Galaxy S3.

193
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,735
- All right, girls? - Yes.

194
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,082
Mom ...

195
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,752
I'll start in high school.

196
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,172
Also, beloved.

197
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,110
Give me that.

198
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,071
- Does ?? 10? - No.

199
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:18,864
- There you go. - No.

200
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,158
There you go.

201
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,328
Check yourself.

202
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:27,372
I can wait.

203
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:30,417
Hurry up, otherwise you will be late for class.

204
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,883
Well ...

205
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:42,387
What is it? Paste now!

206
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,744
- Here. - Hold this.

207
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,381
- It's enough. - Even for the spirits?

208
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:21,717
For room and spirits.

209
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:24,177
Everything is ready. Now party.

210
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:26,638
- We will have the helkul. - Wild game.

211
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:43,028
Check out the TV!

212
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,072
I'm in the middle.

213
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:46,949
I kill you!

214
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,180
You get three seconds to go ahead.

215
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:51,370
I count ...

216
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:53,831
She is crazy!

217
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,501
Check out her with her sexy body!

218
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,077
- Toan is so cool! - Violent!

219
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,999
- Mirror! - Check out our loo cool!

220
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,711
I use it first.

221
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,465
- Not on your life! - Whirlpool bath immediately.

222
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,667
Here ...

223
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,720
Drink a little.

224
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,060
The sweet taste of licorice!

225
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,354
You've seen?

226
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,914
Have you no answer?

227
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,923
Who is it?

228
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,217
None.

229
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:36,887
What happens?

230
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,057
That's my brother.

231
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:42,811
Do not answer that, okay. I turn it off.

232
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:47,982
I turn it off! Enjoy here.

233
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,283
Come here.

234
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,582
You have to do what you want.

235
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,876
Look at me.

236
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,795
You do what you want. I say it.

237
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,172
- I do what I want. - Again.

238
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,258
I do what I want.

239
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:17,177
I have something for you in my jacket.

240
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:24,518
- Should I open? - Come on.

241
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,029
Vic.

242
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,949
Vic as in "Victoria".

243
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,796
- Your dress becomes. - Thanks.

244
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,090
You're beautiful!

245
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,432
- Likewise. - I know.

246
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:09,227
- How do you feel? - Really Beautiful.

247
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,104
Me Nudge.

248
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:13,690
Let stöldalarmen remain!

249
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:15,692
There will be a hole for them.

250
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:18,194
Fily, show your dress.

251
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:21,448
Come here.

252
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,660
Come on, Fily!

253
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,162
Fily, come out!

254
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:30,998
Come on out!

255
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,211
A large leopard!

256
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:38,422
What's so funny?

257
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,967
Big boots with it!

258
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:46,013
You are beautiful in a dress.

259
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:48,015
It is a good change.

260
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:51,310
- Use lipstick. - And high heels, no boots.

261
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,688
No large riding boots ...

262
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:09,327
- Let me try. - Here goes.

263
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:12,372
You can not win every time, Lady.

264
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:14,791
I win and make no mistakes.

265
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:17,627
She's completely stoned!

266
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,377
Please wait ...

267
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:21,714
No Tinker. I give up.

268
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,241
Marieme!

269
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:13,620
- Hi. - What?

270
00:36:15,114 --> 00:36:18,333
- You're through here often. - It's on the way home.

271
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,293
There is a detour.

272
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:24,881
No, no detour. And it occurred to me.

273
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,637
Do you think I come here on purpose?

274
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:33,181
Yes.

275
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,851
- Why? To meet with you? - Yes.

276
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:42,064
Do you think that or what you expect?

277
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:45,276
Both and.

278
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:47,570
Good.

279
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:55,285
I have to go.

280
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:02,250
He is my friend.

281
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:08,006
Yes, I know.

282
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:15,722
I can not. You understand?

283
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,852
I understand.

284
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,361
I should probably go.

285
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:33,280
Yes you should.

286
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,183
Marieme ...

287
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:18,699
Sit.

288
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,833
Do not turn off your mobile.

289
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:34,673
You know you can not.

290
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:41,012
You think you think is funny?

291
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,434
I must say that to you?

292
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,771
Use your brain.

293
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,149
Yes.

294
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,163
Djibril ...

295
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:11,291
- Are you awake? - Yes.

296
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,358
- Where were you? - Close the door.

297
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:45,700
You're beautiful!

298
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,911
It should shower.

299
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,956
- How do I look? - Perfect.

300
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:38,876
Then we go.

301
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:43,756
Come on, time to go.

302
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,991
Clave you, bitch!

303
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,957
It's over now, to strike!

304
00:42:03,408 --> 00:42:05,251
Take!

305
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:11,673
Are you okay?

306
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:13,801
Let me go!

307
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:13,115
Excuse me ...

308
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:15,001
- Hi. - I am the daughter Asmas.

309
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:18,087
ASTHMA? She's down there in the conference room.

310
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:20,923
- Thanks. - No reason.

311
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,976
Hello.

312
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:36,647
You're late.

313
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,149
It's not my fault, it was the bus.

314
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:42,110
Hurry up.

315
00:45:42,702 --> 00:45:44,504
- Are you Asmas girl? - Yes.

316
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:46,714
I can hire during the summer.

317
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:50,259
- Mom told me. - OK, you start tomorrow.

318
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:54,096
- Madam ... - Yes?

319
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:03,731
Tomorrow you tell Mom that was a mistake.

320
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:08,151
You do not need me.

321
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,417
Stay with me.

322
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,628
- I can not. - Why not?

323
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,590
I have to meet with the girls. I'm already late.

324
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,550
When I will see you?

325
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,469
No se.

326
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,763
Tomorrow?

327
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:06,390
I will try.

328
00:48:09,927 --> 00:48:11,771
No Stop.

329
00:48:27,361 --> 00:48:29,204
No Stop.

330
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:55,729
Did you bring your sisters?

331
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:59,191
Mom threw me to look.

332
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:02,152
- Trouble ... - Stop, Awa.

333
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:15,457
Who is she from?

334
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:19,294
You. Home act so rude.

335
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:21,630
Behold!

336
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:25,759
- Where were you? - Nowhere.

337
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:28,052
We have waited indefinitely.

338
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:33,641
What should we do?

339
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:39,230
We're doing something new. All right, ma'am?

340
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:46,320
Come on, I have an idea.

341
00:49:59,533 --> 00:50:01,460
I can not concentrate!

342
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:04,129
Shut up!

343
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:19,644
Two classes!

344
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:22,855
This game is completely insane!

345
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,006
You're so happy is crazy!

346
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:28,110
You saw it? Two strokes.

347
00:50:28,561 --> 00:50:30,404
Two types for you.

348
00:50:34,817 --> 00:50:36,797
- I see what you want to do. - What is it?

349
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:38,787
Hit directly.

350
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:42,040
Hit directly, there is nothing to complain about.

351
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:46,169
- I stuck to the left. - No, it's a tunnel there.

352
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:48,422
Hit directly into it.

353
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:51,091
Let me explain something ...

354
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:53,760
- Start. - Do you see anything?

355
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:55,637
What is it? A track.

356
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:57,379
No trace.

357
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,891
- There is a trail. - Do not start!

358
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:03,019
If I want to play as, I will.

359
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,730
I hit 15 hits in the tunnel, use it!

360
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,472
- No! - Continue.

361
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:09,984
- I turn to the left. - She wants to turn left.

362
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:12,135
- What is your problem? - The rules.

363
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,300
Watch the game. There is a tunnel.

364
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,449
- Place of now. - She can hit left.

365
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,840
- Do not start! - She's just too much.

366
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:22,162
The tunnel is there for a reason.

367
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,915
There are rules, so look through the tunnel!

368
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:27,668
- Calm down. - I'm calm!

369
00:51:28,202 --> 00:51:30,253
you know what? I'll play through it.

370
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:31,913
Do it then.

371
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:34,382
I'll show you how crazy Play minigolf.

372
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,384
I will show you.

373
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:38,678
Yes, continue.

374
00:51:50,098 --> 00:51:51,941
She hit you!

375
00:51:54,018 --> 00:51:57,363
- Leave me alone, dammit. - Come on, are you crying?

376
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,114
Really?

377
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:02,451
you're crying? She's serious!

378
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:04,912
You do not ...

379
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:07,223
There is nothing to complain about. Stop mourn!

380
00:52:07,615 --> 00:52:08,782
Always ...

381
00:52:08,783 --> 00:52:12,961
Okay, stop mourn. Do not be so upset about it.

382
00:52:22,796 --> 00:52:25,724
- Hey, Lady! - Those bastards.

383
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:28,268
We are not their dogs.

384
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:37,318
- How is the situation, Abdel? - If you ask what is the situation?

385
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:39,389
- What is this shit? - What?

386
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:41,864
- Have you seen the video? - Of course I have.

387
00:52:42,315 --> 00:52:44,533
- Uncensored! - It has spread on the Internet.

388
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:47,328
We've all seen the video and seen it all.

389
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:50,581
The four also in her bra.

390
00:52:51,032 --> 00:52:52,625
Filthy ...

391
00:52:53,075 --> 00:52:56,753
You and your big mouth. She cheated on you in the end.

392
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:59,122
Now all feel ashamed, his stupid bastard.

393
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,133
You play the warrior on the block.

394
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,260
Totally useless!

395
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,095
You are just a girlfriend.

396
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:08,682
You thought you were cool, baby.

397
00:53:09,132 --> 00:53:11,309
Have you deserve.

398
00:53:13,053 --> 00:53:14,261
Take!

399
00:53:14,262 --> 00:53:17,023
Move!

400
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,494
His hair is gone and you are the next in line!

401
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:22,570
Do not talk to us. Sitting in his footsteps.

402
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,492
- Now we take and rivets. - No way.

403
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:30,953
What will you do everyone else? We have to react.

404
00:53:31,404 --> 00:53:32,704
Holes Shut your mouth!

405
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:35,082
I'm the boss!

406
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:38,502
You think you're smart, but you know what?

407
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,796
What do you know?

408
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,890
Her hair ...

409
00:53:53,091 --> 00:53:55,227
His father managed.

410
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:04,110
Are not you going to ask ?

411
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:06,279
I want something more.

412
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:10,575
- You always ask the same thing. - Yes, I'm going to change that.

413
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,874
Your phone is off.

414
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:23,963
Okay, she returns.

415
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:28,592
Do you see how we check in?

416
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:38,768
- They're talking about us. - Do you know who you're talking about?

417
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,313
Stop playing smart.

418
00:54:41,763 --> 00:54:43,481
Who do you think you are?

419
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:46,901
No, who do you think you are? come on tell me.

420
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,822
You think you're so sexy ...

421
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:52,572
Who are you?

422
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:54,450
You're a girl a bit, right?

423
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:57,328
Where is she? Tell me. Why are you afraid?

424
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:59,830
How is the situation? Something fishy going on?

425
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:02,666
Be careful, otherwise, he shaved.

426
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,505
- Come on, if you dare. - Bitches bald.

427
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:12,092
- Why the hair cut? - Did not you know?

428
00:55:12,585 --> 00:55:15,429
For she was dressed. You're talking too much.

429
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,224
What is bothering you if we talk too much?

430
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:22,227
What is bothering you?

431
00:55:22,678 --> 00:55:25,522
- You're not even clean. - So we're dirty. What?

432
00:55:25,973 --> 00:55:28,984
Do not talk and superior game.

433
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:30,734
Do not talk to me.

434
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,530
My girls riveting you.

435
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,823
Do you need anybody?

436
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:38,826
The poor need someone.

437
00:55:39,444 --> 00:55:41,245
The idiot is not on my radar.

438
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:43,664
I'm not even talking to you.

439
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:45,615
Stop now. You have a good night.

440
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:48,085
Come on, I'm going to kill someone.

441
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,258
Stupid bitches.

442
00:55:55,626 --> 00:55:57,469
Losers.

443
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:06,770
- A girl wants to meet you. - What is it?

444
00:56:07,221 --> 00:56:08,605
- The old! - How is the situation?

445
00:56:09,056 --> 00:56:10,356
- Good and you? - Good.

446
00:56:10,515 --> 00:56:13,777
- Where have you been? - Introduce us.

447
00:56:14,811 --> 00:56:16,111
he is so cute!

448
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:18,072
- Like her mother. - Beautiful!

449
00:56:18,523 --> 00:56:19,908
Hi ...

450
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,285
It was hard at first.

451
00:56:22,736 --> 00:56:25,747
But it's better now. I am happy. It's quiet.

452
00:56:26,197 --> 00:56:29,750
- Is not the lady here? - No. She's sick.

453
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:31,781
Give her a kiss for me, okay?

454
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,088
I have not seen in a while.

455
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:35,839
Yes, always.

456
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:39,802
We must meet again. Have a good day.

457
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,186
- Who is she? - She was the fourth.

458
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:51,395
Before.

459
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,232
- Before what? - Before the child.

460
00:58:14,677 --> 00:58:15,844
How is it?

461
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:17,855
- Good. And you? - Great.

462
00:58:19,223 --> 00:58:20,899
Do Adiatou?

463
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,151
She is on the way.

464
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:25,445
Always late.

465
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:28,532
You look tense.

466
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:31,451
Lady should kill her.

467
00:58:31,902 --> 00:58:33,745
Do not worry, she does.

468
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:39,959
Here she is now.

469
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:49,969
What about girls?

470
00:58:50,753 --> 00:58:52,805
- Come on. - Lady, then?

471
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:55,099
She finds us there.

472
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:11,981
The lady is not here.

473
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:14,993
She will not. I booked the meeting.

474
01:00:57,459 --> 01:00:59,302
She is tired.

475
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,254
I know you said it would not react.

476
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:43,177
But I did it for your sake.

477
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:45,179
No Stop.

478
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,932
You know who did it.

479
01:01:49,968 --> 01:01:51,894
For its own sake.

480
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,710
Marieme!

481
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:19,879
Yes?

482
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:23,341
Come here.

483
01:02:40,683 --> 01:02:42,651
You've earned more than Vigneux-girlfriend?

484
01:02:45,104 --> 01:02:46,947
How do you know it?

485
01:02:50,192 --> 01:02:52,035
Dime.

486
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:58,125
Le clavé.

487
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,438
Would you like Brazil?

488
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,446
France.

489
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:46,186
Yes?

490
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:48,356
It is Ismael home?

491
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:51,609
-. He sleeps, as always
- Let me in.

492
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,570
- Who is it?
- Is Vic.

493
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,853
Take off your clothes.

494
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:53,585
Continue.

495
01:06:16,308 --> 01:06:18,151
Turn around.

496
01:11:30,777 --> 01:11:32,787
What is this?

497
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:34,321
Go Home.

498
01:11:34,322 --> 01:11:35,915
- You're here. - I'm different.

499
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:37,750
- Different? - Go home now.

500
01:11:38,201 --> 01:11:39,410
Shoot!

501
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:42,296
When I tell you to do something, so comply.

502
01:11:42,956 --> 01:11:44,256
Who are these girls?

503
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:46,162
- Do you mind? - Yes.

504
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:47,792
Stay away from them, okay!

505
01:11:48,002 --> 01:11:49,845
What?

506
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,307
Look at me when I talk to you.

507
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:55,184
Go Home.

508
01:11:55,635 --> 01:11:57,478
I'm talking to you!

509
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:03,733
You hit me?

510
01:12:04,018 --> 01:12:07,237
You hit me? You're just like him.

511
01:12:09,106 --> 01:12:10,949
Do not touch me.

512
01:12:15,112 --> 01:12:16,955
Vamos a casa.

513
01:12:28,082 --> 01:12:29,702
- I'm going now. - Start right.

514
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:31,299
- I'm going now. - Why?

515
01:12:31,336 --> 01:12:33,012
So it is fair.

516
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:36,057
- See you tomorrow? - We'll see.

517
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,779
- Her braids sucks. - I'm tired of them.

518
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,531
Sit. His bow tie.

519
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:40,369
Come here.

520
01:13:41,403 --> 01:13:43,580
Are you going to start studying again?

521
01:13:44,031 --> 01:13:45,874
No se.

522
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:51,004
It suits you.

523
01:13:53,164 --> 01:13:55,008
Marieme!

524
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,555
Download Mini School.

525
01:14:01,798 --> 01:14:03,224
It is not yet time.

526
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:06,060
- Go anyway. - No.

527
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:11,398
- Do not worry. - No, I'm not going anywhere.

528
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:16,987
Shoot!

529
01:14:17,563 --> 01:14:19,223
- No! - Well, if you do not get.

530
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:21,366
I'm not going to leave.

531
01:14:22,318 --> 01:14:24,161
Shoot!

532
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,749
Marieme abierta.

533
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,043
Hell!

534
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:47,725
You did it?

535
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:51,062
Now I feel ashamed.

536
01:14:51,512 --> 01:14:54,231
You fucked like a whore! Like a whore!

537
01:14:54,974 --> 01:14:57,902
Did you think about Mom? Or the family?

538
01:14:58,352 --> 01:15:00,195
Now I feel ashamed.

539
01:15:01,188 --> 01:15:03,323
You know what they say about you?

540
01:15:03,774 --> 01:15:05,909
Look at me!

541
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:09,329
- Sorry. - You bitch!

542
01:15:51,612 --> 01:15:54,706
- I have not asked him. - He did.

543
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:13,099
That's not only good to drink without eating.

544
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,393
Abou.

545
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:17,937
I know who you are.

546
01:16:18,388 --> 01:16:20,982
- I do not know who you are. - Excuse me. Vic.

547
01:16:21,432 --> 01:16:23,150
Having problems?

548
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:26,904
No, I'm fine. I was struck with a girlfriend.

549
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,033
There is nothing in comparison. She suffered.

550
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:34,952
Where do you live?

551
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:38,707
- Le Clos-Français. - My Neighbor. Need a lift?

552
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,253
No.

553
01:16:44,538 --> 01:16:46,381
Strong and alone.

554
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:48,842
Yes.

555
01:17:50,476 --> 01:17:52,612
Can I get to see on TV?

556
01:17:53,062 --> 01:17:54,488
Yes.

557
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,574
Hello.

558
01:17:57,024 --> 01:17:58,367
Hello.

559
01:17:58,818 --> 01:18:01,579
- Where are you? - Go shopping.

560
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:08,836
- Why is this bag? - I'll be right.

561
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:12,256
See ya.

562
01:18:14,249 --> 01:18:16,093
See ya.

563
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,186
Showering her and I will later.

564
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,992
- A shower or a bath? - A bathroom.

565
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:00,427
I know your brother. He's a good guy.

566
01:19:00,919 --> 01:19:03,388
It is hard for you for your own good.

567
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:06,266
Is it better if he let you ruin yourself?

568
01:19:06,717 --> 01:19:08,560
No.

569
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:11,521
What do you say?

570
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:16,818
If you are with me; do not, I promise.

571
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,698
- How old are you? - Sixteen.

572
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:25,076
No imprisonment at sixteen.

573
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:29,121
It ends at the reformatory. Mountain biking,

574
01:19:29,572 --> 01:19:32,124
jet skis ... A break of the project.

575
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:33,875
Fresco.

576
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:36,295
It's great, you have taken.

577
01:19:36,746 --> 01:19:38,172
I like you.

578
01:19:38,622 --> 01:19:40,466
I mean, I like you.

579
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:44,052
Is that your bag?

580
01:19:45,212 --> 01:19:48,181
- Yeah. - I left home already?

581
01:19:49,967 --> 01:19:51,935
Then you have no choice.

582
01:19:55,472 --> 01:19:57,315
What do you say?

583
01:19:59,059 --> 01:20:00,902
Yes.

584
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:36,144
What should you do?

585
01:20:36,595 --> 01:20:38,396
- I have a plan. - What kind of plane?

586
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,187
A plan, okay. Do not ask.

587
01:20:40,557 --> 01:20:43,943
I ask anyway. Where is the secret of it?

588
01:20:45,437 --> 01:20:47,989
I met Abou. He offered me a job.

589
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,367
Abou know what work is, especially for girls.

590
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,244
is not that.

591
01:20:53,695 --> 01:20:55,955
- He asked me to sell for him. - Really?

592
01:20:56,406 --> 01:20:57,572
Sell?

593
01:20:57,573 --> 01:20:59,753
- You can not do that. - I need cash.

594
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:02,128
- You are ruining yourself. - I have?

595
01:21:02,578 --> 01:21:04,922
Sabbar myself?

596
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:09,134
I do not need your permission.

597
01:21:13,839 --> 01:21:16,850
Perhaps you are jealous because he asked you.

598
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,520
- Abou appreciate me. - Continue to dream.

599
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:23,106
Where is the dream?

600
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:26,443
Could you tell me what is my dream?

601
01:21:28,854 --> 01:21:30,697
You have to wake up.

602
01:21:31,898 --> 01:21:33,741
You going anywhere.

603
01:21:36,486 --> 01:21:38,329
Nowhere.

604
01:21:44,577 --> 01:21:47,379
It leads me to a neighborhood far from here.

605
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,383
What should I do?

606
01:21:54,462 --> 01:21:56,555
Continue as a cleaner?

607
01:21:57,006 --> 01:21:59,975
And be traced to my reputation as a whore?

608
01:22:00,426 --> 01:22:02,269
Should I do it?

609
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,063
Should I?

610
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:08,858
Come here.

611
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:39,305
Make me laugh.

612
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:45,009
I know the latest gossip.

613
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:47,229
- What is it about? - Who?

614
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:51,024
- A diva. - Who's the couch?

615
01:22:51,475 --> 01:22:52,943
- Lady. - I'm warning you.

616
01:22:53,393 --> 01:22:54,973
Not his real name.

617
01:22:54,978 --> 01:22:57,030
- Shut up! - Units no ma'am?

618
01:22:57,481 --> 01:22:58,865
It's not his name!

619
01:22:59,316 --> 01:23:01,701
My name is Lady, I promise.

620
01:23:02,152 --> 01:23:03,912
Have you ever been there?

621
01:23:04,362 --> 01:23:07,790
Her mother never called Lady. Never.

622
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,242
What?

623
01:23:10,243 --> 01:23:12,086
Get there and says. "Hey Lady"

624
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:13,837
I'm warning you!

625
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,132
- What is it? - Let me tell it.

626
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:17,791
Never in life.

627
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,094
- Let me talk. - What is the problem?

628
01:23:20,545 --> 01:23:22,179
What is it? Tell me.

629
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,330
I appeal to and she opens the door.

630
01:23:24,382 --> 01:23:26,350
"Hey, I thought to meet Lady."

631
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:28,268
She said, "Excuse me?"

632
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:29,844
"Meet the Lady."

633
01:23:29,845 --> 01:23:32,105
She said: "She's no lady.

634
01:23:32,556 --> 01:23:34,649
Her name is Sophie. "

635
01:23:39,438 --> 01:23:42,032
Sophie! Add!

636
01:23:42,482 --> 01:23:44,325
Lady Sophie.

637
01:23:45,402 --> 01:23:46,702
It is not true. Sophie.

638
01:23:47,112 --> 01:23:48,413
Well, forget it now.

639
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,163
Sophie ...

640
01:23:50,282 --> 01:23:51,582
What is this shit?

641
01:23:51,825 --> 01:23:54,710
Girls named Sophie have the temperament.

642
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:56,712
Sophie. Nice to meet ...

643
01:23:57,163 --> 01:24:00,424
- I put the muzzle on you. - That can not be done, Sophie.

644
01:24:06,422 --> 01:24:08,307
Take off your necklace.

645
01:24:12,428 --> 01:24:14,313
Take off your necklace. I'm serious.

646
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:17,190
At least one name.

647
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:19,901
People know that.

648
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,537
Do you remember when we went to Disneyland?

649
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,503
We walked to the castle.

650
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,759
I stopped and looked.

651
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,012
You were lucky.

652
01:24:49,255 --> 01:24:51,098
You were beautiful.

653
01:25:14,613 --> 01:25:17,113
I told myself that was a perfect time.

654
01:25:17,532 --> 01:25:19,584
And I'll never forget.

655
01:28:44,148 --> 01:28:46,700
- All clear? - Where are my things?

656
01:28:47,818 --> 01:28:49,661
In the back seat.

657
01:29:08,588 --> 01:29:10,014
Fan stop looking!

658
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:12,517
I do not look.

659
01:29:13,218 --> 01:29:15,061
Oh.

660
01:29:20,475 --> 01:29:22,318
Vic ...

661
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:25,446
Download a piece of pizza, please.

662
01:29:30,234 --> 01:29:32,077
Thank you.

663
01:29:37,825 --> 01:29:39,584
Play overtime.

664
01:29:40,035 --> 01:29:43,171
Even an additional 45 minutes, which is now over.

665
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:45,465
We have won.

666
01:29:47,876 --> 01:29:49,219
Do you know the neighbor?

667
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:52,514
Anyone I like. He returned earlier.

668
01:29:52,964 --> 01:29:54,807
- To borrow some sugar. - What?

669
01:29:55,258 --> 01:29:57,685
I should explain that? She likes me.

670
01:29:58,136 --> 01:29:59,979
That's three times in one week.

671
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:02,356
Three times they borrowed him things?

672
01:30:02,807 --> 01:30:04,107
- Monica. - Calm down.

673
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:05,847
You may only imagine.

674
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,360
Let me touch your hair.

675
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:10,406
- Monica, I'm starving. - Do not touch me.

676
01:30:10,857 --> 01:30:13,033
I get high when you touch me.

677
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:14,944
Does it look like I'm kidding?

678
01:30:15,319 --> 01:30:16,569
No.

679
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,414
Leave leg.

680
01:30:19,031 --> 01:30:21,416
I am a romantic. Do you romantic?

681
01:30:21,867 --> 01:30:24,086
Romance is not my thing.

682
01:30:25,537 --> 01:30:27,381
She loves me.

683
01:30:28,665 --> 01:30:31,092
You should stop smoking weed, dude.

684
01:30:31,543 --> 01:30:33,178
It's not good for you.

685
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:36,890
Monica can go to hell. I want the girl from his neighborhood. Vic?

686
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,309
- What is it? - I like her.

687
01:30:39,759 --> 01:30:41,686
- Who? - Lady.

688
01:30:43,596 --> 01:30:45,857
Who is she? I feel no lady.

689
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:48,317
She is super sexy.

690
01:30:51,562 --> 01:30:54,031
I went to his business to meet.

691
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:56,491
Where does she work?

692
01:30:56,609 --> 01:31:00,371
No. Someone store near Fontaine.

693
01:31:00,821 --> 01:31:02,206
In one place for brides.

694
01:31:02,656 --> 01:31:05,125
They thought I was a pervert, a guy who likes ...

695
01:31:05,576 --> 01:31:08,420
No smell of panties.

696
01:31:09,038 --> 01:31:10,338
Yes.

697
01:31:10,456 --> 01:31:12,966
Introduce your friends sexy.

698
01:31:14,293 --> 01:31:18,054
- The bride is amazing. - I see it more.

699
01:31:19,589 --> 01:31:21,449
We can go there you can introduce me.

700
01:31:21,842 --> 01:31:25,103
- You can go there yourself. - What's up with you?

701
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:43,370
- What does not make noise! - The fucks up my feet.

702
01:31:52,496 --> 01:31:53,796
Come here.

703
01:31:54,123 --> 01:31:56,842
Jump. Come on.

704
01:32:12,515 --> 01:32:15,818
- Hurry up, very cold. - Look in your bag worthless.

705
01:32:24,652 --> 01:32:26,078
Good night then.

706
01:32:26,529 --> 01:32:28,372
Good night.

707
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:05,074
There will be lots of people tonight.

708
01:33:07,277 --> 01:33:08,577
Sea discreto.

709
01:33:08,987 --> 01:33:10,830
No problem.

710
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,838
There is food for you.

711
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:22,549
Thank you.

712
01:33:23,209 --> 01:33:26,220
- It is better now that you're here. - You mean you eat?

713
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:28,513
Yes.

714
01:33:29,381 --> 01:33:31,433
A goddess of the royal household.

715
01:33:32,301 --> 01:33:36,313
- Former Abou be their stuff. - Yes. I'm not like you.

716
01:33:39,057 --> 01:33:41,192
You think you're a bitch?

717
01:33:41,852 --> 01:33:43,695
Just.

718
01:33:44,312 --> 01:33:45,612
You're his bitch.

719
01:33:46,022 --> 01:33:47,865
No.

720
01:33:48,775 --> 01:33:51,536
Thou fool not mean you're not a bitch.

721
01:33:51,986 --> 01:33:53,955
I accept it, at least.

722
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:21,940
How is the situation?

723
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:25,860
- Some news? - Great party Abous Saturday.

724
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,404
Yes, a giant party.

725
01:34:29,022 --> 01:34:31,908
- You do not seem that interested. - I'm not going to Abou.

726
01:34:32,359 --> 01:34:34,494
Why not?

727
01:34:35,028 --> 01:34:36,808
My brother lives opposite. Never in life.

728
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:38,998
Bambi!

729
01:34:39,699 --> 01:34:41,542
Come here!

730
01:34:43,953 --> 01:34:46,589
- You look nice today. - Location.

731
01:34:48,332 --> 01:34:50,384
What is it? I'm kind.

732
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:53,554
You look good today. let's go, please.

733
01:34:54,004 --> 01:34:57,766
- Stop playing with it! - I know her, okay.

734
01:34:58,884 --> 01:35:01,603
Say something. I said you were good.

735
01:35:02,179 --> 01:35:03,480
Come on, answer.

736
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:05,139
You hurt me.

737
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,567
- I'm fine, please? - Give thanks.

738
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,069
I thank you.

739
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:12,322
Say thank you. "

740
01:35:13,565 --> 01:35:15,700
- Are you deaf? - Say thank you and leave.

741
01:35:16,151 --> 01:35:17,702
- Thank me, that's fine. - Thanks.

742
01:35:18,153 --> 01:35:20,204
Good. Paste now.

743
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:22,582
Stick.

744
01:36:23,716 --> 01:36:25,976
- Have you been waiting long? - A time.

745
01:36:26,635 --> 01:36:29,271
- There are lots of people here. - Yes.

746
01:36:34,101 --> 01:36:35,944
I do not like this place.

747
01:36:36,395 --> 01:36:39,781
Who cares? it's mine. That is what is important.

748
01:36:51,618 --> 01:36:53,461
I love you.

749
01:37:07,091 --> 01:37:08,934
What is this shit?

750
01:37:13,848 --> 01:37:15,691
What is this shit?

751
01:37:17,351 --> 01:37:18,944
Why do you do it?

752
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:23,114
First, your hair ... Now hide her breasts ...

753
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:25,533
You want to look like a boy?

754
01:37:25,984 --> 01:37:27,827
No.

755
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,002
Why are you doing this?

756
01:37:44,168 --> 01:37:46,137
I'm tired of this.

757
01:37:46,587 --> 01:37:49,348
Paste unique, it is a whore in the next room!

758
01:39:17,633 --> 01:39:20,728
- Do you want a ride home? - But the party Abous then?

759
01:39:21,554 --> 01:39:23,439
You do not want to go.

760
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:27,609
- Let's go there. - Are you sure?

761
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,904
Yes, I'm sure.

762
01:39:59,257 --> 01:40:01,100
What is your neighborhood?

763
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,063
There there.

764
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,384
Come on.

765
01:43:37,968 --> 01:43:39,936
Will not you dance with me?

766
01:43:40,762 --> 01:43:42,605
Come on, relax.

767
01:43:48,102 --> 01:43:49,946
Relax.

768
01:43:53,941 --> 01:43:55,785
Relax, honey.

769
01:43:56,277 --> 01:43:58,537
- Let me go! - What do you do?

770
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,540
Do not touch me!

771
01:44:01,991 --> 01:44:03,375
Kiss me, fine.

772
01:44:03,826 --> 01:44:05,126
- Kiss me! - Let me go!

773
01:44:05,452 --> 01:44:06,752
Who decides this?

774
01:44:07,162 --> 01:44:10,007
When I tell you to kiss me do it!

775
01:44:12,376 --> 01:44:13,676
Who do you think you are?

776
01:44:13,961 --> 01:44:16,680
This is my place. I'm in charge here!

777
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:19,641
- Are you going to slap me now? - Abou, take it easy.

778
01:44:20,425 --> 01:44:21,725
Release her.

779
01:44:21,927 --> 01:44:23,895
Let me go, you bastards!

780
01:44:24,387 --> 01:44:26,522
When I say dance, then do it!

781
01:44:27,265 --> 01:44:29,108
Lower your eyes!

782
01:45:07,971 --> 01:45:10,648
I left Abou. It's over. I quit.

783
01:45:15,103 --> 01:45:16,946
I wanted to call.

784
01:45:17,397 --> 01:45:19,574
Apologize for the last time.

785
01:45:23,611 --> 01:45:25,454
All right.

786
01:45:26,114 --> 01:45:27,957
I sucked.

787
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:34,004
Stay here.

788
01:45:34,455 --> 01:45:36,298
Stay with me.

789
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:39,801
If we are together,

790
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:42,179
nobody can say anything.

791
01:45:43,672 --> 01:45:45,515
You can move around here.

792
01:45:47,384 --> 01:45:49,227
We can marry.

793
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:51,521
Oh.

794
01:45:56,017 --> 01:45:57,902
are you kidding?

795
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:05,201
The problem is solved if we got married.

796
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:08,579
The problem is solved?

797
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:12,458
Yes, you get a decent girl if we got married.

798
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:14,835
A decent girl?

799
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:17,503
Yes.

800
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:19,715
I'll be your little woman?

801
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:23,594
Then I'll feed your baby. He is my life?

802
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,683
Why not?

803
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,313
How is your life now?

804
01:46:45,273 --> 01:46:47,116
Will you marry me?

805
01:46:49,777 --> 01:46:51,621
Morning.

806
01:47:16,428 --> 01:47:18,271
I can not.

807
01:47:25,395 --> 01:47:27,989
I do not want to live like this.

808
01:47:43,329 --> 01:47:45,172
Sorry.

809
01:48:38,966 --> 01:48:40,809
Yes?

810
01:48:42,386 --> 01:48:44,229
Who is he?

811
01:48:46,306 --> 01:48:48,150
Who is he?
