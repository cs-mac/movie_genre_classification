I'm confused.

324
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:05,106
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

325
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:09,579
I hate meetings.
I'm not allowed to go in, only to sit in the lobby.

326
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:10,997
That's boring.

327
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:12,832
So my dad dropped me off.

328
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:17,371
Gave me his credit card and said to have check-in...

329
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,797
...let me in the room so I won't get into mischief.

330
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,416
Ma'am, sometimes I do get into mischief.

331
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,759
We all do.

332
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,012
Merry Christmas.

333
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,725
No sign of him.

334
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,811
We'll need to be in touch.
You have hotel rooms?

335
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:41,402
- Yeah.
- Do you have a recent photo of him?

336
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,400
I have one in my wallet.

337
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,321
I don't have my wallet.

338
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,454
My wallet's in my bag.

339
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,415
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport.
He has my wallet.

340
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,755
- Did you have credit cards?
- Credit cards, money...

341
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,255
We'll notify the credit card companies.

342
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,089
If your son has the cards,
we can get a location on him when he uses them.

343
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:09,219
I don't think he knows how to use a credit card.

344
00:30:12,188 --> 00:30:13,268
Wow! It worked!

345
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:19,401
- Cedric.
- Yes?

346
00:30:19,655 --> 00:30:22,739
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

347
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:27,323
And find out everything you can about that young fellow.

348
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,242
Front, please!

349
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:37,086
Enjoy your stay with us.

350
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:40,253
Don't forget to remind your dad, when he arrives...

351
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:43,386
...he must come down and sign a couple of things.

352
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:46,847
- Thank you, you've been helpful.
- CEDRIC: May I take your bag?

353
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,189
Up here to your left.

354
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:56,652
Herbert Hoover once stayed on this floor.

355
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:58,231
The vacuum guy?

356
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,694
No, the president.

357
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:08,414
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

358
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,215
This is great!

359
00:31:23,598 --> 00:31:27,181
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

360
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,729
Luxurious and spacious.

361
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,190
How convenient.

362
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,071
Hey.

363
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:55,126
Did you want the key in the bag?
Or did you want to hang on to it?

364
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,757
I'll hang on to it.

365
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:01,798
Everything all right?

366
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:04,339
- Is the temperature okay?
- It's okay.

367
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:08,426
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

368
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:10,980
Well...

369
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:15,850
I'm sorry.

370
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:23,954
And there's plenty more where that came from.

371
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:27,660
Thank you.

372
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:57,728
Would you mind if I worked on my cannonballs?

373
00:32:58,532 --> 00:32:59,532
No.

374
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,326
Thanks.

375
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,252
KEVIN: Yikes!

376
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:40,065
This is a vacation.

377
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:42,536
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

378
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,913
<i>It's me, Johnny.</i>

379
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,666
<i>I knew it was you.</i>

380
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,664
<i>I could smell you getting off the elevator.</i>

381
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:54,789
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three, I'm not driving.

382
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:59,054
- DAME: <i>Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.</i>
- Thank you.

383
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,719
<i>You was here last night too, wasn 't you?</i>

384
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,848
<i>I was singing at the Blue Monkey last night.</i>

385
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,469
She was not. She was smooching your brother.

386
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,516
<i>You was here and you was smooching with my brother.</i>

387
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:13,360
- DAME: <i>That's a dirty lie.</i>
- See?

388
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,441
<i>Don't give me that. You been smooching everybody!</i>

389
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,237
<i>Snuffy, Al, Leo...</i>

390
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:23,865
<i>...Little Moe with the gimpy leg,
Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...</i>

391
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,873
<i>I could go on forever, baby.</i>

392
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,750
DAME: <i>You have me all wrong!</i>

393
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:29,002
JOHNNY: <i>All right...</i>

394
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,451
<i>...I believe you.</i>

395
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:33,003
<i>But my Tommy gun don 't!</i>

396
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,795
<i>Johnny!</i>

397
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:37,212
<i>You're the only duck in my pond!</i>

398
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,099
<i>Get down on your knees and tell me you love me.</i>

399
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:43,143
DAME: <i>Baby! I'm over the moon for you!</i>

400
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:45,179
<i>You gotta do better than that!</i>

401
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:50,980
<i>If my love was an ocean,
Lindy'd have to take two planes to get across it.</i>

402
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:55,440
<i>Maybe I'm off my hinges, but I believe you.</i>

403
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:58,240
<i>That's why I'm letting you go.</i>

404
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,705
<i>I'm gonna give you till the count of three,
to get your lousy...</i>

405
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:04,165
<i>...lying...</i>

406
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:08,123
<i>...lowdown, four-flushing carcass out my door!</i>

407
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:10,254
She's rat bait.

408
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:11,548
<i>One!</i>

409
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:13,842
<i>Two!</i>

410
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,223
(LAUGHING)

411
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:23,727
<i>Three!</i>

412
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:27,183
<i>Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.</i>

413
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:31,144
<i>And a Happy New Year.</i>

414
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,230
Housekeeping.

415
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:50,771
FRANK OVER RECORDER: <i>We know a guy who can do the cool jerk</i>

416
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:56,236
<i>We know a guy who can do the cool jerk</i>

417
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:59,946
<i>This cat they're talkin ' about</i>

418
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,786
<i>I wonder who could it be</i>

419
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:05,960
<i>'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat</i>

420
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:09,130
<i>The heaviest cat you ever did see</i>

421
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:12,052
<i>When they see me
Walkin ' down the street</i>

422
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:14,972
<i>None of the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey, hey</i>

423
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,051
<i>On their faces they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know</i>

424
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:22,639
<i>I'm the king of the cool jerks</i>

425
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,894
<i>Get out of here, you pervert, or I'll slap you silly!</i>

426
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:31,478
Uh...

427
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,442
<i>Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.</i>

428
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:40,200
Oh, my foot!

429
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:15,655
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

430
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,170
Uncle Rob lives here.

431
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:37,767
If they're back from Paris, I'll drop in on them.

432
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:40,682
They usually give pretty good presents.

433
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,586
Good night, Mom.

434
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,878
Good night, Kevin.

435
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,533
Your drawers, sir.

436
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,578
Don't flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!

437
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,505
I was very careful, sir.

438
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,463
You can't be too careful with underwear.

439
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:28,840
I understand.

440
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,927
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

441
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:36,556
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

442
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:39,351
No tip?

443
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:41,012
Okay.

444
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:44,357
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

445
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:50,195
The doorman will be happy to find you a taxi...

446
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,910
Mr. McCallister.

447
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:56,535
Excuse me.

448
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,913
Sure.

449
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,122
And how are we this morning?

450
00:41:03,382 --> 00:41:06,502
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

451
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,168
A limousine and a pizza.

452
00:41:09,388 --> 00:41:11,049
Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

453
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:14,642
I do hope your father understands that last night...

454
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:18,429
...I was simply checking to see
that everything was in order.

455
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:20,226
Oh, he was pretty mad.

456
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:21,525
He was?

457
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:25,187
He said he didn't come here to have his naked rear spied on.

458
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:27,442
Of course not.

459
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,657
Will he be down soon?

460
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,073
He already left.

461
00:41:33,873 --> 00:41:36,993
I would've liked to have offered my personal apology.

462
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:40,585
If a guy saw you in the shower, would you want to see him?

463
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:42,875
I suppose not.

464
00:41:43,174 --> 00:41:45,167
I don't think you'll see him again.

465
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,167
I understand.

466
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,051
Bye.

467
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,434
Have a lovely day.

468
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:05,819
McCallister...

469
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:21,334
- Good morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Morning.

470
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:31,801
Mr. McCallister, here's your very own...

471
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,638
...cheese pizza.

472
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:57,785
- Hello?
- Hello.

473
00:42:58,004 --> 00:42:59,415
Know any good toy stores?

474
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:01,465
Yes, sir.

475
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:14,349
Ahh.

476
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,986
Bingo!

477
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:39,380
Get outta here! Go on, get outta here! Get outta here!

478
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,832
Beat it! Beat it! Get outta here!

479
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:45,794
Hey, Marv! Get over here! I gotta talk to you!

480
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,477
Whoa, whoa!

481
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:03,445
- Would you like a scarf?
- Forget about that, we gotta talk.

482
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:09,031
We don't have the equipment to pull off anything big:

00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:13,579
We don't want goods.
We need cash and we need it now.

484
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:15,038
How about...

485
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:16,493
...hotels?

486
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,463
Tourists carry lots of cash.

487
00:44:18,674 --> 00:44:23,585
I got a better idea.
Stores ain't depositing cash on Christmas Eve.

488
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:29,013
The stores that will have cash are the ones
dealing in moderate priced goods.

489
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:30,466
Right. Right.

490
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:34,429
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve...

491
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:36,482
...that nobody's gonna rob?

492
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:38,433
Candy stores.

493
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:41,737
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.

494
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:44,616
This is what I had in mind:

495
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,575
That's brilliant, Harry! Brilliant!

496
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:55,666
Nobody's dumb enough to knock off a toy store
on Christmas Eve.

497
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,754
Oh, yes, there is.

So, what's the plan?

506
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:40,440
Everyone leaves for a holiday off.
We come out of our houses.

507
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:44,953
Yeah, then what?

508
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:47,488
We empty the registers and walk out.

Great plan, Harry!

511
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:55,998

- I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

- I have a lot of grandmothers.
- Oh.

522
00:47:28,376 --> 00:47:30,000
Well, that explains it.

523
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:36,459
This is a nice store.
One of the finer toy dealerships I've visited.

524
00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:37,707
Well, thank you.

525
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:39,885
Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...

526
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:43,181
...letting kids come in here and play with his toys.

527
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:45,343
Most toy stores prohibit that.

528
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,723
- Is that so?
- Yes.

529
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:49,221
Well, he loves kids.

530
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:53,610
As a matter of fact,
all the money the store takes in today...

531
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:57,028
...Mr. Duncan is donating to the Children's Hospital.

532
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,363
And the day after Christmas...

533
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,742
...we empty out all the money in the cash register...

534
00:48:02,954 --> 00:48:06,121
...and Mr. Duncan takes it right down to the hospital.

535
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,780
That's generous of him.

536
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:11,335
Well, children bring him a lot of joy...

537
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,839
...as they do to everyone who appreciates them.

538
00:48:20,556 --> 00:48:25,515
I'm not supposed to spend this,
but I have $20 in a jar in our garage...

539
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:29,678
...where my brother can't find it.
So I can pay my mother back.

540
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,939
So give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

541
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:38,733
Besides, I'll probably spend it on stuff
that will rot my teeth and mind.

542
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:44,863
Ah, that's...
That's very sweet of you.

You see that tree there?

544
00:48:48,086 --> 00:48:51,751
Well, to show our appreciation for your generosity...

545
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:54,670
...I'll let you select an object from that tree...

546
00:48:54,884 --> 00:48:58,004
...to take home with you.
- For free?

547
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:02,093
- May I make a suggestion?
- Okay.

548
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,432
Take the turtledoves.

549
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:06,391
I can have two?

550
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:10,983
Well, "two turtledoves."
And I tell you what you do.

551
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:12,813
You keep one...

552
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:17,022
...and give the other one to a very special person.

553
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,491
You see, turtledoves...

554
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:23,031
...are a symbol of friendship and love.

555
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:26,783
Now, as long as each of you have your turtledove...

556
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:29,617
...you'll be friends forever.

I thought they were just part of a song.

Do you know what happened?

800
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:12,639

01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,763
A person's heart and feelings
are very different than skates.

They're kind of the same thing.

If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.

01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:31,904
When you do decide to try it, it won't be any good.

806
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:33,628
You should take a chance.

807
01:11:33,653 --> 01:11:34,940
Got nothing to lose.

808
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:38,333
Little truth in there somewhere.

809
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:39,691
I think so.

810
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,025
Your heart might still be broken, but it isn't gone.

811
01:11:43,259 --> 01:11:45,548
If it was gone, you wouldn't be so nice.

812

Thank you.

813
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:52,301
Do you know it's been...

814

...a couple of years since I've talked to anybody?

815
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,600
That's okay. You're good at it.

816
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:01,529
You're not boring. You don't mumble or spit.

817
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:03,487
You should do it more often.

818
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:06,990

(LAUGHS)

820
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:13,705
I have been working very hard at keeping people away.

821
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:16,532
I always think I'll have a lot of fun if I'm alone...

822
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:19,167
...but when I'm alone, it's not fun.

823
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:22,288
I don't care how much people bug me...

824
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:25,007
...I'd rather be with someone than alone.

825
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:29,009
So what are you doing alone on Christmas Eve?

826
01:12:29,559 --> 01:12:31,017
Did you get into trouble?

827
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,019
Yeah.

828
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:34,598
You did something wrong?

829
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,231
A lot of things.

830
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:42,312
Did you know that a good deed erases a bad deed?

831
01:12:42,656 --> 01:12:45,325
It's late. I don't know if I'll have enough time...

832
01:12:45,576 --> 01:12:48,577
...to do enough good deeds to erase all my bad ones.

833
01:12:48,954 --> 01:12:52,205
It's Christmas Eve. Good deeds count extra tonight.

834
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,127
- They do?
- Of course they do.

835
01:12:55,378 --> 01:12:59,162
Think of an important thing you can do for others...

836
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:00,794
...and go do it.

837
01:13:01,509 --> 01:13:04,214
Just follow the star in your heart.

838
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:07,379
Okay.

839
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:10,936
It's getting pretty late. I'd better get going.

840
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:21,479

855

I think you'll find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by a countess.

856

01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:51,312
Why did you let him leave?

they're looking for Kevin.

...we're no longer the Wet Mandits,
we're the Sticky Mandits.

1140
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,358
MARV: That's sticky. S...

1141
01:46:03,496 --> 01:46:04,907
...T...

1142
01:46:05,498 --> 01:46:07,076
HARRY: I.
MARV: I.

1143
01:46:19,221 --> 01:46:22,756
COP: It's all over.
We apprehended the thieves and got your money.

1144
01:46:23,017 --> 01:46:26,386
MR. DUNCAN:
I want to get that money over to the Children's Hospital.

1145
01:46:26,604 --> 01:46:29,309
COP: I'll handle it.
MR. DUNCAN: Thank you.

1146
01:46:30,108 --> 01:46:31,353
Excuse me.

1147
01:46:31,693 --> 01:46:35,276
I found this note. Looks like a kid broke your window.

1148
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:37,234
KEVIN: <i>Dear Mr. Duncan:</i>

1149
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:40,278
<i>I broke your window to catch the bad guys.</i>

1150
01:46:40,536 --> 01:46:42,030
<i>Do you have insurance?</i>

1151
01:46:42,287 --> 01:46:45,739
<i>If not, I'll send you some money, if I ever get home.</i>

1152
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,957
<i>Merry Christmas. Kevin McCallister.</i>

1153
01:46:48,294 --> 01:46:50,999
<i>P. S. Thanks for the turtledoves.</i>

1154
01:46:52,215 --> 01:46:53,875
Turtledoves.

1155
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:56,214
Oh.

1156
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:06,265
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son. This boy here.

1157
01:47:09,108 --> 01:47:13,022
Please help me. This boy right here. Have you seen him?

1158
01:47:18,034 --> 01:47:19,034
(KNOCKS)

1159
01:47:22,163 --> 01:47:25,579
I'm looking for my son. He's been missing for two days.

1160
01:47:25,834 --> 01:47:28,669
- Have you filed a report?
- Of course we have.

1161
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:33,300
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

1162
01:47:35,094 --> 01:47:36,256
Oh.

1163
01:47:38,347 --> 01:47:39,347
I'm his mother.

1164
01:47:41,058 --> 01:47:43,728
I know, but you're looking for a needle in a haystack.

1165
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:46,392
Do you have kids?

1166
01:47:47,732 --> 01:47:48,732
Yes, ma'am.

1167
01:47:48,858 --> 01:47:50,566
What if one was missing?

1168
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:55,646
I'd probably do the same thing you're doing.

1169
01:47:56,992 --> 01:47:58,071
Thank you.

1170
01:48:00,829 --> 01:48:02,621
Put yourself in his shoes.

1171
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,949
What would you do?

1172
01:48:05,209 --> 01:48:08,578
Me? I'd probably be lying dead in a gutter somewhere.

1173
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:11,506
But not Kevin.

1174
01:48:11,716 --> 01:48:15,381
No. Kevin is so much stronger and braver than I am.

1175
01:48:16,304 --> 01:48:18,926
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.

1176
01:48:20,517 --> 01:48:23,187
But he's still alone in a big city.

1177
01:48:24,104 --> 01:48:25,896
He doesn't deserve that.

1178
01:48:26,148 --> 01:48:30,609
He deserves to be at home
with his own family around his Christmas tree.

1179
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,615
Oh, dear God...

1180
01:48:36,534 --> 01:48:38,076
...I know where he is.

1181
01:48:38,787 --> 01:48:41,360
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

1182
01:48:41,623 --> 01:48:43,865
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1183
01:48:48,172 --> 01:48:52,335
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

1184
01:48:53,302 --> 01:48:54,844
I don't want any presents.

1185
01:48:55,179 --> 01:48:59,129
Instead, I want to take back every mean thing
I ever said to my family...

1186
01:48:59,392 --> 01:49:01,598
...even if they don't do the same.

1187
01:49:02,187 --> 01:49:06,101
I don't care. I love all of them. Including Buzz.

1188
01:49:07,192 --> 01:49:10,478
If I can't see all of them, could I just see my mother?

1189
01:49:11,363 --> 01:49:15,443
I'll never want another thing, ever. I just want my mother.

1190
01:49:16,035 --> 01:49:17,493
I know it won't be tonight...

1191
01:49:17,828 --> 01:49:20,548
...but promise me I can see her again.

1192
01:49:20,573 --> 01:49:21,897
Sometime. Anytime.

1193
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:26,244
Even if it's just once and only for a few minutes.

1194
01:49:26,588 --> 01:49:28,876
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

1195
01:49:37,307 --> 01:49:38,683
Kevin?

1196
01:49:44,899 --> 01:49:45,899
Mom?

1197
01:49:48,444 --> 01:49:50,152
That worked fast!

1198
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:02,541
Oh, Kevin.

1199
01:50:04,086 --> 01:50:05,746
Mom, I'm sorry.

1200
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:09,214
I'm sorry too.

1201
01:50:21,813 --> 01:50:23,355
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1202
01:50:25,734 --> 01:50:27,810
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1203
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:30,780
Thank you.

1204
01:50:31,448 --> 01:50:32,528
Let's go.

1205
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:34,826
KEVIN: How'd you know I was here?

1206
01:50:35,077 --> 01:50:37,829
KATE: I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest.

1207
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,325
KEVIN: Where's everyone else?

1208
01:50:39,582 --> 01:50:40,672
KATE: At the hotel.

1209
01:50:40,697 --> 01:50:42,524
They didn't like palm trees either.

1210
01:51:04,942 --> 01:51:07,516
(SNORING)

1211
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:28,998
Holy smokes, it's morning!

1212
01:51:30,386 --> 01:51:32,711
FULLER: It's Christmas morning, man.

1213
01:51:33,848 --> 01:51:35,841
Don't get your hopes up.

1214
01:51:36,392 --> 01:51:37,392
Huh?

1215
01:51:37,519 --> 01:51:39,393
I don't think Santa visits hotels.

1216
01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:41,936
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1217
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:43,643
He goes everywhere.

1218
01:51:45,486 --> 01:51:47,194
Wake up, it's Christmas!

1219
01:51:51,867 --> 01:51:54,109
Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!

1220
01:52:06,633 --> 01:52:08,127
BUZZ: Wow.

1221
01:52:08,385 --> 01:52:09,844
ROD: Where'd it come from?

1222
01:52:10,095 --> 01:52:12,551
KEVIN: Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

1223
01:52:16,393 --> 01:52:17,971
- My gosh!
- Peter!

1224
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:20,597
BUZZ: Are we in the right room?

1225
01:52:26,196 --> 01:52:27,856
Don't open any of mine.

1226
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:30,991
- Who's Mr. Duncan?
- Duncan? I don't know.

1227
01:52:31,493 --> 01:52:32,821
Everybody calm down.

1228
01:52:33,161 --> 01:52:35,284
Calm down!

1229
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:37,617
All right. Now...

1230
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:41,743
...if Kevin hadn't screwed up in the first place, again...

1231
01:52:42,463 --> 01:52:45,036
...we wouldn't be in this most perfect...

1232
01:52:45,299 --> 01:52:48,004
...and huge hotel room with all this free stuff.

1233
01:52:48,803 --> 01:52:49,803
So...

1234
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:53,470
...I think it only fair
that Kevin get to open the first gift.

1235
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:57,598
Then I'll go and the rest of you and so on.

1236
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:03,775
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1237
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:06,521
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1238
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,200
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1239
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:13,742
All right! Merry Christmas!

1240
01:53:15,999 --> 01:53:17,030
Enough gooey sh...

1241
01:53:18,001 --> 01:53:19,343
Show of emotion.

1242
01:53:19,368 --> 01:53:20,694
Everyone, let's dig in!

1243
01:53:23,423 --> 01:53:27,421
LESLIE: Everybody, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1244
01:54:03,508 --> 01:54:05,335
Merry Christmas.

1245
01:54:07,554 --> 01:54:08,554
Kevin!

1246
01:54:08,763 --> 01:54:10,423
Merry Christmas!

1247
01:54:11,266 --> 01:54:12,594
I got something for you.

1248
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:22,110
What's this?

1249
01:54:22,736 --> 01:54:25,488
It's a turtledove. I have one. You have one.

1250
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:29,524
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1251
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:36,078
Oh, Kevin.

1252
01:54:38,879 --> 01:54:40,337
Thank you.

1253
01:54:41,798 --> 01:54:44,468
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1254
01:55:12,539 --> 01:55:14,532
The room service bill, sir.

1255
01:55:16,877 --> 01:55:18,253
Merry Christmas.

1256
01:55:19,547 --> 01:55:21,125
Uh, oh.

1257
01:55:24,844 --> 01:55:26,173
Nice family.

1258
01:55:26,429 --> 01:55:27,509
Really.

1259
01:55:36,857 --> 01:55:38,435
Merry Christmas indeed.

1260
01:55:42,279 --> 01:55:43,655
PETER: Kevin!

1261
01:55:43,906 --> 01:55:46,694
You spent $967 on room service?!

1262
01:59:59,887 --> 02:00:01,347
