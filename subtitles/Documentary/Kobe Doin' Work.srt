Let's go out on an adventure tonight, huh?
-Can't.

You mean the routine
where I date models?

Please
don't call her that.

That makes it sound like
you're saying she's --

39
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,362
It's
a literary reference...

From the menu at long john silver's.
-...From "moby dick."

That have stood in the way
of our dates.

But tonight,
all that's about to change,

"nuffin"?

She blew you off again,
didn't she?

She did not!

in the fire of --

162
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,056
Neal, I think on this we're
just gonna have to agree to --

163
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,437
What was that?
Neal?

164
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,596
Boob city.

165
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:25,474
I never thought
I'd say this,

166
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,267
But I want to
get with that goat girl.

167
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,148
Really?

168
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,883
She bailed on me

169
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,451
To go to some pretentious
hipster bar with no sign?

170
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,352
That's right.

171
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,220
Use that anger.

172
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:42,089
And you know they're selling
$15 cocktails served in mason jars.

173
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:44,258
And sure,
they'll be delicious,

174
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,128
But will that justify
the terrible service?

175
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:48,896
I mean, maybe,

176
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:49,964
If they're making their own
juices and simple syrups.

177
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,266
Kinda
losing the anger here.

178
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,534
But they probably aren't!

179
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,369
And it's back!
Let's go!

180
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,460
Yeah!

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,242
Tyler?

182
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,077
Shame on you.

183
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,847
You cancel on me
for some "family thing,"

184
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,349
And now I find you here

185
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:10,386
With all these well-dressed
people of varying ages

186
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,988
And floral arrangements
and a giant photo

187
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,714
Of a guy whose name
I'm guessing is not rip...

188
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,084
...Because this is a wake.

189
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,865
So, shame on you...

190
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,100
For thinking
I wouldn't come down here

191
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,269
And comfort you
in your time of need.

192
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:31,130
Oh, tyler.
Mm-hmm.

193
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,487
Tyler, I can't believe You came
down here to comfort me like this.

194
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,921
Please believe that.

195
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,310
I have to go
check on my grandmother,

196
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,501
But I'll be right back.

197
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,171
You're amazing.

198
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,152
Well played. Very smooth.

199
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,153
You made me
crash a wake!

200
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,188
I know!

201
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,181
I'm sad!
I'm sad, too!

202
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,561
See, I told you katelyn
wasn't blowing me off.

203
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,596
You were right.
Now let's get out of here.

204
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,332
I heard about a secret village
under madison square garden

205
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,435
Where patrick ewing
will wrestle anybody for $100.

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,605
I can't just -- where the hell
did you hear about that?

207
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,308
From a guy who wrestled
patrick ewing!

208
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,576
I can't leave now.

209
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,944
I've been chasing this girl
for months.

210
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,211
Because she's
your white whale.

211
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,113
Will you please stop
calling her that?

212
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,248
But yes.

213
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,482
And I'm not
gonna throw away

214
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,084
The first real chance
I have with her.

215
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,218
Just give me 15 minutes.

216
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,920
Fine.
You've got 15 minutes.

217
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,388
I'm gonna get a drink.

218
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,182
But remember, patrick ewing
isn't gonna wrestle himself.

219
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,152
Although, I heard for 200 bucks,
he might.

220
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,966
Hello, sir.

221
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,968
I will take your most expensive
scotch in your tallest glass.

222
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,694
Thank you.

223
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,980
Cousin stanley?

224
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,406
Is that you?

225
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,418
Yeah, it's me --
cousin stanley.

226
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,486
It's gus!

227
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,654
Gus! Right!

228
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,056
Your great uncle!

229
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,992
There it is!
Great uncle gus! Of course!

230
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,126
Good to see you, man!

231
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,961
[ laughs ]

232
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,296
Look, fellas!

233
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,998
Look what the patriotic cat
dragged in!

234
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,299
Cousin stanley made it!

235
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,459
How are you back
from the war already?

236
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,238
We won!

237
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,240
[ cheers ]

238
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,677
I think I just got shot down
by a half-woman/half-goat.

239
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,013
What'd you say?
Well, I asked her

240
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,447
If she wanted to get out of here
and grab a drink.

241
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,416
[ all groan ]

242
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,451
Gibbs,
everyone on this line is here

243
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,420
Because they want to be
transported

244
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,588
To the world of magic
and wonder that <i>is</i>

245
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:44,158
"ice knights of drogar vi:
A fire and song" --

246
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,394
Neal...
What is your point?

247
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,262
My point is
you got to respect the game.

248
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,664
I respect the hell
out of the game.

249
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,589
Really?
What's it called?

250
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,737
I said it
pretty recently.

251
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,338
Yeah.

252
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,141
"ice knuckles
of drunk girls four."

253
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,677
Look, neal,
Milo’s right.

254
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,346
I have been in a rut -- same types
of women, same conversations.

255
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,014
But these girls
are different.

256
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,682
I just need to know
how to speak their language.

257
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:09,683
Help me.

258
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,085
I will, but only because

259
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,620
I believe your intentions
are pure.

260
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:16,289
Ish.

261
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,058
Listen well,
my young apprentice,

262
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,059
For the journey ahead
is infinite and --

263
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,629
You got three minutes.
I can work with that.

264
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:27,567
So, that's my aunt penny
and her husband, lenny.

265
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:32,072
And -- brace yourself --
their son, kenny.

266
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:35,175
So you're, what, like,
three-quarters dr. Seuss?

267
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,643
[ laughs ]
shut up.

268
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,378
I will not shut up.

269
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,580
I will not shut up at a wake.
I will not shut up on a lake.

270
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,515
[ laughs ]

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,585
As we used to say
in our tank battalion --

272
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,810
Down the hatch!

273
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,657
I thought you said
you were a pilot.

274
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,417
Yup -- flying tanks.

275
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,371
Highly classified.

276
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,516
Highly awesome.

277
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,396
You know, I think

278
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,365
We should probably cool it
with the drinking.

279
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,733
You're right.
We're at a wake.

280
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,535
We don't want to
get carried away.

281
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,103
Oh, no, no.

282
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:10,906
I just thought
we should go smoke

283
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,898
Some of my
glaucoma medicine.

284
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,737
Mission: Impossible...
To turn down.

285
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:22,420
'tis true
what the elders say.

286
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:26,524
Wood nymphs are
the most beautiful creatures

287
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,926
Of our forest.

288
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,661
Tell me, good swordsman,

289
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:32,831
Whereupon your person
did you etch your speech?

290
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:35,491
On-eth my hand.

291
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,069
Alas,
I must take my leave.

292
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:39,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

293
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:40,805
I am new to this world

294
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,407
And was rendered speechless
by your beauty.

295
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,076
Did I offendeth
thy thouness-eth?

296
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:48,113
No, it's just this twig bra
is super uncomfortable.

297
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:50,548
I have the same problem
with my pine-cone thong.

298
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,950
[ both laugh ]

299
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:55,453
They call me Drusilla.

300
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:59,047
They call me...
Gibbs...Eses.

301
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:02,593
The eulogies
are about to start.

302
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:04,095
I gotta get my mom
out of the bathroom.

303
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,429
Will you save me a seat?

304
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:06,797
Well, I don't know...

305
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,866
You might have to fight off
your great-aunt irene.

306
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,034
She seems pretty into me.

307
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,702
I think I can take her.

308
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:14,639
She's lost a step since she got
her foot amputated.

309
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:16,164
[ both laugh ]

310
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,580
Oh, my god.
That's so good.

311
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:24,515
Hey, I don't want to
jinx anything,

312
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,717
But I believe
I've landed the white whale.

313
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:31,521
When I die, I want to be buried
with a sandwich like this.

314
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:32,989
No, no, no.

315
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:36,860
I want to be buried
<i>in </i> a sandwich like this.

316
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:38,128
Milo, are you high?

317
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:41,498
Yes.

318
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:44,167
But around here, you got to
call me "cousin stanley,"

319
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:47,470
Because I'm pretending to be
a guy they call cousin stanley.

320
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:48,671
Damn it.

321
00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:49,939
I need you
to pull it together right now

322
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,608
So you don't screw up
my thing with katelyn.

323
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,477
Hey, my thing has nothing to do
with your thing.

324
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:55,569
Boop!

325
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,481
Relax. You won't even know
that I'm here.

326
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:03,486
As you all know, I've never
been one for speeches.

327
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:07,714
So, cousin stanley,
why don't you get on up here?!

328
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:11,761
You bet!

329
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,863
Showtime.

330
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:15,498
What the hell
are you doing?

331
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:17,033
Relax,
I have two purple hearts, man.

332
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:18,125
I can handle this.

333
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:23,540
Hey.

334
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,676
I found
the most amazing girl.

335
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,677
She's kinda quirky and funny
and creative.

336
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:29,546
Plus, she's a wood nymph,
so, you know...

337
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:30,882
[ crowd murmurs ]

338
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,883
Yeah! Yeah!

339
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:33,585
Where is she?

340
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,253
Well, she's got a tent way back
at the end of the line.

341
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:38,523
So, I guess now I'm a member
of the "mile-long club."

342
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,125
[ all ooh ]
mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

343
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,727
You're
the coolest guy I know.

344
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,829
And I know a guy
with three dirt bikes.

345
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,731
What's her name?

346
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:49,200
Uh,
Drusilla of the camden forest.

347
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,235
[ all gasp ]

348
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,536
You guys know her?

349
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:52,637
Gibbs...

350
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:54,763
You had sex with my mom!

351
00:13:57,558 --> 00:13:59,535
Our F-14 was in a flat spin...

352
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,038
And goose was dead
before we hit the water.

353
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:05,307
I couldn't deal with it.

354
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:08,477
Every night, I'd ride
my motorcycle up the coast

355
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,813
Wearing
the dopest leather jacket.

356
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:12,749
Isn't this
from "top gun"?

357
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,051
Is it?

358
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:17,644
Or is "top gun"
from <i>this?</i>

359
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,558
I knew I'd never
see my friend again,

360
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,560
No more sing-alongs
at the bar,

361
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,962
No more
shirtless beach volleyball games

362
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,830
Wearing cut-off
jean shorts.

363
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,532
It's kind of hard to describe,
you know?

364
00:14:29,657 --> 00:14:31,701
It's like...

365
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,770
You've lost
that loving feeling.

366
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,905
No, this is <i>definitely</i>
<i>from "top gun."</i>

367
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,840
Does this guy
seem weird to you?

368
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,642
Life's
all about friendship.

369
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,444
Like the first time I went
shrimping with my buddy bubba

370
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,680
And our legless leader,
lieutenant dan.

371
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,850
I couldn't say, really.
You know, war changes people.

372
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:50,320
But I've never met him
before, so --

373
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:51,946
Tyler knows what I'm talking
about. Right, buddy?

374
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,493
I guess there's
another tyler here.

375
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,863
Wait -- how did you know
I was gonna be here today?

376
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:02,033
I read
your grandfather's obituary.

377
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:04,660
The obituary
runs tomorrow.

378
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,073
Spoiler alert?

379
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,766
Unbelievable.

380
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,413
So there it is.

381
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,348
Life moves pretty fast.

382
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:17,550
You don't stop and look around
once in a while,

383
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,684
You could miss it.

384
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:20,920
Does that
answer your question?

385
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,847
Sincerely yours,
"the breakfast club."

386
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,797
Katelyn, I swear
this is not what it looks like.

387
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,565
Oh, good, because it looks like
you brought

388
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,691
Some drunk, delusional hobo
to my grandfather's wake.

389
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,905
Actually,
that's pretty accurate.

390
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,641
I needed to know
if we had a chance.

391
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,944
It's just -- we've had
so many "almost" moments,

392
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,079
And you keep
blowing me off,

393
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:48,915
But there's something about you
that keeps me coming back.

394
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,550
And I thought
by staying here,

395
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:52,553
I'd get a chance
to find out what it is.

396
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:56,523
So, you used my grandfather's
wake as a speed date?

397
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,650
See, your ability to summarize
is one of the things I'm liking.

398
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,765
I guess I never really
gave you a chance.

399
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,158
I just thought you were
some conceited pretty boy.

400
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:09,795
I'm not <i>conceited.</i>

401
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,476
All right, listen.

402
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,411
If you're not busy tomorrow,
the burial's in the morning.

403
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:18,412
You could meet me there,
and we can hang out after.

404
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:19,814
It's a date.

405
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:23,274
And remember, you can't
spell funeral without "fun."

406
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,559
But we will tomorrow.

407
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:32,961
[ chuckles ]

408
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:34,720
[ smooches ]

409
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:37,099
Hey ty.
Ty. Ty.

410
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:38,968
Ty. Ty. Ty.
Ty. Ty. Ty. Ty.

411
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:40,736
Ty. Ty. Ty. Ty. Ty.

412
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:42,505
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What?!
You have my full attention!

413
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,973
Did I screw things up
with katelyn?

414
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:46,576
Actually, uh,
despite your best efforts,

415
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,678
I think the white whale
may finally be a normal whale

416
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,713
That likes me.

417
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:54,449
Great.
Can I borrow 50 bucks?

418
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:58,053
Gus and I are gonna go halvesies
on patrick ewing.

419
00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:59,721
No, you are not.

420
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,715
I'm sorry, sir, but I got to
take this little fella home.

421
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,761
Say goodbye to gus.

422
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,797
Bye to gus!
Sorry for bailing on you, man!

423
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:09,998
It's all right.

424
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:11,800
We had enough adventure
for one night.

425
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,259
We did, didn't we?

426
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,572
Hey, ty,
we got weird tonight.

427
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:17,697
Yes, we did.

428
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,118
Okay, I'll go first.

429
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:30,586
I'm still upset with you.

430
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,522
And even though
I know it's just a game,

431
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,524
For some weird reason,

432
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,894
It feels like you really did
sleep with my mom.

433
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,762
Yeah. But I didn't.

434
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:40,830
Exactly!

435
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,766
Round and round we go,
right?

436
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,168
[ sighs ]
but clearly, we're left

437
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:48,229
With this undeniable tension
between us.

438
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,175
Okay.

439
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,212
So, I think the only way
to make things right

440
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,905
Is for me
to sleep with your mom.

441
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,218
Your virtual mom.

442
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:02,854
Okay.

443
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,556
You would have to create
a character

444
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,158
And then create
that character's mother

445
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:07,726
So I can seduce her.

446
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,895
Which, I know,
it doesn't make us exactly even,

447
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,264
But it's the symbolism
that matters to me.

448
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,565
Okay.

449
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,135
Great! Thanks!

450
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,537
Look, we both said
some things we regret.

451
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,006
The point is, I'm sorry.

452
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,808
And you know what?
Breakfast is on me!

453
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,201
Okay.

454
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,085
We have
an officer and a gentleman.

455
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,653
You wore <i>that</i>
<i>to the funeral?</i>

456
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,922
Cousin stanley
wanted to pay his respects,

457
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:41,593
And this is what someone
of my rank wears to a funeral.

458
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,328
Aren't you supposed to be
on a date?

459
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:44,329
She, uh...

460
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:46,230
She didn't show.
-No way.

461
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,333
She bailed
on her grandfather's funeral?

462
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,801
She had a work thing!

463
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,569
Oh, come on, ty!
You're buying that?

464
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:53,171
People have work things!

465
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,963
You can't handle
the truth.

466
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,309
Fine.

467
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,077
Maybe she did blow me off,

468
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,146
But I think I like it better
when she's my white whale.

469
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:02,881
All potential,
no disappointment.

470
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,149
Except for
the continual disappointment

471
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,651
Of her blowing you off.

472
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,377
You can't handle
the truth!

473
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,590
I just admitted
she blew me off.

474
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,191
Sorry, I've got to
rn this by noon,

475
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,292
So I'm trying
to get 'em all out.

476
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:17,295
Did you order
the code red?!

477
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,187
You're damn right I did!

478
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,025
Yeah.

479
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,734
And "shouldn't have eaten
indian food" mike.

480
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:37,117
Uh-oh. Are you gonna want to go
on another adventure?

481
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,920
Nah, I'm gonna enjoy the routine
for a little while.

482
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,313
That adventure gave me
a massive hangover.

483
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,626
So,
what are we watching here?

484
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,752
We're in the bedroom
of my castle.

485
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:51,955
That's gibbs' mother.

486
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,969
And you're playing
as your mom

487
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:58,838
So neal
can have sex with her?

488
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,641
I guess. I --

489
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,909
All right, gibbs.

490
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,901
That is me
entering the bed chamber.

491
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,849
I am now removing
my armor of invincibility.

492
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:10,849
Oh!
Oh!

493
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,184
Hey, man!
Wow.

494
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:13,619
Didn't know
you went commando

495
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,155
Under
the armor of invincibility.

496
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,824
And now, gibbs,
I am going to even the score

497
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:20,759
With the most
thorough ravaging

498
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,263
Your virtual mother
will ever experience.

499
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:25,956
You're gonna want to
tap "s."

500
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,602
What -- what are you doing?
[ keyboard clacking ]

501
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:31,604
What -- no!
I said "s," not "a"!

502
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:32,739
<i>Aaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

503
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,774
Noooooo!

504
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,744
What just happened?
Your mom killed me!

505
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,613
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to build my character?

506
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:43,149
Sure died easy.

507
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:46,286
It's 'cause
I took my armor off.

508
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,288
I wanted to make it special.

509
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,226
Hey look, your armor
fits my mom. Ha!

510
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,694
All right, mom.

511
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,254
Let's take a walk
around our new castle.
