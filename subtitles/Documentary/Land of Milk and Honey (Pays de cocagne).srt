SOLDIER 1: It's okay, it's okay.
SOLDIER 2: I got it, I got it.

998	
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,122
Watch out.
Watch yourselves.

999
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:41,540
SOLDIER 2: Come on, hurry up.

1000
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:49,215
It's me, we are at the church.

1001
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:51,884
No dinner tonight for the painter, okay?

1002
01:54:51,968 --> 01:54:52,968
Understand?

1003
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:56,847
(GUNS FIRING IN THE DISTANCE)

1004
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:12,483
Are you surprised to see me alive,
you Turkish pig!

1005
01:57:16,655 --> 01:57:17,821
Why are you here?

1006
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:19,073
To be with you.

1007
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,324
Where did you go that night?

1008
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:23,118
(SCREAMS)

1009
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:27,289
Were you with your Muslim friends?
Did you tell them I was in the church?

1010
01:57:36,383 --> 01:57:37,591
I saw your sister.

1011
01:57:45,934 --> 01:57:47,226
I'm sorry.

1012
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,566

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING
IN THE DISTANCE)

1015
01:58:58,590 --> 01:58:59,590
(IN ENGLISH)
Hey!

1016
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:02,134
Stop!

1017
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,721
I said stop!

1018
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,099
Raise your hands up.

1019
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:13,812
Stop!

1020
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,733
Put your hands up.

1021
01:59:27,952 --> 01:59:30,245
My name is Danijel Vukojevich.

1022
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:34,416
I am a war criminal.

1023
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:44,468
My name is Danijel Vukojevich.

1024
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:48,806
I am a war criminal.

1025
02:00:29,723 --> 02:00:33,809
For three and a half years,
the international community failed

1026
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:38,063
to decisively intervene
and stop the war in Bosnia.

1027
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:41,984
The siege of Sarajevo was the longest
in modern history.

1028
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:48,657
Across the country, 1 in every 2 Bosnians was
forced to flee their homes.

1029
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:52,661
During the war, as many as fifty thousand
Bosnian women were raped,

1030
02:00:52,829 --> 02:00:56,665
leading to the first conviction
for sexual violence,

1031
02:00:56,833 --> 02:01:00,377
on its own,
as a crime against humanity.

1032
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:08,343
The war in Bosnia was 
the deadliest conflict in
Europe since World War ll.

1033
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:13,682
Since 1995, an uneasy peace has prevailed
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

1034
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:18,729
Still deep divisions remain,
and the struggle
for reconciliation continues.
