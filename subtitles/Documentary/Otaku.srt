1
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,656
Yoriko!

2
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,158
Huh?

3
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,928
Let's...

4
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,496
...hold hands?

5
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:44,497
What?

6
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,174
...or not...

7
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,377
You don't want to?

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,013
No. I mean...

9
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,281
I don't mind.

10
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:03,282
Oh!

11
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:12,692
Wow. It's beautiful!

12
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:32,284
Makes you kind of nervous, doesn't it...

13
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:37,856
Yes.

14
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,958
Hinata...

15
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,961
Do you like holding hands?

16
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:49,962
Yes! But, err...

17
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:57,570
Not as much as I like you!

18
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,618
Yoriko...

19
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:11,089
Will you...

20
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,895
go out with me?

21
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,896
Oh...

22
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,800
Oh?

23
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,670
Um...

24
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:30,075
There's something I should probably
tell you first...

25
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:36,114
Yes?

26
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,950
Promise me you won't freak out
after you hear it...

27
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,070
I promise. I won't freak out,

28
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:44,189
and I won't hate you or anything.

29
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,491
Um...

30
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:51,029
I'm...

31
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,665
an Otaku...

32
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,434
Are you cool with that?

33
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,102
Huh?

34
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:03,242
Actually, in my case...

35
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,044
It's called a Fujoshi Otaku...

36
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,446
Are you freaking out?!

37
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,750
What? A Fujoshi...

38
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,252
That's normal, isn't it?

39
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,721
Aah, no... not that... um...

40
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:19,191
The word you're thinking of is spelt
a little differently...

41
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,226
I don't care if you are an Otaku...

42
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:27,065
or a Fujoshi or whatever...

43
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,368
I...

44
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:36,369
love you, Yoriko.

45
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,947
Me too...

46
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:48,948
I...

47
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:54,893
Love you too...

48
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,730
Great!

49
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:03,335
I guess that makes you my boyfriend.

50
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:10,336
Thank you!

51
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:19,138
You taste like cotton candy.

52
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,955
What the...?

53
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,158
Welcome home, Mademoiselle Yoriko.

54
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,660
Welcome home, Mademoiselle!

55
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,665
I am Ashigara, Head Butler
of this establishment.

56
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,335
These are your footmen.
We are at your service.

57
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,406
I am Kagami, Head Footman.

58
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,207
Tonishige, at your service.

59
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:54,146
Mademoiselle Kasumi awaits you inside.

60
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,081
Thank you.

61
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,119
Huh?!

62
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,555
Mademoiselle, your bags...

63
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,790
The Young Master's bags too...

64
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,627
Young Master?

65
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,263
Thank you.

66
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:17,302
This way.

67
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:24,303
Please mind your step.

68
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:34,780
What the...?

69
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:43,989
Welcome home.

70
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,364
Welcome home.

71
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:53,365
Err... I'm home...?

72
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,545
This is Kasumi.

73
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,882
She's into light novels and Internet games,
but mainly anime.

74
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,887
She also makes her own B-L comics.
She is like a mentor to me.

75
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:09,855
B- L?

76
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,423
Boys-Love.

77
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,457
Boys-Love...

78
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,727
Keep it a secret.

79
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,262
Nice to meet you, Hinata.

80
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,397
Nice to meet you.

81
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,433
This is Miki.

82
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,736
Her dress-up name is Milk.
This is her daughter, Mocha.

83
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,072
She is a full-time housewife, but...

84
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,941
Full-time housewife and Fujoshi
start with the same letter 'F'!

85
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,443
Huh?

86
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,745
Oh, yes...

87
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,646
I see.

88
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,148
She's actually quite the popular
Play-R on the Internet.

89
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,583
P... Play-R?

90
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,051
Costume Play-R.

91
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,920
Oh, like dressing up.

92
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:46,725
That's right.

93
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,226
Oh...

94
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,061
Excuse me.

95
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,129
No problem.

96
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,731
Allow me.

97
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:59,732
Please.

98
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,983
Excuse me.

99
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:17,255
Thank you.

100
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,559
What's with the looks?

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,561
He gets embarrassed easily.

102
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,863
How awesome!

103
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:30,435
I do not!

104
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,936
A 'Fujoshi' is an Otaku
girl who goes crazy

105
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:37,436
for the Boys-Love genre...

106
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,245
...which is all about love
between male characters

107
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,546
in a given story.

108
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:48,253
Oh my gosh!

109
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,023
Breaking in the newbie.
It sooo does it for me.

110
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,427
Ohh yes... All that 'training' and 'punishment'!

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,262
It's too much! Actually...

112
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:02,734
I think it is the 'punishment' that gets me...

113
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:07,739
Sorry for putting you out,
meeting here on our home turf like this...

114
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,240
No problem.

115
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,410
I could tell earlier you were thinking,
"Where is she taking me?"

116
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:17,882
You're all excited about your
first butler cafe, aren't you!?!

117
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,118
Well, you wouldn't tell me
where we were going.

118
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,387
I didn't want to ruin the surprise!

119
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,622
I see...

120
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,259
You really are polite, aren't you?
Even when you speak to Yoriko.

121
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,262
I know! How good is it?!

122
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,964
You're so lucky!

123
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,500
I bet it's not easy, going out with Yoriko.

124
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,935
No...

125
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,005
Don't spoil her to much...
She'll just get worse!

126
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:44,009
You should start to treat her normally,
before she gets out of control...

127
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,746
But, she was my boss when I first met her...

128
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:52,083
I guess I kind of got into the habit of
speaking to her like that.

129
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:58,323
Somehow I can't seem to shake it.

130
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,158
This one is dangerous...

131
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,593
What?

132
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,164
Sorry! For a moment there I nearly fell
for someone else's real-life boyfriend!

133
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,266
No problem!

134
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:14,072
That's why I wanted you
to see him for yourself!

135
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,274
Hinata?

136
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,710
You rock!

137
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,578
You're like... a Sebastian!

138
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,280
A Se... se... A what?

139
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,718
A loyal butler serving his mistress!

140
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,888
No way! Your own Sebastian!

141
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:35,860
He seems like a submissive type, too...

142
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,029
You love Yoriko, right?

143
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,568
No one gains anything without sacrifice.

144
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,938
Every gain requires a fair
exchange of value.

145
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,241
That's Alchemy's Law of
Exchange in Equivalence.

146
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,079
Al... Alchemy?

147
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,548
Love is...

148
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,884
Exchange in Equivalence!

149
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,320
I want a ring too!

150
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,989
Check it out... pretty cute, huh?

151
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,191
You want one too, don't you Mocha?

152
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,459
Do you want a ring, Mocha?

153
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,661
Oh...

154
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,730
Exchange... in Equivalence?

155
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:18,731
That's right! Yes!

156
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,072
This story is a record of one guy's

157
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:26,572
struggle to date a Fujoshi Otaku girl.

158
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,768
< How to Date an Otaku Girl >

159
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,603
Yes.

160
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,671
9:30 in front of the station. Ok.

161
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,373
Right.

162
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,941
What?

163
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,210
It will be fine.

164
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,578
Ok.

165
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,481
I understand.

166
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,517
Yes.

167
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:12,518
Ok, see you later then.

168
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,661
Hinata.

169
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,862
Hey, Koji.

170
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,931
You free tomorrow?

171
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,499
Sorry, I've got plans.

172
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,668
What? You going somewhere?

173
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,370
Something like that.

174
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,540
Yoriko?

175
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,341
Who's Yoriko?

176
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,944
Hinata's girlfriend.

177
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,814
He met her at his part-time job.

178
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,448
So she's older than you then?

179
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,817
Yes.

180
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,952
Pretty impressive!

181
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,955
Yeah, I guess she is...

182
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:44,856
Huh?

183
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,324
Err... nothing.

184
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,293
So what's on tomorrow?

185
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,295
Nothing. I thought we could
maybe do that report...

186
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,462
Sorry.

187
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,031
Don't worry about it. See you later.

188
00:13:53,032 --> 00:14:00,032
See you.

189
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,978
"Hinata 4 Yoriko"

190
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:13,979
I remember the day I fell in love.

191
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,258
Yoriko!

192
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:27,259
Yes.

193
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,681
This is Hinata.
He'll be working with us part-time.

194
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:50,255
He'll be working under you,
so I'll get you to show him the ropes.

195
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:57,256
My name is Yoriko. Nice to meet you.

196
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,665
My name is H... Hinata.

197
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:07,666
It's a pleasure to meet you.

198
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,747
Let's get started then.

199
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,882
Oh... Ok.

200
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,252
And now...

201
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,089
Hurry up, Hinata!

202
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,092
Yes. Yes... and this one too!

203
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,194
And this one!

204
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,232
And that one and that one!

205
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,870
So many to choose from... look at that one!

206
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,371
And this! Gotta have this!

207
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,707
Don't you think you are overdoing it?

208
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:47,645
But you can't normally get
these anthology back numbers!

209
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,581
This is awesome. Such a massive trove!

210
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:55,286
This place is too good to be true!
It's got everything I could ever want!

211
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,090
Thank you staff.
Thank you pundits. Good job!

212
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,693
Excuse me, but I don't understand half of
what you're talking about.

213
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,828
You will... you will.

214
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,229
What do you mean?

215
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:12,230
This is what makes the daily grind
all worthwhile, right?!

216
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,005
Um...

217
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,507
I thought we were going on a date today...

218
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,810
I can't help that we ran into
Kasumi by chance...

219
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,178
Chance?

220
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,182
"Concerto Symphonia"

221
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,485
"Girls Comics"

222
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,720
This is like your gathering place...

223
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,921
Oh my gosh!

224
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,992
New issues! Yes!

225
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,994
Everyone's looking at you...

226
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,864
Yes! Yes! Yes!

227
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,833
New issues! New Issues!

228
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,103
Yesss!

229
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,838
Umm...

230
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,843
It might be just me,
but I think everyone is staring!

231
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,511
Yep, they're staring.

232
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,849
No, you're right. They are staring.

233
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,951
What?

234
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:04,856
Not many guys come to places like this.

235
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,090
Why did you bring me here?

236
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:13,091
Because you said: "Wow, a B-L store.
I want to see what one is like. "

237
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,265
I never said that!

238
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,335
- Don't worry, I will train you in B-L ways.
- No way!

239
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,870
He-y!

240
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,639
Are you still deciding?

241
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,476
Yeah... wish I could see inside.

242
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:30,281
Don't be fooled by the excessive effort
they put into the covers.

243
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,819
You know how the saying goes.
You need to see the truth. Then decide!

244
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,988
O- oh...

245
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:43,989
He who shoots often will
surely hit the mark!

246
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,805
She's having a ball!

247
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,642
It's not the kind of interest
you can bring up easily...

248
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,576
Huh?

249
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,812
Sebsy!

250
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:07,085
Ye-s!

251
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,719
Milk.

252
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,088
Hey. How was the harvest?

253
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,722
Great.

254
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,925
Sorry. I guess we had a little too much fun.

255
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,560
The sacrifices I make being a mother...

256
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,929
I guess so...

257
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,133
Mocha, Mocha, come here.

258
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,236
I want heaps of comics too!

259
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,773
When you're older and you
get a job. Let's go.

260
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,909
No! You mustn't grow up to be like them!

261
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,845
Right?

262
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,247
Hinata, we're going!

263
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,683
Yes...

264
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,320
Too many books for one person...

265
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,289
Hey! Hinata...?

266
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,191
Koji...!

267
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,127
What are you doing here?

268
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,764
It's not me, it's...

269
00:18:53,765 --> 00:19:00,605
Just helping out... you know...

270
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,608
Koji, the movie's going to start.

271
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,209
Oh yeah...

272
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,378
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:14,379
Ok.

274
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,199
Who was that?

275
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,368
A friend from university.

276
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,103
I see.

277
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,272
Why didn't you introduce me?

278
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:39,443
Ah... um...

279
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,979
You didn't want to be seen with me, right?

280
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,651
No, that's not...

281
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,986
...because I am a Fujoshi...?

282
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,423
Huh?

283
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,824
Yoriko.

284
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,961
Submissive Sebsy!

285
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,564
Hey! We're in public!

286
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,399
It's Ok, right?

287
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Let's go.

288
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:37,028
"Hinata Suwa"

289
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,433
You should have introduced us.

290
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,834
Huh?

291
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,970
It's just...

292
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,172
I was caught off guard...

293
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:54,512
Hmmm...

294
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,479
Hey.

295
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,781
Yeah?

296
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,083
You two...

297
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,686
You've been living together
for how long now?

298
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:06,524
We came up to Tokyo together
to go to university...

299
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,358
so... 4 years?

300
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,392
That's long!

301
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:14,732
Yeah, I guess so...

302
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,535
Hey, um...

303
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,938
What do you think's the secret...

304
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,909
to lasting so long?

305
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,013
Well, we're interested in the same things,
and have lots to talk about.

306
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,016
Good job!

307
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,052
Why do you ask?

308
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,021
I see...

309
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,390
Common interests...

310
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:46,297
I find her relaxing to be around, too...

311
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,566
Relaxing...

312
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,435
You want a drink? I'm thirsty.

313
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,637
Let me get them.
As payment for helping with this report.

314
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,373
Really?

315
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,608
Ok. Just get me anything.

316
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:04,609
Ok.

317
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,695
Yes.

318
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,130
Delivery.

319
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:24,235
It's here!

320
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,302
Delivery for Mr. Suwo.

321
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,238
Thank you.

322
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,206
Ok.

323
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,207
There you go.

324
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:38,516
Thank you.

325
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:45,517
Common interests...

326
00:23:54,166 --> 00:24:01,166
"Some homework for you. "

327
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:10,347
Women sure do have an amazing imagination.

328
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:16,520
They take a story and make
another story from it.

329
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,606
Wait a second! This
character is not even gay

330
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,691
in the original...

331
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:25,796
What are you doing?

332
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,498
Here you are.

333
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:34,499
Thanks.

334
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,780
"Sebsy, what are you doing now?"

335
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:46,817
I am always 'Sebsy' now...

336
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:53,818
"I'm working on that report with Koji. "

337
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:11,909
You two-timer!

338
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,746
Oh... you've finished work?

339
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,449
Yes. I'm at home.

340
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,752
About the two-timing...

341
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,987
We are two guys.

342
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,956
That's why I'm worried!

343
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,458
Oh, I see.

344
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,226
Why does she think like that?

345
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:33,163
You guys get along a little too well!

346
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:37,101
You were out, but I got the delivery,
so it doesn't matter.

347
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,435
What?

348
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,305
You mean you're at my place?

349
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:48,306
Yes.

350
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,851
Wait a second?!

351
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,319
Um...

352
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,187
On the subject of two-timing...

353
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:01,358
I'm not the one with the strange voices
in the background.

354
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:07,398
Nothing to worry about. This is my life's work.

355
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,866
Um...

356
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,935
You said you got a delivery...

357
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,071
I let it go at the time, but...

358
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:21,072
I ordered it online, to be delivered today.

359
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,949
To... my house?

360
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,553
Yes. I bought it in your name.

361
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,722
Uu-m...

362
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:36,727
Just checking - I'm sure it's not the case, but...

363
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,629
You're not going to tell me
it's a porno game, are you?

364
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,930
What?

365
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,033
Don't be silly! It's not just any porno game!

366
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,935
It's a world-famous porno game!

367
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:51,936
It's a porno game?!

368
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,152
Why are you buying porno games with my account!?!

369
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,521
Using my account would be too embarrassing!

370
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,522
Huh?

371
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,960
And stop saying 'porno game'.
Koji will think you are weird.

372
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,664
You'll blow my cover!

373
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,132
You make that sound like a big deal.

374
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,870
It IS a big deal!

375
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:24,041
Calm down! I'm nowhere near Koji right now.

376
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,544
Look, I'm leaving now, so just wait there.

377
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,680
No...

378
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,150
Don't worry about it.

379
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,656
Today you and Koji just hang out
like good friends...

380
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,325
Koji... Sebsy... Koji...

381
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,526
Koji...

382
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,328
Hinata...

383
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,663
Koji...

384
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,031
Hinata...

385
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,200
Koji... Sebsy... Oh-h...

386
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,837
KojiSebsy... Ohh... Oh... h

387
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,173
Koji... Sebsy...

388
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,877
Koji...

389
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,014
Sebsy... Koji...

390
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,583
Sebsy... Koji... Sebsy...

391
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:12,756
I am coming home right now!

392
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,159
Sorry Koji.

393
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,594
- I'll give you a ride.
- No, thanks!

394
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,197
Don't ask for details, just let me apologize.

395
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,767
She really gets jealous of your male friends.

396
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,936
It's sweet.

397
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,606
Um... it's probably not what you think.

398
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,609
She doesn't look like the insecure type.

399
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,612
It's a little surprising.

400
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,215
No, quite the opposite.

401
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,852
"She always looked like that at work too. "

402
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,886
So she's actually different then?

403
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,724
Ah... well, no...

404
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,760
She is probably feeling secure now,

405
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,796
and opening up to you.

406
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,500
I guess so.

407
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,068
It is a big deal...

408
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,737
What?

409
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,373
Ah... nothing, just saying 'thank you. '

410
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,709
Hold on tight!

411
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,478
You'll fall off!

412
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:14,479
Don't say stuff like that, Koji!

413
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,112
Here we are.

414
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:49,113
Thanks.

415
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:58,189
Yoriko.

416
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:05,435
This is Yoriko.

417
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,471
This is Koji.

418
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,773
Nice to meet you.

419
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:14,444
Nice to meet you. I saw you the other day...

420
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,782
Yes.

421
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,551
You were quicker than I thought.

422
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:24,655
I guess red bikes really are...

423
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,960
...3 times faster!

424
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,164
You're the Red Comet!

425
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,566
You bought the DVD box set, right?

426
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,568
Yep. Wanna borrow it sometime?

427
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,470
Can I? Bring it in tomorrow then.

428
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,073
Ok.

429
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,744
You're like Char in Gundam!

430
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,714
Char...

431
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,217
Custom made...

432
00:30:53,218 --> 00:31:00,218
Let me show you what my
new machine can do!

433
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:09,126
It's quite scary! I can't
stop my hands shaking.

434
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,473
Thanks for the ride.

435
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:23,474
Hitting the Bullseye is what counts!

436
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,491
Farewell for now.

437
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:40,030
My dear Artesia...

438
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:45,802
Char!

439
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,205
Ca...

440
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:55,206
Casval...

441
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:09,092
Yoriko!

442
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:15,065
Are you Ok?

443
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:20,237
So, did you have fun in your head
with me and Koji?

444
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:24,074
No comment.

445
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,710
What the hell are you watching!?

446
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,613
Stop! Don't take it... It's mine...

447
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,317
I wouldn't take it if you paid me.

448
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,485
But...

449
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:41,391
...surely you aren't going to keep stuff
like this at my place, are you?

450
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,827
Hey, Sebsy...

451
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,229
Read that to me...

452
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,299
...with feeling...

453
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,804
...playing both characters.

454
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,473
Gimme a break.

455
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,308
Well?

456
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,311
No.

457
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,747
Ok then, Sebsy.

458
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:09,319
Tell me what you go crazy for,
apart from Cat-eared Nurse.

459
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,855
So I have to go crazy for Cat-eared Nurse?

460
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,992
You liked it when I dressed up like her last week.

461
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,526
Huh?

462
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:21,164
I wasn't Cat-eared Nurse I was going crazy for...

463
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:26,269
It was you, if anything.

464
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,506
A 3-D crush...?

465
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,742
What? That's not the right way!

466
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,577
I'll teach you the truth that is 2-D!

467
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,444
Huh?

468
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,446
First you must go crazy for Ayanami
from Evangelion.

469
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:41,551
Or maybe Macross and Haruhi
would be better for a beginner.

470
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,086
Ok.

471
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,556
Start me off on Haruhi.

472
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,357
Huh?

473
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,228
Then I can move on to Macross,
and learn to appreciate Evangelion.

474
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,865
Then I will meet Ayanami,
and the whole 2D world.

475
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,401
Finally, I could get into
hunting for porno games

476
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,936
and Bishojo DVDs...

477
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,206
...and then I will be so
into 2-D stuff that...

478
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:10,207
I probably won't feel anything
for you anymore...

479
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,986
No!

480
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,621
I don't like that idea.

481
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,489
You are the one who suggested it.

482
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,993
Shut up. I said I didn't like it.

483
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,496
Even though 2-D crushes are the right way
and 3-D ones aren't?

484
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:32,702
Stop going on about it. A girl's mind is complex.

485
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,306
Well, as a "fair exchange"...

486
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,643
I will teach you the truth that is 3-D.

487
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,513
When you cheer up a bit.

488
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:50,514
Ok...

489
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:04,995
What's wrong?

490
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,839
You don't think...

491
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,942
I'm a freak?

492
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:18,943
Why ask that all of a sudden?

493
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,787
I promised you from the beginning.

494
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,324
It doesn't worry me,

495
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:34,325
and of course, I won't hate you for it.

496
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,140
I used to...

497
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:50,013
go out with a guy I hid this kind thing from.

498
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:56,353
We stayed together for a while
after he found out...

499
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,457
Then he told me one day...

500
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:07,264
...that he thought I was a freak...

501
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:11,301
So...

502
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:16,273
I thought maybe you'd suddenly
disappear someday too...

503
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:23,274
I got scared...

504
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:32,750
Sorry...

505
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:40,791
So that is what is with
the crash-course education.

506
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,338
I've never given

507
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:55,339
...anyone a promise ring before.

Please believe me.

509
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:12,195
I'll say it again.

510
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:17,667
I don't care if you are an Otaku, or a Fujoshi.

511
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:24,668
I love you, Yoriko.

00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,318
Thank you!

515
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:16,192
Hello!

516
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,062
I can hear a lot of voices calling Razzle.

517
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,196
Indeed

518
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,132
Do you know who I am?

519
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,401
Jun-Jun!

520
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,836
Thank you.

521
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,205
I am jealous now. Who am I then?

522
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,508
Hinocchi!

523
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,509
Thank you!

524
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,512
Now I am the jealous one!

525
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,547
I want to leave...

526
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,549
Ok, let's move on.

527
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,687
Do you want to hear that famous line?

528
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,156
Do you?

529
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,693
Ok then.

530
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:56,694
I am happy we could meet today, ladies.

531
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,573
Calm down!

for everyone here today... "

533

we have a special voice CD!

534
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,116
Really?

535
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:17,120
I loooooooooove Razzle!

536
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,088
Jun, you knew about it.

537
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,325
Did you hear how Hinocchi spoke to Jun just now?

538
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,127
That's a dead giveaway!

539
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,963
He never speaks to him like that
on the Internet radio show...

540
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,700
Razzle is the submissive one then!

541
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:35,505
Are you having fun?

542
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:41,044
If you're not having fun,
I'll have to force you to!

543
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:46,349
I know they're just the voices,
but they're starting to look real!

544
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,550
Oh-h...

545
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,286
I have his voice as my phone ring tone.

546
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,155
Show me!

547
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,456
He just touched him on the shoulder.

548
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,357
What? Who did?

549
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,026
And Razzle is smiling!

550
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:04,027
I think I'm going to faint!

551
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:12,142
Jun, you're not sleeping enough.

552
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,177
Aren't you sleepy?

553
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,415
Don't be silly! I'm not soft like you.

554
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,551
If you keep playing the tough guy like that,

555
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:26,656
I might grow to love you.

556
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,925
So grow, then.

557
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,260
What?

558
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:34,664
If you couldn't hear, don't worry.

559
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,665
Hey.

560
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,767
What?!

561
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,504
You know what "love" means, right?

562
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:47,110
Of course I do!

563
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,613
You're so cute.

564
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,949

00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:10,834
the final movement!

00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,663
- It'll look so good on you!
- No!

578
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,199
Check this out! Yes?

579
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,300
Very cute.

580
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,835
I have to try it on!

581
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,138
Hinata, grab that wig.

583
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,875
Hatsune Miku?

584
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,644
This one!

585
00:41:54,645 --> 00:42:01,645

Very nice!

Hey...

590
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:57,768
Ooh!

591
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:09,947
Got it.

592
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,229
Can you stop that clicking noise?

593
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,464
You mean the pen?

"And the swiveling. "

595
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,967
No clicking or swiveling.

00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,469
Yoriko.

597
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,637
Yes.

00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,847
Hey.

606
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,351
You said you had no plans today, right?

607
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,887
Well, I don't have a girlfriend...

608
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:56,059
Well, why don't you come
over to my place later on.

609
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,795
What?

Tonight you can...

611
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,634
be my sleigh ride.

Um... err... ahh!

613
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:20,544
Wanna swap? Ok...

614
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,523
Merry Christmas.

615
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:33,629
Hey Santa. Give me a present.

616
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,134
Oh, all right then. What do you want?

617
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,737
I...

618
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,140
I want you.

619
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,845
You want m... what?

620
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm...

621
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:57,320
...serious.

622
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:01,924
Santa's the dominant,
and the reindeer's the submissive.

623
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,127
Are you talking to yourself?

624
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,263
No. No.

625
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,599
Otaku poison...

626
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:16,105
The water is poisoned!

627
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,809
Congratulations.

628
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:26,810
Thank you.

629
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:06,589
Yes.

630
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,425
Welcome home, Yoriko.

631
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,027
I'm back, Sebsy.

632
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,529
Did you get the broccoli?

633
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,131
Aahh!

634
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:18,134
I forgot! Sorry.

635
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,435
I see.

636
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,872
I think there are some other greens somewhere.

637
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,540
It's Ok.

638
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,710
Sorry...

639
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,246
Yoriko. Check it out.

640
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,447
Ta-da!

641
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:36,919
I got a suit. With a vest!

642
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,759
Love the apron. Very nice.

643
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,761
You must be tired from work.

644
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:50,466
I have run you a half bath,
so why don't you go and relax.

645
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:57,467
I am still preparing dinner, Mademoiselle.

Ye-s!

649
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,010
Yes yes yes.

650
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,112
How do you read this word?

651
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,380
Which one?

652
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,985
Ah, that's "Gyoko. "

653
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,354
Wait a minute!

654
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,055
Hey!

655
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:22,892
That's my precious history book!
What do you think you're doing!?

656
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:23,960
Having a half bath.

657
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,530
I know about the bath.
I am talking about the book!

658
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,031
I'm borrowing it.

659
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,734
It will get all wet in the bathroom!

660
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,969
Oooh! Naughty!

661
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,036
I was talking about the book!

662
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,473
I am just reading. Don't be so uptight, Sebsy.

663
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,543
I'm not being uptight.

664
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,878
Either way, what does this "Gyoko" mean?

665
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,815
You're ignoring me?

666
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:52,816
It means like, unexpected happiness.
That kind of nuance.

667
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,494
Hey.

668
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,663
What?

669
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,065
You are

670
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:08,838
...tall, good-looking and clever...

671
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,110
and kind... and you sometimes wear glasses...

672
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:17,713
You must be popular, at University and all.

673
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:21,717
That's rather sudden. What's up?

674
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,387
Huh?

675
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,122
Is something

676
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:31,894
...burning?

677
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:37,900
The cheese fondue!

678
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,870
Gyoko...

679
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:47,209
Unexpected happiness...

680
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,812
That was close.

681
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,915
Sebsy, I'm thirsty.

682
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,583
Huh?

683
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,552
Oh...

684
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:02,892
Ye-s!

685
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,060
Here.

686
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,561
Thank you.

687
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,965
Hey...

688
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:16,966
Sebsy!

689
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,876
Yes.

690
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,046
Um...

691
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:28,250
I was just thinking how good this book is.

692
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:33,055
What's up with you?
You keep calling and calling and calling...

693
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:38,828
What's wrong with that?
You're the kitchen boy, right?

694
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,930
Yoriko.

695
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,667
Our life can't be a game all the time.

696
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,836
It's all right now...

697
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:53,442
But I don't think I can keep doing it forever.

698
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,512
Sebsy, wait.

699
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:03,513
"There's actually something I want to tell you... "

700
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:13,323
What is it this time!?!

701
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,481
Nooooooooo!

702
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,017
I'm sorry, Master.

703
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,620
Can you stop calling me Master?

704
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,155
Why?

705
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,123
It makes me uncomfortable.

706
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,225
Anyway, Master...

707
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,962
I am really cold in this dress.

708
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:53,169
Warm me up, Master.

709
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,038
Is that the right attitude to ask
a favour of your master?

710
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,841
I'm cold, so hurry up, Master.

711
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:03,646
Stop talking and warm me up!

712
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:04,647
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

713
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,615
Hurry... I'm cold.

714
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,751
Mademoiselle is spoilt.

715
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:12,121
I'm cold! And you only need to say
"yes" once, Master.

716
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:19,122
You just want to say "Master" all the time.

717
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:36,272
Are you still cold?

718
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:41,750
I might...

719
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,521
...be moving to London for work,

720
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,023
...Master.

721
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:52,261
What?

722
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:58,200
A successful woman follows her dreams,

723
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,837
right, Master?

724
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:02,738
Huh?

725
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:07,743
Pretty amazing, right?

726
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,213
Umm...

727
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,683
London?

728
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:20,389
I joined the company hoping to work
in England someday.

729
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:27,196
Ahh...

730
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,599
When you say "might"...

731
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,935
If you do go...

732
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,805
When will you be going?

733
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,742
Next month.

734
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,911
Next month?

735
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,980
So...

736
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,985
When will you be coming back?

737
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,920
I don't know.

738
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:55,324
It might be permanent.

739
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,327
Permanent...

740
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,495
Permanent?

741
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:03,632
I don't know. I might come back
after two or three years.

742
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,901
And I still haven't decided if I will go yet.

743
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,237
Um...

744
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,472
Why...

745
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,676
...didn't you tell me?

746
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,010
I'm telling you now.

747
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:18,514
You never told me about...

748
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:25,515
...such an important dream.

749
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:31,026
Why didn't you tell me about it until now?

750
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:31,760
Why?

751
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,862
I'm still...

752
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:40,863
thinking. About whether to go or not.

753
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,914
But...

754
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,950
You've had the dream for a long time, right?

755
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,020
Your dream.

756
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,123
We are talking about your life here.

757
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,325
You can't just give up so simply on...

758
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:06,962
I'm still deciding whether to go or not.

759
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,430
But you've been working towards it
all this time...

760
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:15,431
I just told you: I'm still deciding!

761
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:23,639
Sorry...

762
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:31,286
Hey.

763
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,188
Do you think I should go?

764
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,190
What?

765
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,226
So you think the sooner the better, then?

766
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,462
That's how it seems, as if it would be
a relief for you if I went.

767
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,463
That's not true!

768
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,665
Deep down, you do think I am a freak,
because I am a Fujoshi.

769
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,800
I never said...

770
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,736
You want a normal girlfriend,
not some annoying Fujoshi freak!

771
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:54,737
What the hell is wrong with you!?

772
00:56:55,512 --> 00:57:01,683
Is that what you've been thinking?

773
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:05,587
That I...

774
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:12,588
...have been thinking that all along?

775
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,269
I'm leaving.

776
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:27,270
Yoriko.

777
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,764
So,

778
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:54,837
...what do you want to do?

779
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,105
If you don't go,

780
00:57:57,106 --> 00:58:04,106
I think you'll regret it.

781
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,428
You've always said

782
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:26,429
it was your dream to live over there.

783
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,640
Yeah.

784
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:38,641
I had forgotten about it though.

785
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:50,887
That's why you joined your company, right?

786
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:59,662
And why you were an exchange student.
All for that goal.

787
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:10,646
But,

788
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,648
maybe I shouldn't go...

789
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:17,386
Why?

790
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:23,659
You'll regret it.

791
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:29,431
Definitely.

792
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:35,504
Sorry.

793
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:42,505
I understand how you feel about Hinata, but...

794
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:53,115
You have to think about you, too.

795
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,472
She doesn't...

796
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:17,245
trust me...

797
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:21,450
because I am younger than her...

798
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:28,451
because I am still a student...

799
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,661
I thought Yoriko...

800
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:38,266
really needed me around...

801
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:42,804
I feel like such an idiot.

802
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,305
I was just a little butler plaything

803
01:00:46,306 --> 01:00:49,805
she kept around for her amusement.

804
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,282
Being younger or a being a student...

805
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,952
doesn't have anything to do with it.

806
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,987
Huh?

807
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,256
She...

808
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:08,257
needed you in her own way, no?

809
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:14,569
You seem to understand her better than I do.

810
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:20,175
You're just saying that.

811
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:27,176
What do you want to say?

812
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:37,292
If you say it's her decision,

813
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,793
Then she won't talk it over with you.

814
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:44,293
I wouldn't if I were her.

815
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,545
Mama, I'm dirty!

816
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,649
Yes, I see.

817
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:05,020
All clean. Off you go.

818
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:11,226
She'll just get dirty again...

819
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:15,163
Kasumi called me just before.

820
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,199
Said she was sorry,

821
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,200
...said it was her ego speaking.

822
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,746
Not at all.

823
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:37,652
I was glad.

824
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:43,391
If you've made up your mind, I won't say a word.

825
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:49,931
Of course, Mocha and I want you to stay...

826
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:56,932
but no pressure...

827
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,008
I'm still

828
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:07,009
...confused.

829
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,185
If I do go,

830
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,222
people like you and Kasumi,

831
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:16,258
who are into the same stuff I am...

832
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:23,259
might be hard to find.

833
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:33,308
But,

834
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,812
It's been my dream for so long,

835
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,165
and I know I'll regret
it the rest of my life

836
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:43,518
if I don't go.

837
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:50,519
Kasumi was right.

838
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,208
But,

839
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:13,209
I'm scared.

840
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:20,916
I don't know how my feelings will change...

841
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:26,428
Now I...

842
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:33,429
...am having so much fun,

843
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:40,669
which makes going that much scarier.

844
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:50,079
I'm so unsure.

845
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,544
What? No, I'll be fine.

846
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:20,115
I can't take all that food with me
to England anyway.

847
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,919
Yes.

848
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,391
You take care of yourself too, Mother,
you're not as young as you used to be.

849
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,959
Ok.

850
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,428
Say hi to Dad for me.

851
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:40,429
Yep. Ok. Bye.

852
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,665
Have you been waiting long?

853
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,501
Sorry.

854
01:07:53,502 --> 01:08:00,502
Don't worry about it.

855
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:06,214
Shall we walk?

856
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:13,215
Ok.

857
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,232
Do you want...

858
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:31,233
to hold hands?

859
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:38,841
Ok.

860
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:29,892
Yoriko.

861
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:49,878
Please be with me forever.

862
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:57,725
I can't imagine...

863
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:04,726
...my world without you.

864
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:26,682
I've...

865
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:33,822
made up my mind.

866
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:41,663
I'm going to go to London.

867
01:10:56,051 --> 01:11:00,455
Aren't you going to...

868
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:06,628
say congratulations?

869
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:13,629
Don't go.

870
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:28,210
Ohh...

871
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:35,250
I thought you weren't going to try and stop me.

872
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,411
Yoriko,

873
01:11:56,412 --> 01:12:03,412
Go to London.

874
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:07,522
You've worked so hard for it.

875
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:14,523
You have my full support.

876
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:21,863
Congratulations.

877
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:57,291
You're going to have to get more flexible,

878
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:04,292
so you can cut them yourself.

879
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,971
Maybe someday.

880
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:16,972
They'll just keep growing otherwise.

881
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:26,287
They'll get really long.

882
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:32,593
You'll have to learn to cut them yourself.

883
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:39,594
I'll get you to cut them.

884
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:45,439
They'll break off before I can get to them.

885
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:52,440
I want you to cut them.

886
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:08,490
But...

887
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:15,436
I won't...

888
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:20,841
be around to.

889
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:24,412
I imagine it will be tough,

890
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,515
...but it's a present from the gods...

891
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:34,288
for all your hard work.

892
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:37,124
Make sure you

893
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:44,125
don't waste it.

894
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:49,737
We've been together just over two years...

895
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:56,738
It went so quickly.

896
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:04,546
It went quickly because we were together.

897
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:22,030
It's time to go.

898
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,872
You're right.

899
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:31,873
So quick...

900
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,784
I'll put the key...

901
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,854
on the table.

902
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:20,855
Ok.

903
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:46,387
Hey.

904
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:50,057
Let's say goodbye here.

905
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:57,058
Huh?

906
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,739
It won't be any less sad at the airport.

907
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:11,740
I'll grab a taxi over there.

908
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:20,882
Ok.

909
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,629
Yoriko.

910
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,799
Congratulations

911
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:38,800
on your transfer to London.

912
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:48,610
Thank you.

913
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:10,158
I'm home...

914
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:31,402
And that is how me and
my Fujoshi girlfriend

915
01:23:31,403 --> 01:23:34,902
went our separate ways.

916
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:30,230
Hello?

917
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:35,469
Hello.

918
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:38,839
Hinata?

919
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:42,309
I actually got through to you.

920
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,178
Um...

921
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:51,179
Long time.

922
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:59,693
Aren't you homesick yet?

923
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:05,466
Who do you think I am?

924
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,968
Still as focused as ever, I see.

925
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,337
That's right.

926
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:13,907
I am thinking of getting an MBA...

927
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:17,244
Really? Good for you!

928
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:24,245
Of course, I can't get into Cambridge,

929
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,754
but I'm thinking of doing it in London.

930
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:33,861
What?

931
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:37,297
Yoriko.

932
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,333
I'll say it again.

933
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:43,470
Ok.

934
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,706
I really...

935
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:52,707
...want you to be with me forever.

936
01:25:53,815 --> 01:26:00,815
You don't say that kind of
thing over the phone.

937
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:08,389
You're right.

938
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,063
Wait there a second.

939
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:16,770
Ok.

940
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,406
Miss Surisaki?

941
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:20,541
Yes

942
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,109
This is a parcel for you.

943
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:23,443
Thank you.

944
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,146
Could you sign here please?

945
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:28,282
Sure.

946
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,650
Sorry.

947
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:31,251
What's up?

948
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:33,487
I've got some sort of delivery.

949
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:36,757
What is it?

950
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:40,561
It's some cups I ordered the other day.

951
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:44,331
Well then, let's have a drink

952
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:51,332
...with those cups...

953
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:22,997
Can you stop raising my heart-rate
suddenly like that please?

954
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:29,276
No chance.

955
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:31,411
Ohh...

956
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:38,412
Are you Ok?

957
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:13,481
This took me months to choose.

958
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:28,863
It is a new type.

959
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:36,143
Yoriko.

960
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:43,144
Be with me forever.

961
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:51,224
That's unfair, with this kind of timing.

962
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,360
Is it?

963
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,596
This...

964
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,832
This ring is a...

965
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:05,833
Yes. It is exactly what it looks like.

966
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,911
But...

967
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,348
I am selfish, and a Fujoshi...

968
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:21,349
And I think
I am going to call you Sebsy forever...

969
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,524
I know.

970
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:31,525
It is not a fair exchange!

971
01:29:55,356 --> 01:30:02,356
But I get you.

972
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:24,651
You never learned that
you shouldn't make girls cry...

973
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:28,321
when you were small?

974
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:30,524
I did.

975
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,993
Well you've made me cry.

976
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:36,396
It's not nice.

977
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:38,565
I'll get angry.

978
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:45,566
I'm sorry.

979
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:55,682
Well then,

980
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:58,752
lend me your chest.

981
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:04,791
I need something to wipe my eyes and nose on!

982
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:11,792
Ok.

983
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:37,952
This story is a record of one guy's
struggle to date an Otaku girl.

984
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:50,537
You're stuck with me now... forever.

985
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:54,474
Sebsy...

986
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:57,143
Actually, that's a lie.

987
01:31:57,144 --> 01:32:04,144
It's too one-sided to be called a struggle!

988
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:55,129
< How to Date an Otaku Girl >

989
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:06,953
Hey.

990
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:12,859
Will you pour me some tea?
The really delicious one?

991
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:19,860
Yes, Mademoiselle.
