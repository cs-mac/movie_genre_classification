1
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:16,044
- There was nothing
extraordinary about the fact

2
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,213
That you lose the people
that you love,

3
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,249
'Cause it's gonna happen
to all of us.

4
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,153
It's just that it happened
in this targeted community

5
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:28,189
Of people
who were disenfranchised

6
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,226
And separated
from their families,

7
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:34,696
And a whole group
of other people stepped up

8
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:38,166
And became their family.

9
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,937
- We are not
some network of people

10
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,239
Who just like to have sex.

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,275
We are not some
ephemeral subculture

12
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:49,444
That comes
and dissolves and goes.

13
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:52,046
This is a community
that was tested

14
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:55,083
In a way almost no community
on earth is ever tested,

15
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,818
And succeeded
in what it was trying to do,

16
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,420
Which is save as many lives
of people as it could,

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,722
Stop civil rights attacks,

18
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,457
And then
try to use that example

19
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:04,626
To transform the world.

20
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,794
If you're ever facing
a natural disaster

21
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:08,963
As extraordinary as aids was

22
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:11,132
In the last quarter
of the last century,

23
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,301
You should be so lucky
as to be in a community

24
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:16,337
Like the queer community
of san francisco.

25
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:22,410
- When i talk to young people,
particularly,

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,145
They'll say,
"what was it like?"

27
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,615
I mean, the only thing
i can liken it to is a war zone,

28
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,218
But most of us have never
lived in a war zone.

29
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:31,519
But it was...

30
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,857
you never knew where the bomb
was gonna drop.

31
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:41,496
I decided to do
this interview because...

32
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:45,833
i've...i've been around
for the entire epidemic,

33
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,002
And i've seen
so many parts of it,

34
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:52,774
And i think there's
a lot of people from--

35
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:55,376
I mean, none of my friends
are around.

36
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,678
From the beginning.

37
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:59,280
So i want
to tell their story

38
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:02,317
As much as i want
to tell my story.

39
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,485
I think that's why.

40
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,872
- I came to san francisco

41
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:28,776
Back in the late '70s.

42
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,379
You know, there were more
gay people coming here.

43
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:33,548
There was
all these love children.

44
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:37,018
It was right at the end
of the hippies, you know,

45
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:40,488
And everybody, i mean,
if you had a bus ticket,

46
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:43,524
It better be saying
"san francisco," you know,

47
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,127
Because that was
the place to come.

48
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:48,730
I was the dancer.

49
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,067
I thought i could dance better
than anybody on the west coast.

50
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,802
Center stage,
i would get up there,

51
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,537
I'd climb up on that stage,

52
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:58,706
And i'd dance myself
into a frenzy.

53
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,309
Every sunday night
at the tea dance.

54
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,044
And if you got too close,

55
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,779
You might slip off the stage,

56
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:08,683
Because you were
too close to me.

57
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:12,587
But i thought
i had it going on.

58
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:17,792
My dad said one day
that i should sell flowers.

59
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,527
That's a good business.

60
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:23,431
And i thought, "i'm gonna
sell flowers in san francisco,"

61
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,166
Because, you know,
they've got these songs,

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,335
Where have all
the flowers gone?

63
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,504
And "if you're going
to san francisco,

64
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:31,672
Wear a flower
in your hair," and...

65
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:35,143
so i was ready for it.

66
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,745
A friend of mine
came up in a pickup

67
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,914
And took me right over
into the castro

68
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:44,252
On 15th and noe, and i've
been there for 28 years.

69
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:48,156
"Hey, i'm one of
the family members," you know.

70
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:49,457
"Come buy my flowers."

71
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,493
So i would put up
these rainbow flags,

72
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,530
And i--You know, and you could
see 'em from a block away.

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,397
If you looked
down the street.

74
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:59,867
You could just see
that little ribbon.

75
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,904
Until all the colors faded.

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,410
- I always knew i was gonna
come out to the bay area.

77
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,579
And i think a lot of us
came out here

78
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:15,049
Because we didn't quite fit
where we were.

79
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,254
Back in college, i helped start
the first woman's newspaper.

80
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:24,158
Uh, we started the first
childcare center.

81
00:04:24,158 --> 00:04:26,761
Stuff like that.
So i was very involved.

82
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:30,231
We had a women's center
on haight street,

83
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:31,966
So i started going
to the women's center,

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,267
And we sat around and said,

85
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,436
"Let's open up
a women's clinic,"

86
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:36,737
And then we just did it.

87
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:41,075
It was the era
of illegal abortions.

88
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,678
It was a time
when we, as women,

89
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:47,582
Weren't as educated
about our body.

90
00:04:47,582 --> 00:04:49,317
I was getting
a little older,

91
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:50,618
My late--Later 20s,

92
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,353
And i thought, "eileen,

93
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:55,823
You might want
a real job sometime,"

94
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,992
So i thought,
"i'll just go to nursing school

95
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,595
And see how i feel about it."

96
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:03,197
And, uh, i loved it.

97
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:06,667
I loved bedside nursing.

98
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,137
Once i started working
in the hospital,

99
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,439
There were all these gay men,

100
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,740
And it was really fun,

101
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,343
'Cause we'd go
clubbing together.

102
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:18,379
To the i-Beam,
to the stud.

103
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:20,548
You know,
places like that.

104
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:25,319
I'd dance and go home
and go to sleep.

105
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,922
So, you know,
we had a good time.

106
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:29,223
It was, like, really fun.

107
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:33,995
Unfortunately, none of
those guys are alive today.

108
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:39,200
- You know, it's the--The end
of the hippy era in america,

109
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,802
And i was a queer kid who--
Who was different,

110
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,104
Didn't really know
what to do,

111
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:45,273
And basically left
buffalo, new york,

112
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:47,008
And hitchhiked
around the country

113
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:50,044
For a number of years with
the guy i was sleeping with,

114
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:52,647
And deliberately
tried to be free,

115
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,382
It was our--
Sort of our goal,

116
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:57,418
And i remember
at one point thinking,

117
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,587
"Well, i've got nothing but
the backpack and my boyfriend."

118
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,189
And we literally
actually had nothing.

119
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,925
"I guess we must be free."

120
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,093
And it was that
sort of mentality

121
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,696
That we were pursuing.

122
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,865
A phrase that
i've sort of come to like

123
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:11,732
Is "crazy dreamers,"

124
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:12,600
And i was--At that time,

125
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,335
I thought san francisco
and california

126
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,636
Was full of crazy dreamers,

127
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:19,106
And that was where
i wanted to be.

128
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:21,275
I belonged to a little commune

129
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,878
Of leftover '60s folks,

130
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:26,914
Who were trying to establish
an alternative lifestyle,

131
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,649
And i was struggling with
was i gay,

132
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,119
Was i bisexual, you know,
what is going on.

133
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:33,854
So i come out of the closet,

134
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,457
In this terrifying moment of
coming to the gay student union

135
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:39,927
In san jose state
in september of 1975,

136
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,096
And the minute
i walked through the door,

137
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,699
And i'm sure most gay men
of my generation,

138
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,867
Most queer people are gonna
have a similar experience.

139
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:47,735
It was like you're home.

140
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,036
It's, like,
it all felt familiar.

141
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,639
It all seemed like,
"oh.

142
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,241
How did i not realize this
is where i was supposed to be?"

143
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,748
- My father really wanted me
to get a master's degree,

144
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:02,483
And i really didn't care,

145
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:06,387
So the compromise was i would go
to san francisco state,

146
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:09,423
'Cause san francisco
was where i wanted to be.

147
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:12,893
I liked the people here.
They just seemed more open.

148
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:18,099
And i always wanted to meet
a nice blond surfer.

149
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,400
When i moved
out to california,

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,701
I was still in the closet.

151
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,304
I didn't come out of
the closet until after college.

152
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:25,473
Um, i came out with a bang.

153
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:28,943
I was in a production
ofthe boys in the band.

154
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:34,148
For quite a few years,
i was a bit of a workaholic.

155
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,618
I was in my studio
all the time.

156
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:38,919
By the time i was 27,

157
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,655
I was having one-Man shows
in new york,

158
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,390
At galleries--
Good galleries in new york.

159
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:44,992
And i didn't know
it was supposed to be that easy.

160
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,293
It was just easy.

161
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:49,330
And i was pretty obsessed
with my work,

162
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,499
And i was
for quite a long time.

163
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:55,403
And--Until i got sick,
really.

164
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,571
I was first
living in the haight,

165
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:00,608
And i remember
walking down haight street,

166
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,210
And there was this guy handing
out leaflets on the corner,

167
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:04,945
And it was harvey.

168
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,247
It was his first campaign,

169
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:07,548
First time he was running,

170
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,283
And he introduced himself
and i talked to him,

171
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,584
So i went to work for him.

172
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,319
And i was handing out
leaflets.

173
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,922
And, you know, door hangers
and things like that.

174
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,223
And that was very exciting,

175
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:20,127
'Cause i had been somewhat
political in college.

176
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:22,730
I'd gotten sick of it,

177
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,899
Because all my roommates
were s.D.S.,

178
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,634
And it was very militant.

179
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,670
And harvey was just
a lot gentler,

180
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,707
And a lot more fun.

181
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,309
My partner at that time,
steve,

182
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,044
Was also fairly political.

183
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:40,081
Any time there was a march
or a demonstration

184
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:42,683
Or a candlelight thing,
we were always there.

185
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,852
Um, it was important to us.

186
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,021
Those were the things

187
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,057
That made us feel connected
to the community.

188
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:16,951
Castro street was just
starting to happen,

189
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,120
And you would always
run into people you knew,

190
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,722
And it really felt
like a village,

191
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,325
And the castro
just started to feel

192
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,927
Like the village
you always wanted.

193
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:37,772
- If you took
a bunch of young men

194
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:40,374
And said, "have as much sex
as you can have,"

195
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,543
How much sex
would they have?

196
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,712
A lot of sex.

197
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:59,026
The sense was if gay is good,
gay sex is good, you know?

198
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,761
And more gay sex
is even better.

199
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:04,231
And people often say of--
Of my generation,

200
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,834
We came to san francisco
to be gay.

201
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,486
- I remember, like,
january, 1977,

202
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,088
I went right down
to castro street.

203
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,691
Here i've lived in greenwich
village all these years.

204
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,860
"This--This
is gonna be amazing."

205
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,595
And i went down,
and, yeah, as you know,

206
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:35,896
It's, like, one block long,

207
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,065
And, like, a block
in either direction.

208
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,234
And, like, there were
a lot of gay men.

209
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,837
And, as with
any group of people,

210
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:47,608
It was already pretty quickly
falling into little cliques.

211
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,211
You know, there was, like,
this kind of military look,

212
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,379
And the kind of the--

213
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,681
The outdoorsmen look,

214
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,416
And there was a preppy look,

215
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,452
And there was already this,
like, kind of western look,

216
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,621
And a leather look.

217
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,356
It was already
starting to happen.

218
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:05,826
People quickly identifying
as certain male images,

219
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,429
And i, you know,
i just didn't, like, fit in.

220
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:10,598
There wasn't, like,
a long-Haired,

221
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:14,068
High-Voiced basketball look,
or something, you know?

222
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,237
I was just kind of me.

223
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,405
I mean, i tried.

224
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,008
I would go and pick up guys
and bring them home,

225
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,309
And, like,
they would want to go

226
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,346
From zero to 60 so fast.

227
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,081
I couldn't do it.

228
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:30,117
I was terrible
at anonymous sex.

229
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,587
I didn't know how to go,
like...

230
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,491
"all right."

231
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:38,792
You know, i just--
I couldn't do it.

232
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:42,263
I was like, "hi, my name's ed.
Who are you?"

233
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,564
You know, and it just--

234
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:46,600
It didn't...
it didn't click.

235
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,372
- I tend to be somebody
who has a partner

236
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,107
Almost my whole life,

237
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,143
But i've always been
in open relationships,

238
00:11:56,143 --> 00:12:00,481
So my sexual outlet
was always the bath houses,

239
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:03,517
And they were there,
and they were fun.

240
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:05,252
And i would go
with my friends.

241
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:07,421
It wasn't, like,
something i would sneak out

242
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:08,722
And go on my own.

243
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,024
It was--It was something
of an outing.

244
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,192
We would go with friends.

245
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,795
I remember coming out
of one bath house,

246
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:16,096
At, like,
3:00 in the morning,

247
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,699
And walking home across the city
in the middle of the night,

248
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:19,566
And just thinking,

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,169
"Gee, if my mother
could see me now,

250
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,470
She'd be just shocked,"

251
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,507
But it just felt so good.

252
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:27,374
It was, like, a club,

253
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,543
And we--We called it church.

254
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:32,579
It was going to church.

255
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,616
- Part of it,
you're having sex to have fun.

256
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,351
Part of it,
you're having sex to find love.

257
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:40,387
Part of it,
you're having sex to, uh...

258
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,857
to--To rebel
against the people

259
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,592
Who said
you couldn't have sex.

260
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,496
All of america
was feeling very confident

261
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,665
That you could be
much more sexual,

262
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:53,400
And that was okay.

263
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:56,437
Venereal diseases
and unwanted pregnancies,

264
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:58,605
It's all curable
with a shot or a pill

265
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,774
Or something to that effect.

266
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,089
It's may of 1979,

267
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:16,824
And the verdict has come down,

268
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:18,993
A verdict on dan white
for the murder of harvey milk,

269
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:21,595
And we're all at city hall
protesting.

270
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,764
There's this enormous rage.

271
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,065
Thousands of people arrive.

272
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:26,367
The police attack.

273
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,102
We're tear-Gassed,
we're beaten.

274
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,270
Police cars are burned.

275
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,006
So this is not a community

276
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,042
That's feeling really good about
the political establishment

277
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,644
Going into the 1980s.

278
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:40,681
The next night is harvey's
birthday party,

279
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,283
And so the streets
close off,

280
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,019
Tens of thousands
of people show up,

281
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,621
And they give very,
very angry speeches.

282
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:51,091
Anne kronenberg
gives a very fierce speech,

283
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:51,959
And at the end
of her speech,

284
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,128
She starts a chant,
"welcome to the '80s,

285
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:55,863
Welcome to the '80s."

286
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,598
We couldn't know,
of course,

287
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:01,068
That even then
hiv was present.

288
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:03,670
Hiv arrived first
in san francisco

289
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,406
Probably in '76,

290
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,309
And by 1979,
probably 10%

291
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,045
Of the gay men
in that crowd were infected.

292
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,780
And by the time we discover

293
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,081
That there is such a thing,

294
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,250
Aids is even happening,
in june of '81,

295
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,852
Roughly 20% are infected.

296
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,587
By the time we actually
get the test,

297
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,322
So people can find out
if they're infected,

298
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,491
Close to 50% of the gay men
of san francisco

299
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:28,395
Are already infected.

300
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,735
- '81 was a big year.

301
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:11,338
I landed a really good job,

302
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,073
And, for the first time,

303
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,242
I was part
of a large office staff

304
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,845
With a lot of other gay men.

305
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:21,315
I was finishing my graduate
degree in creative writing.

306
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:23,050
I went to europe.
I had this great job.

307
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:26,954
All these new gay men
i was working with.

308
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,556
And, um, i felt like,

309
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,725
"Oh, the '80s.
Something's gonna shift."

310
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,894
Like, i moved
to new york in '71.

311
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:38,665
Now i'm really here
in san francisco in '81.

312
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:43,437
And--And so that is
when everything changed,

313
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:49,076
Because that was, you know,
that was the year in the castro.

314
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,245
Running down,
i'll never forget,

315
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:53,413
I went to
the castro theatre.

316
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,149
Great double feature.

317
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:56,884
Two--I think it was, uh,

318
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:59,486
It was, like,
now, voyagerandcasablanca

319
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:00,787
On the big screen,

320
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,390
And i remember, like,
running down to the--

321
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,125
The old star pharmacy,

322
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,860
'Cause we're gonna
smoke some pot,

323
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,463
And we didn't have any papers.

324
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:12,065
And i remember
looking in the...

325
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:18,138
i remember looking in the window
of star pharmacy,

326
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:21,608
And there were these little
polaroid photographs

327
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:24,645
That this young man
had made of himself.

328
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,813
There were at least three,
maybe four of them.

329
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,416
The first one was like this.

330
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,452
And inside...

331
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:39,826
these big,
purple splotches.

332
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:41,562
And then there was
another picture,

333
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:43,730
And he had taken his shirt,
and pulled it up like this.

334
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,899
It was of his chest,

335
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,068
Big purple splotches.

336
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:49,803
They were just on the window,

337
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:51,538
And underneath,
there was a hand-Written note

338
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,273
That said something like,
"watch out, guys.

339
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,575
There's something out there."

340
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:57,611
Something like that.

341
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,780
And, uh, oh, my god.

342
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,985
It made...
huge impact on me.

343
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,720
And then, like,
i was really stoned,

344
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,455
And i went and watched
the movie, and...

345
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,190
but the whole movie

346
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,227
I was just
thinking about that.

347
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:16,263
It really made
an impact on me.

348
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:21,468
I went to see the movies with
a friend of mine named michael,

349
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:23,203
And he and i
worked together,

350
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,372
And he had woken up
kind of recently

351
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:31,011
With this, like,
red splotch in his eye.

352
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:34,481
And he kept going, like,
"what is this? What is this?"

353
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:38,819
And, um, he, um, he had been
going to the eye doctor,

354
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,855
And they hadn't been able
to figure out what it was,

355
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:45,325
And...
[sighs]

356
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:47,928
You know, i...

357
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,229
it turned out to be ks.

358
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:51,398
He had ks in his eye.

359
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:54,001
So it was right there
in the movie line with us.

360
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,772
Like, already.
Like, it was already there.

361
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,543
- The pictures
show the progression

362
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,279
Of how a few red bumps

363
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,014
Turn into the mark
of kaposi's sarcoma.

364
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:09,616
It's a rare cancer normally
found in the elderly,

365
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,351
But now
it's striking young men,

366
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:13,520
Most of whom are gay,
like bobbi campbell.

367
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,123
After one month,
tests are still being done

368
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:17,858
On the red bumps
on his foot.

369
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,593
- I don't know
how i got it.

370
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:22,629
I fit the profile of kind of
a typical kaposi's patient

371
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,666
In my age,
and that i'm gay, and...

372
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:30,871
but i don't know
how i got it.

373
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,606
- The first time
i heard about aids,

374
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,775
I think it was called
the gay cancer.

375
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:36,943
It was ks.

376
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:38,679
It was terrifying.

377
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:42,149
And we had friends
who were dying

378
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,318
Right at the beginning
of the epidemic.

379
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:49,523
I mean, this one person
who helped my career greatly,

380
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,993
Who was a curator
of the brooklyn museum,

381
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:55,162
Gave me a show
at the brooklyn museum,

382
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:57,764
And he died before
the show happened,

383
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:00,801
And that was--
We--Now looking back,

384
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,102
I know he died of aids,

385
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,705
But back then
there was no name for it.

386
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:10,777
- I was hanging blood
one day in the hospital,

387
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,946
And this was, you know,

388
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:15,115
Before the times
that you wore gloves.

389
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,718
And the infectious
disease fellow

390
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:20,320
Came in and said, "eileen,
why don't you put gloves on?

391
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,923
We don't know what this is."

392
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:29,429
- I was selling flowers
at that time,

393
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,466
And there was a guy
down the street.

394
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,068
Five days.

395
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:38,105
One day he went
to the hospital,

396
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:41,141
Five days later,
he was dead.

397
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,045
- I'm looking through
the gay periodicals,

398
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:49,383
And in one of them,
new cancer described.

399
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,118
And so i'm aware
something has occurred.

400
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:52,419
And i noted--

401
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,889
I think everybody who was paying
attention to the community

402
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:59,793
Noted, "well, this could be
something to pay attention to,"

403
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:01,962
And so we--I did.

404
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:14,975
- People were coming in
with pneumocystis pneumonia,

405
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:18,445
Who were quite well,
you know, one day.

406
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:23,650
You know, uh, out there
swimming, playing tennis.

407
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,385
You know, buffed.

408
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,988
Coming in and--
Were dying.

409
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:31,458
I mean,
were dead ten days later.

410
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,928
People would come in
with kaposi's sarcoma.

411
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:37,964
There might be one little legion
or two little legions,

412
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,699
And they would grow.

413
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:43,603
And maybe a legion would cut off
circulation in their leg,

414
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:45,772
And their leg
would balloon up,

415
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,507
Or maybe it would
get into their lung,

416
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,242
And they couldn't breathe.

417
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:54,014
And maybe they would
just waste away.

418
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:58,351
- Very early, certainly within
the first 18 months,

419
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:04,858
I assumed that a number of my
friends were likely infected,

420
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,461
And probably myself and--

421
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:10,497
And all the people
in my group were infected.

422
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,437
[Dramatic music]

423
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:24,377
? ?

424
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,271
- From the beginning,

425
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:53,874
I just couldn't stand
the homophobia

426
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:57,777
And the prejudice
that was going on,

427
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:58,645
And the fear.

428
00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:00,814
There was incredible fear,
right?

429
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:02,549
These people
were coming in and dying,

430
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,284
And nobody knew what it was,

431
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:07,320
And people get afraid.

432
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,923
There were people who were
afraid to go into rooms,

433
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:14,694
And so i found myself
going into the rooms.

434
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:18,598
If you're not a family member,
they wouldn't talk to you,

435
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:21,201
So if somebody's partner
was in there,

436
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:25,105
The doctors might not explain
to them what was going on.

437
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:29,876
So i found myself
talking to them.

438
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:32,913
It was a weird time
in the hospital,

439
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,515
Because they didn't want
to be associated

440
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,250
As an "aids hospital,"

441
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:40,287
Because no one would want
to come to the hospital

442
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:42,889
If they knew we were
an "aids hospital."

443
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,359
So there was a lot
of struggle there.

444
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,829
I remember my mom.

445
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,167
She was saying,
"why do you have to do this?"

446
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:55,902
You know,
'cause i've already put my mom

447
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,203
Through lots of stuff.

448
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:58,939
And i remember saying to her,

449
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,975
"Mom, it didn't choose--

450
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:05,011
I didn't choose it.
It chose me."

451
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:06,313
'Cause you're there,

452
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,481
And this terrible thing
is happening,

453
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,216
And you're a nurse,
and you can help,

454
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:13,687
And sometimes that's just
helping somebody die,

455
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,326
But i, you know,
i couldn't turn my back to it.

456
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:29,736
- Something was happening.

457
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,471
That these gay men
were showing up

458
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:34,941
At places like united way,

459
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,676
Looking for a support group,

460
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,713
Or, um...

461
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:42,749
uh...social services.

462
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:44,918
Because they had no...

463
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,954
they had no family.

464
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:51,424
I saw an ad
in thebay area reporter.

465
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,593
Shanti project
was looking for people

466
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:57,931
Who'd be willing to be a buddy
to someone with this illness.

467
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:02,268
And i took the second
shanti volunteer training

468
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,437
That occurred here
in san francisco,

469
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:08,775
And i got matched
with someone immediately.

470
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,944
I hadn't met a person
with aids yet

471
00:24:10,944 --> 00:24:15,281
Who was just kind of, like,
off on his own, and...

472
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:19,185
like, expecting...

473
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:23,523
that someone was gonna come,
and, like, help him.

474
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:26,126
And, um...

475
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:33,500
i just remember
going to his apartment, and...

476
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:37,837
just him opening the door,
and...

477
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:40,006
he said his name was ed.

478
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,645
I said
my name was ed too.

479
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:48,248
And, you know, like,
lo and behold,

480
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:51,284
My way
of being with gay men

481
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:54,320
Suddenly...

482
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,357
was perfect.

483
00:24:57,357 --> 00:25:00,827
Like, "hi."

484
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:07,767
Like, "who are you?
How are you doing?"

485
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:11,671
I took my training
in july of '83,

486
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:14,708
And of course i was close
to all these gay men.

487
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,876
There were seven gay men
working in this office,

488
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:19,479
And i was coming in
and telling them, like,

489
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,780
"Oh, my god..."

490
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,250
And, you know, they think
it's transmitted sexually,

491
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:28,154
And they're thinking condoms
is a way to protect us,

492
00:25:28,154 --> 00:25:31,191
And they're telling us
don't use poppers.

493
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,227
And i go, "it's already, like,
disseminating information."

494
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:36,396
Back then, especially,

495
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,734
There was this
whole dynamic about

496
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:44,204
How are you getting it?
Who are you getting it from?

497
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,939
Who's giving it to who?

498
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,975
Um, in that little office,

499
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,276
Some of that feeling, like,

500
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:52,879
I'm pretty sure they had
all had sex with one another.

501
00:25:53,313 --> 00:25:55,048
But, once again,
in my kind of mismatched way,

502
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:58,084
I hadn't had sex
with any of them.

503
00:25:58,084 --> 00:26:00,687
Um...

504
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,856
they all...

505
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:06,326
they all got infected.

506
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:08,928
And they all died
except one.

507
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:18,905
- My partner, steve,
was an immunology researcher.

508
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,074
We'd been together
for quite a while,

509
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:23,243
Probably about eight years.

510
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,544
And, all of a sudden,

511
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,279
People were coming to him

512
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,882
And asking him
to explain what's going on,

513
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:30,617
And it was interesting.

514
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,219
I mean, his self esteem
sort of turned around,

515
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:37,557
Because he was a holder
of very important information.

516
00:26:37,557 --> 00:26:41,027
He ended up working
in jay levy's lab,

517
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:43,196
Which was one
of the most important

518
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:45,799
Aids research labs
in the world.

519
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,269
We got tested because
steve took my blood

520
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:51,004
And brought it
into jay levy's lab,

521
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:52,739
So we were, like,
some of the first people

522
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,908
Who knew that we were
actually positive,

523
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:58,812
'Cause the test
wasn't even available.

524
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:02,715
When steve came back
from jay levy's lab

525
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:08,354
And told me that we were
both hiv positive,

526
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:11,825
It--My life
changed completely.

527
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:16,596
Um, i--I had had five people
working for me,

528
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:21,801
Um, and i let them go,

529
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:24,404
And, luckily,
i had saved some money,

530
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:27,440
And i just
started doing sculpture.

531
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:33,947
- Here am i,
the kid from san jose,

532
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,682
I'm up here,
i'm now the vice president

533
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:36,983
Of some little
gay democratic club

534
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:40,019
Where maybe 15 or 20
people show up,

535
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:43,056
And suddenly the community
starts to die

536
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:45,225
Of these extraordinary,
horrible diseases,

537
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:47,393
And they want help.

538
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,996
"How do we--" You know,
"how do we keep 'em alive?

539
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,731
"How do we make sure
they don't die of starvation

540
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:53,900
Because they can't cook?
How do we--"

541
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,502
Meanwhile, there's all these
attacks that are occurring.

542
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,238
Meanwhile, there's
this tremendous debate

543
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:59,539
Within the community about--

544
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,274
"Well, maybe these
are all wrong decisions.

545
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:02,575
Maybe we shouldn't
be sexually free."

546
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,612
Maybe--And all these
other debates are occurring.

547
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:08,214
But it's occurring--
The leadership, such as it is,

548
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:11,684
Is guys like me,
who are suddenly,

549
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:12,986
In this little group,

550
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:16,456
Were forced to deal with this
unbelievable circumstance

551
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,793
Of a community that, in addition
to being hated and under attack,

552
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:23,830
Is now forced alone
to try to figure out

553
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,601
How to deal with this
extraordinary medical disaster.

554
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:32,505
People would see
my picture in theb.A.R.

555
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:35,541
And come up to me and say,
"i was diagnosed. What do i do?

556
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,710
"Do you know a doctor?
What do i do?

557
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,879
"Is it true, you know,
this might occur?

558
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,180
What do i do?"

559
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:44,217
We held a series
of town hall meetings,

560
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:47,253
And a group called mobilization
against aids was created.

561
00:28:47,253 --> 00:28:49,422
And i was their first e.D.,

562
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:53,760
And that's sort of how
i formally enter into aids work.

563
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:57,230
Mobilization's purpose
was to demand a greater response

564
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,832
To the hiv aids pandemic.

565
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:02,869
The first response was to try
to take care of the sick.

566
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:04,170
That's the first response.

567
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,773
The second response
was to try to stop people,

568
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,942
Um, from getting infected.

569
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:12,845
The third response was--
How do we advocate?

570
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:14,147
How do we now
get other people involved

571
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,316
To be able
to generate resources?

572
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:19,786
We are here to try to spark
across the land

573
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:23,256
General citizen support for
the actions that are being led

574
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,425
So overwhelmingly
by people with aids,

575
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:28,027
To try to get
the nation to move

576
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,630
Into an effective response
of this epidemic.

577
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,100
We lead a delegation of people
with aids to washington.

578
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:36,269
Here's guys, very sick,

579
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,004
They're in end sta--
By definition,

580
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,305
They're in end-Stage aids.

581
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,342
There is no treatments to--
To speak of.

582
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,077
Maybe there's some
experimental treatments

583
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,378
They're starting to get.

584
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:47,113
And here they are,
flying on planes,

585
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:48,848
Going across the country
with no money,

586
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:50,583
Sleeping four to a room

587
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:53,186
To be able to go do opping.

588
00:29:53,186 --> 00:29:54,487
And my experience is,

589
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:57,523
My belief is, all those folks
thought they would die.

590
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,692
None of them thought
they would survive aids.

591
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,427
They were doing it
because they thought

592
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:03,162
In so doing they would make it

593
00:30:03,596 --> 00:30:05,765
So other people
from the community and beyond

594
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:07,500
Were able to live.

595
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,103
And that happened
many, many, many times,

596
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:13,573
Where people with aids would
just do extraordinary things.

597
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:17,910
That's who was, in fact,
leading the response.

598
00:30:20,947 --> 00:30:24,417
- When he went to the hospital,
i followed him there.

599
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,586
So i went to 5-B,

600
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:29,622
Which was right here at
san francisco general hospital,

601
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:33,092
To--To visit him,
as a shanti volunteer.

602
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:37,430
And 5-B was a seven-Bed unit,

603
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,466
An old intensive care unit
that had been turned into

604
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:47,407
The first aids-Dedicated
hospital unit in the world.

605
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:53,046
And everybody who worked there
was there on a volunteer basis.

606
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:57,383
1983, which they weren't sure
how it was transmitted.

607
00:30:57,383 --> 00:30:59,552
So they didn't
want anybody working there

608
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:02,155
Who was gonna have
contagion issues.

609
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,191
So they wanted to make sure here
at san francisco general

610
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,661
That you were not gonna be
coming from that kind of fear.

611
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,830
You'd be volunteering
to work here.

612
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:14,300
This is where
i started encountering,

613
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:17,770
Like, lesbians, coming
and working on the aids unit

614
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,807
With all these gay men
who were dying.

615
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,409
It was so moving,
because certainly gay men

616
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:26,446
Were not making a whole lot
of room for lesbians.

617
00:31:26,446 --> 00:31:28,181
Let's put it that way.
Back then.

618
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:32,518
Um...

619
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:39,025
so i got this sense
of this group of people

620
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:44,230
Who were really caring
for these men who were dying.

621
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,604
- Steve became
more and more obsessed

622
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,207
With trying to find out
what the latest treatments were.

623
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:56,375
He wanted to save our lives.

624
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,544
He wanted to figure out,
you know,

625
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:02,448
You know, how we were
gonna beat this thing.

626
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:05,051
And he found out
about a study

627
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:11,124
That was done in africa
with a drug called suramin.

628
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,726
And they were doing--

629
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,196
They were doing the study
here at san francisco general,

630
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:20,666
And he got us both
into the study.

631
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,835
Across the country, there was,
like, three study sites.

632
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,004
There were, like,
80 people in the study.

633
00:32:25,004 --> 00:32:29,342
And the drug was hideous.

634
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:31,944
It was...
you'd go in,

635
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:34,113
And it was, like,
two hours of i.V.,

636
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,848
And for the next two days,

637
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:39,318
You literally felt like
you'd been run over by a truck.

638
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:41,921
And i was a wuss.

639
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:44,524
And i--I just--
After a month of this,

640
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,259
I just said,
"i can't take this."

641
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,861
It's just, you know...

642
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,898
i was just--
It just made me so sick,

643
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:53,199
And i hated it.

644
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,934
But steve just kept on going,

645
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:57,970
And he had had
chronic hepatitis b

646
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,007
From a needle stick
that he'd gotten in a lab

647
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,176
When he was working
in a lab,

648
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,079
And it activated
his hepatitis.

649
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,682
And within--

650
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:12,718
We started, i think,
the study in july.

651
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:16,622
He quit the study
in october.

652
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,225
And he was...

653
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,334
he was dead by january.

654
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:33,105
It was really quick.

655
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:34,840
Um...

656
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:41,347
and everybody in that study
died except for me.

657
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:44,383
'Cause i was a wuss.
I couldn't take it.

658
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:49,155
And i'm so glad
i took care of myself that way.

659
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:54,794
But i talked to a doctor
in the study afterwards,

660
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:58,264
And they had a meeting
of all the doctors

661
00:33:58,698 --> 00:33:59,565
And people who had--

662
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,734
Researchers
across the country

663
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,337
Who had been involved
in the study,

664
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:08,241
And he said he never...

665
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:13,446
he'd never been in a room
of doctors sobbing before.

666
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:17,350
They had lost
all their patients.

667
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,518
Very quickly.

668
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:22,121
So that was one of the first
disasters in aids treatment,

669
00:34:22,555 --> 00:34:24,724
I think,
that really made everybody

670
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:27,760
Really careful after this.

671
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,531
Um...

672
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:36,002
[sighs]

673
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:39,905
Steve was 35.

674
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:45,978
Two weeks after steve died,

675
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,713
My best friend died.

676
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:52,051
Peter.

677
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,786
Two days before steve died,

678
00:34:53,786 --> 00:34:55,087
Another good friend died.

679
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:58,991
I mean, it was just--
It was an avalanche.

680
00:35:46,272 --> 00:35:50,176
- Within a mile of epicenter
of castro and market,

681
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:51,911
Large numbers
of people died.

682
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,212
And not just
your friends who died,

683
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:55,381
But, you know,
the people you didn't know.

684
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,682
The friend of the friend.

685
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:58,417
You know,
you'd go get a coffee,

686
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,020
And the person who used
to give you coffee's died.

687
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,755
You would, you know,
whatever it was--

688
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,924
Your banker, your mailman,
all that.

689
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:06,659
Mass, mass death.

690
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:09,261
To the point where you,
to some degree,

691
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:11,430
You would stop asking,
if people weren't around,

692
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,599
Where they were, unless you
wanted to get into a discussion

693
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,202
Of them being dead
or them being sick.

694
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,672
So, for a number of years,

695
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:23,142
People are all assuming
we've got this disease,

696
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:26,178
And it's very likely
we'll be dead soon.

697
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:32,685
- Everybody was reading
the obituaries,

698
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:36,155
Because they went from
like this to like this.

699
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:39,191
You know, it was just,
like, "oh, my god."

700
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:42,228
And everybody would get
theb.A.R.Every week

701
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,830
Just to see who's gone.

702
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,867
Being the flower man,

703
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,035
I was thrown
into the middle of it,

704
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:53,072
Because a lot of people
would say,

705
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:56,542
"Guy, my friend died,

706
00:36:56,976 --> 00:37:00,880
"And i don't have enough money
to buy flowers, and...

707
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,217
i need some help.
Can you help us?"

708
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:07,820
They wanted
to bury their friends

709
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,158
With a lot of dignity
and beauty, and...

710
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:16,061
and "i came to you
to help me out."

711
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,098
You know,
i'm emotional,

712
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:21,267
Because this is the first time
i thought about it.

713
00:37:21,267 --> 00:37:26,038
I--I can't even count the
funerals that i did, you know?

714
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,207
And if it wasn't
no more than--

715
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:31,243
You know, some people
would bring me a vase,

716
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:32,978
And they said, "guy,
this is all i can afford.

717
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:35,581
Can you put some
flowers in it, or--?"

718
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:36,882
You know, and i did that.

719
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:39,919
And i, you know,
it was never about money.

720
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,654
It was about love,
you know.

721
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:42,955
It was about these people.

722
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:45,124
Not letting my friends down.

723
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:48,594
You know, just helping them
to the other side.

724
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:51,630
Mm.

725
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,776
- Today i have ordered
the closure

726
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,378
Of 14 commercial
establishments

727
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:10,716
Which promote and profit
from the spread of aids.

728
00:38:10,716 --> 00:38:12,885
- There was a broad view

729
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:15,054
That there was
a sexual transmission component

730
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,355
Of the disease.

731
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:20,259
So here we are debating
how do we continue to have sex,

732
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,428
How do we continue
to love each other,

733
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,163
How do we continue to be--

734
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:28,501
To pursue the dream of the
community that we want to have

735
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,236
In the midst of this plague,

736
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:31,971
And so then
comes the discussion,

737
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:33,706
Well, the government

738
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:36,742
Would like to shut down
some institutions,

739
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:40,212
And some of these are old,
core institutions,

740
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:41,514
Which is the bath houses.

741
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:42,815
There's always
been bath houses.

742
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:45,417
They precede the gay community
as we know it,

743
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:48,020
Where gay people would go
and meet and have sex,

744
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,490
And some people thought
that was a good idea,

745
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,960
The bath houses are run by
irresponsible business owners

746
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,695
Who are--Just don't care
about the pandemic

747
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:57,997
And are ripping people off,

748
00:38:57,997 --> 00:39:01,467
And other people thought
this is a dangerous precedent.

749
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,202
That your friend
the government

750
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,937
Would like to shut down
these institutions.

751
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,672
Is that--That okay with you?

752
00:39:06,672 --> 00:39:07,540
The majority
of the community

753
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,142
Felt that we were in
a crisis right now,

754
00:39:10,576 --> 00:39:11,877
And the baths
needed to be shut down.

755
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:16,215
And a lot of people
were very afraid of it,

756
00:39:16,215 --> 00:39:18,817
And so the community divided.

757
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,119
And, to some degree,

758
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,854
A split also between
the women's community,

759
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:23,589
The lesbian community,
and gay men,

760
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:28,360
Where gay men kept being
controversial to a degree,

761
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:30,529
By insisting
on having as much sex

762
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:31,830
In as many places
as they were doing,

763
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:33,999
And the women's community

764
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,036
Was, you know,
to some degree saying,

765
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:37,903
You know,
we don't know--

766
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,204
This is not the commu--

767
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,373
This is not the core
definitions of the community

768
00:39:41,373 --> 00:39:43,542
That we think the community
should be fighting over.

769
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,277
We don't think
the central battles

770
00:39:45,277 --> 00:39:48,314
Of glbt liberation
should be about, you know,

771
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:49,615
Public sex, for example.

772
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,217
We think there should be
a broader discussion.

773
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:56,555
So it was a high,
high tension debate.

774
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:05,230
- Since i did sit on the corner
for 28 years,

775
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:10,002
I just saw the progression
of people, you know,

776
00:40:10,436 --> 00:40:13,906
So scary just to,
all of a sudden, you know,

777
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,641
They'd be walking
down the street,

778
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,942
And then the next time
you see them,

779
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:19,979
They would be
walking with a cane,

780
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:22,147
Or they'd be in a wheelchair.

781
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:24,316
And that was devastating to--

782
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:28,220
"Oh, i remember him."

783
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:32,992
- Here's the gay community,

784
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:35,160
Which,
for better or for worse,

785
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:37,763
Is very concerned
with appearances,

786
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:40,366
And here comes this disease
that manifests itself

787
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:42,968
And destroys
your physical appearance.

788
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,269
It's the first thing it does,

789
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:46,438
Whether it's ks or wasting.

790
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:50,776
I mean, people were just
losing many, many pounds,

791
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,511
And people--
It looked--

792
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:53,812
People--It looked like,
you know,

793
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,981
We were living
in a concentration camp.

794
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,018
I mean, people were just
losing so much weight

795
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:00,753
In their faces
and their bodies.

796
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:03,789
You know, a third of their
body weight very, very quickly.

797
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:05,958
Mysteriously.
They didn't know what was--

798
00:41:06,392 --> 00:41:08,560
You know, what part
of the disease was causing it.

799
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,464
Um, so it was these
very physical manifestations

800
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:16,368
That were horrifying to people,

801
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:18,537
And were very scary to people,

802
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:21,140
And if you--
Especially if you had aids,

803
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,176
And then you saw somebody
who was much worse off than you,

804
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:26,779
You almost had to turn away.

805
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:30,249
It was just--
It was too scary.

806
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:34,153
I was losing all the fat
in my face and my butt,

807
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:35,454
And everywhere,

808
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:38,490
And i would walk
by a store window

809
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,659
And see myself in the window,
and just jump.

810
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,394
It's like,
"who is that?"

811
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:45,431
Um, and i remember
my mother saying,

812
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,166
"Couldn't you
stand on your head,

813
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,768
"And make some of the stuff
flow down to your face?

814
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:51,070
You got nothing on your--"

815
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:53,672
You know, "you're just--
You're skin and bones."

816
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:02,347
- The aids epidemic allowed me
to move into the community

817
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,950
In a very powerful way.

818
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,553
And, in fact, in many ways,

819
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,288
I began to thrive.

820
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:13,625
Because it was, like,
being in the army.

821
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:17,529
Like, i was really,
for the first time,

822
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:20,132
Other than being
super involved in my family,

823
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,735
I was involved
in something else.

824
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:27,072
Like, i rolled up
my sleeves, and...

825
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:30,976
i wanted to be
a part of this.

826
00:42:30,976 --> 00:42:34,880
The aids ward was a--

827
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,085
It was a terrible and beautiful
place at the same time.

828
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:46,592
My primary role was to be one of
the shanti counselors there,

829
00:42:46,592 --> 00:42:48,761
Which was someone
who was trained

830
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:50,496
To be able to sit

831
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:55,267
And be and witness
and have conversations

832
00:42:55,267 --> 00:43:00,906
And support people
through their process there.

833
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,075
I worked with people there

834
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:05,244
Who were, like,
18 years old.

835
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,846
We had people there
who were in their '60s.

836
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:14,353
But in general they were
sexually active gay men.

837
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:16,088
People were coming
into the hospital

838
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:19,558
With diseases like
toxoplasmosis,

839
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:24,329
Which you can get from a potted
plant or a canary cage.

840
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:28,667
I mean, people were
extremely susceptible

841
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,836
To any number of things.

842
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:37,342
So there had to be, like,
a controlled environment.

843
00:43:37,342 --> 00:43:42,548
There was this idea that
we were there to cure and heal,

844
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:44,283
And--And not
to minimize any of that,

845
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:47,753
But--But really, back then,

846
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:48,620
What were people were doing is,

847
00:43:49,054 --> 00:43:50,355
They were dying of aids,

848
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:53,392
And we were trying to help them
as best we could.

849
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:56,862
You could go a couple days,

850
00:43:57,296 --> 00:44:02,067
And, um, no one would die.

851
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:05,103
And then, in one day, like,
six people would die.

852
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:14,213
We saw many
lover couples come in.

853
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:15,948
One would die.

854
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,116
The other, you know,
partner would be there,

855
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,852
Go through the whole process,

856
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:21,153
Some time would pass,

857
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:25,924
And then the next lover
would come in.

858
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,262
There was a mom
who came to 5-A,

859
00:44:30,262 --> 00:44:37,202
And one...two...three times,

860
00:44:37,202 --> 00:44:40,239
She lost her boys there.

861
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,613
I would stand in the hallway,

862
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:51,083
A gay man myself
in my mid 30s,

863
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:54,553
Visiting and talking
to a mother and father

864
00:44:54,553 --> 00:44:56,722
Who had just stepped out
of a room,

865
00:44:56,722 --> 00:45:00,192
Who had just found out
that their son had pneumocystis

866
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:03,228
And had three months to live,
or whatever,

867
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:04,963
And the father
would stand there and go,

868
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:08,867
"You know...

869
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:12,771
"it's harder for me to find out
that my son is a fag

870
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:18,410
Than to find out
that he's gonna be dying soon."

871
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:21,880
And there i would be, like,
trying to comfort him.

872
00:45:27,953 --> 00:45:30,989
- When steve died,
my friends were there for me.

873
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:32,724
I felt so supportive.

874
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:36,194
My family was very--
Very much there for me.

875
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:39,231
Also, i had other friends
who were sick,

876
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:42,701
And so i--
It pulled me out of myself,

877
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:47,039
'Cause i could go
help take care of them.

878
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,774
I mean,
i think i mentioned peter,

879
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:52,244
Who was one of my
dearest friends.

880
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:53,979
He's one of the first
people i met

881
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:55,714
When i moved to san francisco.

882
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,449
He was tall and handsome,

883
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:59,618
And grew up
in a trailer park,

884
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:03,088
And he was--He used
to keep these diaries,

885
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:05,691
And he always wanted them
published after he died

886
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:09,594
As diaries of an
illiterate homosexual.

887
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,330
Peter was such an original.

888
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,800
He was just amazing.

889
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,872
He died two weeks
after steve.

890
00:46:20,872 --> 00:46:22,607
He had moved
back here to die.

891
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:23,909
He and his lover.

892
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,644
I had introduced
he an his lover,

893
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:27,379
George, and then
they moved to rhode island,

894
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:28,680
Where george was from,

895
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:30,415
And then when peter
started getting sick,

896
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:31,717
They moved back
to san francisco,

897
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,018
'Cause care was better,

898
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:35,187
And their core group
of friends was here,

899
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:39,091
And peter was getting
sicker and sicker,

900
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,392
And they told him,
you know,

901
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:42,561
You have, like,
four or five days to live,

902
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:44,730
And he was just
in so much discomfort

903
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:49,935
That he decided
to take his own life.

904
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,971
So we, you know,
we got together all the drugs,

905
00:46:52,971 --> 00:46:57,309
And the cocktail
that was gonna kill him,

906
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:01,213
And we had a party.
At his house.

907
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:02,514
He was in bed.

908
00:47:02,514 --> 00:47:06,418
Sort of like a--
Like a queen holding court.

909
00:47:06,418 --> 00:47:12,924
And we each got to go up
and say our goodbyes.

910
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:16,395
And i remember him saying,

911
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:18,997
"You know,
when i was single,

912
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:20,298
"You were married,

913
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,467
"And when i was married,
you were single.

914
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:25,937
"Did you think if we'd both
been single at the same time,

915
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,106
We would have been partners?"

916
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:31,576
And i said, "yeah.
I know we would have been."

917
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:34,613
And then he gave me one
of the most passionate kisses

918
00:47:35,047 --> 00:47:38,083
I've ever had in my life.

919
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:44,589
And then we all went away.

920
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:26,231
- I was the charge nurse
in the medical clinic,

921
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:30,135
And we were starting
the first a.Z.T. Trials,

922
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:34,906
And dr. Jay had come on
to help that,

923
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:36,641
And he looked at me one day,

924
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,678
And he said,
"i think we can do this."

925
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:42,714
We can do clinical research.

926
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:44,883
And so we started

927
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:49,654
The quest clinical research
center together.

928
00:48:50,088 --> 00:48:53,558
You know, both of us
had never done research.

929
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:56,595
We just kind of did it,
you know?

930
00:48:57,028 --> 00:49:03,101
Back then there weren't
as many, um, regulations.

931
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:06,571
The reason that you wanted
to do research back then

932
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:07,873
Was because there was nothing,

933
00:49:08,306 --> 00:49:10,909
And all you were doing
was helping people die,

934
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:14,379
And you just felt like you had
to work on these trials

935
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,982
And, you know,
figure out what was working,

936
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:18,717
Figure out
what the problems were

937
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:20,452
And get these drugs approved

938
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:23,054
So that everybody
could have 'em.

939
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:26,091
By doing this
and working really hard

940
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,260
And getting these drugs
on the market,

941
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:33,031
You know,
maybe we could save lives.

942
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:34,332
In the early days,

943
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:36,067
I would go to people's houses.

944
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:38,670
They were too sick to come in
to get their medicine,

945
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,538
I'd go to their house.

946
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:42,140
I'd draw their blood.

947
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,743
They would come in
very educated,

948
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:48,647
Wanting the newest treatment.

949
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:50,815
Sometimes they would know
more than i did,

950
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:53,852
'Cause they had, you know,
researched so much.

951
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:56,021
And, um,
i would learn from them.

952
00:49:56,454 --> 00:50:00,358
There was really
a camaraderie there.

953
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:03,395
You know, of course,
you know, we made mistakes.

954
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:06,431
When, you know, when we first
started the azt trials,

955
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:09,034
We were giving way too much,
you know.

956
00:50:09,034 --> 00:50:11,203
That's why people
got so sick on it,

957
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:14,239
And it got a bad rap.

958
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,974
If you ever
come to our office,

959
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:19,010
We have this picture
of this guy

960
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,480
Who is almost
like a skeleton,

961
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,782
And he's holding a sign,

962
00:50:23,782 --> 00:50:26,384
"Man can't live on azt alone,"

963
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:29,854
And every time
i see that picture,

964
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:32,891
It brings me back
to those days of--

965
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:35,493
We need more treatments.

966
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:38,096
We need more than azt.

967
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:44,169
And--And we need them
to happen quickly.

968
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:47,205
- I remember one fellow
particularly said to me,

969
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:49,374
"You know, i'm at the end
of my chemical rope,"

970
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:53,278
Um, and i thought,
"boy, what a phrase from our--

971
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:55,880
You know,
from this time."

972
00:50:56,314 --> 00:50:58,483
- These doctors were coming up

973
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:01,086
With every kind of pill
that you should take.

974
00:51:01,086 --> 00:51:04,990
It seemed like every day they
were coming up with a new cure,

975
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,592
But my friends
were guinea pigs,

976
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,629
And those cures didn't work,

977
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:14,099
And they were still dying,
and they were still dying,

978
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:18,436
And not even just my friends,
my relatives.

979
00:51:18,436 --> 00:51:23,642
You know, my--My cousin,
he died of aids, you know?

980
00:51:24,075 --> 00:51:27,545
And it was, like, the whole
family kept it, you know,

981
00:51:27,545 --> 00:51:29,281
Zips the lip.

982
00:51:29,281 --> 00:51:33,618
Nobody wanted to say
that people were gay, you know,

983
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:37,088
And we didn't speak about it.

984
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:39,257
We just said romeo was sick.

985
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:41,860
And, um,

986
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,330
He just succumbed to...

987
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:46,631
aids,

988
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:50,101
And he died.
Very quietly.

989
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:14,826
- I think my biggest fears
around getting sick

990
00:52:14,826 --> 00:52:18,730
Was...blindness.

991
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,200
There was a lot,
in the early days of aids,

992
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,236
Of c.M.V.,
cytomegalovirus,

993
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:26,971
Which attack the eyes,

994
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:28,707
And people were
losing their eyesight

995
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,875
In a short period of time.

996
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:34,346
And...

997
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,081
you know,
i could deal with pain,

998
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:36,948
Or they could, you know,

999
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:38,683
They could manage pain
and all that,

1000
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:40,852
But the idea
of losing my eyesight

1001
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:45,623
Was really--I think it really,
really scared me.

1002
00:52:46,057 --> 00:52:48,660
- We worked on this trial

1003
00:52:49,094 --> 00:52:51,262
For cmv retinitis.

1004
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:55,166
It affected,
infected people's eyes.

1005
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,769
We wanted to do research,

1006
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:02,974
So we would ask them if we could
take their eyes when they died.

1007
00:53:03,408 --> 00:53:05,577
And...

1008
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:09,047
you know, that was a hard
conversation to have,

1009
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,782
But people were into it.

1010
00:53:11,216 --> 00:53:13,818
They were going,
"this awful thing is happening,

1011
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:18,590
"And, you know, if i can give
my eyes to advance this,

1012
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:20,759
I'm willing to do that."

1013
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:23,361
Any time anybody is ill,

1014
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:27,265
You're meeting them at a very
vulnerable place in their life,

1015
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:32,904
And these relationships can grow
very intensely very quickly,

1016
00:53:32,904 --> 00:53:41,146
So it was my job to go
into the autopsy room,

1017
00:53:41,146 --> 00:53:45,917
Um, when the pathologist
would come and remove the eyes,

1018
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:50,255
And, uh, i would have
to put them in this little,

1019
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:52,857
Like, urine container,

1020
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:55,894
And then put them
in a paper bag,

1021
00:53:55,894 --> 00:53:59,364
And take them to the lab.

1022
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:02,834
And that was really,
really hard.

1023
00:54:03,268 --> 00:54:05,870
I mean, these were people
i really knew,

1024
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:10,208
And, uh, loved, liked,
whatever you want to say,

1025
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,979
And it was really hard
to, um, watch this.

1026
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:19,317
And something that
i'll never forget, actually.

1027
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:23,655
But one of my patients'
sisters really helped me.

1028
00:54:23,655 --> 00:54:30,161
Because she said to me
something like,

1029
00:54:30,161 --> 00:54:31,896
"It makes me feel better

1030
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,065
"To know that you're
gonna be with him

1031
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:35,800
"When this is happening,

1032
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,572
"That i was there
to watch over these people,

1033
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,608
"And make sure
they were treated with respect,

1034
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:47,078
And that their body
was handled with love,"

1035
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:53,151
And i just was so grateful
for her to give me that job.

1036
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:36,961
- How deeply are americans
worried about aids?

1037
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:38,263
Alos angeles timespoll

1038
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:39,998
Found that 50% of americans

1039
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:42,600
Favor quarantine
for aids victims.

1040
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,504
48% said they should be
issued special identification.

1041
00:55:46,504 --> 00:55:50,842
15% said aids victims
should be tattooed.

1042
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:54,312
We were preoccupied
for those first four years

1043
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:56,047
With extraordinary
civil rights attacks.

1044
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,083
In 1986 in california,

1045
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:02,120
There was an initiative on
the ballot by lyndon larouche,

1046
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,590
And it was an initiative
to enforce the quarantine laws

1047
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,626
Relative to hiv in california.

1048
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,964
And it was--It was written
in such a way to sound medical,

1049
00:56:12,964 --> 00:56:16,434
But the intent as interpreted
by the queer community

1050
00:56:16,868 --> 00:56:18,603
And everyone else was

1051
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:22,073
This is to stigmatize people
with hiv aids,

1052
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:25,109
And could go so far
as to have them

1053
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:27,278
Be quarantined
under doctor's orders.

1054
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:29,881
And when that ballot initiative
first was put forward,

1055
00:56:30,315 --> 00:56:32,917
Um, it was
overwhelmingly favored.

1056
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,520
It was overwhelmingly favored.

1057
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:39,424
And a statewide
campaign formed,

1058
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:41,593
And we organized
throughout california

1059
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:44,195
To defeat the initiative,
and defeated it.

1060
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:45,930
And it came again
two years later.

1061
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,099
It was put forward
a second time.

1062
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:50,702
Um, in--In '88.

1063
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:53,738
And simultaneously,
there were laws that were--

1064
00:56:53,738 --> 00:56:56,341
That was people could be fired
for being hiv positive.

1065
00:56:56,341 --> 00:56:58,509
People could be
mandatory tested.

1066
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:00,678
Other words, you could be tested
without your consent,

1067
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:03,715
Um, and then those results
made available to people.

1068
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:06,317
Fact is,
the reagan administration

1069
00:57:06,317 --> 00:57:07,619
Has been criminal
in its response,

1070
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:09,354
And they've done so
because they thought

1071
00:57:09,354 --> 00:57:10,655
It was a disease
of the gay community.

1072
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:13,691
And what needs to be done
is a federal program

1073
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,426
That's equivalent to our effort
to get to the moon,

1074
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,029
That is equivalent of our effort
to develop the atomic bomb.

1075
00:57:18,029 --> 00:57:20,632
If we implement that,
we can stop aids,

1076
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:22,800
But the way to go is not to
start violating civil rights.

1077
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,102
I mean, the way to go

1078
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:26,270
Is not to start turning
american against american

1079
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,138
In times of crisis.

1080
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,307
- And i believe
that when you live immorally,

1081
00:57:29,307 --> 00:57:31,042
Whether you're
a heterosexual or a homosexual,

1082
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:32,343
And you violate
the laws of god,

1083
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:34,078
And homosexuality does,

1084
00:57:34,078 --> 00:57:41,019
You become wide open to every
kind of sin and sickness.

1085
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:44,489
- I think the country
as a whole understood

1086
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,959
That the queer community
was taking care of each other,

1087
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:50,128
That our principal response

1088
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:53,598
Was food banks
and care programs,

1089
00:57:54,032 --> 00:57:57,068
And that it was a response
that america should be proud of,

1090
00:57:57,068 --> 00:58:00,104
And that maybe
the pat buchanans

1091
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:02,273
And the bigots
who were attacking us

1092
00:58:02,707 --> 00:58:05,743
And who basically just
wanted us to die were wrong.

1093
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:07,045
And at a certain point,

1094
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:09,213
Those--Those attacks
just stopped.

1095
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:12,250
They just couldn't
get traction

1096
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,021
To continue to stigmatize
people with aids.

1097
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:20,491
- Aids organizations were just
popping up everywhere.

1098
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:21,359
I mean, that was--

1099
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,094
It was called
the san francisco model.

1100
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:26,130
I think one of the reasons
the san francisco model worked

1101
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:28,733
Was 'cause of the size
of san francisco,

1102
00:58:28,733 --> 00:58:31,335
And because of
castro street itself,

1103
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:36,541
That there was a center.

1104
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:40,011
San francisco people
came here not for career.

1105
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:43,915
They came here because
they wanted to live here.

1106
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:47,385
And when aids came along,

1107
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,987
The community was sort of
inherent in that.

1108
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:52,590
It--All it needed
was the aids epidemic

1109
00:58:53,024 --> 00:58:55,626
To really make it coalesce.

1110
00:58:55,626 --> 00:58:58,229
Whether it was taking care
of peoples' pets

1111
00:58:58,663 --> 00:58:59,964
When they were
in the hospital,

1112
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:02,567
Or bringing them food,
like open hand,

1113
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,169
Everybody wanted
to do something.

1114
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:08,206
It was a way
the community came together

1115
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:10,808
In an amazing way that...

1116
00:59:10,808 --> 00:59:14,278
you know,
politics had never done that.

1117
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:16,881
And it brought together
the women's community

1118
00:59:16,881 --> 00:59:19,484
And the gay women's community
and the gay male community

1119
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:25,123
In ways that had certainly
never happened before.

1120
00:59:25,556 --> 00:59:27,291
- Again and again,
in every situation,

1121
00:59:27,725 --> 00:59:30,328
Every circumstance,
there's lesbians there

1122
00:59:30,328 --> 00:59:32,497
Leading the fight.

1123
00:59:32,497 --> 00:59:35,533
All the women had friends
who were gay guys

1124
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,702
Who were sick.

1125
00:59:38,136 --> 00:59:40,738
I was walking up castro street
one day to my apartment,

1126
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:43,341
And in the early days
of these horrible tests,

1127
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:46,811
People would become anemic,
severely anemic.

1128
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,112
There was also
a blood shortage,

1129
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:50,715
Because of hiv and blood.

1130
00:59:50,715 --> 00:59:53,317
Lesbians weren't at risk
for hiv,

1131
00:59:53,317 --> 00:59:55,920
And--And could donate blood,
and did.

1132
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,655
And so i'm walking up
castro street,

1133
00:59:57,655 --> 00:59:58,956
And i see a poster,

1134
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:00,691
And i believe it was from
the lesbian caucus

1135
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:01,993
Of the harvey milk
gay democratic club,

1136
01:00:02,426 --> 01:00:04,595
And it said
"our boys need blood.

1137
01:00:05,029 --> 01:00:06,764
"Lesbian caucus blood drive

1138
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:09,367
For people with aids,
san francisco."

1139
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,536
And i remember thinking,

1140
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:16,307
"This is just
a wonderful thing."

1141
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:18,910
- People came
to san francisco to go,

1142
01:00:19,343 --> 01:00:26,284
"What is happening here that
the response is so heartfelt?"

1143
01:00:26,717 --> 01:00:30,188
I think what made 5-A
such a spectacular place

1144
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,489
And such a powerful response

1145
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,658
Were the people
who worked there.

1146
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:35,827
It's also true
of shanti project.

1147
01:00:35,827 --> 01:00:38,429
I mean--
I mean, literally,

1148
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:39,730
It was thousands of people

1149
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:43,201
Who volunteered
thousands of hours.

- Every other sunday,
there is a party on ward 5-B.

1152
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:56,647
The hostess is a travel agent
named rita berger,

1153

But the nurses and the patients
know her as rita rocket.

1154
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:06,190
- She came on an easter
to offer to do an easter brunch.

1155
01:01:06,624 --> 01:01:10,962
It went so well, turned into,
like, she would come on sundays.

1156
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:17,468
And she would come
with this whole group of men,

1157
01:01:17,468 --> 01:01:19,203
Who spent
a good part of the week,

[Cheers and applause]

1160
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,349
- I got together
with some friends,

1161
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:34,819
And we started an organization
called visual aid.

1162
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:35,686
I thought, okay, you know,

1163
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,289
Just start in
the community that i know,

1164
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:39,590
Which is artists,

1165
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,759
And i was seeing
artist friends

1166
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,097
Who were having to make
the choice between...

1167
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:50,001
medical care
or art supplies.

1168
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,736
When art was--

1169
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:53,037
You know,
it was also therapy.

1170
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:54,772
It keeps you going.

1171
01:01:54,772 --> 01:01:58,242
So we started this
organization called visual aid,

1172
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:03,881
Which would give artists
access to art supplies.

1173
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:05,182
We had great t-Shirts,

1174
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:06,050
And we would sell them

1175
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:09,086
At every street fair
gay pride parade,

1176
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,821
And we actually
made a lot of money,

1177
01:02:11,255 --> 01:02:13,424
And i remember
in one meeting saying,

1178
01:02:13,424 --> 01:02:14,725
"You know, christmastime

1179
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:16,894
"Is a time when people
are buying lots of gifts,

1180
01:02:16,894 --> 01:02:18,195
"And there's no street fairs.

1181
01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:19,497
"We should do
something about that.

1182
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:21,666
We should have a place that
we could sell these things."

1183
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:26,437
And so i had this idea
to start a store.

1184
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:28,606
I had pulled together
a board of directors,

1185
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:33,377
And they wanted
to name it aids mart.

1186
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:35,546
And i said, "no."

1187
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,149
I said,
"i'm gonna pull rank here.

1188
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:42,053
I'm the president, and it's not
gonna be called aids mart."

1189
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:45,957
They said, "aids mart.
Aid smart. See?"

1190
01:02:45,957 --> 01:02:47,258
And i said, "no.

1191
01:02:47,258 --> 01:02:50,294
Nobody's gonna shop
at a store called aids mart."

1192
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:52,463
But "under one roof"
just sounded right.

1193
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:55,066
I remember
working the cash register,

1194
01:02:55,499 --> 01:02:57,668
And, you know,
when you're working at a store,

1195
01:02:57,668 --> 01:03:00,271
You usually say thank you
to the customer.

1196
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:03,307
I swear, every customer
would just say "thank you.

1197
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,910
Thank you for doing this."

1198

'Cause, you know,
people who weren't

1199

Doing anything in the
community felt so powerless,

1200
01:03:11,115 --> 01:03:14,151
And here was one even
little way, by shopping,

1201
01:03:14,151 --> 01:03:18,923
By buying a mug or a t-Shirt
for their aunt tillie.

1202
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:20,224
What ended up happening is,

1203
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:23,260
Most of our volunteers
were people with aids

1204
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,996
Who were on disability.

1205
01:03:24,996 --> 01:03:26,297
People were sick.

1206
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,466
But they could get out of bed
one day a week

1207
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:30,201
And work the cash register.

1208
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:33,671
And it became,
for a lot of our volunteers,

1209
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:34,538
Their social life,

1210
01:03:34,972 --> 01:03:39,744
Their only time
out of their houses.

1211
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:43,647
- I felt as though
we were more compassionate.

1212
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:44,949
We were going through things

1213

didn't go through,

didn't understand.

It just went over
everybody's head.

How close that brought
everybody together.

You know, it was just, like,
we didn't care who you were,

01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:04,902
But we all had
the same burden.

1220
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:07,071
And that was just, like,

1221
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:09,673
It was just, like, the glue.

1222
01:04:09,673 --> 01:04:14,011
- Gay people were never seen
as care givers.

1223
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:17,048
They were seen as, you know,
good time people, you know,

Having fun, being wild.

And, all of a sudden, we were
the ultimate care givers.

time taking care of my friends.

all this was really happening.

1251
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:47,565
How do you stop working
in a place like this?"

1252
01:06:47,565 --> 01:06:51,468
We have a local newspaper
here in san francisco

1253
01:06:51,468 --> 01:06:53,204
Called thebay area reporter,

1254
01:06:53,637 --> 01:06:56,674
And there was one issue.

1255
01:06:56,674 --> 01:07:01,011
They decided to run
just all the photos

1256
01:07:01,011 --> 01:07:05,349
Of the people that had died
in the last year.

1257
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:15,326
It was just page
after page after page

1258
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:17,928
After page.

1259
01:07:18,362 --> 01:07:20,965
Of all of these
primarily gay men

1260
01:07:20,965 --> 01:07:24,001
Who had died on the unit.

1261
01:07:28,339 --> 01:07:31,375
I just felt something,
like, right here.

1262
01:07:31,809 --> 01:07:35,713
It was a physical,
like, click.

1263
01:07:36,146 --> 01:07:37,881
Because i saw all these faces,

1264
01:07:38,315 --> 01:07:42,219
And i was stunned.

1265
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:49,159
By how many of them i knew
from working on the unit.

1266
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:53,497
And i, you know, i realized

1267
01:07:53,497 --> 01:07:55,232
I couldn't.

1268
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:59,136
I just couldn't--
Couldn't do it anymore.

1269
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:07,378
- There's times
when you just think,

1270
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:09,980
"I can't take it anymore.

1271
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,282
"I don't want to watch this.

1272
01:08:11,282 --> 01:08:12,583
"I don't want to see it.

1273
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,318
"There's just too many images

1274
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:17,354
That i don't want in my head."

1275
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:23,427
And, you know, your feeling
of wanting to run away.

1276
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:28,198
It was my generation
that was being infected,

1277
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,669
And so that, of course,
made it even heavier,

1278
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:36,006
Because, you know,
we were way too young to die.

1279
01:08:36,006 --> 01:08:40,344
And i felt like i was too young
to go through all this.

1280
01:08:40,778 --> 01:08:44,682
Why--You know,
all this loss.

1281
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:48,152
When you're doing this work,

1282
01:08:48,152 --> 01:08:51,622
You have to figure out
how to take care of yourself

1283
01:08:51,622 --> 01:08:55,526
And not feel it all the time.

1284
01:08:55,526 --> 01:08:58,128
But sometimes
when somebody would die,

1285
01:08:58,562 --> 01:09:00,731
And i'd find myself crying,

1286
01:09:00,731 --> 01:09:03,767
I would feel like
i was crying for everyone.

1287
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:05,502
It wasn't just that person.

1288
01:09:05,936 --> 01:09:08,539
It just felt overwhelming,

1289
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:10,708
And i just--

1290
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:13,310
'Cause sometimes
you just really had to cry.

1291
01:09:13,744 --> 01:09:15,913
You had to let it out.

1292
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:21,118
- I think there were
probably some times

1293
01:09:21,118 --> 01:09:22,419
During the epidemic for me

1294
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:24,154
Where i would hear
somebody was sick,

1295
01:09:24,588 --> 01:09:28,926
And it was just--
I wouldn't call them,

1296
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,661
Or i'd just--
I couldn't see them.

1297
01:09:30,661 --> 01:09:31,962
It was just too much.

1298
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:35,866
It was just, like, i...

1299
01:09:35,866 --> 01:09:38,035
somehow knew my limits,

1300
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:41,505
And i couldn't take
one more sick friend...

1301
01:09:41,505 --> 01:09:42,806
on.

1302
01:09:42,806 --> 01:09:46,710
And it felt bad.

1303
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,445
But it was--It's so easy

1304
01:09:48,445 --> 01:09:50,614
To just become part
of a caregiver's group

1305
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:52,349
And, you know,
that's your life

1306
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:54,952
For the next
many, many months,

1307
01:09:54,952 --> 01:09:58,856
And sometimes
i just couldn't do it.

1308
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:01,892
Especially during
the late '80s and early '90s.

1309
01:10:01,892 --> 01:10:05,362
I was sick,
and it was just enough

1310
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:08,399
To get, you know,
get me out of bed.

1311
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,001
A lot of times, it was
the side effects of the drugs.

1312
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:13,604
It wasn't just
the disease itself.

1313
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:14,905
You're just so caught up
with dealing--

1314
01:10:15,339 --> 01:10:20,544
Whether it's nausea or wasting
or dizziness or fatigue,

1315
01:10:20,544 --> 01:10:22,279
That you don't have time

1316
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,580
To worry about
what else could happen.

1317
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,050
It's just you're dealing with
what is happening.

1318
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:30,087
Tim was my partner
during this time,

1319
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:32,256
But he was also hiv positive,

1320
01:10:32,689 --> 01:10:36,160
And i just didn't think
i could do it again.

1321
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,328
I could not
lose another partner,

1322
01:10:38,762 --> 01:10:40,063
And i told him that.

1323
01:10:40,063 --> 01:10:40,931
But we liked each other.

1324
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:43,100
We had really good
times together.

1325
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,401
And we kept
seeing each other,

1326
01:10:44,835 --> 01:10:46,570
And after about six months,

1327
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:51,775
He said, you know,
"are we together, or aren't we?

1328
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:53,076
Are you here,
or aren't you?"

1329
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:54,812
And i just, you know, said,

1330
01:10:54,812 --> 01:10:57,848
"You know,
i really love this person,

1331
01:10:57,848 --> 01:11:01,752
And what happens,
you know, happens."

1332
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:04,354
We would sort of
take turns being sick.

1333
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:05,656
You know,
i would get really sick,

1334
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:06,957
And then
he would take care of me,

1335
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:09,560
Then he would get really sick,
and i would take care of him,

1336
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,464
And thank god we were never
both sick at the same time.

1337
01:11:13,897 --> 01:11:15,199
He was not feeling well,

1338
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,500
And i called the doctor,

1339
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:18,235
And i said,
"i'm going to the hospital."

1340
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:20,404
And i bundled him
into the car

1341
01:11:20,838 --> 01:11:24,308
And drive him down
dolores street.

1342
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:29,079
He...i guess an aneurysm.

1343
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:31,682
He just--His mouth
just locked shut,

1344
01:11:31,682 --> 01:11:35,586
And there i am driving, like,
80 miles an hour

1345
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,754
Down dolores street,

1346
01:11:37,754 --> 01:11:39,923
And try to pry his mouth open,

1347
01:11:40,357 --> 01:11:42,960
Just saying,
"breathe, breathe."

1348
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,430
And we were supposed
to go to cpmc,

1349
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,599
But i knew that was
way too far away,

1350
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:51,635
And davies was closer,
and i just--I mean,

1351
01:11:51,635 --> 01:11:53,804
Thank god i didn't
kill anybody on the street.

1352
01:11:53,804 --> 01:11:55,105
I was really going down--

1353
01:11:55,105 --> 01:11:57,274
Running every light
on dolores street,

1354
01:11:57,274 --> 01:12:02,913
Just honking my horn,
just driving.

1355
01:12:02,913 --> 01:12:06,817
And by the time
i got to davies, he was dead.

1356
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:08,552
It was so quick.

1357
01:12:08,552 --> 01:12:11,588
I was in
a total state of shock.

1358
01:12:18,529 --> 01:12:22,866
I thought i was gonna
lose my mind.

1359
01:12:22,866 --> 01:12:26,770
Just felt like
it would be real easy

1360
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:28,939
To just not be here anymore.

1361
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:30,674
Most of my friends were dead.

1362
01:12:31,108 --> 01:12:35,445
And there just didn't seem to be
any reason to stick around.

1363
01:12:35,445 --> 01:12:38,482
But i didn't, and i'm really
glad i didn't kill myself.

1364
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:41,518
But it was--It's the only time
i've ever been suicidal.

1365
01:12:41,952 --> 01:12:43,687
It just--And it was odd.

1366
01:12:44,121 --> 01:12:45,856
It wasn't...

1367
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,591
it wasn't a crazy suicidal.

1368
01:12:47,591 --> 01:12:50,193
It just felt very, like,

1369
01:12:50,193 --> 01:12:52,796
"I don't--" You know,
"i don't need to be here.

1370
01:12:52,796 --> 01:12:54,965
There's no reason
for me to be here."

1371
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:57,568
It seemed very logical.

1372
01:12:57,568 --> 01:13:01,471
Um, i still could understand it,
looking back.

1373
01:13:35,305 --> 01:13:36,607
- There was some hope
on treatment,

1374
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:37,908
Some hope on research.

1375
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:40,077
Some of the money
had begun to flow,

1376
01:13:40,077 --> 01:13:43,113
And it had paid off
with some early drugs.

1377
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:45,282
Experimental drugs
were more accessible.

1378
01:13:45,282 --> 01:13:48,318
Gay activists were meeting
with pharmaceutical companies

1379
01:13:48,318 --> 01:13:50,487
To actually
talk about medicines.

1380
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:52,656
So, yeah, there was--
And then act up comes.

1381
01:13:52,656 --> 01:13:54,825
It was, like, this wave
of sort of brilliant,

1382
01:13:55,258 --> 01:13:58,729
Young,
artistic new yorkers.

1383
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:00,030
Uh, thing about act up,

1384
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:02,199
Is it's true
they were political,

1385
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:03,500
But they were
political artists.

1386
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,801
From their very
opening statement,

1387
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:06,103
"Silence equals death,"

1388
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:07,404
It's art, it's culture,

1389
01:14:07,404 --> 01:14:11,742
And it was, you know,
it transformed the dialogue.

1390
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,477
- 60,000 deaths remain!

1391
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:16,513
Where was george?

1392
01:14:16,513 --> 01:14:18,248
- Fight back!
Fight aids!

1393
01:14:18,248 --> 01:14:20,417
- Healthcare is awry!

1394
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:24,321
Healthcare is awry!

1395
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:27,791
- That was the first time
i crossed a picket line.

1396
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:31,261
I wanted to go in
to the aids conference,

1397
01:14:31,261 --> 01:14:35,599
Because there was information
i wanted to get inside.

1398
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:37,768
And what they were screaming
and hollering about,

1399
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:39,069
I agreed with.

1400
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:41,238
So--But then i realized

1401
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,142
That everybody is doing
what they need to do.

1402
01:14:45,575 --> 01:14:46,877
They need to be out there

1403
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,046
Screaming and hollering
and pushing,

1404
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:52,082
Because things don't happen
unless you push.

1405
01:14:52,082 --> 01:14:54,685
And i needed to go in
to get that information

1406
01:14:54,685 --> 01:14:56,420
So i could take care of them.

1407
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,890
And--So it made me--
Once i figured that out,

1408
01:15:00,323 --> 01:15:02,926
It was a little easier
to cross that picket line.

1409
01:15:02,926 --> 01:15:05,962
- Act up! Fight back!
Fight aids!

1410
01:15:05,962 --> 01:15:10,300
- I mean, that was when drugs
weren't on the fast track,

1411
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,336
Where it took ten years
to get a drug approved,

1412
01:15:13,336 --> 01:15:15,072
And the activists
really worked

1413
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:18,108
For that to change.

1414
01:15:22,879 --> 01:15:26,349
- Neil jaeger.

1415
01:15:26,349 --> 01:15:29,820
James martin case.

1416
01:15:30,253 --> 01:15:32,856
- One of the ways
i came back into the world

1417
01:15:32,856 --> 01:15:35,025
Was through the names project,

1418
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:37,627
Which is the aids
memorial quilt,

1419
01:15:37,627 --> 01:15:40,230
Which cleve jones started.

1420
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:44,134
- And my friend,
marvin feldman.

1421
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:47,604
- He came up with the idea
that people would make panels,

1422
01:15:47,604 --> 01:15:52,375
Memorializing their friends
and children and lovers.

1423
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:55,846
It was a creative, positive way
to focus their grief,

1424
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:57,581
Then sew it all together,

1425
01:15:57,581 --> 01:16:03,653
And make a powerful,
political statement.

1426
01:16:03,653 --> 01:16:07,124
- When they went to washington
and unfolded those blankets,

1427
01:16:07,124 --> 01:16:10,594
It was like,
you know, to me,

1428
01:16:10,594 --> 01:16:14,064
Lotus flower after lotus flower
after lotus flower,

1429
01:16:14,064 --> 01:16:16,666
And each petal was a person,
you know?

1430
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,835
And it was so powerful.

1431
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:20,137
It was so powerful.

1432
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:23,173
You didn't even
have to say anything.

1433
01:16:23,173 --> 01:16:26,209
The tears would just come.

1434
01:16:35,318 --> 01:16:36,186
- How are you?

1435
01:16:36,186 --> 01:16:38,789
- I'm good.
Nervous, but good.

1436
01:16:38,789 --> 01:16:40,957
- Sure.
Results are negative.

1437
01:16:41,391 --> 01:16:43,126
- Okay. Good.

1438
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:43,994
- Good.
- Good.

1439
01:16:44,427 --> 01:16:47,464
- I still wanted
to be involved.

1440
01:16:47,898 --> 01:16:49,199
After my work
in the hospital,

1441
01:16:49,633 --> 01:16:53,103
It was fairly easy
for me to translate,

1442
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:54,838
Take those skills,

1443
01:16:54,838 --> 01:16:58,742
And move into working
in testing clinics,

1444
01:16:59,176 --> 01:17:01,778
And working with people
who are at risk for hiv,

1445
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:04,815
As well as occasionally
having to tell people

1446
01:17:04,815 --> 01:17:06,983
That they were infected.

1447
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:08,718
- When the test occurred,

1448
01:17:09,152 --> 01:17:10,020
One of the main
things we could do

1449
01:17:10,453 --> 01:17:11,755
Is figure out how
we're doing on prevention,

1450
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,056
And we were able
to turn that around,

1451
01:17:13,056 --> 01:17:16,526
So the likelihood that more and
more people were being infected

1452
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:18,695
Had--Had been changed.

1453
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:20,864
So less despair.

1454
01:17:20,864 --> 01:17:24,768
Less sense of absolute crisis.

1455
01:17:25,202 --> 01:17:27,370
We're now
getting into a sense of

1456
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,841
Maybe there's
a place to go here.

1457
01:17:30,841 --> 01:17:33,443
- Some things
seemed to be working.

1458
01:17:33,443 --> 01:17:35,612
I'm not saying
that there was a cure,

1459
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:39,516
But there was a slow down.

1460
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:43,420
You know, people weren't
dropping like flies anymore.

1461
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:48,625
Some people were, uh,
hanging on.

1462
01:17:49,059 --> 01:17:52,529
There was this one guy.

1463
01:17:52,529 --> 01:17:53,830
He was in a wheelchair.

1464
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:55,565
He used to come
by in a bicycle,

1465
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:56,867
And then
he was in a wheelchair,

1466
01:17:56,867 --> 01:17:58,602
And then he had a patch
over his eye,

1467
01:17:58,602 --> 01:18:01,204
And i really hated
to look at him,

1468
01:18:01,204 --> 01:18:04,241
Because i remember
when this guy

1469
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:05,976
Used to come by on his bicycle

1470
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:09,012
And buy flowers for his sister,

1471
01:18:09,012 --> 01:18:11,615
And we would just laugh
and everything,

1472
01:18:12,048 --> 01:18:14,217
And i couldn't
laugh at him anymore,

1473
01:18:14,217 --> 01:18:16,386
Because he was coming by
in a wheelchair,

1474
01:18:16,386 --> 01:18:18,989
And it was like he was
almost on his way out,

1475
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:24,194
And i just thought,
"god, where are you?

1476
01:18:24,194 --> 01:18:27,664
Look at what's happening."

1477
01:18:27,664 --> 01:18:30,267
And he was one of the first

1478
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,737
Who the next time i saw him,

1479
01:18:33,737 --> 01:18:35,472
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

1480
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,074
He was walking.
He had a cane.

1481
01:18:38,074 --> 01:18:39,809
And then the next
time i saw him,

1482
01:18:39,809 --> 01:18:42,846
He didn't have that
eye patch on anymore.

1483
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,183
And then,
hey, i swear to you,

1484
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:50,654
Yesterday,
i saw him at my flower stand.

1485
01:18:51,087 --> 01:18:53,256
On his bicycle.
And he was back.

1486
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:55,859
He wasn't back like he was
in the beginning,

1487
01:18:55,859 --> 01:19:00,196
But, you know, i'm not the way
i was 20 years ago either,

1488
01:19:00,196 --> 01:19:06,703
But he was there, and he had
gone through the storm,

1489
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:09,306
And he had
weathered the storm,

1490
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:14,077
And his spirit was just
as bright and effervescent

1491
01:19:14,077 --> 01:19:16,246
As it was in the beginning.

1492
01:19:18,415 --> 01:19:20,150
-The washington post
came out with a headline,

1493
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,319
And it showed death from aids,

1494
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:24,487
And it was a graph
going down.

1495
01:19:24,487 --> 01:19:28,391
And it basically said
"cocktail proves effective

1496
01:19:28,391 --> 01:19:30,994
Against hiv aids."

1497
01:19:30,994 --> 01:19:36,199
This means that aids work
as we know it is transformed.

1498
01:19:53,984 --> 01:19:56,152
- I remember my friend ben
saying in the old days

1499
01:19:56,152 --> 01:19:57,887
That he would never
go to costco

1500
01:19:57,887 --> 01:20:00,490
And buy one of those
big things of toilet paper,

1501
01:20:00,924 --> 01:20:03,093
'Cause he didn't think
he'd ever use it all up,

1502
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:05,695
And now he can.
That's the difference.

1503
01:20:06,129 --> 01:20:08,298
I would never take a commission

1504
01:20:08,298 --> 01:20:10,033
More than five
or six months out,

1505
01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:12,202
'Cause i didn't think
i'd be able to finish it.

1506
01:20:12,635 --> 01:20:16,973
Now i'll take a commission
that's, you know, a year out.

1507
01:20:16,973 --> 01:20:20,010
And now i have
a partner to my love,

1508
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,745
And whom i hope to be with

1509
01:20:22,178 --> 01:20:23,480
For a very, very long time,

1510
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,648
And so i'm imagining a future.

1511
01:20:25,648 --> 01:20:27,817
I'm allowing myself
to imagine a future.

1512
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:29,986
And that's--
That's scary too.

1513
01:20:29,986 --> 01:20:32,155
There's still--I mean,
i can feel it right now.

1514
01:20:32,155 --> 01:20:33,890
There's, like,
butterflies in my stomach,

1515
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:34,758
'Cause, like, i'm hoping.

1516
01:20:34,758 --> 01:20:36,926
I'm feeling that hope again.

1517
01:20:36,926 --> 01:20:38,228
And i could lose it.

1518
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:39,963
And i have
to remember that.

1519
01:20:39,963 --> 01:20:42,999
'Cause, you know,
you get sick, and bam.

1520
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:46,903
You just sink
right down again.

1521
01:20:50,373 --> 01:20:53,410
- My friend john
who has studied buddhism

1522
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:57,313
Talks about
this metaphor of people

1523
01:20:57,313 --> 01:21:02,085
Who have been through
some huge experience of loss,

1524
01:21:02,085 --> 01:21:06,423
Who cannot find their way back,
if you will,

1525
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:08,591
To the land of the living.

1526
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:10,760
But they still walk the earth.

1527
01:21:11,194 --> 01:21:14,664
Hungry.
Hungry for connection.

1528
01:21:14,664 --> 01:21:21,604
Hungry for some way to regain
a sense of life and balance,

1529
01:21:21,604 --> 01:21:24,207
And that--I do,

1530
01:21:24,207 --> 01:21:25,942
When i walk through
the castro sometimes,

1531
01:21:25,942 --> 01:21:29,846
I see--I see people who
haven't been able to do that,

1532
01:21:29,846 --> 01:21:32,882
And that's something that could
have easily happened to me,

1533
01:21:32,882 --> 01:21:34,617
And that i could have,
you know,

1534
01:21:34,617 --> 01:21:37,220
Become one of those
hungry ghosts,

1535
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,256
And, luckily, for me...

1536
01:21:43,726 --> 01:21:46,763
it changed.
I met someone.

1537
01:21:46,763 --> 01:21:49,799
And i encountered life again.

1538
01:21:49,799 --> 01:21:52,836
Here was this man
walking down the street,

1539
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:57,607
And thank god i got it together,
and i said hello.

1540
01:21:57,607 --> 01:22:01,077
And he's younger than me.

1541
01:22:01,077 --> 01:22:03,680
Like,
much younger than me.

1542
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,017
And it's been a powerful,
powerful experience

1543
01:22:08,017 --> 01:22:10,620
To love and be
very close to someone

1544
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:13,223
Who's younger than me
who did not have

1545
01:22:13,223 --> 01:22:17,127
The experience that i had
with the aids epidemic

1546
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,295
And all that terrible loss,

1547
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:23,633
And go on with my life
having that inside me,

1548
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:30,573
And it not be
the all-Consuming...

1549
01:22:30,573 --> 01:22:33,176
experience that i had had.

1550
01:22:33,176 --> 01:22:36,646
And as much
as i think about my father

1551
01:22:36,646 --> 01:22:38,381
And what he went through
in the war,

1552
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:42,719
I don't want, like,
my war to do to me

1553
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,888
What it did to him.

1554
01:22:49,225 --> 01:22:52,695
- In january of 2007,
i became the executive director

1555
01:22:53,129 --> 01:22:57,901
Of the glbt historical society
in san francisco.

1556
01:22:57,901 --> 01:23:00,937
And, uh,
and it surprised me

1557
01:23:00,937 --> 01:23:03,540
That basically
the conversation about aids

1558
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,275
That i'd been having
for so many years

1559
01:23:05,275 --> 01:23:07,443
Wasn't still going on
in that group,

1560
01:23:07,443 --> 01:23:10,914
Or in the community--The glbt
community of san francisco.

1561
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:12,215
Because, for me,
it had continued,

1562
01:23:12,215 --> 01:23:13,950
'Cause i was doing
international aids work

1563
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,251
And working with aids groups.

1564
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,420
So suddenly no one
was talking about aids.

1565
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,721
There weren't people with aids

1566
01:23:18,721 --> 01:23:20,456
Who everyone was sort of--

1567
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,625
If they were around,
they were--

1568
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:24,360
Took me a while to figure out
who they were,

1569
01:23:24,794 --> 01:23:30,433
And, uh, an entire,
you know, part of, uh...

1570
01:23:30,433 --> 01:23:33,903
how i had perceived
the community had changed.

1571
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:40,410
- I don't have to worry
when i'm old,

1572
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,145
You know,
and looking back at my life

1573
01:23:42,579 --> 01:23:44,314
That i didn't do anything.

1574
01:23:44,314 --> 01:23:46,916
And in terms of my politics,

1575
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:52,555
This was the thing
that i got to do the most.

1576
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:57,760
Without all these people
participating

1577
01:23:58,194 --> 01:23:59,495
In these clinical trials,

1578
01:23:59,495 --> 01:24:02,532
We would not be
where we are today.

1579
01:24:02,532 --> 01:24:05,134
And i really wish

1580
01:24:05,134 --> 01:24:10,340
That some of them
were around today.

1581
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:12,508
To see where we are.

1582
01:24:12,508 --> 01:24:14,677
Because...
i don't know.

1583
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:17,280
They just gave a lot.

1584
01:24:21,184 --> 01:24:24,654
- This tragedy,
it taught us how to be humble.

1585
01:24:24,654 --> 01:24:26,389
It taught us
how to be honest.

1586
01:24:26,389 --> 01:24:29,425
It taught us how to--
To love

1587
01:24:29,425 --> 01:24:33,329
In spite of what's
at the end of the tunnel.

1588
01:24:33,763 --> 01:24:38,101
You know, how to be
a little bit more considerate

1589
01:24:38,534 --> 01:24:40,703
Of another person.

1590
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:45,041
It--It showed us
how to find spirituality.

1591
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:47,644
It taught me.
I can only speak for myself.

1592
01:24:48,077 --> 01:24:50,246
It taught me
how to find my spirit,

1593
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,283
And how to, you know,

1594
01:24:53,283 --> 01:24:56,319
Make my flame brighter.

1595
01:25:00,223 --> 01:25:03,693
- You know, it's, like,
the aids epidemic is not over.

1596
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:07,597
I still have friends
who are living with hiv.

1597
01:25:07,597 --> 01:25:11,501
Every once in a while,
someone i know becomes infected.

1598
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:14,103
I mean, it continues.

1599
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:17,573
What has stopped continuing,

1600
01:25:17,573 --> 01:25:21,044
At least in san francisco
and in most of the--

1601
01:25:21,044 --> 01:25:22,779
Of the developed world,

1602
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:28,851
Is the--The vast amount
of sickness and death.

1603
01:25:29,285 --> 01:25:34,924
I would really like
to be able to live long enough

1604
01:25:34,924 --> 01:25:38,394
To know, like,
how does the epidemic

1605
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:40,129
Actually come to an end?

1606
01:25:40,563 --> 01:25:42,298
Like,
will the treatments come

1607
01:25:42,732 --> 01:25:47,070
And--And finally
and effectively stop people

1608
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,371
From becoming sicker?

1609
01:25:48,805 --> 01:25:52,275
And will the vaccine come,
and--

1610
01:25:52,275 --> 01:25:57,046
And stop people from being able
to transmit and acquire it,

1611
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,818
And--And will it all
just finally...

1612
01:26:01,818 --> 01:26:04,854
finally just stop?

1613
01:26:07,457 --> 01:26:10,059
- You know, when people say,
"how did you get through it?"

1614
01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:12,228
It's like,
"i don't know."

1615
01:26:12,228 --> 01:26:14,397
You know?
You just do.

1616
01:26:14,397 --> 01:26:15,264
And everybody does.

1617
01:26:15,698 --> 01:26:17,867
I mean, anybody
who's got cancer or aids,

1618
01:26:17,867 --> 01:26:20,470
And they're just like, "oh,
you're, you know, so amazing

1619
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:21,771
You--You've
gotten through this."

1620
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:24,374
It's like,
"do i have a choice?"

1621
01:26:24,374 --> 01:26:26,109
You know.
I want to stay alive,

1622
01:26:26,109 --> 01:26:28,277
And i'm gonna take care
of myself the best i can,

1623
01:26:28,711 --> 01:26:31,748
And you just do it.
And it's not heroic.

1624
01:26:31,748 --> 01:26:33,916
You just do it.

1625
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:36,953
And the same thing
with losing a partner.

1626
01:26:36,953 --> 01:26:38,254
It's...

1627
01:26:38,254 --> 01:26:41,290
you know,
so many, you know...

1628
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:43,459
most people in the world
lose partners,

1629
01:26:43,893 --> 01:26:45,194
You know, at one time
in their lives or another,

1630
01:26:45,628 --> 01:26:47,363
And you just--
You live through it,

1631
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:49,098
And it's horrible,

1632
01:26:49,098 --> 01:26:52,568
But you do live through it.

1633
01:26:55,171 --> 01:27:00,376
I know i have so many friends
who died so young.

1634
01:27:00,376 --> 01:27:02,111
That's--I mean, that's...

1635
01:27:02,545 --> 01:27:06,883
that, to me,
is the most painful part.

1636
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:09,919
What would the world be like now
if they were alive?

1637
01:27:10,353 --> 01:27:12,955
It would be different.
It would be very different.

1638
01:27:13,389 --> 01:27:15,558
I mean,
so many powerful people,

1639
01:27:15,558 --> 01:27:17,727
Talented people.

1640
01:27:21,197 --> 01:27:25,101
I miss...

1641
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:26,836
i miss a lot of them.

1642
01:27:26,836 --> 01:27:29,872
A lot.

1643
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:35,511
