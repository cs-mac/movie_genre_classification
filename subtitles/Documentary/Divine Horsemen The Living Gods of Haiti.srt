1
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,554
Sean, let's go.

2
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,724
Sean, come downstairs.

3
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,051
Hi there.

4
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:17,994
- How long has this been here?
- Tuesday.

5
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,918
10-23 over on 10th and Montgomery.

6
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:53,398
Yeah. Detective. we got
a possible 1 87 out on Route 59...

7
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,833
south of Washington Township.

8
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,587
Detective Breslin.

9
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,269
Right this way.

10
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:07,168
- Has anybody moved the body?
- No.

11
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,800
- But-
- You got a cause of death?

12
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,675
Well, officially...

13
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,045
we haven't determined death...

14
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,015
sir.

15
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:29,329
What the fuck is that?

16
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:51,379
We thought we should call you
because of your background...

17
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,920
in the oral-

18
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,455
Forensic Odontology.

19
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,155
- That's someone's real bad day.
- Yeah. No kidding.

20
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,959
The victim is male.

21
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:09,332
Early to mid-30s.
Moderate smoker. Less moderate drinker.

22
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:13,066
Upper middle to upper class.
Lives in the city.

23
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:15,642
- And definitely not a vegetarian.
- You're sure of all that?

24
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:18,076
Well, the root transparency
and the enamel wear...

25
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,807
put the age at about 32,
plus or minus four.

26
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,076
Acid racemization will be more precise.

27
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:25,277
I'm waiting on the results of that.

28
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,184
But you see this right here?

29
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,279
That is lateral striated trauma.

30
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,325
It's where the pliers slipped.

31
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,663
The victim,
he was struggling during the extraction.

32
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,664
He could still be alive?

33
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,063
Yeah.

34
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,567
Be on a liquid diet, but yeah.

35
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,289
''Come and see.''

36
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:09,088
It was written on four trees
around the pond.

37
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:11,165
North, south, east and west.

38
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,335
Any idea what it means?

39
00:07:16,004 --> 00:07:18,268
It means they brought a compass.

40
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:24,142
How are the kids holdin' up?

41
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,837
Fine.

42
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,542
Imagine it's been a tough week for 'em...

43
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:31,619
Karen's birthday and all.

44
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,488
Yeah.

45
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,817
It's late, Bres.
Why don't we get out of here?

46
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,221
I'm almost done here, so-

47
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,092
Come on. I'll walk with you.

48
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,877
Earthling. no one can help you now.

49
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,108
- What do you want from me?
- Not much.

50
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:05,118
Merely your help in arranging-

51
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:09,588
If you cooperate. I may let you live.

52
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,591
I'll die before helping you.!

53
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,252
Brave words indeed.

54
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,387
But we shall see.

55
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,643
''What is my strength that I should hope?

56
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:34,203
Is my strength the strength of stones...

57
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:37,443
or is my flesh of brass?

58
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:42,046
Wherefore then hast thou
brought me forth out of the womb?

59
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:45,648
O, that I had given up the ghost
to know I had seen me.

60
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,924
I should've been as though
I had not been.

61
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,659
I should've been carried
from the womb...

62
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,895
to the grave.

63
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,336
Are not my days few?

64
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,175
A land of darkness, as darkness itself...

65
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,747
and to the shadow of death...

66
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,783
without any order...

67
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,512
and where light is as darkness.

68
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,080
God hath delivered me...

69
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,455
to the ungodly...

70
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:23,930
and turned me over
into the hands of the wicked.''

71
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:50,154
Jesus Christ.

72
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,977
- Is that blood?
- No, it's paint.

73
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,920
She's been dead about 12 hours.

74
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:24,355
Don't know how long
she was hangin' up there alive.

75
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,552
How'd she get in that thing?

76
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:28,822
- Drug injection, probably-
- No, that's not what I mean.

77
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,728
It takes more than one person to do this.

78
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,630
Make sure we get a report
from Footprint Morphology.

79
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,097
Then there's this.

80
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,269
Looks like they stood right here
and watched.

81
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:52,518
That's a tripod.

82
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,088
They videoed the entire thing.

83
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,961
- How many kids does she have?
- Three, and they're downstairs.

84
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,393
Let me do it.

85
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,130
I'll do it.

86
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,067
Who found her?

87
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,644
The daughter.

88
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,049
- Which one?
- The oldest one.

89
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:31,591
You're gonna have all the support
that you need.

90
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,661
She's adopted.

91
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,127
He'll be here any minute.

92
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:40,596
Thanks for the hot tip.

93
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,734
Hello.

94
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,812
I'm Detective Breslin.

95
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:56,178
- I'm gonna be heading up the investigation.
- Get out of my way!

96
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:59,651
- And I just wanted you girls to know that-
- Where are they?

97
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,312
Daddy!

98
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:04,152
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

99
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,367
It's gonna be all right.

100
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,500
You need to double-check that
before we do anything with it.

101
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,545
Yeah, will do.

102
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,307
What's up?

103
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,514
They took something.

104
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,518
They took what?

105
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:36,517
They took something from inside of her.

106
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,524
She was pregnant.

107
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,871
Detective?

108
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,511
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

109
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,415
No, no. It's all right.

110
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:07,352
Is there anything
that I can do for you?

111
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,988
Are you going to catch
the person that did this?

112
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm going to try.

113
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,029
Kristin.

114
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,706
If you need anything...

115
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,276
if you need to talk...

116
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:33,245
or if you have any questions at all...

117
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,747
just call that number.

118
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,545
Anything at all.

119
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:41,216
Thank you.

120
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,752
What have you got for me?

121
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:51,525
Heavy gauge fishing hooks.
Ankles, backs of knees.

122
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:53,623
She had two in the back of each thigh...

123
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:57,431
one behind each elbow,
three up each side of the back.

124
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,005
And then there's this.

125
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,336
She was stabbed in the chest
with an unidentified...

126
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,104
very sharp, very long foreign object.

127
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:05,804
Punctured her lung.

128
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:10,415
The object lacerated one of
the bronchial arteries and the bronchus...

129
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,112
which is one of the major
air passages into the lungs.

130
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,883
So blood starts flowing out
of the severed artery...

131
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,959
into the severed air passage,
the lungs fill.

132
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:24,554
You ever accidentally
drank water down your air pipe?

133
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,097
Imagine doing it continuously
for an hour.

134
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,103
So are we looking at a torture kill here?

135
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,936
Well, if it was done intentionally, yeah,
we would call it torture.

136
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:39,240
But it wasn't. I mean, to skewer both
of those spots in just the right way...

137
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:42,145
that's basically impossible
to do deliberately.

138
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,445
They probably just wanted
to bleed her out.

139
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,982
- What is that?
- Etomidate injection.

140
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,355
- She was drugged?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,928
So she could be hung up by the fishhooks.

142
00:14:57,131 --> 00:15:01,625
I understand things I see
less every year, buddy.

143
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:14,675
Shit.

144
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,993
Roger that. 14. Confirmed.

145
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,806
There's the Metropolitan Theater.
That's where I met your mother.

146
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,775
I know. You tell me that
every single time you pass it.

147
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:46,005
Yeah. Yeah, right.

148
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,382
Do you maybe wanna go to the game tonight?

149
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,216
What game?

150
00:15:56,324 --> 00:16:00,158
Well, it's just that a friend of mine
has these season tickets...

151
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:04,288
and I thought you might wanna go,
so I gave him some money for 'em.

152
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:07,162
Where'd you get that kind of money, Alex?

153
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:10,760
It was from you...
every time you ditch us.

154
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,135
Oh, yeah.

155
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,707
Right.

156
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,174
What game is this?

157
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:22,341
The Red Wings.

158
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,611
Red Wings.

159
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,058
- If you can't go, if you got work-
- No, no, no. Let's go.

160
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,293
Why not?

161
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,393
- Sean!
- Yeah?

162
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,028
- Guess who's in town tonight.
- Who?

163
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,369
- The Red Wings.
- Cool.

164
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:51,036
- We're gonna go to the game.
- Yes!

165
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,272
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- All right!

166
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:57,317
Come on! Hi, Rose.

167
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:59,545
- Hi, Mr. Breslin.
- Yes!

168
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,314
- Have fun, guys.
- All right. Go get ready.

169
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,720
The Wings havejust been a
dominant team not only at home...

170
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,382
but certainly on the road as well-

171
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:07,222
- Yeah!
- Show Dad. Show Dad.

172
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:08,488
Dad, Dad, look!

173
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:12,164
You guys look like twins.

174
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,131
- Yeah.
- Bres. it's Stingray.

175
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:24,302
- They found another dead body.
- Where?

176
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,438
18th and Broadway.
We got an anonymous call.

177
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,984
We need you down here right now.

178
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,746
I'll be right there.

179
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:45,827
Steven Silva, 33, single.
Teaches the second grade.

180
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,163
- Seems to be missin' all his teeth.
- No, thanks.

181
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,430
- Got any prints?
- Fingerprints? No.

182
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,302
Footprints? Four sets.
Three watching, one doing.

183
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,241
And the tripod,
just like before, except for the windows.

184
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,813
That's ripe.
Let me have some of that.

185
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,627
Is that paint again?

186
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,457
Yeah.

187
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,467
What'd you find out about these rigs?

188
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,901
These rigs aren't cheap.

189
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,495
Heavy-duty fishin' hooks.
Steel-reinforced lines.

190
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:30,600
Custom jobs tailor-made
for the suspension connoisseur.

191
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,611
Connoisseur?

192
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:36,911
Suspension is a subculture based on
ancient rituals found in several religions.

193
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:41,451
It's the next step of evolution
from tattoos and piercings.

194
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,886
All right. That's where we start.

195
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:49,429
Pay a visit to every tattoo parlor
in the city.

196
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,327
We're already on it.

197
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,161
What?

198
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,598
Look at him.

199
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,937
A second grade teacher.

200
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:06,502
Who's ever doin' this, it's inhuman.

201
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:36,306
Tuck, get the paramedics up here!
How the fuck did we miss this?

202
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,607
Sloppy fuckin' police work.
Come on! Let's go!

203
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:56,790
He's a good tenant.
He pays the rent. He keeps-

204
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,457
Just play that, will you?

205
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,730
What happened-
What happened to the picture?

206
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,903
What- Hold on. What time was that?

207
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,580
4:00 a.m. exactly.

208
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:23,179
Fuck.Just fast-forward again, will ya?

209
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,492
Okay. All right. What time was that?

210
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,433
7:00 a.m. exactly.

211
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,213
What time of death do you have on Silva?

212
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,647
Estimated time of death
between 5:00 and 6:00.

213
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,345
And we got an address
on that tattoo parlor.

214
00:20:53,454 --> 00:20:56,855
- It's on the corner of Main and 10th.
- All right.

215
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:11,199
Hi there. Can I help you?

216
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:14,934
Yeah. I'm looking for something.

217
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,370
Suspension?

218
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:20,845
- Yeah, we do that.
- Really?

219
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,472
Hey, Banksy!

220
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,017
- What's up?
- You know who made this?

221
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:33,491
Yeah. I did.

222
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,258
- And when was that?
- Month, month and a half ago.

223
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,494
So he called you?
You never saw him?

224
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:48,102
Called me. Told me what he wanted.
Faxed me the schematics from a Kinko's.

225
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,176
Did it seem strange to you?

226
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:51,710
Come on, man.

227
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:55,942
We got doctors, lawyers, businessmen
come in here gettin' stuff done.

228
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,181
Scarification, dermal implants,
cock stretching, whatever.

229
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,415
Doesn't mean they want you
to know about it.

230
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:06,721
- How many did you make?
- What?

231
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:10,763
How many of the suspension rigs
did you make?

232
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:14,630
Bro, it's fuckin' midnight,
and I'm still at work helpin' you out...

233
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:18,034
when I wanna be at home
catchin' a jack to Belladonna.

234
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:22,768
So maybe you oughta cut me some slack
if you want my cooperation, capisce?

235
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:25,470
- Yeah, maybe I should.
- Yeah.

236
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,309
Or maybe I should just take you outside...

237
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:30,906
and search you and your car
for controlled substances.

238
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,986
How about that?

239
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:39,050
Four. I made four rigs.

240
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,319
Thank you.

241
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:51,429
Stingray, wake up.
I need you to listen to me.

242
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,442
He made four rigs,
and we got two victims.

243
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,809
Shit. So there's two more.

244
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,939
What'd you find out
about the girl in the closet?

245
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,178
Well, her name's WhitneyJacobs.
She's pretty dehydrated.

246
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,744
She's still in and out of consciousness.
They drugged her up pretty bad.

247
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:12,087
What I found most interesting about her
while checking her out...

248
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,888
was her recent divorced ex-husband-
Garrison Jacobs.

249
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,987
They share custody of two kids, currently
spending the weekend with the grandparents.

250
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:20,828
Two kids? Let me guess.

251
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,902
Garrison's got a kid
in the second grade, right?

252
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,335
Yep. Garrison Jacobs
must have figured out...

253
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:28,567
his wife was having one too many
parent-teacher conferences.

254
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,610
- And Garrison Jacobs is currently-
- Unaccounted for.

255
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,373
Let's find him.

256
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:59,465
- ''Come and see.''
- Hey.

257
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,404
You shouldn't be looking at those.

258
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,440
Come and see what?

259
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:14,313
Well, I don't know.

260
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:44,909
Come and see.

261
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,542
Come and see.

262
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,087
Sean, get away from my stuff.

263
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,585
Revelations 6.

264
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:44,267
You have got to be kidding.

265
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,907
It was ceremonial.
The serving tray, the teeth.

266
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,581
They're announcing themselves.
They want us to know that they're here.

267
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,954
Who?

268
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,651
Revelations 6.

269
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:03,127
''And I saw, and behold, a white horse.

270
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,495
And he that sat on him had a bow:
and a crown was given unto him...

271
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,761
and he went forth conquering.

272
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,997
And when he had opened the second seal,
I heard the second beast say...

273
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,333
Come and see.

274
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,273
And there went out
another horse that was red.

275
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,072
Power was given to him
to take peace from the Earth...

276
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:22,706
and there was given unto him
a giant sword.''

277
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:25,717
- Remember this?
- Shit.

278
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:31,319
''And when he had opened the third seal,
I heard the third beast say, Come and see.

279
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:33,985
And I beheld a black horse,
and he that sat on it...

280
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,392
had a pair of balances in his hand.''

281
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:39,998
They're labeling them.

282
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,728
The fourth is the pale horse.

283
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:47,296
''And his name that sat on him was Death,
and hell followed with him.''

284
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:51,405
It's the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

285
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,063
The book of Revelation
is a vision of the apostleJohn.

286
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:15,362
A vision of the end of times
as revealed to him byJesus.

287
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,994
The Horsemen are the first four...

288
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:21,541
of seven prophetic elements
of the Apocalypse.

289
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,739
Okay.

290
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:27,109
There's Death, who rides the pale horse.

291
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,045
Which, in fact, is green.

292
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,946
Pestilence rides the black horse.

293
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,349
- And the red horse is-
- War.

294
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:37,116
Yeah. What is the difference
between Death and War?

295
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:40,489
Think of War as more of a concept.

296
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,757
Not as man killing man, but as strife.

297
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:47,698
Death is a physicality.
War is a state of mind.

298
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,769
And the rider of the white horse-

299
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,362
The rider of the white horse
is the leader.

300
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,433
Some believe that
he is the Antichrist.

301
00:27:57,544 --> 00:28:00,240
Others thinks he is Jesus Christ himself.

302
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,983
Aidan, these people...

303
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,921
chose the Horsemen
as their model for a reason.

304
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:14,551
If they truly understand
the symbolism of the Horsemen...

305
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,925
and it sounds like they do...

306
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,726
you should expect things
to get much worse.

307
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:23,461
We're looking for a four-person team.

308
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,336
Their intent is to produce two more victims.
I intend to stop them.

309
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:31,571
Suspect one is the smallest.
Between 100-115 pounds.

310
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,111
The other three kept clear...

311
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,080
while this one tortured Mary Anne Spitz.

312
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,448
The suspect spent quite a bit of time
around her head.

313
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,646
They must have had quite a conversation.

314
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:44,280
The second suspect is Garrison Jacobs.

315
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,621
His whereabouts are unknown at this time.

316
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:50,823
Suspect three delivered
the killing blow in both cases.

317
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,422
I think that he's the pale horse.

318
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,694
- Death.
- Why?

319
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,500
Because the fourth suspect
is the only one...

320
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:02,268
in both locations who never moved.

321
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,036
Not an inch.

322
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:08,706
The fourth suspect is the one
that we should be the most worried about.

323
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:10,442
He's the ringleader.

324
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,042
We find him, and this thing ends.

325
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:33,902
We got another dead body
at the Bell Hotel.

326
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,282
What do you got for me?

327
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,286
Hello, Garrison.

328
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,385
Remember when I told you
about Spitz's puncture wound...

329
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,052
and the chances of it being intentional?

330
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,723
- Yeah. You said it was impossible.
- I take it back.

331
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,893
Yeah. It's the same.

332
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,799
Almost to the millimeter.

333
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,963
That means we're looking
for someone with medical training.

334
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:44,066
No, we're looking for a medical savant.
It is all the same.

335
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:48,246
Except no rig.

336
00:30:55,889 --> 00:31:00,553
Checked in Monday with a single suitcase.
Told registration he's staying indefinitely.

337
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,222
Nobody lives in a hotel unless they're
homeless or they're hiding from somebody.

338
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,323
He knew that they were
coming for him next.

339
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:10,232
And the only person who knew
how he knew that is in a vinyl bag.

340
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,304
Excuse me.

341
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:16,068
The only person with a motive's in a vinyl bag.
Every lead we had is in a vinyl bag!

342
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:34,154
- What?
- Sean told me that he helped you today.

343
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:37,627
He was really excited.

344
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,359
Yeah. Right.

345
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,162
Maybe next time you shouldn't be showing
a seven-year-old photographs of a murder.

346
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,435
Alex, I did not show them to him.

347
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,273
- He found them. I took them away from him.
- Whatever.

348
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,382
Hey, Alex.

349
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:04,889
Look.

350
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:08,552
Thanks for taking such good care of Sean.
You've been really great with him.

351
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:12,859
You have parent-teacher
conferences tonight.

352
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:15,366
- I reminded you last week.
- What time?

353
00:32:15,468 --> 00:32:17,732
Like, five minutes ago.

354
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,830
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

355
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:23,409
Shit!

356
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,211
Alex has so much potential...

357
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:30,840
which is why it's so frustrating.

358
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:34,810
- He's not doing well?
- Well, he does great when he's here.

359
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,253
That's just not very often.

360
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:42,091
Alex is what we call a maximum result,
minimum effort student.

361
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:45,096
He doesn't have to try very hard
to do well.

362
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,325
So he doesn't.

363
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,797
Well, that's...

364
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,031
kind of my fault.

365
00:32:56,142 --> 00:33:00,442
I don't really get to spend as much time
with him as I would like.

366
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,675
His group therapist used to say-

367
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:06,274
On the other hand, if I can be frank-

368
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,952
I think it's a good sign
that Alex is trying at all.

369
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:16,395
Well, it's not often the case
with children who have lost a parent.

370
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,499
Yeah.

371
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,101
I'm sure.

372
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,477
Spit.

373
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,613
I'm done.

374
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,484
All right. Go get in bed.

375
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:43,750
Hey. I was thinking maybe Sean and I
can take you to school tomorrow.

376
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,950
Make sure you actually go.

377
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,118
That's good.

378
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,990
Good night.

379
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:11,508
- Thank you for seeing me this morning.
- Of course.

380
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:15,645
But, Kristin, I'm not sure that I'm
the person you should be talking to.

381
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:17,382
I'm not trained, and-

382
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,890
I just wanna talk to a normal person...

383
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:23,656
not a man in a crisp suit
with a tape recorder.

384
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:25,788
Okay.

385
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,026
Well, I should also tell you that...

386
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,495
I'm not very good with children.

387
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:33,629
I'm not a child.

388
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,674
No, of course you're not.

389
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:41,641
- Do you have any kids?
- I have two sons.

390
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,683
What kinds of things do you all do together?

391
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,885
We don't really do a lot of stuff together.

392
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,150
Why not?

393
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,022
Well, it's a lot of things.

394
00:34:56,496 --> 00:35:00,057
Sean, he's young,
and I'm just figuring him out.

395
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,997
And Alex-

396
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,833
I was so focused on my job for so long...

397
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:10,399
that I sort of missed his childhood.

398
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:13,839
My parents did that.

399
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,584
They thought my mom was infertile.

400
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,482
They were going to pick a baby.

401
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:26,491
But then, my mom found out
about the orphanages...

402
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:29,494
about us- the older ones.

403
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:33,227
I remember the first time I saw her...

404
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,233
when she came in.

405
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,326
I was eight.

406
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:40,838
I wanted her to take me with her so bad.

407
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,931
I couldn't tell her...

408
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:45,670
but she did anyway.

409
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:49,180
I came here to the States.

410
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:54,549
They were my parents,
and I was their daughter.

411
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:58,055
It was just like
I always dreamed it would be.

412
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:01,724
The next year, Teresa was born.

413
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,393
Doctors said it was a miracle.

414
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,398
That must have been hard.

415
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,072
Why do people do the things they do?

416
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,110
I don't know.

417
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,194
I'm so sorry.

418
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,255
Sorry?

419
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,129
What do you have to be sorry about?

420
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:50,265
I didn't know... this was inside her.

421
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,618
Why do people do the things they do?

422
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,061
I didn't know that-

423
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:32,446
Why are you wasting our time?

424
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:35,885
I know what you're going to ask me
five minutes before you do.

425
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:44,062
Detective Breslin.

426
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:50,696
If you'd like to come in here...

427
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,465
I will tell you things.

428
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:32,076
I wonder, Aidan, what you think of me.

429
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:37,115
You thought I was just this sweet girl
who had been wronged by the world.

430
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:41,582
What do you think now?

431
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:43,918
I still think that.

432
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,083
Really?

433
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,490
The moment I met you...

434
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:54,032
I knew we would have
a special relationship.

435
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,569
So why your mother?

436
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:02,440
- Because I hate my father.
- Why not him?

437
00:39:03,976 --> 00:39:05,876
Would you rather be dead...

438
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:09,414
or live the rest of your life
without your soul mate?

439
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:13,952
- I'd rather be dead.
- You just might be. Do you realize that?

440
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,924
Why'd you turn yourself in to me?

441
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:22,460
I was craving some good conversation.

442
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,964
You're not Death.

443
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:31,332
Do you know the difference
between Death and War, Detective?

444
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:35,567
Yes. Death is a physicality.
War is a state of mind.

445
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,635
You're right.

446
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:42,977
Death is what happens at the end.
War's everything else.

447
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:45,915
What is everything else?

448
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,454
You mean...

449
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,820
you haven't found them yet?

450
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,979
Some books, trophies...

451
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,713
creepy-ass clown dolls.

452
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:23,719
Let's see. We got some clothes.

453
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:25,290
Some cartoons.

454
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,986
Cartoons?

455
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,654
Yeah.

456
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,324
- She's a little old for cartoons.
- Here.

457
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,569
Here's another one.

458
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:45,005
''Garrison Jacobs.''

459
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,636
''Mary Anne Spitz.''

460
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,978
- Why are you doing this?
- What does it feel like?

461
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:58,022
Does it feel like you are weightless?

462
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,058
You should feel like you don't exist.

463
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:03,823
Do you feel expendable yet?

464
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,696
Does your heart tell you that
it's your time to come and see the end?

465
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,199
Yes.!

466
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,031
Oh. my God.!

467
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,765
Yes. Oh. God.!

468
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,704
Now you feel like I do-

469
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:18,606
at war for the last 10 years of my life...

470
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:23,114
fighting against the things he does
and the way you forget.

471
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:27,277
No.! I'm so sorry.! I'm so sorry.!

472
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:31,083
I'm your daughter.
and you allowed me to hurt.

473
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,126
Now you die.

474
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,759
The war's inside you now.

475
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:46,032
War. and then death.

476
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:48,868
You're going to drown now. Mom.

477
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:57,141
Oh. my God.! Oh. my God.!

478
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,939
Stingray! Where the fuck are you?

479
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:08,172
I didn't know you guys were here.

480
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,443
- I thought you were one of them.
- I know what you did.

481
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:20,421
What the fuck-

482
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,930
Did you come here tonight
looking for these?

483
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:31,230
She's getting under your skin, Detective...

484
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:35,899
manipulating you to believe whatever
she wants you to believe, Detective.

485
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,843
Stingray...

486
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:44,042
why don't you go call Child Services
and tell them to pick up the Spitz daughters.

487
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,085
Mr. Spitz is going to jail.

488
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:48,813
Will do.

489
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,221
Let me tell you something.

490
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,624
She's a fuckin' monster.

491
00:45:08,574 --> 00:45:10,804
Your room is very red.

492
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,108
Come on, Aidan.
I know you understand what we're doing.

493
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,149
- No, I don't.
- Don't lie. You do.

494
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,277
You saw the pictures.
You know what he did to me.

495
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:25,186
Then you know just as well as I do-

496
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,021
taking her wouldn't have been enough.

497
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:31,096
He needs to know that she hurt inside...

498
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:33,165
like I did.

499
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,296
Twelve hours in exchange for 1 0 years.

500
00:45:39,472 --> 00:45:42,464
I think that's a pretty favorable trade.

501
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:45,501
What about the rest, Kristin?

502
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:49,047
Garrison Jacobs, Steven Silva-

503
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,116
What did they do to you?

504
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,981
There's going to be more, isn't there?

505
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:57,783
Three people does not make an apocalypse.

506
00:45:58,424 --> 00:46:00,324
How many more, Kristin?

507
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:13,638
Four Horsemen.

508
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,207
Four offerings.

509
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:18,843
No more.

510
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,881
You are not going to find them.

511
00:46:54,947 --> 00:46:56,915
You forgot?

512
00:46:57,016 --> 00:47:00,417
No, I didn't forget.

513
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:07,416
I would never forget that.

514
00:47:11,564 --> 00:47:14,124
It's just that-

515
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:17,430
Alex, we can't keep doing this every year.

516
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:19,367
You know, it's just-

517
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:27,141
Hey! I don't know how many times
I have to explain myself!.

518
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:29,646
Just because I don't show it
doesn't mean I don't miss her.

519
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:33,011
- You don't know what she went through.
- I was there!

520
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,985
I was there for every biopsy,
every chemotherapy!

521
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:38,556
You weren't there when it mattered!

522
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:41,421
That case you were working on
when Mom was dying?

523
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,230
Was it worth it?

524
00:49:22,594 --> 00:49:24,391
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

525
00:49:24,496 --> 00:49:26,327
by Albrecht Durer.

526
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:29,526
Wood carving, 1498.

527
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:32,502
- Beautiful, right?
- Yeah.

528
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:37,433
We got this
from Garrison Jacobs's stomach.

529
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:41,040
I think they made him eat it.

530
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,349
''Exodus 9:15.''

531
00:49:49,555 --> 00:49:52,388
The computer this chip came out of-
I need to know where it is.

532
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:54,482
Can you trace it?

533
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:58,085
If his system was inventoried on line,
we can connect the chip to the IP address.

534
00:49:58,197 --> 00:50:00,961
- And that'll tell you where it is?
- Pretty much.

535
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:05,366
If the IP was assigned by the CO,
we can geo-locate down to a street address.

536
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:06,961
Do it.

537
00:50:17,116 --> 00:50:20,711
- Computer guy's got a location on the chip.
- Let's go.

538
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,843
Get out of the way!

539
00:50:49,948 --> 00:50:51,609
Halt!

540
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:58,112
Damn it!
He went down the fire escape!

541
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:01,582
Bring them down.

542
00:51:01,693 --> 00:51:03,923
He's out in front
and heading down the alley!

543
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:09,432
Everybody out! Come on!
Clear the room! Clear the room!

544
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:11,127
Come on! Move it!

545
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,828
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

546
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:17,535
Bres! Come on!

547
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:20,612
- Fuck!
- Let it go, Bres! Let's go!

548
00:51:20,712 --> 00:51:23,306
- It's evidence!
- Bres, let it go! Let's go! Come on!

549
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,111
Fuck!

550
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:37,328
Very interesting.

551
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:40,364
Bres, the suspect got away.
We're settin' up a perimeter.

552
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:44,163
Well, we got lucky about one thing.
Tell 'im, Terrence.

553
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,898
They wound magnesium ribbons
through the drives, around the RAM.

554
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:50,133
Burns at 4,000 degrees.

555
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:52,870
It's pretty smart, but the magnesium
didn't catch in this one.

556
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:54,912
It gives me a good place to start.

557
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:58,039
I saw a Web page on this monitor.
''We are the nothing.''

558
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,914
If that was on this,
would you be able to find it?

559
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:03,851
- Give me some time.
- Do it quick.

560
00:52:09,995 --> 00:52:11,963
Black, black, black.

561
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:15,732
Red, red.

562
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,429
Green. Green. The Four Horsemen.
The Four Horsemen.

563
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:42,960
Order up, Cheryl.

564
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:51,029
I ordered you a coffee.
Black, with two packets of sugar-

565
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:53,001
So-

566
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,240
What do you want?

567
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:08,717
Mom and Dad support me, you know?
I don't understand why you can't.

568
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,288
Mom and Dad support you?

569
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:17,123
Mom and Dad don't understand this.

570
00:53:17,229 --> 00:53:20,198
They don't understand why you're doing this.
I don't understand it.

571
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,929
It doesn't even affect them or you.

572
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:28,336
Doesn't affect us? Hey, fuck you, pal!

573
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:31,668
It doesn't fuckin' affect us?

574
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:34,678
Fuck you. You have no fuckin' idea.

575
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,578
Do you know what it's like to walk
down the street, havin' people say...

576
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,015
''There goes Taylor Kurth.
His little brother's a faggot!''

577
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:43,417
Having to suffer the indignity of people
talkin' shit about your own fuckin' blood?

578
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:46,013
And knowin' that they are right?
Fuck you!

579
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,299
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

580
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,026
Stop fucking crying.

581
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:58,659
Fuckin' stop it!

582
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,738
I will fuckin' walk out of here-

583
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:07,668
What the fuck are you looking at?
Go fucking clean something.

584
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:18,149
Knock this shit off.

585
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:21,852
Right? Be a fucking man.

586
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:25,762
Jesus Christ.
For once in your fucking life-

587
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,077
This isn't how I wanted tonight to go.

588
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:53,314
What did you expect, Cor?

589
00:54:53,425 --> 00:54:55,325
That I was gonna change my mind?

590
00:54:56,662 --> 00:54:59,654
Tell you how happy I am
that my little brother takes it up the ass?

591
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:04,099
Come on. Fuckin'Jesus, man.

592
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,502
I just... didn't want it to have to come-

593
00:55:09,608 --> 00:55:14,875
Seriously,just shut the fuck up. Okay?

594
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:20,048
I'm fucking exhausted.
Just drive me home.

595
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:23,079
Drive me home.

596
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:29,226
I just wanna go home, go to bed.

597
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:35,232
Jesus.

598
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,769
You all right?

599
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,809
Don't touch me!

600
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:02,325
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

601
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:04,794
Okay.

602
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:07,228
Okay.

603
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:08,560
Excuse me.

604
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:18,935
Everything in your pockets,
and do it fast.

605
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:25,574
Hey. You take another step back,
and I'll cut you like a fuckin' pig.

606
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:29,912
- Hell follows with-
- What's that?

607
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:37,520
I said, ''Hell follows with me.''

608
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,975
Owen Rundell, 35, seven priors-

609
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:54,272
breaking and entering, petty theft,
assault with intent to rob.

610
00:56:54,379 --> 00:56:56,006
Amateur shit across the board.

611
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:58,378
Tonight Mr. Rundell here
tried to mug the wrong cat.

612
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:01,714
Victim fought back,
put a nice little hole in his side.

613
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,481
- And?
- Tell him.

614
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:06,955
He told me not to worry 'cause he
purposely avoided hitting my organs.

615
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:10,027
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.

616
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:13,188
- Could you describe him to a sketch artist?
- Yeah.

617
00:57:13,298 --> 00:57:18,167
Okay. Great. Get our best artist on this.
I want this done fast, as in right now.

618
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,330
Fax it to every medical facility
in a 200-mile radius.

619
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,466
Check it against employees,
residents, candy stripers, whoever.

620
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:26,476
- Find him!
- I'm on it.

621
00:57:37,122 --> 00:57:39,022
Hold on for him.

622
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:47,757
- Hello. This is Detective Breslin.
- Hi. This is Lee Shoemaker.

623
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:51,063
I'm a registered nurse
at the University Hospital.

624
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:52,227
I know Corey.

625
00:57:52,337 --> 00:57:55,067
Do you have his last name?

626
00:57:55,173 --> 00:58:00,440
Thank you.
Kurth. Corey Kurth. K-U-R-T-H.

627
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:08,544
This is Dispatch.
Can we have an address on Corey Kurth?

628
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,089
555 Canal Street.
Backup is on the way.

629
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:21,215
We found Green,
but we have no Horseman.

630
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,671
I feel fuckin' weird.

631
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:02,058
Jesus, this is- Christ!

632
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,964
Holy fucking Christ.

633
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:06,799
Oh, no. Somebody help me. Somebody-

634
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:09,533
Get me the fuck out of here.
I wanna get out. What?

635
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:12,171
Corey?

636
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:14,472
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck's going on?

637
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:21,880
Oh, shit. Corey. Corey!

638
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:24,547
Oh, my God! Fuck!
Somebody get me out of this fucking thing!

639
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:27,648
Help. Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck. Is that you?

640
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:29,659
Is that- Oh,Jesus Ch- Corey.

641
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:32,855
Oh,Jesus, thank you.
Get me out of this fucking thing.

642
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:34,727
Oh, my God. What are you-

643
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:38,898
Corey. Oh, Corey.
Get me out of this fucking thing.

644
01:00:39,004 --> 01:00:40,904
There's fucking hooks in my-

645
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,905
What the fuck are you doing?
Come on. Let me out of this thing.

646
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:48,537
Get me out of this fucking thing, will you?

647
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:53,280
Jesus fucking Christ, man!
What are you doing?

648
01:00:53,385 --> 01:00:56,616
What is this? I don't understand
what you're doing to me.

649
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,621
Yes, you do.

650
01:00:59,858 --> 01:01:02,019
Oh, God!

651
01:01:03,528 --> 01:01:06,429
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

652
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,830
I was wrong!
I didn't mean any of those things I said.

653
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:12,061
I didn't mean any of what I said to you.

654
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:16,129
I'm sorry. I was being stupid. I'm your brother.
Come on. What are you doing?

655
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:17,902
We can't both live like this anymore.

656
01:01:19,144 --> 01:01:22,238
Having an older brother
who can't support me...

657
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:25,111
and be happy for me like I am for him?

658
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:32,588
I looked up to you so much!

659
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:34,886
Let's talk about it. Come on. I'm sorry.

660
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:38,292
No. No more talking.

661
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:44,160
What the fuck are you doing?

662
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:47,397
- The pain needs to go away.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

663
01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:49,632
I didn't-

664
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:52,403
The pain is going to go away tonight.

665
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:55,104
Corey, let me out
of this fucking thing right now!

666
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:58,273
Corey, let me out of this fucking thing!
I swear to God!

667
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:01,250
You fucking let me out of this thing!

668
01:02:01,352 --> 01:02:03,513
What are you-
What are you- Oh, no!

669
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:07,079
Corey, stop it! Corey!

670
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:09,854
What the fuck are you doing?
Don't do it!

671
01:02:12,197 --> 01:02:15,166
God, no! God, don't!

672
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:05,516
My name is Detective Breslin.

673
01:03:05,617 --> 01:03:07,744
I'm afraid I have to ask you
a few questions.

674
01:03:17,195 --> 01:03:20,028
Taylor, can you hear me?

675
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,094
- Taylor-
- I can hear you.

676
01:03:27,305 --> 01:03:29,273
Can you tell me what happened?

677
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:36,342
Which part do you wanna hear?

678
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:38,745
The part where my brother hung me up?

679
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:43,983
Or the part where he made me watch-

680
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:47,124
watch-

681
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:53,862
Taylor, I need you to help me
understand why he did it.

682
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:58,634
'Cause he's a fuckin' faggot!

683
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:05,203
He's a fuckin' faggot!
He's a fuckin' faggot!

684
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,141
You're a fuckin' faggot!
You're a fuckin' faggot!

685
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,146
- Can you guys get these hooks out of him?
- Got it.

686
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:12,349
Excuse me.

687
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:25,654
How did he do that to himself?

688
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:29,790
- PCP?
- Enough to kill a small mule.

689
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:37,105
It's the closest I've seen someone come...

690
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,075
to cutting out their own heart.

691
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:56,088
So, you found Corey.

692
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:59,027
- Yes.
- Tell me about it.

693
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:01,030
He's dead.

694
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:03,123
Corey was a remarkable person.

695
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:05,828
No, I don't doubt that.

696
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:08,337
You and Corey are from different worlds.

697
01:05:10,642 --> 01:05:12,610
How did two people
like you and Corey meet?

698
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,043
You want to know how people like us
can meet each other?

699
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:20,140
We are the nothing.
How can we not meet each other?

700
01:05:22,053 --> 01:05:26,513
The world lives in my bedroom, Aidan,
and in Corey's.

701
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:30,822
And in anyone else's
who's looking for something or someone...

702
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:33,454
they can't find at home.

703
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:38,691
So, did Taylor hurt?

704
01:05:39,537 --> 01:05:42,768
Oh, yeah. He's really fucked up.

705
01:05:42,874 --> 01:05:46,674
- Does that make you happy?
- Is that what you think?

706
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:49,747
We do what we do,
and all of a sudden we are happy?

707
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:53,646
You don't know the first thing about hurt.

708
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:57,583
But you're paying attention now,
aren't you?

709
01:05:57,689 --> 01:06:00,590
Yes, I'm paying attention now, Kristin.

710
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,719
I have four victims.
I only have two Horsemen.

711
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:12,435
I can save you a lot of time
and energy right now.

712
01:06:12,537 --> 01:06:16,496
You're not going to catch
Pestilence... ever.

713
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:19,167
And the rider of the white horse...

714
01:06:19,277 --> 01:06:22,075
you don't find someone like that.

715
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,842
Someone like that finds you.

716
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:28,043
Oh, really? Is that how it happened?

717
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:30,279
The rider of the white horse
found all of you...

718
01:06:30,388 --> 01:06:32,379
put this all together?

719
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:35,118
Created a forum to show the world?

720
01:06:35,226 --> 01:06:38,821
Yes. That's what a leader does.

721
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:43,690
You could learn a lot from him.

722
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,772
Don't be like that.

723
01:07:07,258 --> 01:07:09,158
Where's Sean?

724
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,694
I let him go
to a friend's house for dinner.

725
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,764
I really didn't expect you back.

726
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:17,296
Yeah.

727
01:07:20,138 --> 01:07:21,765
Can we talk?

728
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,107
This place is great.
Who do you come here with, friends?

729
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,310
Yeah, sometimes I come with friends.

730
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,446
Recently though, I've just been,
you know, by myself.

731
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:40,922
Sometimes I'll come after school
or whatever.

732
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:45,257
When Sean's with a friend
or you're working through dinner.

733
01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:48,264
Well, we should start
coming here together.

734
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,634
Like, once a week we'll come,
like, on the same day.

735
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:54,762
We could make this one of our things.

736
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:57,533
Right.

737
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:05,841
Dad, Sean is starting
to ask a lot of questions.

738
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:08,612
Like why you're not around
and things like that.

739
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:11,279
And I can answer those...

740
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:15,018
but he's gonna start asking about Mom.

741
01:08:17,328 --> 01:08:20,297
Alex, I want you to know that-

742
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,630
I mean,
I'm so sorry that you had to have...

743
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:28,466
that moment with your mom...

744
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:30,905
alone.

745
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:33,970
But do you know what I would give...

746
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:36,842
to have had that moment with her...

747
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:38,916
instead of you?

748
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:44,786
It's not that
you weren't there that night.

749
01:08:44,889 --> 01:08:47,483
It's that you never came back.

750
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:51,824
Well...

751
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:54,193
the whole deal with your mom, it was-

752
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,198
it was hard on everybody.

753
01:08:58,269 --> 01:09:00,237
But I'm coming back now, okay?

754
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:04,240
This is me telling you that I am back.

755
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:09,439
Alex, I just-

756
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:13,608
This case that I've been working on,
it's bad.

757
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:17,279
I mean, it's really bad.
But it's almost over.

758
01:09:17,388 --> 01:09:20,585
And after this case,
it's all gonna be different.

759
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,060
Everything is gonna be different?

760
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:25,629
Promise.

761
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:43,578
Western Division has a case they need you on.
Attempted rape.

762
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:47,276
Apparently, he's a heck of a biter.
Briefing's this afternoon.

763
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:49,444
- Hey, Krupa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
- Yeah?

764
01:09:49,554 --> 01:09:51,715
I don't have time for this.

765
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:53,483
There's still two Horsemen out there.

766
01:09:53,591 --> 01:09:56,458
They told us to expect four victims.

767
01:09:56,561 --> 01:10:00,292
- We have four victims.
- No, we don't. They're not finished.

768
01:10:00,398 --> 01:10:02,457
Let me explain something to you.

769
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:06,264
They chose the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse for a reason.

770
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:10,238
Did you know that the word ''apocalypse''
does not even mean ''the end of the world''?

771
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:13,799
The literal translation of it
is ''the lifting of the veil.''

772
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,741
This whole time they've been trying
to show us something.

773
01:10:17,848 --> 01:10:20,681
They're leaving clues.
It all ties in together.

774
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:24,312
Look at-This is the Web site that
the computer was connected to.

775
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:25,787
It's a forum.

776
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:28,324
There are thousands of members on it.

777
01:10:28,426 --> 01:10:30,860
See that date? That's new. That wasn't there.

778
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:33,692
When I first saw that,
that was a place to type in a password.

779
01:10:33,798 --> 01:10:35,265
Now, that's tomorrow.

780
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:37,596
This whole time, they've been trying
to lead us to something.

781
01:10:37,702 --> 01:10:40,364
- They're building to something. Don't you see?
- Building to what?

782
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:44,373
I don't know!
But it's going to happen tomorrow.

783
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:46,136
Now, we know two of them.

784
01:10:46,244 --> 01:10:50,203
If we can find out what connected them,
maybe that will lead us to find the other two.

785
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:52,874
- I need more time to find this out.
- You need to let this go.

786
01:10:52,984 --> 01:10:55,384
- We don't have more time.
- I don't have time for this right-

787
01:10:55,486 --> 01:10:56,953
Just drop it!

788
01:10:57,054 --> 01:10:58,885
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

789
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:02,926
were sent here to initiate
hell on Earth...

790
01:11:03,027 --> 01:11:04,995
and it's happening tomorrow.

791
01:11:11,802 --> 01:11:14,430
Fine. You've got 2 4 hours.

792
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,135
They've been leaving bread crumbs for us.

793
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:23,713
Yeah, well, I guess we missed
a couple of those crumbs...

794
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:25,873
'cause-

795
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:38,387
Four ''Come and sees.''
One in each direction.

796
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,754
Mary Anne Spitz.
One, two, three, four.

797
01:11:41,866 --> 01:11:43,857
Silva's apartment.
One, two, three, four.

798
01:11:44,902 --> 01:11:47,928
Garrison Jacobs's hotel room.

799
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:52,101
- There's only three.
- Yeah.

800
01:11:53,711 --> 01:11:57,579
That's why there's no rig, no ceremony...

801
01:11:57,682 --> 01:11:59,547
no paint, no necklace.

802
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,618
Nothing taken from the body.

803
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,745
That's why the veil hasn't been lifted yet.

804
01:12:04,855 --> 01:12:07,289
Garrison Jacobs is not the third victim.

805
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,151
What was he?

806
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,765
Garrison Jacobs is Pestilence.

807
01:12:28,245 --> 01:12:31,737
I was trying to get my beauty sleep.

808
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:44,558
Garrison Jacobs tricked us
into punishing the innocent.

809
01:12:44,662 --> 01:12:47,290
What did he tell you?

810
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:50,390
- He told us Silva molested his son.
- He lied to you.

811
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:53,002
- He was-
- Heartbroken and lying.

812
01:12:53,104 --> 01:12:55,004
So we bled him.

813
01:12:55,106 --> 01:12:58,940
You could afford to kill him. You didn't need
Pestilence like you needed the others.

814
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:01,603
He just operated the computers.

815
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:05,671
It would have been nice to have carried
the Pestilence theme throughout.

816
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:10,916
Three Horsemen
just doesn't have the same ring.

817
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:15,151
That means there's one less Horseman...

818
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:17,955
which means there's going
to be another victim.

819
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:24,162
Does it eat at you, Detective Breslin?

820
01:13:24,268 --> 01:13:27,704
That three of the four of us
are off the streets...

821
01:13:27,805 --> 01:13:31,002
and you had nothing to do with it?

822
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,678
We would have caught you.

823
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:42,252
Really.

824
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:50,620
Good-bye, Kristin.

825
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:03,131
''The great day of his wrath has come:

826
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,334
and who shall be able to stand?''

827
01:14:06,444 --> 01:14:09,572
Who shall be able to stand?
Maybe that's why they used the rigs.

828
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:18,815
Find something?

829
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:22,324
- They were both in group therapy.
- Who were the doctors?

830
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:26,022
Annette Richardson and...

831
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:30,028
Annette Richardson.

832
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:32,659
Well, we'll look her up and pay her a visit.

833
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:39,534
Oh, God.

834
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:42,168
We thought we should call you
because of your background in-

835
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:43,906
Forensic Odontology.

836
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:47,281
Bres, what's the matter?

837
01:14:47,384 --> 01:14:51,684
Kristin has acted like she's known me
ever since the day she turned herself in.

838
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:54,519
That's because she does.

839
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,593
The teeth were placed on that pond...

840
01:14:56,694 --> 01:14:59,026
to guarantee that I would be
assigned to the case.

841
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:01,791
They're after me and my family.

842
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:03,924
Stingray, I want you to do me a favor.

843
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,525
I want you to go to my house
and take care of Alex.

844
01:15:06,637 --> 01:15:08,696
- I'm gonna pick up Sean.
- What's going on, Bres?

845
01:15:08,806 --> 01:15:12,242
When Karen died,
Alex was in group therapy.

846
01:15:12,343 --> 01:15:13,742
Same doctor.

847
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:28,217
This is Aidan Breslin.
I'm driving there now. I'm his father!

848
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:32,318
I just need someone to tell me
if he's in his classroom!

849
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,664
- Stingray?
- It's me. at the house.

850
01:15:38,769 --> 01:15:41,067
- What the fuck?
- Stingray!

851
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:43,497
Stingray!

852
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:46,234
Shit!

853
01:15:58,222 --> 01:16:00,190
Stingray?

854
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:01,758
Ray?

855
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:14,463
Police Emergency. How can I help you?

856
01:16:14,572 --> 01:16:17,040
This is Detective Aidan Breslin,
1 4th Precinct.

857
01:16:17,141 --> 01:16:20,542
I have an officer badly injured,
28th and Nanty Street.

858
01:17:35,786 --> 01:17:38,755
You don't find someone like that.

859
01:17:38,856 --> 01:17:41,450
Someone like that finds you.

860
01:17:41,558 --> 01:17:45,790
Well, he does great when he's here.
That's just not very often.

861
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:12,438
Alex?

862
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,621
Alex! Answer me!

863
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:33,968
- Dad?
- It's gonna be all right, Alex.

864
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:37,905
I'm gonna get you down! Hold on!

865
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:41,878
It's gonna be okay, Alex!
It's gonna be all right!

866
01:19:41,979 --> 01:19:44,174
I'm bleeding.

867
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:47,409
I'm supposed to drown, not bleed.

868
01:19:47,518 --> 01:19:50,180
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am!

869
01:19:57,461 --> 01:19:59,429
You have to know!

870
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:04,893
- This won't end with us.
- Please, God.

871
01:20:05,002 --> 01:20:07,163
There is no Four Horsemen.

872
01:20:07,271 --> 01:20:09,398
There's millions of them.

873
01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:12,907
They're born into this fucked-up world...

874
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:18,209
by parents who are unwilling
to even try to understand them!

875
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:19,543
I understand.

876
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:23,950
And it won't end until every parent
in this fucked-up society...

877
01:20:24,054 --> 01:20:26,852
realizes that it does apply to them!

878
01:20:29,293 --> 01:20:31,784
They're watching us right now.

879
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,227
They're waiting...

880
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:37,266
for the last Horseman
to make the final sacrifice!

881
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:40,537
Waiting for the sign-

882
01:20:40,637 --> 01:20:42,366
my death-

883
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,271
to begin the apocalypse.

884
01:20:47,044 --> 01:20:51,538
The veil will be lifted,
and the people will finally see.

885
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:56,647
Please tell me you didn't do these things.

886
01:20:56,753 --> 01:20:59,153
Tell me you didn't do this to yourself.

887
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:02,987
Why? Because I'm your son?

888
01:21:06,964 --> 01:21:11,094
You haven't been in my room
in three years.

889
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:13,829
All you had to do was go in my room.

890
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:20,942
I told you it would be different.

891
01:21:23,347 --> 01:21:25,747
It can still be different.

892
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:24,138
Open your eyes!
Open your eyes! Look at me!

893
01:22:38,255 --> 01:22:40,689
Dad. Dad?

894
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,650
You were right. You were right.

895
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,194
After your mom died, I never came back.

896
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:51,533
I never came back.
I wasn't there for you and Sean.

897
01:22:52,803 --> 01:22:54,566
Please.

898
01:22:54,671 --> 01:22:57,834
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

899
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:00,432
Give me a chance to be a father to you.

900
01:23:01,378 --> 01:23:03,005
We're gonna be all right.

901
01:23:03,113 --> 01:23:06,742
Whatever happens,
I'm never gonna leave you again.

902
01:23:10,887 --> 01:23:12,514
You're gonna be all right.

903
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:18,594
I'm not gonna let you die.

904
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,803
Sean?

905
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:40,916
Daddy?

906
01:23:41,018 --> 01:23:42,918
Yeah.

907
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,988
I had a bad dream.

908
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,248
You did?

909
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:52,459
I'm here now.

910
01:23:55,032 --> 01:23:57,057
Where's Alex?

911
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:00,493
Don't you worry about Alex.

912
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,733
Alex is gonna be okay.

913
01:24:07,778 --> 01:24:09,905
I love you, Sean.

914
01:24:10,914 --> 01:24:13,144
I love you too, Daddy.
