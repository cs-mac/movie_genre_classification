1
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:16,059
There an unprecedented meteor shower
falling off the coast of Tokyo.

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,196
The entire city is mesmerised
by this incredible sight.

3
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:22,661
Two hours after the first contact...

4
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,877
...an unidentified enemy
has reached our coastlines...

5
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:29,222
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,073
Right now, one thing is
- The world is at war.

7
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,953
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...

8
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:55,878
...12 different locations
across the globe were breached...

9
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:59,554
...in a coordinated
attack by an unknown enemy.

10
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,398
All breaches were along the coastline...

11
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,114
...in what is a campaign
of rapid dominance.

12
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:09,039
This is a textbook military invasion.

13
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,088
There are massive
casualties in New York.

14
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:15,514
Defensive lines are
being set up in Boston.

15
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:19,400
And at 13:15 Zulu time,
we lost communications...

16
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,866
...with San Francisco and San Diego.

17
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,287
Their status is unknown.

18
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,637
What we know is that we are the last
offensive force on the West Coast.

19
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:32,771
We cannot lose Los Angeles.

20
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,375
We have five birds down two
klicks west of CP Victory.

21
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,884
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten
your asses, we're going down!

22
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:45,765
Command and control is down.

23
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,230
Civilians in need of
support two klicks northeast.

24
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,779
Cables inbound. Engage
your sectors of fire, over.

25
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:53,995
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

26
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,566
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider
Foundation Morning Surf Report.

27
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:42,945
Surfers, hard northeast
conditions blowing out there...

28
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:47,658
...the ocean slopping and chopping.
There is some size starting to build....

29
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,034
Come on. Come on.

30
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,808
- Morning, staff sergeant.
- Morning, sergeant.

31
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,558
Morning, staff sergeant.

32
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,979
- Morning, sergeant.
- Morning, staff sergeant.

33
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,021
Morning, staff sergeant.

34
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,822
Morning, you little prick.

35
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,009
You know what they say. You're only
as old as you feel, staff sergeant.

36
00:03:46,218 --> 00:03:49,970
That's what I'm worried about.
I can't feel a damn thing.

37
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:59,188
-
- to the Pacific for our next report, where a cluster of meteors...

38
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:04,902
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere
in the early hours tomorrow morning.

39
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,155
Go ahead.

40
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:10,367
They're expected to strike miles
from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.

41
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,830
- John.
- Oh, God.

42
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:16,582
What's up, Mike?

43
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:20,753
Hey. What happened to that picture
of us in Iraq with that camel?

44
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,671
I mean, your girlfriend.

45
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,840
Hey, is this for real?

46
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,928
It's got your signature. l said, "That's
gotta be a mistake. He can't write."

47
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:33,058
No mistake, John. l did my
20. I know when to get out.

48
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:36,643
Come on. You got the box full of
medals, a file full of commendations.

49
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,481
You can have them. Seems
you like interior decorating.

50
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,442
A Marine's got a shelf life,
you know? After that....

51
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,943
What? He spoils?

52
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,737
Something like that.

53
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,573
I'll finish my training
assignment with these Marines.

54
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,369
Get them combat ready.

55
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,036
And then I'll be on my merry way.

56
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:58,375
You know, we could always use
another lean, mean typing machine.

57
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,376
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.

58
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,712
Ugly, slow, soft.

59
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,175
God.

60
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:10,470
You had to make some
tough calls there, Mike.

61
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,849
Especially that last one.

62
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,895
We all wish your men made it home.

63
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,816
Here we go.

64
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,076
You're expired.

65
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,745
Clear the shelf...

66
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,330
...staff sergeant.

67
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,511
Everything I know is in here, John.

68
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:13,743
What typically would have been
detected months, if not years, before...

69
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,078
...surfaced in less than four hours.

70
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,167
These images giving some idea of the
rate these meteors are travelling.

71
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:24,211
Scientists are abuzz, scrambling
to try and understand it.

72
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,715
There's something just
extremely uncomfortable...

73
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,217
...about a man your
size sniffing a flower.

74
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:31,344
What you want is some hydrangeas.

75
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,222
Popular wedding flower,
come in green, blue.

76
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,808
What colour is the bridesmaids' dresses?

77
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,023
- Good question.
- You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.

78
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,733
Yes, pretty girl?

79
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:48,612
For 300 more, she said we
could have sprays of lilies.

80
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,074
Now, l know it's a lot, but it'd
be so beautiful. What do you think?

81
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:53,867
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.

82
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:57,996
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting
married once. Worry about 300 bucks?

83
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:01,166
- Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you.
- Yeah, no worries.

84
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:06,589
You know what? lt's your
day. Do whatever you want.

85
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:10,926
I'm gonna hit you with
something. What are you doing?

86
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,177
Busting your balls.

87
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:13,887
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.

88
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,931
And l can't wait.

89
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,308
I love cake.

90
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,572
Yo, Doc. What you doing?

91
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,823
Skyping back home.

92
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:35,909
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.

93
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,912
Doc. My boy.

94
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,419
That's my sister.

95
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,215
Goddamn.

96
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:53,428
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively
here, you know what I'm saying?

97
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,555
All right, no, stop playing!

98
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:58,640
May I take a message?

99
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,144
Doc, is it all right if
l have one of those first?

100
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:05,605
You eat it at your own risk.

101
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,985
They're very old.

102
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,115
So do you feel that
you're making progress?

103
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,992
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:19,829
I'm sleeping a lot better.

105
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,665
And then also around the
firing range and everything...

106
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,377
...when I first came back
and hear the pop, pop, pop...

107
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:29,213
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with
me a bit and a little bit of a setback.

108
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,466
But now it, you know...

109
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,219
...doesn't bother me.

110
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,179
So l think that's progress.

111
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:39,767
So, what's the story
with my status, doc?

112
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,852
I mean, are you gonna clear
me for combat? Because....

113
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,937
Yeah, l feel good.

114
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,901
Let's meet again next week...

115
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,032
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?

116
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:59,369
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much, doc.

117
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,339
Harris' girl is making the dude
organise his entire wedding...

118
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:11,965
...two weeks before we deploy.

119
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:16,888
I say the chick's busting his
balls like nobody's business.

120
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,600
But he got two weeks to get
it done because we're out.

121
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,270
So l just came by to visit you
one last time before we leave.

122
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:29,902
And l brought Dad's five iron with
me. And you know what that means.

123
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,990
Me and the boys are gonna go out
tonight, continue the tradition.

124
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,949
Have a good time, you know?

125
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,621
I'll see you soon, bro.

126
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,671
See you soon.

127
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:53,006
Motown, give me boots. I'm going skiing.

128
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,759
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.

129
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,971
Here they come.

130
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,141
Don't mess this up, man. They
cannot know that you a virgin.

131
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,936
How do you know l--
Who says I'm a virgin?

132
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,771
We know you are. Look at your face.

133
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,358
What are you telling
her? Telling her what?

134
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,238
Oh, come on, you guys.
You're killing me.

135
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,324
That dog gonna hunt! Damn,
Daktari, you can play, man.

136
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,786
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

137
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,958
Shit. How am l supposed to know,
man? It's an American game, right?

138
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,501
Adukwu's our Navy
corpsman. He's like a medic.

139
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,920
No, not like a medic. Medic is
the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.

140
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,047
Well, sailor, yes.

141
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,757
I came here to become a doctor.

142
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,182
Slow down.

143
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,892
That's like number five.

144
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,437
How many have you had?

145
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,979
No, I'm good.

146
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,442
- Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan...
- Hey.

147
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,403
...his mom signed so
he could join up at 17.

148
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,282
And l look after him because this boy
don't know his ass from a hot rock.

149
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,915
- Not on my truck, dude!
- Easy, now. Easy, buddy.

150
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,251
- Oh, yeah!
- Not on my truck.

151
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,503
- Toast. To Lenihan.
- To Lenihan!

152
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,298
Good luck, rookie.

153
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,715
Retreat, hell!

154
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,136
-
- emergency developing throughout NASA and the space community.

155
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,432
We now know that meteors will land off
the coasts of eight different cities...

156
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,517
...and that number could keep rising.

157
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,603
Evacuations now under way
in Southern California...

158
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,107
...moving the population
back from the coastline.

159
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:33,444
But a lot of curious people
are clamouring for views.

160
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:38,990
- What are you doing up so early?
- Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.

161
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,371
This thing right?

162
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,623
- Here. You want me to do it?
- lt's tricky.

163
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:51,544
They gotta be parallel to the deck.
That's the whole thing with these bars.

164
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,006
- Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay?
- Okay.

165
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,924
- Call me later.
- I'll call you later.

166
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,514
That's my baby. All right.

167
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,992
Let's go! Move!

168
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,667
Quick time! March!

169
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,884
Marines! lnto the trucks and
report to your company! Let's go!

170
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:40,428
Move it! Let's move!

171
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,096
Move it!

172
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,849
- Load them up!
- Move it!

173
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,185
What's going on, first sergeant?

174
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,981
Meteors hitting off California now...

175
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:54,276
...but they got the whole
goddamn base being mobilised.

176
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:58,904
I'm bringing you back to the
company, Mike. They need you.

177
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,115
First sergeant.

178
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,538
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.

179
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,294
- You heard we might be mobilising?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:13,920
Moving you up to squad leader.

181
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:16,382
It's a big responsibility,
but you can handle it.

182
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,924
Thank you, sir.

183
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,677
Staff Sergeant Beck is being
replaced by Staff Sergeant Nantz.

184
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:24,598
What do you know about him?

185
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:27,893
He's a very dedicated Marine.

186
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:30,437
Don't bullshit me, corporal.

187
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:33,273
What'd you hear about his last tour?

188
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:37,152
Just the grimy details that
everybody else already knows.

189
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,112
But at the end of the day,
you're our lieutenant...

190
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,617
...and we take our orders from you, sir.

191
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:50,040
You're assigned to 1st Platoon
under Second Lieutenant Martinez.

192
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,129
His platoon sergeant's on leave,
so you're gonna have to suck it up.

193
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,965
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant
right up here, 1 o'clock.

194
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,551
He's a kid, Mike.

195
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,969
Right out of officer training school.

196
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,805
He's only been with us a
month, but I think he's sharp.

197
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,186
It's just an evacuation,
buddy. He's in charge.

198
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,941
Just keep an eye on him, huh?

199
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,944
Just don't lose my paperwork.

200
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,988
- Lieutenant.
- Good afternoon, staff sergeant.

201
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,990
- Happy to meet you.
- Thank you, sir.

202
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:27,162
We're being called in to help with
an evacuation? For these meteors?

203
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,828
I assume so.

204
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,750
Whatever it is, I'm happy to
finally get out in the field.

205
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,335
At approximately 4:42 am
Pacific Standard Time...

206
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:35,920
...the meteors impacted....

207
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,882
Who the hell took my
tortellini? You got tortellini?

208
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:40,218
This some kind of drill?

209
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:43,845
Get ready, man. Get
ready. It's serious. Okay?

210
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:51,436
Meteors continue to fall off the coast
of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....

211
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:52,688
Corporal. Corporal.

212
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:54,439
- Corporal. Corporal.
- Yeah?

213
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,483
It's probably just a training exercise.

214
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:59,861
No, man. They're shifting Nantz
into our unit. Something's going on.

215
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:03,157
The guy wants out of the Marine
Corps and now we're stuck with him.

216
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,117
- Stavs!
- You got tortellini?

217
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,160
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.

218
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:11,039
He went into that compound
alone and killed 10 insurgents.

219
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,959
- That's what you heard, Lenihan?
- Chill out.

220
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:16,670
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot
told me that he was going on--

221
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,131
Don't worry about it.

222
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,050
- Let's go, this is serious.
- What the hell did l do?

223
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:23,385
Nantz got a couple guys
killed on his last tour.

224
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:24,636
What?

225
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,014
That's the story.
Lockett's brother was one.

226
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:31,519
So l know you didn't know, but just
don't-- No, don't worry about it.

227
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:34,230
Looks like we're getting
into some heavy shit.

228
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:38,151
It's been my experience, lieutenant,
heavy shit is highly overrated.

229
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,738
Look, staff sergeant,
let's just be clear.

230
00:15:41,989 --> 00:15:44,072
I know your rep, know what you've done.

231
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,701
This is my platoon. These are my men.

232
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,163
- Not gonna have a problem, are we?
- No problem, sir. She's all yours.

233
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:53,584
It appears our initial
assumptions were wrong.

234
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,087
Listen up! Once you get your weapon...

235
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:01,924
...get your gear, get your
munitions, move outside!

236
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,430
We got white chocolate rap from my
man. That should finish the new mix?

237
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,059
National Guard troops have flown
in to evacuate beach areas...

238
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:15,104
...and we have word the
military is now deploying.

239
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:18,273
That's us. That's us! That's us!

240
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,861
- Calling military for a meteor shower?
- l don't know why they're happy.

241
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,696
-
- a meteor that just hit the ocean.

242
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,910
Large plumes of smoke are coming up.
Visibility is getting worse as we....

243
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,330
These objects were
completely undetected...

244
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,290
...until they entered our atmosphere.

245
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,877
NASA estimates that they are not
hitting the water at terminal velocity.

246
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,713
They're slowing down before impact.

247
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:45,803
These objects are falling into the
ocean in tightly packed clusters...

248
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,846
...10 miles outside of
a major population centre.

249
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:51,059
Thermal imaging from
the Hubble shows us...

250
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:55,061
...that within each cluster is a central
object much larger than the others.

251
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,398
Now, these central objects are
all the same geometric shape.

252
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,943
They appear mechanical in nature.

253
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,738
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.

254
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:06,907
We are in Threatcon Delta. That's right.

255
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:10,410
Come on. All units, gear up.

256
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,162
Be ready to move.

257
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,248
Combat situation.

258
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,543
It's what I've been training for.

259
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:22,673
l am told that one of the Coast
Guard cutters has issued a mayday.

260
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:25,342
lt is difficult to
see, and-- Oh, my gosh!

261
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:29,098
There is just another meteor
that just hit the ocean...

262
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:32,058
...and it's the closest one
yet, right behind those cutters.

263
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,601
Two or three meteors just impacted.

264
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:36,771
Shit.

265
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:40,316
Do you have any more information
in the studio? Oh, my God.

266
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,529
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?

267
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:49,534
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!
- Kate, are you still hearing us?

268
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,248
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone,
move out. Get out of the way.

269
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,666
What is that? What is that in the water?

270
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,963
I can't really get a good look,
but it appears there's something--

271
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,048
I'm looking through the people, trying
to determine exactly what this is.

272
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:08,094
I don't even know. It's
like shadowy figures.

273
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,141
Maybe five, six, seven. I can
make out maybe eight figures.

274
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:15,602
- What the hell is that?
- Holy shit!

275
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,648
- Look at that!
- Stavs, you see that?

276
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:22,526
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone
needs to get out of here right now.

277
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:32,536
I think that we've gotta leave,
Jean. I'm gonna head back now.

278
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,788
Oh, my God!

279
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,836
Go! Let's go. Go, go!

280
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,047
Corporal Grayston and Corporal
lmlay are both expert marksmen...

281
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:46,259
...as well as strong fire team leaders.

282
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,345
We also have PFC Lenihan, who
is our second best marksman...

283
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:53,726
- ...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero.
- What's your take on this, Specs?

284
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,393
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?

285
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,687
- Do you mean like from space?
- No, Imlay.

286
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,190
- From Canada.
- Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?

287
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,068
All right, first squad, line
it up. Bring it in. Let's go!

288
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,279
As you may have heard...

289
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,741
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be
taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.

290
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,953
We're lucky to have him aboard.

291
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:17,289
All right. Here's the situation,
Marines. We're facing an unknown enemy.

292
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:21,335
We don't know how strong their
force is or what they're capable of.

293
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:25,131
But one thing we do know is that
we're fighting for our land...

294
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,802
...our families, our home
and our country, goddamn it!

295
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:32,347
Whatever those things are, let's show
them how Marines fight. Retreat....

296
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:33,556
- Hell!
- Two-Five!

297
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,725
- Retreat, hell!
- Let's form it up, let's go!

298
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,740
First in, last out, Marines!

299
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:53,493
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe.
Your training will kick in.

300
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,620
Thank you, staff sergeant!

301
00:19:56,832 --> 00:20:00,251
- Got something to get off your chest?
- No, it's cool, staff sergeant.

302
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,503
You got a silver star, my brother
came home in a box. I get it.

303
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:09,468
All stations, this
net. Standby for sitrep.

304
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:11,971
Enemy elements have
advanced beyond the beach.

305
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,017
Aliens? That's not possible, right?

306
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:18,812
We'll know soon enough, brother.

307
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:23,565
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed.
Company beyond the defensive line....

308
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:27,736
It's in case his head gets blown
off, so they can identify his body.

309
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,116
Be advised, enemy have
heavy assault weapons.

310
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,994
Firepower equal to
high-explosive rounds.

311
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,791
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me
you won't let me be taken alive...

312
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:45,547
...by some godless predator from
another world, staff sergeant?

313
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,300
No promises in combat.

314
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:52,888
Stop screwing around
and keep your head in it!

315
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:59,060
These units are falling tactically.
Their strategies are coordinated.

316
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:02,356
Do not underestimate
enemy combat intelligence.

317
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:11,490
We are not evacuating
civilians fast enough.

318
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:14,076
I say again, we are not
evacuating fast enough.

319
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:19,623
All units be advised, there are
friendlies behind enemy lines.

320
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,667
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.

321
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,453
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.

322
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:01,331
Boys, hold on to something.
Things are about to get rough.

323
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:47,296
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!

324
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,932
Move, move, move!

325
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:02,518
Form it up!

326
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:12,946
- What do we got, sir?
- All right, situation is as follows:

327
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,616
Most of Santa Monica's
been cleared of civilians.

328
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:19,412
We got a defensive line at Lincoln
Boulevard a mile from the ocean.

329
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:23,040
Air Force has got
Warthogs and B-52s on deck.

330
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:28,588
At 1930 hours, they will pound the
entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.

331
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:30,631
Shit.

332
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,510
We're levelling Santa Monica, sir?

333
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,970
We got an infestation
of God knows what...

334
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,140
...not of this Earth and we
gotta hit them with everything...

335
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,602
...and we gotta hit them hard.
They are a ground-force enemy only.

336
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,105
They have no aircraft, so the Air
Force will tear them a new asshole...

337
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,067
...and we will rule the air.

338
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:51,319
- You said "most civilians," sir?
- Affirmed.

339
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,821
Getting distress calls,
sending squads out.

340
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:56,991
Golf, you take Santa Monica to Olympic.

341
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,370
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.

342
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,746
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.

343
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:04,499
Lieutenant Martinez, I want
you to break off a squad...

344
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:05,875
...and a machine gun team.

345
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:10,004
Proceed west from Lincoln to
a police station located here...

346
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:12,383
- ...at Venice and Amarosa.
- Venice and Amarosa.

347
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:13,966
Police were overrun.

348
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:18,638
Got a distress call that civilians are
still there. We don't know how many.

349
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,890
Just gather survivors,
then you radio in.

350
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,978
We'll have helicopters in
the area to evacuate you out.

351
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:28,022
Now, be advised, you got exactly
three hours before our bombs drop.

352
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:31,317
And make no mistake, they
will drop, with or without you.

353
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,862
Get those civilians, get
the hell out of there...

354
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,366
...and you kill anything
that is not human.

355
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,700
Let's go! Let's get it done!

356
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:43,329
Captain, this is not a drill. You
hold that line, you understand me?

357
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:44,582
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:57,053
-
- from the coastline into suburbs. Golf company is overrun.

359
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,598
Lima company requesting
immediate air support.

360
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,851
Civilians are being
stranded behind enemy lines.

361
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,393
Hang on, One!

362
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,061
Fire in the hole!

363
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,204
Troops are amassing in every
coast, along every major coastline.

364
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,333
The UN has called an
emergency sitting...

365
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:29,376
...in an attempt to establish
a means for sharing resources...

366
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:31,504
...and intelligence across the globe.

367
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:33,338
Watch out, go!

368
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:38,135
This way? Where are we supposed to go?

369
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:40,972
Jesus Christ.

370
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:56,237
Marines, anything beyond this
point, consider to be hostile.

371
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,073
All right, nice and easy.

372
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,502
Clear.

373
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:14,381
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.

374
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,925
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.

375
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:21,013
Lieutenant. How many civilians we
gotta get out of that police station?

376
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:24,224
I have no idea, Guerrero.
Just stay focused.

377
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:33,024
- What the hell's that? What is that?
- This is insane.

378
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,734
Yo, eyes open.

379
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,781
An unidentified enemy has
breached our coastlines...

380
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:40,616
...in a swift and militaristic attack.

381
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,869
At this point, there are many
more questions than answers.

382
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,416
Right now, one thing is
- The world is at war.

383
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,002
Eyes open.

384
00:26:53,338 --> 00:26:55,381
You see something, Simmons?

385
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:57,843
Can't see shit.

386
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:03,890
- Kerns, you see a cross street?
- Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.

387
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,518
Police station's about one
klick northwest of here.

388
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,847
- Twelve o'clock!
- Hundred metres front.

389
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:45,973
- This is Echo 6, we need
immediate-- -Turn your radios down.

390
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:58,737
- lt's just a dog.
- Just a little doggy. Come here.

391
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:00,071
- lt's just a dog.
- Dog.

392
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,406
- Dog.
- Dog.

393
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:03,700
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."

394
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:06,203
Kidding me. Who's the idiot
naming dogs these days?

395
00:28:06,413 --> 00:28:08,288
What do you wanna call him, Fido?

396
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:10,416
Watch out!

397
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,426
- Where's it coming from?
- l don't know.

398
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:21,135
Lenihan, watch your head!

399
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:22,512
On the roof!

400
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:27,933
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!

401
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:30,938
- They're on the roof! On the roof!
- Cover him!

402
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,278
Twenty-five metres!
Twenty-five metres!

403
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:42,572
- Lieutenant!
- Left flank, on the roof!

404
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:44,700
Covering, covering!

405
00:28:46,537 --> 00:28:48,329
- We gotta move now!
- Lockett!

406
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,665
- Yes?
- Get me an exit down that alley!

407
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,668
Yes, sergeant! Kerns, Motown, let's go!

408
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:58,840
Get up! Come on!

409
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,424
Falling back!

410
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,051
Let's go, come on!

411
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,346
Enemy fire! Watch your head!

412
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,764
- Where'd they come from?
- Fall back!

413
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,017
Enemy fire, keep your head down!

414
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,561
It's all over the damn place!

415
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,854
What do you see?

416
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,771
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.

417
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:15,400
How do we get out of here?

418
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:17,901
- Lieutenant, where's the exit?
- I'm working on it!

419
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:21,112
- Shit, we're boxed in!
- I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!

420
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:23,115
- Move out!
- Ambush!

421
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,742
I don't have him!

422
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:28,246
I'm hit!

423
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:30,956
Cover me, Lockett!

424
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:44,721
- Man down, man down!
- lt burns!

425
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:49,558
Shit!

426
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,894
I got you, Guerrero!

427
00:29:57,192 --> 00:30:00,987
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

428
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:07,661
I've got you covered!

429
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,538
We have an exit! Everybody,
move out! Move out!

430
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:11,789
Move, move!

431
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:16,044
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come
on, we're going! Come on, let's go!

432
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:25,094
Fall back, fall back!

433
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,356
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!

434
00:30:38,192 --> 00:30:39,652
Lorenzo!

435
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,069
Move, move, move!

436
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,530
Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!

437
00:30:44,406 --> 00:30:46,742
I can't see shit!

438
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,873
Shit, shit, shit! Imlay!

439
00:30:53,082 --> 00:30:55,083
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

440
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:57,878
U.S. Marines, coming in!

441
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,172
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?

442
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:02,883
Kitchen's clear! The
kitchen's clear, lieutenant!

443
00:31:03,385 --> 00:31:05,259
Get on that window! Are we clear?

444
00:31:05,469 --> 00:31:07,844
Put the wounded in the kitchen!

445
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,224
Kerns, Lockett, secure
the back of this house.

446
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,852
- Yes, staff sergeant.
- Staff sergeant, we're on it!

447
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:18,024
Doc, how long till they're able to move?

448
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,608
Ten minutes. Ten minutes,
staff sergeant. Ten minutes.

449
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,612
You want me? Come get
some! I'm right here!

450
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,280
What do we got, lmlay?

451
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,701
I got nothing. I can't
see a goddamn thing.

452
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:30,245
- With this smoke, it's zero visibility.
- You're dead!

453
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:31,705
Stow that shit, Simmons!

454
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,332
You'll get shot before you're
able to kill any of them.

455
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,583
Your orders, sir?

456
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,503
I led us right into that ambush.

457
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:42,841
- Mottola, anyone on command?
- No, sir.

458
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,387
- We need to find answers to get out.
- You're in charge, sir. Your orders?

459
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:53,852
Let's radio that evac to meet us.

460
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,229
Civilians or no, we gotta
get these wounded out.

461
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:58,772
- Roger that.
- Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan?

462
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,066
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?

463
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:02,318
- Lenihan?
- Lenihan?

464
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:03,944
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?

465
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,282
- Lenihan!
- I'll go for Lenihan, sir.

466
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,576
Imlay, Harris, on me. Let's
get this shit out of here.

467
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:12,078
I'll package the wounded.
Rally on 10th Street.

468
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:14,622
Be prepared to move.
We're moving out soon.

469
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,417
Shit.

470
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:27,427
Mottorola.

471
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,678
Mottorola?

472
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,309
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?

473
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:35,770
Lenihan, where are you?

474
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,397
Staff sergeant?

475
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:41,316
Jesus Christ. l had to turn my radio
off. These things are everywhere.

476
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,612
We're coming for you.
What's your location?

477
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:47,073
I'm in the laundry room
of some apartment complex.

478
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:49,033
It's like
three storeys--

479
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:02,631
What colour is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?

480
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,480
Shit.

481
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:30,242
Lenihan.

482
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:36,248
Shit.

483
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,551
So smooth....

484
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,845
Smooth is fast.

485
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:52,889
Shit.

486
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,564
Oh, shit.

487
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,577
- Lenihan!
- Lenihan, lower that weapon!

488
00:34:56,455 --> 00:34:58,289
What the
hell--?

489
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:09,300
Keep on firing!

490
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,720
Jesus Christ! What
the hell is that thing?

491
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,351
It's not dead. They don't die. I've
hit it a hundred times. They don't die.

492
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,770
Get separated from the unit again,
I'll find you and shoot you myself.

493
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,565
Imlay, drop a grenade
in that pool. Let's move!

494
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:25,775
Come on, l got you. l got you.

495
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,320
Frag out.

496
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:42,167
Street's clear.

497
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:45,085
Get down, get down, get down.

498
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:49,132
- What's happening? What's going on?
- All right, we're good. Come on.

499
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:56,515
- lt's Lenihan.
- Yo, Lockett.

500
00:35:56,724 --> 00:36:00,978
You owe me $5. l told you, a virgin
ain't gonna die till he get him some.

501
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:02,853
Move to the police station?

502
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:06,317
- All right, let's move. Let's move.
- Move it. Move it out.

503
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,666
- Where'd that come from?
- Door's open at the bank!

504
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:23,167
Take care of him.

505
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:24,669
Where'd the shot come from?

506
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:27,671
- Kerns!
- Door's open on the bank! Let's move!

507
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,549
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!

508
00:36:31,761 --> 00:36:35,054
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou,
cover front. Harris, cover front!

509
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:37,682
Roof's clear, roof's clear!

510
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,100
I got it. I got it covered.

511
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,811
Harris! Find me where
that shot came from, guys!

512
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:44,105
Imlay, get eyes up on
that roof, all right?

513
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,607
- Cover the roof!
- Roof's clear, roof's clear!

514
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,025
Lockett, on me!

515
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:50,321
Did anybody even see
where that came from?

516
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,031
Doc, how serious?

517
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,035
Third degree thermal burns
on his neck and his face, sir.

518
00:36:57,454 --> 00:36:59,037
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.

519
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:00,788
Shit.

520
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,919
- Hostiles, 12 o'clock!
- Hostiles at 12 o'clock!

521
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,214
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!

522
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,591
Prepare to fire!

523
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,053
Hold it, hold it!

524
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:15,805
Friendlies, sir.

525
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:20,641
- Shit.
- Friendlies. Let's get them in.

526
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:24,855
Get over here.

527
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:31,653
Move. Move to the back.
Let's go. Come on, get.

528
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,657
- What's your unit?
- 40th, lD.

529
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,493
Where's the rest of your unit?

530
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:40,079
Everyone else is either dead or missing.

531
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:42,874
I picked up Air Force here.

532
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:45,249
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force.

533
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,629
61st Wing, intel,
surveillance, recon division.

534
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:52,007
Tech sergeant? What the
hell are you doing here?

535
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:55,804
We were tracking enemy transmissions
about 12 klicks south of here.

536
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:58,429
They ambushed us like they
knew our freaking address.

537
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,891
I'm the only one left.

538
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:04,978
I found these guys on the way to the
safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.

539
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,858
You ready to use that
weapon, tech sergeant?

540
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:12,236
With all due respect, staff sergeant, I
didn't get this far off of my good looks.

541
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:14,321
- I'm ready for payback.
- Outstanding.

542
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,576
Lieutenant, bird
inbound, 25 minutes, sir.

543
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:21,788
Roger that. Let's get
to that police station.

544
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,581
All right, let's get
Simmons and move. Let's go!

545
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:32,174
Cover our flanks, Mottorola!
To the right, in that building!

546
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:33,467
Watch your feet!

547
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:34,968
There's the police station.

548
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,972
Let's get those civilians
and get back to the F.O.B.!

549
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:42,349
Gotta rock, gotta rock!

550
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:49,441
Come on, come on, come on.

551
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:52,444
I'll stay with our wounded,
wait for the medevac.

552
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:55,280
I'll go for civilians.
Kerns, Dever, on me.

553
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:58,492
- Mags, mags. I need mags.
- All right.

554
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:02,455
Santos, when that bird arrives, I'll
need your help on this stretcher.

555
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:05,081
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

556
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,251
Door. The door.

557
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,213
- Elevator right.
- Clear!

558
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:11,923
Elevator right.

559
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:15,176
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.

560
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:18,136
Door left.

561
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:19,889
It's locked.

562
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:21,390
- What's your name?
- Harper.

563
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:24,436
- I'm gonna need you on this stretcher.
- Bird incoming, sir!

564
00:39:24,644 --> 00:39:27,396
Roger that. lmlay, pop smoke!

565
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,652
- Door locked.
- Door left.

566
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:37,948
Radios off.

567
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:49,793
Move.

568
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,367
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!

569
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:24,329
- How many of you?
- Five of us, three kids.

570
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,081
Kerns, kids!

571
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,126
- Let's move!
- Let's go, let's go!

572
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,255
All right, let's get ready
to move! Let's get it up!

573
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,593
- Here we go! Let's move!
- Aye, sir!

574
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,595
We got room for four and
that is it! That is it.

575
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,139
- Get your wounded on! Move it!
- Oh, yeah, baby.

576
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,518
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.

577
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,395
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.

578
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:50,896
I'll work on that mix for you!

579
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:54,526
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're
gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!

580
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,279
Give them hell!

581
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,032
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

582
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:03,452
You just had to get out of the shit.

583
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,454
- You take care of yourself!
- l will.

584
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,497
I'll see you soon, partner.

585
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:10,459
- That's it.
- We have civilians coming out!

586
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,962
- We can't take them, we got no room!
- Make room!

587
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,132
We can't! Now, get back, sir!

588
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:18,467
Fall back. Move back,
move back, move back!

589
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:25,349
Wait! Kids, kids!

590
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,992
Get back to the police station!

591
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:49,458
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!

592
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:02,262
They have air power. Again, enemy
has air support. We have a bird down.

593
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:03,763
Damn it!

594
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:05,767
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.

595
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:08,895
We've disengaged back into a
police station. We have civilians.

596
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:11,355
I say again, we have civilians.

597
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:14,900
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.
Nothing gets in, you understand?

598
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:22,032
We got a body. Do you think you could
get rid of it so the kids don't see it?

599
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:23,992
What do you want? Where should we go?

600
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,243
Dever.

601
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:27,162
Set up back there, okay?

602
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,167
Come on, you guys. Take the back.

603
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,419
Stay away from the window, all right?

604
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,923
Are there gonna be more choppers?
Did you guys call any in?

605
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,304
I'm sure they're gonna come
for us. They know where we are.

606
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:48,183
Shit. You okay? You all right?

607
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,812
- I'm good. Yeah.
- You sure?

608
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:53,563
- You didn't get hit or nothing?
- No, I'm good, man. I'm good.

609
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:57,402
Man, they're gone. They're gone.

610
00:42:57,612 --> 00:43:00,071
Everybody's gone. Lenihan,
Guerrero, Grayston.

611
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:02,324
Grayston. Grayston had kids.

612
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:04,367
Didn't deserve that.
Didn't deserve that!

613
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:06,285
He didn't deserve to go out like that!

614
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:10,415
Neither do you! You hear me?
You're gonna make it through this!

615
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:15,003
All right? You're gonna get out of
here. You're gonna marry Cherise.

616
00:43:15,214 --> 00:43:17,046
And you're gonna be her problem...

617
00:43:17,256 --> 00:43:20,758
...because I'm done taking care
of your sorry ass, you got that?

618
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:26,472
All stations, this
net. Sitrep as follow:

619
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,685
Enemy aircraft number
four fleets at this time.

620
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:33,228
Be advised, more entering battle
space Los Angeles from ocean...

621
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:35,773
...on bearing
2-niner-7-5-0.

622
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:38,235
They got air support too.

623
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,822
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.

624
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:44,866
So much for ruling the air.

625
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:48,621
There's no time for that, lieutenant.

626
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,664
Those bombs are gonna drop.

627
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,668
And we're in the blast radius.

628
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:57,336
Top of my goddamn class.

629
00:43:57,795 --> 00:44:02,092
And l get out in combat in the
middle of that shit? Goddamn it!

630
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:04,845
I already lost four of my goddamn men!

631
00:44:05,598 --> 00:44:06,723
Four good men.

632
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:09,058
Who would go to hell
and back for you, sir.

633
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:15,482
- Have you?
- Yes.

634
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,651
You're not the first to lose
men. You won't be the last.

635
00:44:18,862 --> 00:44:21,196
Now, put that away. You understand me?

636
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,947
Right now your men are awaiting orders.

637
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:28,202
Now, you can go left, you can
go right. I don't give a damn.

638
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:30,790
Just make a decision.

639
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,000
Lieutenant.

640
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,920
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.

641
00:44:37,129 --> 00:44:39,005
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.

642
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:41,507
Command says it's like
nothing they ever seen.

643
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:43,469
We gotta find a way out.

644
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:45,887
We gotta get to that F.O.B.

645
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:48,973
You're right. We gotta move.

646
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:52,268
Let's get these people
safe. Lockett, Kerns!

647
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:55,063
I need you to set up an
observation post on the roof.

648
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:57,607
We're gonna move by foot,
so we gotta move fast.

649
00:44:57,776 --> 00:45:00,443
Scan for hostiles, find
the best route out of here.

650
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:02,112
All right, sir.

651
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:04,656
Lieutenant.

652
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,998
Officials are now saying any civilian
within 10 miles of the coast...

653
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,794
...should try to make their way...

654
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,876
...to a military forward
operating base, F.O.B.

655
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:22,049
This is the safest place
that you could be right now.

656
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:26,178
Now, the military has set up a line
of defence to try to protect civilians.

657
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:30,473
Take a look at you, make sure
you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.

658
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:34,311
Just look at this. There you go.

659
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,480
- Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon.
- Okay, thank you.

660
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:38,982
- No problem.
- Thank you.

661
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:44,821
- Joe Rincon.
- Staff Sergeant Nantz.

662
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,198
This is my son, Hector.

663
00:45:46,408 --> 00:45:50,077
We all wanted to thank
you for coming to get us.

664
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:52,245
Yeah.

665
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:55,208
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.

666
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,418
So you here when the police got overrun?

667
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:04,592
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.

668
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:07,888
Hey, you all right, man?

669
00:46:08,514 --> 00:46:10,264
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

670
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:11,849
Okay.

671
00:46:13,102 --> 00:46:15,603
If you-- lf you need
him to do anything...

672
00:46:16,314 --> 00:46:19,065
- ...you know.
- I'll let you know.

673
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:23,360
Aye-aye, sir.

674
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:25,155
Aye.

675
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,532
Thank you.

676
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,623
We got two dozen hostiles
about 300 metres out.

677
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:38,417
Lieutenant, we got two dozen
hostiles 300 metres north, over.

678
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:43,341
It's like those things are
on overwatch, just like us.

679
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:47,970
That one out front looks like the
leader. Now they got leadership.

680
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:50,013
So do ants, Kerns.

681
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:52,932
You think those things get scared too?

682
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:58,188
Probably just like us. They're probably
just grunts that get told to go fight.

683
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:03,443
Come on. Find us a way out of here,
Marine, because we're sitting ducks.

684
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:06,196
They dragged them out of
the house, into the street...

685
00:47:06,364 --> 00:47:08,700
...put them in perfect
order before they shot them.

686
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,451
They shot them right in the head.

687
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,078
Chief, do we have any
idea why this is happening?

688
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:16,666
Well, it's clear there has been no
attempt at any kind of communication.

689
00:47:16,832 --> 00:47:19,041
No demands, nothing like that.

690
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:21,838
So, obviously, they are
here for our resources.

691
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,549
When you invade a place for resources...

692
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,636
...you wipe out the
indigenous population.

693
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,845
Those are the rules of any colonisation.

694
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,641
And, right now, we are being colonised.

695
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:35,851
Brave kids.

696
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:40,231
They're my nieces. My sister and
her husband are away on vacation.

697
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,531
Thing is, they live in Arizona.
I see them once or twice a year.

698
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,742
And now I may be all they have left.

699
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:54,079
- You have kids?
- No.

700
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,163
Neither do I.

701
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,711
I used to regret that, but
maybe it was for the best.

702
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,547
Of course, our planet's
surface is 70 percent water.

703
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,384
So again, and l have to stress
this, without certainty...

704
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,969
...the leading hypothesis remains
that their objective, their target...

705
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,220
...is our water.

706
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:15,183
- Shit.
- There ain't gonna be nothing left.

707
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,730
- l think l got a way out of here.
- What'd you say?

708
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,814
Right here, look. 200 metres out.

709
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,149
- What's right behind that backside?
- Bus.

710
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,111
- Lieutenant, we got a bus.
- Roger that.

711
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,613
So the men on the roof saw a bus.
They think it could be operational.

712
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,617
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.

713
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,786
It's miles to the operating base...

714
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,332
...and those bombs are
gonna drop in an hour.

715
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,583
We gotta move fast.

716
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,419
Bus is a big target.

717
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,837
I made the call.

718
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,758
It's my responsibility.

719
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,634
Stavrou, Harris.

720
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:51,803
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.
If it runs, get it back here.

721
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:55,975
- You know how to hotwire a bus?
- Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.

722
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:57,560
Ladies first.

723
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,564
Two hundred metres.

724
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:05,610
Go down, there's the cars burnt
out, there's a pickup truck.

725
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,277
Right back behind there.

726
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:12,116
We have a situation.
Y'all need to follow me.

727
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:17,121
Harris found it out here.
Y'all gotta see this thing.

728
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:29,467
Weapon looks like it's
been surgically attached.

729
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,802
Talk about commitment to cause.

730
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,811
Shit.

731
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:44,649
- You gotta be kidding!
- Corporal. Corporal, hold it.

732
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,362
Let me shoot this thing, staff
sergeant. That weapon's hot.

733
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:49,655
Let me just shoot it.

734
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,030
- Doc.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

735
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,367
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

736
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:57,203
We need to know exactly
where to hit this thing...

737
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,164
...so we don't waste all our ammo.

738
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,709
Maybe I can help.

739
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:04,419
I'm a veterinarian.

740
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,893
Sure you wanna do this?

741
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:21,854
I was more sure when I
was standing over there.

742
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:24,732
We gotta figure out how
to kill these things.

743
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:28,153
Otherwise, we won't last another
five minutes out there, okay?

744
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,655
Let's peel this back.

745
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:38,371
- Look at this, we got a organ here.
- Jesus Christ, look at that.

746
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:40,539
- I got another one.
- Me too.

747
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:43,751
Does it have some sort of
cognitive mechanism? Anything?

748
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,921
There's no frontal lobe, no
temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.

749
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:48,881
The cranial vault is unlike anything.

750
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:50,549
- Oh, shit.
- What?

751
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,301
- You see what I'm seeing?
- What?

752
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,761
The ones that were just
on the roof aren't on it.

753
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,973
There's about two dozen
coming out the door.

754
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,058
They're on the street heading this way.

755
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:01,728
- Lieutenant, we got movement up here.
- Roger that.

756
00:51:01,897 --> 00:51:04,480
We have contact 300 metres
out. We gotta cut quick.

757
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:13,908
Lieutenant, we gotta
move! What do we do?

758
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,576
- Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move.
- Staff sergeant.

759
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,995
Come on, how do you kill this thing?

760
00:51:27,755 --> 00:51:29,340
Goddamn it, Stavs.

761
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:31,758
- I lost them.
- You lost them?

762
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:35,596
Lieutenant, they're gone.
Lieutenant, I don't see anything.

763
00:51:36,806 --> 00:51:39,642
- We got a breach.
- Got a breach on the north entrance!

764
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:40,935
They're inside.

765
00:51:41,102 --> 00:51:43,519
I'm gonna gather everyone by
the doors on the south side.

766
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:45,271
We're right behind you.

767
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,982
What was that?

768
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,609
- Adukwu, you go with her.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

769
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:52,988
- Imlay, got an HE grenade round?
- Never leave home without it.

770
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,573
You cover that hall to
the rear. Buy me some time.

771
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:58,494
They start coming, you
blast the hell out of them.

772
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,121
Hey, Harris. Where's that goddamn bus?

773
00:52:01,332 --> 00:52:04,208
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy
scout. Come on, let's go.

774
00:52:06,044 --> 00:52:10,004
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby! Newark! Represent!

775
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,424
Lieutenant, we've got
the bus, heading back.

776
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:14,928
Okay, guys, the bus is
en route! Bus is en route!

777
00:52:15,136 --> 00:52:17,096
Thirty seconds till we move out!

778
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,147
Imlay, give me a sitrep. I
need an update on the breach.

779
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:28,232
Report back, over.

780
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:35,488
We're running out of time.

781
00:52:45,626 --> 00:52:46,877
Move!

782
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,590
Contact!

783
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,134
They've breached.

784
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:01,640
This is our last shot.

785
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:03,977
Got it.

786
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:06,145
Right here.

787
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:15,739
That's gotta be it. It's dying.

788
00:53:20,368 --> 00:53:23,706
That's how we kill this thing, to
the right of where the heart would be.

789
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:25,249
- Got it.
- I got three more!

790
00:53:29,754 --> 00:53:31,379
Let's get out of here.

791
00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:38,387
Get them on the bus! Get them
on that bus! Let's go, let's go!

792
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:45,935
- Get on.
- Get underneath.

793
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:48,147
You okay?

794
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:56,113
Heads up. Cover your
sectors of fire. Heads up!

795
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:03,954
Marines, concentrate firepower to
the right of where the heart would be.

796
00:54:04,122 --> 00:54:05,539
Yes, staff sergeant.

797
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:07,958
That's how we kill these things.

798
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,546
All right, remember your training.

799
00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:13,799
We got a hostile warbird,
thousand metres out.

800
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,299
Everybody keep your eyes up.

801
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:25,602
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.

802
00:54:25,812 --> 00:54:27,228
Roger that.

803
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:30,566
It should be about
six miles to the F.O.B.

804
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:32,651
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.

805
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:34,860
If we stay on these side streets.

806
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,823
Air Force is gonna level
this area in 40 minutes.

807
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:47,416
Get us to the forward
operating base. Fast.

808
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,724
What the hell is that?

809
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,809
Stavrou, stop the bus.

810
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,077
Everyone, get down.

811
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:41,762
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.

812
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,015
Go ahead,
Foxtrot-Two-November.

813
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,477
Enemy aircraft. They're
lighting up the sky...

814
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:49,312
...heading east towards
downtown Los Angeles.

815
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,645
Copy that.

816
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:54,775
They're tracking our signals.

817
00:55:58,446 --> 00:56:01,157
Mottola, turn off that radio!
They're tracking our signals!

818
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:03,619
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!

819
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:07,165
Give me your radio.

820
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,878
Mottola. Give me your radio.

821
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:17,424
Where you going?

822
00:56:17,592 --> 00:56:19,760
- Staff sergeant!
- Where the hell is he going?

823
00:56:28,353 --> 00:56:33,065
- We gotta get off this bus, all right?
- Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!

824
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:36,400
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!

825
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:39,738
It's getting closer.
Hey, it's on my six!

826
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,622
A hundred metres!

827
00:56:56,006 --> 00:56:57,215
Oh, my God.

828
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:01,760
Everybody, get down!

829
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:17,485
Holy shit.

830
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,861
- What was that?
- Is he all right?

831
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:01,530
- Did he make it out?
- Staff sergeant?

832
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:20,758
- There he is.
- Staff sergeant's alive!

833
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:23,093
- Yeah, he's alive!
- There he is!

834
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,881
That aircraft was unmanned, Iieutenant.

835
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:02,216
Drone.

836
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,560
That was some real John
Wayne shit, staff sergeant.

837
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:22,195
Hey.

838
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:26,409
I can't afford to lose you.
Neither can these men, all right?

839
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,954
Yeah. They're your men.

840
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:34,417
All right, staff sergeant!

841
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:39,337
That's how you do it!

842
00:59:39,547 --> 00:59:41,715
- That's retreat, hell!
- That's right.

843
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:44,592
Who the hell's John Wayne?

844
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:56,896
Everybody, eyes open!

845
00:59:57,106 --> 00:59:58,773
Stay alert!

846
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:01,652
Thank you for that.

847
01:00:06,117 --> 01:00:07,616
It's nothing.

848
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,827
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?

849
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:19,421
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to retreat.

850
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:24,341
He said, "Retreat,
hell. We just got here."

851
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:30,848
You should have the
doc take a look at that.

852
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,100
I thought you were a doctor.

853
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:36,269
Animals and aliens only.

854
01:00:36,939 --> 01:00:39,106
I'll put it on my to-do list.

855
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:41,108
Thank you.

856
01:00:51,287 --> 01:00:54,413
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did
you say that was an unmanned drone?

857
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:55,999
Correct.

858
01:00:57,043 --> 01:00:59,920
They must have one hell of
a command-and-control system.

859
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:03,173
If NORTHCOM didn't agree
with you, I wouldn't be here.

860
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:04,800
Why?

861
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:10,055
My mission was to provide
AIS with a strike package.

862
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,808
A strike package?

863
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:15,727
Yeah, coordinates for a missile
strike on a command-and-control centre.

864
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:19,856
But the asset fell off
the grid and we lost them.

865
01:01:29,784 --> 01:01:33,246
All side streets are blocked. Our
only choice is to take the freeway.

866
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,666
All right. Well, it's your call.

867
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:38,584
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.

868
01:01:39,753 --> 01:01:43,631
We don't wanna be in this area
when these bombs start to fall.

869
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,490
Try to miss at least
one of the cars, Stavrou.

870
01:02:11,368 --> 01:02:12,953
Just keep driving.

871
01:02:13,912 --> 01:02:15,496
Off ramp is one mile ahead.

872
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:23,461
Jesus.

873
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,257
Look out.

874
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:35,808
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.

875
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:44,277
All right, Robertson
exit, half a click away.

876
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,778
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!

877
01:02:56,999 --> 01:02:58,874
- You okay?
- Harper!

878
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:09,092
Tank's drawing enemy fire!
It's a good time to move!

879
01:03:09,303 --> 01:03:11,554
I'll suppress the fire,
you take the civilians!

880
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:13,763
Secure this exit, Imlay!

881
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,938
Imlay, get me a defensive
line on that vehicle!

882
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:26,401
- Move, move, move!
- Let's go! Come on.

883
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:29,154
- Let's go!
- Come on, stay down, stay down!

884
01:03:34,328 --> 01:03:37,372
Just keep everybody calm.
We'll be right back, all right?

885
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,290
All right. Safety first, buddy.

886
01:03:42,544 --> 01:03:47,383
Martinez, if we get the civilians to
that helo, they take cover, rappel down.

887
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:50,343
I got a dozen up on the
bridge. They're moving down.

888
01:03:50,595 --> 01:03:53,930
Lieutenant! Tank's out!
Nothing's stopping them now!

889
01:03:56,850 --> 01:04:00,687
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make
it to that helo without cover fire.

890
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,773
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!

891
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:06,193
Let's move, let's move, let's move!

892
01:04:10,614 --> 01:04:12,491
Get the civilians down, all right? Move!

893
01:04:17,747 --> 01:04:19,248
Come on!

894
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:24,210
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.

895
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:28,881
Get behind the bus! Now,
now, now! Get behind it!

896
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:32,261
Kids first! Around the body,
bring them down one at a time.

897
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,845
Roger that.

898
01:04:35,556 --> 01:04:37,058
Imlay!

899
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:39,852
Get your team up on that garbage truck!

900
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:43,689
Staff sergeant, cover us up front!
Stavs, you're with me! On me now!

901
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:49,278
We're gonna run behind that helicopter
and we're gonna rope down, all right?

902
01:04:49,572 --> 01:04:50,779
The girls will be first.

903
01:04:50,947 --> 01:04:53,949
I promise you nothing's
gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!

904
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,954
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles, maybe more!

905
01:04:59,123 --> 01:05:01,666
Four hundred metres and closing fast!

906
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:04,585
Cover, cover! What
the hell are you doing?

907
01:05:04,794 --> 01:05:06,378
You guys need another gun.

908
01:05:07,546 --> 01:05:10,340
Three o'clock. Up on the
bridge, Santos. Up on the bridge.

909
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:12,343
Incoming!

910
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,436
Ten o'clock!

911
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:28,692
- Reloading!
- Aim for the leader!

912
01:05:33,074 --> 01:05:35,117
Hell, you can take
all the room you want.

913
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:37,577
Mottola, move, move, move!

914
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:42,415
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's
go! Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!

915
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:46,212
Keep running! Don't
stop, run! Run, run, run!

916
01:05:53,094 --> 01:05:55,345
- Get in there!
- Cover me!

917
01:05:57,263 --> 01:06:00,183
- I'm going for the .50 cal!
- Hurry up!

918
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:07,774
Get some, Lockett.

919
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:21,413
- Shit.
- What the hell is that thing?

920
01:06:21,623 --> 01:06:23,164
I'm engaging!

921
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:30,464
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay.
Listen to me. You're going to be okay.

922
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:33,634
I got you. I will not let
anything happen to you, all right?

923
01:06:39,975 --> 01:06:41,225
Shit!

924
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:44,729
Man down!

925
01:06:45,149 --> 01:06:48,274
You're gonna be okay. Hold on,
hold on! Keep going. Hold on!

926
01:06:48,774 --> 01:06:50,484
Keep looking up!

927
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,618
Oh, God!

928
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,663
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.

929
01:07:01,872 --> 01:07:04,749
Get the ant that's
controlling that thing!

930
01:07:08,212 --> 01:07:09,589
Lockett, get off your ass!

931
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:17,053
It's turning this way!

932
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:20,181
It's about to hit the fan,
guys. Get out now! Move!

933
01:07:20,391 --> 01:07:22,017
Santos, come on!

934
01:07:22,894 --> 01:07:24,436
- Come on!
- I'm stuck.

935
01:07:24,645 --> 01:07:25,937
Go!

936
01:07:27,148 --> 01:07:28,982
- What are you doing?
- Go!

937
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,067
Imlay!

938
01:07:43,456 --> 01:07:44,706
Where's Stavrou?

939
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,129
Mottorola! How many down?

940
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,343
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!

941
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,968
Look at me, look at me.
Look, look. Be good, okay?

942
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:01,974
- It's gonna be fine, okay?
You ready? -Lieutenant, C-4!

943
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:05,936
Let's blow this sucker to hell!

944
01:08:06,897 --> 01:08:08,438
Let's do it.

945
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:10,899
Kerns!

946
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,076
Covering!

947
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,297
All right, dough is good to go!

948
01:08:32,506 --> 01:08:34,298
- Go!
- Covering!

949
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,139
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.

950
01:08:43,226 --> 01:08:46,352
- You all right?
- Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.

951
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:54,820
- Mottorola!
- Dad!

952
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:57,155
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.

953
01:08:57,323 --> 01:08:58,740
Hold on!

954
01:09:02,245 --> 01:09:05,163
- I need bandages from the first aid kit.
- Sir! Sir!

955
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:06,790
It's okay!

956
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:15,673
Oh, my God!

957
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,592
All right.

958
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:35,028
We gotta get you to a medevac.

959
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,738
Doc!

960
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:41,950
Oh, shit, man!

961
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:43,869
- We need some cover!
- Damn it, I'm out!

962
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:46,331
- Got another mag, Lockett?
- They kicking our ass!

963
01:09:46,497 --> 01:09:48,833
You're getting pinned
down, staff sergeant!

964
01:09:49,043 --> 01:09:51,336
Marines, you're getting pinned down!

965
01:09:52,129 --> 01:09:54,630
- We're not leaving you.
- Staff sergeant, get them out!

966
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,883
- Lieutenant, I am not
leav-- -Get them out!

967
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:59,135
- No, I'm not leaving you!
- Get them out!

968
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:00,386
No! Not again!

969
01:10:03,557 --> 01:10:06,224
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.

970
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:09,228
Give this to my wife...

971
01:10:09,437 --> 01:10:12,148
...and get them off
this goddamn freeway.

972
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,445
That's an order.

973
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:22,241
Yes, sir.

974
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:27,038
Right behind you.

975
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,548
Cover the lieutenant!

976
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,928
Hey, I'm out!

977
01:10:47,017 --> 01:10:48,684
They're closing in!

978
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:53,565
Here we go.

979
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:01,906
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...

980
01:11:02,117 --> 01:11:05,619
...Echo Company, 2nd
Battalion, 5th Marines. Hoorah!

981
01:12:10,186 --> 01:12:13,230
We're still half a klick
inside the bombing zone.

982
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:17,777
Move to live, Marines.

983
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:25,284
Did he just leave the
lieutenant back there to die?

984
01:12:25,494 --> 01:12:27,161
Sure looked that way.

985
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,955
And this is the guy in charge of us now?

986
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:32,124
Let's move.

987
01:12:35,169 --> 01:12:39,465
Hey, those are our jets.
We're still in the fight.

988
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:43,762
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.

989
01:12:44,262 --> 01:12:45,846
Let's tighten this place down.

990
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:47,721
Bombs drop in six minutes.

991
01:12:47,932 --> 01:12:49,892
Santos, Kerns, on me.

992
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:53,855
Let's see if there are any
comms. All right? Hardwire only.

993
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:15,209
- Corporal Harris, we clear?
- We're clear!

994
01:13:15,418 --> 01:13:18,421
- Do you have a hard line in here?
- Over there.

995
01:13:22,718 --> 01:13:24,386
Now, my son's an optimist.

996
01:13:25,387 --> 01:13:29,724
When this first happened, he said,
"Why don't we go try to talk to them?

997
01:13:31,059 --> 01:13:33,103
Maybe they wanna be friends."

998
01:13:36,191 --> 01:13:38,024
Hector? Hey.

999
01:13:38,234 --> 01:13:41,360
We're gonna go get some food
and water for your dad, okay?

1000
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:43,530
It's okay.

1001
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:45,866
And what'd you tell him?

1002
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:47,618
I said:

1003
01:13:48,244 --> 01:13:50,704
"You know, if they're
chasing and shooting us...

1004
01:13:50,913 --> 01:13:53,290
...they're probably not good friends."

1005
01:13:56,835 --> 01:13:59,880
I should've followed directions
and gone to the F.O.B.

1006
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:03,550
I should've never stayed at the
police station, but I was scared, man.

1007
01:14:05,803 --> 01:14:07,846
I made all the wrong decisions.

1008
01:14:08,055 --> 01:14:10,307
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.

1009
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:13,394
You made a call.

1010
01:14:13,562 --> 01:14:16,354
I'd do the same thing
to protect my Marines.

1011
01:14:22,403 --> 01:14:25,698
- I had a situation my last tour.
- Yeah?

1012
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:30,287
There was no right call. You went
left or you go right, it didn't matter.

1013
01:14:33,664 --> 01:14:35,249
But you're alive.

1014
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,294
Yeah, I survived.

1015
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:41,297
But I wasn't supposed to.

1016
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:45,717
Staff Sergeant Nantz....

1017
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:56,812
You promise to save my son?

1018
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:07,366
Staff sergeant, we have
a hardwired connection!

1019
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:12,869
Doc, keep him warm. Sun is going down.

1020
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:15,624
This will keep you warm.

1021
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:20,337
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17
countries are now under full attack.

1022
01:15:20,672 --> 01:15:24,382
It's obvious the enemy is attempting
to cut us off from one another.

1023
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,803
Is there any more information
at this time, Professor Stavert?

1024
01:15:28,012 --> 01:15:30,806
New data shows that they're
using our water as their fuel...

1025
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:33,141
...and our ocean levels
are already decreasing.

1026
01:15:33,352 --> 01:15:36,269
They are using it to power
their ships, their machinery...

1027
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,440
...possibly their own bodies. It's the
composition of our water that's unique.

1028
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:44,027
It's in a liquid state. No other
locations in our known universe...

1029
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:46,864
...have liquid H2O
anywhere near their surface.

1030
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:50,701
I just saw a field report that said
they will use our sewage systems...

1031
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,287
- ...to follow our water to their ships.
- How'd you get that to work?

1032
01:15:54,455 --> 01:15:58,502
These things are everywhere. There's
one off the coast of 20 countries.

1033
01:15:58,711 --> 01:16:01,337
They're calling it the
command-and-control centre.

1034
01:16:02,464 --> 01:16:05,216
- That's the thing you were tracking?
- Yeah.

1035
01:16:05,425 --> 01:16:09,219
So you're saying that's the thing
that's controlling the drones?

1036
01:16:09,429 --> 01:16:14,057
Yeah. And if we wipe it out,
we take out their air power.

1037
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:18,521
These bombs better work.

1038
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:20,981
- Let's move it.
- Bring him through here.

1039
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:24,236
- Set him down.
- How much time we got?

1040
01:16:25,028 --> 01:16:26,112
One minute.

1041
01:16:29,283 --> 01:16:32,660
Air Force about to lay some pain
on those extraterritorial bastards.

1042
01:16:35,747 --> 01:16:37,957
- All right, Two-Five,
retreat.... -Hell!

1043
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:40,084
- Retreat....
- Hell!

1044
01:16:41,628 --> 01:16:42,628
Here we go.

1045
01:16:42,797 --> 01:16:45,256
Come on. Let's fry
these sons of bitches.

1046
01:16:45,465 --> 01:16:48,008
We get to the F.O.B. after
these bombs drop, get ammo.

1047
01:16:48,177 --> 01:16:51,429
And some goddamn reinforcements.
Some goddamn tanks.

1048
01:16:56,519 --> 01:16:58,437
- Ten.
- Gotta be strong, okay?

1049
01:16:58,645 --> 01:17:00,104
Nine.

1050
01:17:00,314 --> 01:17:01,983
Eight.

1051
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:03,484
Seven.

1052
01:17:03,694 --> 01:17:05,235
Six.

1053
01:17:05,444 --> 01:17:06,820
Five.

1054
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:08,823
Four.

1055
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:11,240
Three....

1056
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:14,329
Shit. Everybody, brace!

1057
01:17:35,392 --> 01:17:37,268
- They should've dropped.
- What the hell?

1058
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:41,146
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if
they'd dropped? We would've felt them.

1059
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:43,565
Would've felt it in
Nevada with that ordnance.

1060
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,275
That clock right?

1061
01:17:45,486 --> 01:17:46,736
That's what I got.

1062
01:17:46,946 --> 01:17:50,239
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we
turned the tide. That's a good thing.

1063
01:17:50,407 --> 01:17:52,826
You damn straight, Imlay.
We was kicking some ass.

1064
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:55,703
Could they have taken
out the whole Air Force?

1065
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:57,621
This isn't happening.

1066
01:17:57,832 --> 01:17:58,958
Let's move.

1067
01:17:59,165 --> 01:18:01,251
Everybody, up, up. Let's move. Come on.

1068
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,294
We're in the home stretch,
everybody. We in the home stretch.

1069
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:24,898
Now we know why those bombs didn't drop.

1070
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:28,821
They wiped our forward
operating base right off the map.

1071
01:18:30,574 --> 01:18:32,782
All clear, staff sergeant!

1072
01:18:33,033 --> 01:18:35,742
All right, let's bring him back here.

1073
01:18:39,957 --> 01:18:40,999
Hang in there, buddy.

1074
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,793
Million-and-one odds we'd
get here in the first place...

1075
01:18:44,004 --> 01:18:48,256
...we get here and there ain't nothing.
I knew Nantz would never get us out.

1076
01:18:50,302 --> 01:18:54,304
- There were thousands of Marines here.
- Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.

1077
01:18:56,058 --> 01:18:58,349
You remind me of my older brother.

1078
01:18:59,143 --> 01:19:00,934
How's that?

1079
01:19:01,605 --> 01:19:03,981
He never smiles either.

1080
01:19:07,444 --> 01:19:08,986
Secure the front with Harris.

1081
01:19:10,989 --> 01:19:12,489
Imlay, anything?

1082
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:14,742
Nothing. We only got
maps of Santa Monica.

1083
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:17,536
We need something farther
east. They're all burned.

1084
01:19:17,745 --> 01:19:18,829
Follow me, Imlay.

1085
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:26,629
All right, here's the
battalion commander's hooch.

1086
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,214
Looking for maps, anything
with an extraction point.

1087
01:19:29,382 --> 01:19:31,176
Staff sergeant.

1088
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:42,269
I'll be right back.

1089
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:50,694
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.

1090
01:19:50,862 --> 01:19:53,281
Shows where all the units were deployed.

1091
01:19:53,866 --> 01:19:56,951
- What the hell are all these red marks?
- Means they're gone.

1092
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,205
- You mean the units got moved?
- Wiped out.

1093
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:03,249
- All of them?
- All of them.

1094
01:20:03,459 --> 01:20:04,709
Oh, shit.

1095
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:09,047
All right. One alternate extraction
site is still operational.

1096
01:20:09,799 --> 01:20:11,509
That's eight klicks.

1097
01:20:11,717 --> 01:20:15,512
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.

1098
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,223
Adukwu, plenty of weapons
around. Find yourself an M-16.

1099
01:20:19,642 --> 01:20:20,976
Mr. Rincon is dead.

1100
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:47,293
Wake up, Dad.

1101
01:20:55,555 --> 01:20:58,221
Please help me right now.

1102
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:01,893
Don't leave me.

1103
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:09,818
I'm so sorry, Hector.

1104
01:21:13,905 --> 01:21:15,364
I'm sorry.

1105
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,575
No.

1106
01:21:17,743 --> 01:21:21,579
Your dad tried so hard to stay with you.

1107
01:21:23,082 --> 01:21:25,332
- I'm sorr-- -I
don't wanna be here.

1108
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,968
It's okay, bud.

1109
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:44,018
Your father was a brave man, Hector.

1110
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,824
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.

1111
01:21:58,035 --> 01:22:00,119
It's okay to cry.

1112
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,627
He loved you very much.

1113
01:22:08,711 --> 01:22:10,629
Listen to me, Hector.

1114
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:16,344
I need you to be brave for me. I
need you to be my little Marine.

1115
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:20,848
Okay?

1116
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:25,103
We gotta be brave for the others.

1117
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,564
Do you know why?

1118
01:22:31,527 --> 01:22:33,025
Why?

1119
01:22:36,115 --> 01:22:38,658
Because Marines don't quit.

1120
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:42,287
Do you believe that?

1121
01:22:44,832 --> 01:22:46,040
Say it for me.

1122
01:22:49,169 --> 01:22:52,755
- Marines don't quit.
- Good.

1123
01:22:53,298 --> 01:22:57,300
I'm gonna get you out of
here, Hector. I promise.

1124
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:03,683
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.

1125
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:25,079
We are not losing one more of
those civilians. Understand?

1126
01:23:27,374 --> 01:23:30,209
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?

1127
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,089
Or are we expendable?

1128
01:23:43,891 --> 01:23:45,643
All right, Lockett.

1129
01:23:46,478 --> 01:23:48,729
You wanna go there, let's go there.

1130
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:55,736
I commanded men and men died.

1131
01:23:55,987 --> 01:24:00,657
Kids. 19 years old.
The best men I ever led.

1132
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:06,246
Do you think for one second I
wouldn't rather trade places with them?

1133
01:24:12,504 --> 01:24:15,256
I know you think I got my men killed.

1134
01:24:18,135 --> 01:24:19,635
They're dead.

1135
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:22,763
I'm here.

1136
01:24:23,599 --> 01:24:26,101
Like the punch line to some bad joke.

1137
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,269
You think I like that?

1138
01:24:28,603 --> 01:24:31,897
Do you think a minute goes by that
those faces aren't right here...

1139
01:24:32,107 --> 01:24:34,274
...seared into my brain?

1140
01:24:37,613 --> 01:24:42,116
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal.
1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.

1141
01:24:42,284 --> 01:24:47,955
Ambruster, William R.
Private. 8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.

1142
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,209
Wharton, Jeffrey H.

1143
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:56,465
Lance Corporal.
8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.

1144
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,929
Lockett...

1145
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,894
...Duane G.

1146
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,187
Corporal.

1147
01:25:12,815 --> 01:25:17,486
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....

1148
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,612
Five-five.

1149
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,450
Your brother was an outstanding Marine.

1150
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,289
He was my friend.

1151
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:34,296
And I miss him every day.

1152
01:25:37,339 --> 01:25:38,840
And you remind me of him.

1153
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,352
None of that matters right now.

1154
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:56,108
Because our duty is to keep
moving forwards, to keep fighting.

1155
01:25:57,276 --> 01:25:58,987
That's how we honour your brother...

1156
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,364
...and Lieutenant Martinez...

1157
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,614
...Corporal Stavrou...

1158
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,827
...Lance Corporal Mottola...

1159
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:07,829
...Hector's father...

1160
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:12,041
...who picked up a rifle and did
what needed to be done. A civilian.

1161
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,628
So we better damn well step it up.

1162
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,880
Discard any lingering doubt.

1163
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:20,050
Work fast, work as a
unit, and we will prevail.

1164
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:22,551
Let's figure out how we're
gonna get out of this.

1165
01:26:22,802 --> 01:26:24,889
Imlay, you come with
me. Get to higher ground.

1166
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,683
The rest of you, find some
ammo and some vehicles.

1167
01:26:27,893 --> 01:26:31,394
Gotta be a few LAV's or armoured
Humvees still operational.

1168
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,482
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.

1169
01:26:38,904 --> 01:26:41,196
You went down fighting.

1170
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,038
Holy shit.

1171
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,248
I wasn't expecting to see all this.

1172
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,585
That don't look good.

1173
01:26:54,836 --> 01:26:56,088
Reinforcements.

1174
01:27:00,384 --> 01:27:02,510
Holy shit.

1175
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,514
They already set up a beachhead.

1176
01:27:07,432 --> 01:27:08,725
All right.

1177
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:14,522
If that evac site is still operational,
I think we can get behind the line.

1178
01:27:14,732 --> 01:27:16,607
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.

1179
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:18,776
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.

1180
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:22,572
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!

1181
01:27:22,782 --> 01:27:25,281
Any station, this net. This
is Foxtrot-Two-November.

1182
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:26,618
We have 11 passengers.

1183
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:31,122
Requesting evacuation at
alternate extraction point Charlie.

1184
01:27:31,332 --> 01:27:33,333
Are there any birds in the air? Over.

1185
01:27:33,543 --> 01:27:37,335
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is
Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.

1186
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:41,632
Get to extraction point Charlie
by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.

1187
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:44,803
Roger that. 0300, not
a minute more. Out.

1188
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:49,266
Imlay, ever see what a
Bushmaster chain gun can do?

1189
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,935
- Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant.
- Get on it, son.

1190
01:27:52,144 --> 01:27:54,145
Let's do this!

1191
01:27:58,152 --> 01:27:59,651
- No lights, Kerns.
- Roger that.

1192
01:28:00,653 --> 01:28:02,279
Let's move.

1193
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:07,117
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.

1194
01:28:07,326 --> 01:28:08,576
Give them hell.

1195
01:28:08,785 --> 01:28:10,286
Damn right.

1196
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,010
Two minutes till that helo drops.

1197
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:28,431
Everybody okay?

1198
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:34,519
All right, Kerns, take a left.

1199
01:28:34,687 --> 01:28:37,940
I want you to go over three blocks,
then you go about five blocks...

1200
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,025
...hang a right, and straight.

1201
01:28:40,276 --> 01:28:43,111
- That should get us to the evac site.
- Yes, staff sergeant.

1202
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,036
- I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett!
- Copy that!

1203
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,705
- We got hostiles.
- What's going on?

1204
01:28:52,915 --> 01:28:55,875
- Let's not wait around and find out.
- It's gonna be okay.

1205
01:28:56,042 --> 01:28:58,877
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.

1206
01:29:06,969 --> 01:29:08,721
Know what they say if you hit a deer?

1207
01:29:08,973 --> 01:29:10,723
- Speed up!
- Damn straight!

1208
01:29:16,396 --> 01:29:17,980
- Come on!
- Y'all hold on!

1209
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:20,734
We're gonna have to
go right through them!

1210
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:28,909
- You saw that?
- They're going down like bowling pins!

1211
01:29:53,351 --> 01:29:54,893
Kick it out!

1212
01:29:55,228 --> 01:29:57,897
Run that sucker over, man!

1213
01:30:00,233 --> 01:30:01,358
Santos, you okay?

1214
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:05,070
I got that nasty stuff
all over my mouth, man!

1215
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:11,451
- It's not funny.
- You let him do you on the first date.

1216
01:30:25,301 --> 01:30:27,969
- Everyone okay?
- Yes!

1217
01:30:29,344 --> 01:30:30,555
Let's get us home.

1218
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:38,980
Cease fire!

1219
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:45,986
- Stay close, stay close!
- What are we doing?

1220
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:53,077
Load them up! Our flight path
won't be clear much longer!

1221
01:30:53,287 --> 01:30:55,246
You're in the middle
of the shit, sergeant!

1222
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,873
What happened to all our air?

1223
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:00,418
Pulled back to save our assets!
They were blowing us out!

1224
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:02,296
We're abandoning Los Angeles!

1225
01:31:12,138 --> 01:31:14,141
Let's go, Imlay!

1226
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:16,184
Son, you okay?

1227
01:31:18,062 --> 01:31:19,438
All right.

1228
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:23,274
Let's move! Move, move!

1229
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:26,486
Come on, Harris, let's go!

1230
01:32:08,488 --> 01:32:09,946
Hold on!

1231
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,536
- You all right?
- Everybody all good?

1232
01:32:14,745 --> 01:32:16,996
- Girls?
- Everybody okay?

1233
01:32:17,205 --> 01:32:18,832
Hold on tight!

1234
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:21,874
What happened?

1235
01:32:22,085 --> 01:32:25,338
Pilot said something was
playing hell with our power!

1236
01:32:25,548 --> 01:32:28,924
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!

1237
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:38,017
Santos, you said you were
tracking massive RF signals?

1238
01:32:38,227 --> 01:32:40,812
Could a concentration
of them knock out power?

1239
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,899
Yes, definitely! Why?

1240
01:32:45,275 --> 01:32:47,651
Could be their
command-and-control centre!

1241
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:52,490
Get me down there!

1242
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:54,117
What?

1243
01:32:55,244 --> 01:32:57,537
I gotta recon that area!

1244
01:32:57,747 --> 01:33:00,039
No way! It's a suicide!

1245
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:04,003
Damn it, we're the only ones left!
All the other forces have fallen back!

1246
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:08,798
We can't land! May not have
power to take off again!

1247
01:33:16,183 --> 01:33:18,559
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.

1248
01:33:19,937 --> 01:33:21,479
Will you get it to her?

1249
01:33:24,815 --> 01:33:26,192
Yeah.

1250
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:34,242
Hover at 40 feet!

1251
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:36,159
- Twenty seconds!
- Roger that!

1252
01:33:40,706 --> 01:33:43,167
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.

1253
01:33:43,376 --> 01:33:45,587
Staff sergeant, what
the hell are you doing?

1254
01:33:45,797 --> 01:33:48,797
We're in the clear!
We're almost home, Imlay!

1255
01:33:49,007 --> 01:33:51,091
You're in charge now!

1256
01:33:51,969 --> 01:33:54,638
You get these civilians home safe!

1257
01:33:58,936 --> 01:34:01,311
You're the bravest Marine
I ever seen, Hector!

1258
01:34:02,728 --> 01:34:04,271
No!

1259
01:34:48,234 --> 01:34:50,278
Everybody, take cover.

1260
01:34:53,322 --> 01:34:54,824
I told you to stay in that helo.

1261
01:34:55,032 --> 01:34:58,534
Civilians are free and clear.
We were worried about your ass.

1262
01:34:58,911 --> 01:35:01,123
I think the command-and-control
asset is nearby.

1263
01:35:01,707 --> 01:35:03,833
Kerns, how many klicks to that blackout?

1264
01:35:04,293 --> 01:35:06,502
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.

1265
01:35:06,712 --> 01:35:08,170
Five klicks. All right.

1266
01:35:08,754 --> 01:35:10,881
We're gonna use this overpass for cover.

1267
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:13,593
If we take out those drones...

1268
01:35:13,803 --> 01:35:17,305
...our military might have a
chance to get back into this fight.

1269
01:35:17,723 --> 01:35:19,307
Santos...

1270
01:35:19,725 --> 01:35:23,393
...where would you put a command and
control asset if you wanted to protect it?

1271
01:35:24,688 --> 01:35:26,439
- Underground.
- Let's go.

1272
01:35:28,109 --> 01:35:31,235
Everybody, let's move.
Come on. Move, move, move.

1273
01:35:56,721 --> 01:35:57,763
Move.

1274
01:36:52,194 --> 01:36:54,946
They must've gone back up.
Just leads up to the street.

1275
01:36:55,154 --> 01:36:58,240
I thought they were leading us
to the command-and-control centre.

1276
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,159
Damn it.

1277
01:37:04,498 --> 01:37:06,666
Let's go. Back.

1278
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,635
Holy shit!

1279
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,347
Santos!

1280
01:37:35,737 --> 01:37:37,612
They know we're here now.

1281
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:50,460
That's their
command-and-control.

1282
01:37:55,967 --> 01:37:58,761
Everybody out now! Move,
move, move! Follow me!

1283
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:02,972
Up here! Up that ladder, go!
Move, move, move! Up that ladder!

1284
01:38:03,807 --> 01:38:06,101
Let's go! Move it up!
Blow that grate, Imlay!

1285
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,730
Move, move, move!

1286
01:38:15,527 --> 01:38:17,280
We're right over their command asset.

1287
01:38:17,781 --> 01:38:22,534
That's it, all right. Let's move the
concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.

1288
01:38:24,705 --> 01:38:25,954
Fire in the hole!

1289
01:38:26,164 --> 01:38:28,499
That should give us a couple minutes.

1290
01:38:44,808 --> 01:38:47,893
Laser target, staff sergeant? We
don't have any more jets, though.

1291
01:38:48,104 --> 01:38:51,231
They can fire ground-to-ground
missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.

1292
01:38:51,398 --> 01:38:53,901
We radio in a strike, paint
the target with the laser.

1293
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:55,777
- Aye-aye, staff
sergeant. -Hoorah.

1294
01:38:55,986 --> 01:38:59,030
Our best chance at radio reception
is on top of that building...

1295
01:38:59,197 --> 01:39:00,615
...but it's the most exposed.

1296
01:39:00,825 --> 01:39:03,284
I'll do it, staff sergeant.
I'll make the call.

1297
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:04,952
Santos, you got those codes?

1298
01:39:05,162 --> 01:39:07,205
Air Force strike package coming up.

1299
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:12,001
You get to high ground. Once you
radio in, they'll track that signal.

1300
01:39:12,211 --> 01:39:13,753
Things are gonna get real hot.

1301
01:39:13,963 --> 01:39:17,298
So once you make that call, you get
the hell out of there, all right?

1302
01:39:17,843 --> 01:39:19,008
You know what that means?

1303
01:39:19,218 --> 01:39:22,387
We're gonna have to hold those
things off till the strike gets here.

1304
01:39:22,596 --> 01:39:24,597
Bingo. Marines...

1305
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:30,271
...we make our stand here. Let those
bastards know who they're fucking with.

1306
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,521
- Retreat....
- Hell!

1307
01:39:31,730 --> 01:39:33,190
Two-Five.

1308
01:39:44,035 --> 01:39:46,371
- Right of the heart, right?
- Right of the heart.

1309
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:49,165
They're gonna be coming
up from there. Take two.

1310
01:39:49,374 --> 01:39:51,750
Plant one there and the
other one on the other side.

1311
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,587
- Keep your head down, get it done.
- Doc, watch your back!

1312
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:56,921
Watch your head! Watch it!

1313
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:13,648
Any station, this is
Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?

1314
01:40:13,857 --> 01:40:16,107
Foxtrot-Two-November,
this is Yankee-Tango, over.

1315
01:40:16,317 --> 01:40:19,820
We have a priority fire mission. We've
located an enemy command centre...

1316
01:40:20,071 --> 01:40:23,534
...under grid 885-342.

1317
01:40:23,743 --> 01:40:26,661
We will be
lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1318
01:40:26,871 --> 01:40:29,289
I say again, we will
be lasing. Code 1-2-0.

1319
01:40:29,498 --> 01:40:32,042
Copy that. Time to
target, three minutes.

1320
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:35,086
Staff sergeant!

1321
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:39,174
We got three minutes! It's
coming in three minutes!

1322
01:40:39,383 --> 01:40:42,219
All right. Let's paint this target.

1323
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,358
Hell of a shot, Kerns!
Get your ass out of there!

1324
01:40:58,151 --> 01:41:00,612
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.

1325
01:41:04,618 --> 01:41:06,576
- Shit!
- Kerns!

1326
01:41:09,538 --> 01:41:11,998
Shit! Shit!

1327
01:41:16,337 --> 01:41:19,090
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now! Move, move!

1328
01:41:19,298 --> 01:41:20,881
Shit.

1329
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:25,762
Contact! Twelve o'clock!

1330
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:28,474
Covering up front!

1331
01:41:28,684 --> 01:41:30,684
- Go, go, go!
- Go on, get in there!

1332
01:41:32,438 --> 01:41:34,229
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!

1333
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:36,940
Right there, right there!

1334
01:41:42,572 --> 01:41:43,906
Got it!

1335
01:41:44,783 --> 01:41:46,618
Sixty seconds left.

1336
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,922
- Lockett!
- Shit!

1337
01:42:02,508 --> 01:42:03,927
Let's go!

1338
01:42:11,477 --> 01:42:13,645
Back in the fight, Santos!

1339
01:42:14,438 --> 01:42:16,272
- Need a little help!
- Covering!

1340
01:42:16,481 --> 01:42:18,525
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!

1341
01:42:18,735 --> 01:42:20,901
- I got it, Doc!
- Covering!

1342
01:42:29,077 --> 01:42:31,746
Where's that goddamn
artillery? Should've hit by now.

1343
01:42:33,249 --> 01:42:34,999
Doc, let's go!

1344
01:42:38,546 --> 01:42:40,962
- Doc?
- Imlay! Imlay!

1345
01:42:49,725 --> 01:42:51,433
Incoming!

1346
01:42:56,815 --> 01:42:58,147
Yes!

1347
01:42:58,983 --> 01:43:01,652
Santos, we got it! We got it!

1348
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:06,574
Direct hit! Direct hit!

1349
01:43:06,741 --> 01:43:08,033
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1350
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,872
Yes, we got it!

1351
01:43:13,374 --> 01:43:15,874
The strike package. It went through?

1352
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:18,877
- It came through?
- Yeah! All right, Kerns!

1353
01:43:20,047 --> 01:43:21,464
It's over.

1354
01:43:38,565 --> 01:43:40,191
It's coming up. It's coming up.

1355
01:43:52,413 --> 01:43:54,873
They're trying to get away.

1356
01:43:59,879 --> 01:44:03,213
The goddamn thing can fly,
staff sergeant. It's flying now!

1357
01:44:03,424 --> 01:44:04,591
I'll get you out!

1358
01:44:12,768 --> 01:44:15,351
We gotta protect the
laser. Come on. Come on!

1359
01:44:17,272 --> 01:44:18,813
Santos!

1360
01:44:29,117 --> 01:44:30,617
Son of a bitch!

1361
01:44:33,163 --> 01:44:36,124
- That hurt!
- Cover me, Lockett!

1362
01:44:41,504 --> 01:44:44,883
The drones are pulling it
away! We gotta take it out now!

1363
01:44:48,511 --> 01:44:50,804
Incoming Copperhead!

1364
01:44:55,519 --> 01:44:58,354
They're using the drone
to protect the ship!

1365
01:45:01,902 --> 01:45:03,651
I'm running low on ammo!

1366
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,277
Santos!

1367
01:45:09,575 --> 01:45:12,618
- How is he?
- He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!

1368
01:45:12,827 --> 01:45:14,955
Crazy bastard. You
should've left me there.

1369
01:45:19,628 --> 01:45:21,127
Covering!

1370
01:45:22,046 --> 01:45:23,253
Grenade!

1371
01:45:30,055 --> 01:45:32,555
- Staff sergeant!
- We are not dying here, Lockett!

1372
01:45:32,807 --> 01:45:34,849
You damn right we're not dying!

1373
01:45:36,352 --> 01:45:38,604
It's getting out of range!
I gotta take it down!

1374
01:45:38,812 --> 01:45:40,814
Doesn't have enough
punch! Save that shot!

1375
01:45:50,407 --> 01:45:52,201
Staff sergeant!

1376
01:45:52,409 --> 01:45:53,701
Lockett, you okay?

1377
01:45:53,912 --> 01:45:55,870
Harris, you're gonna be okay.

1378
01:46:20,272 --> 01:46:22,606
There's the last Copperhead.

1379
01:46:26,444 --> 01:46:29,071
Santos, take out that drone!

1380
01:46:31,449 --> 01:46:33,200
Firing!

1381
01:46:50,136 --> 01:46:51,679
- Yeah!
- We did it!

1382
01:46:53,888 --> 01:46:57,809
We did it!

1383
01:47:03,149 --> 01:47:06,027
I can't believe it worked!

1384
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:13,868
Yeah!

1385
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:15,703
Staff sergeant, you did it!

1386
01:47:17,998 --> 01:47:21,000
There's nothing controlling
the drones anymore!

1387
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:29,424
Marines, on me!

1388
01:47:41,897 --> 01:47:44,398
They're retreating. Advance!

1389
01:48:55,054 --> 01:48:56,930
You guys saved our lives out there!

1390
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,014
Semper Fi, Two-Five!

1391
01:48:59,267 --> 01:49:02,645
- All right, Two-Five!
- Retreat, hell!

1392
01:49:02,854 --> 01:49:05,523
You kicked ass, staff
sarge! Welcome home!

1393
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:09,692
- Move! Move! Move!
- Good work, Marines! Outstanding.

1394
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:12,154
Your civilians are safe.

1395
01:49:12,363 --> 01:49:14,948
Word of how you brought
their ship down...

1396
01:49:15,116 --> 01:49:17,827
...is going out to
every army in every city.

1397
01:49:18,036 --> 01:49:22,038
We're mustering up whatever troops
we can get and going back in.

1398
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:24,332
So get out of that gear.

1399
01:49:24,917 --> 01:49:26,127
Get some chow in you.

1400
01:49:26,587 --> 01:49:28,463
There's breakfast in the tent.

1401
01:49:28,672 --> 01:49:32,090
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.

1402
01:50:20,557 --> 01:50:22,059
- Get some smoke, Imlay.
- Got you.

1403
01:50:22,267 --> 01:50:24,479
Got grenades over here. Anybody need?

1404
01:50:24,687 --> 01:50:28,898
- Got frag rounds coming down.
- Imlay, I think you could use this.

1405
01:50:29,107 --> 01:50:32,026
- Got it. HE rounds.
- I need a couple more magazines.

1406
01:50:32,236 --> 01:50:34,487
- Very nice, very nice.
- Everybody got ammo?

1407
01:50:34,697 --> 01:50:36,156
Yes, staff sergeant.

1408
01:50:36,574 --> 01:50:39,076
What do you think you're
doing, staff sergeant?

1409
01:50:39,868 --> 01:50:42,120
We already had breakfast, sir.

1410
01:50:51,215 --> 01:50:53,048
I'll be borrowing this, sir.

1411
01:50:53,298 --> 01:50:54,717
Carry on.

1412
01:50:55,845 --> 01:50:57,886
- Retreat, hell!
- Hoorah!

1413
01:50:59,055 --> 01:51:01,057
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?

1414
01:51:01,308 --> 01:51:03,559
Morning, Bullpen. Dog
Pound 2-1, on your left.

1415
01:51:03,727 --> 01:51:05,769
Good to hear a friendly
voice, Dog Pound 2-1.

1416
01:51:05,937 --> 01:51:07,897
Liberty 1-1, Snake
Eyes joining the fight.

1417
01:51:08,064 --> 01:51:09,815
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1,
we're on your six.

1418
01:51:09,983 --> 01:51:12,067
- Morning, Dog Pound 2-1.
- Eagle on your right.

1419
01:51:12,235 --> 01:51:16,530
This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Let's take back Los Angeles.
