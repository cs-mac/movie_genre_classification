1
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,501
We're ready, boss.

2
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,043
You can go.

3
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,709
Move, let's move the cars.

4
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,751
Let's go.

5
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:43,126
Move, let's move the cars.
Let's go!

6
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,459
- Mum?
-Hello!

7
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,668
- Can you hear me?
-Is it you, my son?

8
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,168
- Yes, it's me!
-I can't hear you.

9
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:56,168
- Now you hear me?
-Yes, yes! Now it's better.

10
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,918
I want to pray with you.

11
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,918
<i>You do the introduction.</i>

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,168
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

13
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:15,168
Tomorrow I'll go to jail

14
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:19,376
and I'm scared
you'll abandon me, my Lord.

15
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:23,668
And that you might not understand
my actions.

16
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:28,543
I just want to remind you
that everything I do,

17
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,376
I do out of love of my family,

18
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,251
to protect them
from all evil and danger.

19
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,376
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

20
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:44,334
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

21
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,168
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

22
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,168
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

23
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:57,251
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

24
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:59,959
now, and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

25
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,001
- Good evening.
-Good evening, Pablo.

26
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,293
We are all family, right?

27
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,126
Have a seat.

28
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,334
Nico, sit over there.

29
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,501
Well...

30
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,959
I've made a deal with the Government.

31
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:40,251
Tomorrow,
I'll surrender to the authorities.

32
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:45,251
I'll be in jail... for a while.

33
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,626
Till things get quiet again.

34
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,793
I've called you all in person
because I need the help...

35
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:58,626
of the people I trust the most.

36
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:04,084
Our job is to hide our economic power

37
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,918
from our enemies.

38
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,084
And this treasure is the life

39
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,376
and the future
of our families and children.

40
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,084
And we'll be the only ones to know

41
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,751
where it's hidden.

42
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,793
So...

43
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,709
the question is:

44
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:30,168
are you ready to help me?

45
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,209
- I am, Pablo.
-We're family.

46
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:36,876
- Till death, patron.
-Whatever may come.

47
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,959
And you, Nico?

48
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,376
Me too.

49
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,709
Very good.

50
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:53,126
Reach hands.

51
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,918
One, two, three! Let's do!

52
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,209
Lights!

53
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:08,043
Heavy metal, the workers can come out.

54
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:10,251
Come on, people!

55
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,126
Pepito,
you're gonna be in the first car.

56
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,418
Alfonso,
you're gonna be in the second car.

57
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,626
Nico, the third one.

58
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,584
Ricardo, in the fourth.

59
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,043
Felipe, you're in the fifth.
And Juan, in the sixth.

60
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,793
Group One,
load the trucks as fast as possible.

61
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:04,084
- Take these. Water too.
-Thank you

62
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:07,168
Boy, take care.

63
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:09,043
May God be with you.

64
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,834
I see you've got two sandwiches.

65
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,251
Yes.

66
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:12,543
<i>And you will say setenta y dos.</i>

67
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,626
<i>Setenta y dos...</i>

68
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:41,918
Good luck.

69
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:11,543
- That's for all:
-20,000 pesos for transport.

70
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,001
In this car.

71
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,834
Guys, when I will tell you,

72
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,168
pull at the same time.

73
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,709
The truck don't go.

74
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:44,584
Good, Ricardo.

75
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:49,668
Eso. That's good.

76
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:38,959
Go with him.

77
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,626
Let it down!

78
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,251
Take that shit down.

79
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,626
Wake up! Get up!

80
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:23,834
- Get up, get up, get up! Everybody up!
-Get up.

81
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,293
Wake up! Wake up!

82
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,459
Come here.

83
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:44,084
Come here.

84
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:47,543
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

85
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:50,334
You think you can come to my woods

86
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,084
and do as you like, or what?

87
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:56,334
They told me

88
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:59,459
that this doesn't belong to anyone.

89
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:00,834
What?

90
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,418
This place is mine.

91
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,376
Everything around here is mine.

92
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,918
If you want to do something here...

93
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,543
Business...

94
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,168
Come to the village.

95
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:29,251
Ask for the Rolando brothers.

96
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,584
Everyone knows who we are.

97
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,793
All right.

98
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,959
All right.

99
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:42,334
Move forward, sissy!

100
00:18:44,793 --> 00:18:45,918
Let's move.

101
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,376
Thank you.

102
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,709
Special greeting

103
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:28,668
for the young people of this town.

104
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:32,126
I'm thankful

105
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,376
to all the people

106
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:37,251
who have helped

107
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,876
renovating this clinic.

108
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:51,126
This hospital...

109
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,001
This hospital

110
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,876
is but one small step

111
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:59,459
towards the life you deserve.

112
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:08,001
I'm proud

113
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:10,251
of my humble origins.

114
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,959
My family never had great means.

115
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:15,918
And we experienced

116
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:19,293
the same problems most Colombian
families are faced with daily.

117
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,293
I promise you...

118
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,293
I promise you
that if I can do anything

119
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,876
I'll keep fighting for your rights.

120
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:38,793
Civismo en marcha
will provide you with a shield

121
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,668
that will protect you from all evil.

122
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,543
Thank you very much!

123
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:53,543
People from Turbo,

124
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,251
once more let's thank

125
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,376
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.

126
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:28,959
Come on!

127
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,668
Why didn't you come over?

128
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,834
This jacket... with these pants.

129
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:25,668
- If it fits big, I'll fix it.
-Thank you.

130
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,376
Can I help you, Sir?

131
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,959
No, you can't.

132
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:45,793
Gringo,

133
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,293
get out.

134
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,543
Come here.

135
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:36,418
Stop it! Please stop it,
it's going to kill him!

136
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,376
Stop it, it's going to kill him!
Stop it, it's going to kill him!

137
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,584
- Hi!
-What's up, bonita?

138
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:25,959
Juanita! Your dress is beautiful!

139
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:27,584
This is Nick.

140
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:30,793
Nice meeting you.
Maria's spoken so much about you.

141
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:36,918
So nice to see you!

142
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,543
- You're so elegant!
-How are you?

143
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:43,001
Now I need your attention.
This is my boyfriend Nick.

144
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,334
See you later.

145
00:30:58,501 --> 00:30:59,168
Aunt!

146
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:02,959
- Aunt!
-I was looking for you.

147
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,876
- This is Nick.
-Nice meeting you. You've had lunch?

148
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:09,626
- Yes. Where is Pablo?
-Over here, in the water.

149
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,001
Can we go say hi?

150
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:16,168
I'll ask him. I'll be right back.

151
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,376
Pablo, go get dressed.

152
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:29,084
Maria wants to introduce
her boyfriend to you.

153
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,793
Come over, Maria love, come!

154
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:44,751
- Hi Maria!
-Hi prince, how are you?

155
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:45,668
OK.

156
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,793
- Did you have a good flight?
-Very good.

157
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:51,043
- Happy birthday, uncle Pablo!
-Thank you.

158
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:57,334
At last, Pablo, this is Nick.

159
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,918
- Hi. Welcome, Nick.
-Thank you.

160
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:06,918
- Does he speak Colombian?
-No. No, English.

161
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,251
Maria, show him around the house

162
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:20,376
and introduce him to Grandma.

163
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,751
- Go, go see Grandma.
-We're going to now, Pablo.

164
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:38,168
We are so proud that Maria
opened up a clinic for the poor.

165
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,459
She's adorable.

166
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:16,293
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

167
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:20,418
<i>Happy birthday to you,</i>

168
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:49,543
Hey to Pablo!

169
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,418
A Speech!

170
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,709
<i>In the sky</i>

171
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,376
<i>fly the clouds</i>

172
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:21,876
<i>going toward the sea.</i>

173
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:30,668
<i>God, how I love you.</i>

174
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:35,168
<i>I cannot...</i>

175
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,751
<i>embrace...</i>

176
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:48,209
<i>so much happiness,</i>

177
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:51,001
True love.

178
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:53,334
True love.

179
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,543
True love.

180
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,084
- Good night.
-Good night.

181
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:17,668
Light, camera, action!

182
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,959
Now a big round of applause

183
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:18,084
to the new member
of the Escobar Gaviria family.

184
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,168
Come on.

185
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:35,668
- Good morning, Carmen.
-Good morning, Nick.

186
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:38,084
- Daniela.
-Good morning, Nick.

187
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,251
Nico, come!

188
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,126
He's dead, Luis.

189
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,251
Luis, get ready!

190
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:46,168
What are you doing? It's sunday.

191
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,376
Nick,
there's no one there to help you!

192
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,918
Watch out!

193
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:28,584
- Who's that?
-Nick. Maria's boyfriend.

194
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:39,459
Finish it off.

195
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,334
At last we meet, Nick.
It's a pleasure.

196
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,709
I know Maria
since she was a little kid.

197
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:31,959
Bambi, get me the boss.
We have a problem.

198
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,084
No fear, Nico, no fear.

199
00:46:11,084 --> 00:46:13,251
<i>Feind hiort mit.</i>

200
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:32,959
Please be careful with those frames,
put them here.

201
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:35,751
<i>It's the biggest corruption scandal
in the history of Congress.</i>

202
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:38,251
<i>Senator Pablo Escobar has been found</i>

203
00:49:38,418 --> 00:49:41,001
<i>to have a criminal record
as a drug dealer.</i>

204
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:42,584
<i>This operation</i>

205
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:45,293
<i>is having significant results</i>

206
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:49,043
so we need to have the national
public and armed forces support it.

207
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:53,126
<i>This will give you
an idea of the magnitude</i>

208
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:56,751
<i>of the narco trafficking problem
we have in this country.</i>

209
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:07,376
First, the Minister of Justice
lied when he said that...

210
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:11,126
Pablo Escobar had a criminal record
in the United States.

211
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:13,626
- Hello, Nick.
-Hello.

212
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:14,918
Hello, Nico.

213
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:58,126
- Are you done with the cash?
-lt's all done boss.

214
00:52:58,293 --> 00:53:01,001
<i>Let's go! Let's go, chiquitin!</i>

215
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:08,876
<i>The assassination of the Minister
of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilia</i>

216
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:11,751
<i>has Colombia
on the verge of a civil war.</i>

217
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:14,293
<i>These are chilling words
from Pablo Escobar's last interview.</i>

218
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:17,668
<i>The Minister of Justice
lied to the country six times.</i>

219
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:21,126
<i>He said he wasn't going to resign.</i>

220
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:23,543
Let's see what happens
in the next few days.

221
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:27,918
<i>Everyone who opposes Pablo Escobar</i>

222
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,376
<i>is a potential target
of his assassins.</i>

223
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:32,834
<i>The epidemic of violence
is unprecedented.</i>

224
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,834
<i>Innocent people</i>

225
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:37,043
<i>are getting caught
in the crossfire.</i>

226
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:40,709
<i>American forces have now joined
the biggest manhunt</i>

227
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:44,209
<i>in Colombia's history
for the drug Lord.</i>

228
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:47,501
<i>Escobar,
confronting this new threat,</i>

229
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:49,793
<i>responds with
a brutal wave of terror.</i>

230
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:53,418
<i>The cartel will soon pay
for their crimes.</i>

231
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:56,418
<i>Escobar and his allies
are an enemy of the state.</i>

232
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:43,126
Dad!

233
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:26,751
Boys, try these delicious beans
that Maria made for patron.

234
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:31,918
It's Ramirez.

235
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:37,459
Dursi, how are you?

236
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:40,709
All set.

237
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:42,751
Boys, we have to get going.

238
00:55:50,834 --> 00:55:52,001
I'll call you later.

239
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:29,084
This son of a bitch.

240
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:12,251
It's because
they're hitting like goats.

241
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,584
Camillo,
can you come help me with this?

242
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:16,793
Sure.

243
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,793
Nick, we forgot the salt.

244
01:01:43,918 --> 01:01:45,959
You want melons?

245
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:47,918
- Take some.
-No, thank you.

246
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:51,751
Two for 80 pesos.
Take them, they're delicious.

247
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:53,084
Take them.

248
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:58,543
Take them, take them. Take them.

249
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:11,626
Take them. They're delicious.

250
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:14,043
No, no, no, thank you.

251
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:16,084
Ok then.

252
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,168
Melons!

253
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:40,334
Let's go! Come on! Start the car.

254
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:43,418
Start the car, brother.
What are you waiting for?

255
01:02:48,418 --> 01:02:49,751
I'm Martin.

256
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:56,084
He can't come. I'm Martin.

257
01:03:33,918 --> 01:03:35,959
Don't look. Don't look!

258
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:46,084
Don't move, understand?

259
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,334
It's not working.

260
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:12,959
This phone never worked.

261
01:04:13,168 --> 01:04:15,709
If you have another one,
it's very important.

262
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:21,668
Follow me. It's here.

263
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:29,251
- This way.
-Thank you.

264
01:05:29,376 --> 01:05:30,584
Everything okay?

265
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:38,751
The number is 72.

266
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:44,126
We have to go this way. 72. That's it.

267
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,293
Let's go.

268
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:27,668
If I had been driving, we would have
been here like an hour ago.

269
01:07:27,834 --> 01:07:30,459
But you're driving
like you're scared or something.

270
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:32,376
Well whatever, there's your cave.

271
01:07:32,543 --> 01:07:35,293
But I know these mountains
like the back of my hand

272
01:07:35,459 --> 01:07:39,209
and you're driving like one or two
kilometers per hour, you feel me?

273
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:42,209
Hey, here it is, 72.

274
01:07:57,709 --> 01:08:00,001
It's nicely done.

275
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:11,959
Brother, it's almost time to eat.

276
01:08:12,126 --> 01:08:13,501
Es que hay hungry.

277
01:08:14,668 --> 01:08:17,376
<i>Mi wife prepare very good food.</i>

278
01:08:22,918 --> 01:08:23,793
Yes, of course.

279
01:08:24,459 --> 01:08:26,293
Of course, brother.

280
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:30,959
This is my wife, Estrella.

281
01:08:31,918 --> 01:08:33,668
And my son, Martin Junior.

282
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:30,959
They're heavy, no?

283
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:44,084
All right.
I'm going to set the dynamite

284
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:46,251
and the cable.

285
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,459
Come on, let's go.

286
01:12:30,959 --> 01:12:32,876
Come on, let's go.

287
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,293
Why?

288
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:41,834
This... is a lot of money.

289
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,418
A lot of money for you
and your family.

290
01:13:50,168 --> 01:13:52,043
I knew it, brother.

291
01:13:53,376 --> 01:13:56,418
There's treasure in those boxes, huh?

292
01:14:00,209 --> 01:14:02,209
How am I supposed to forget this?
This is a treasure.

293
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:29,959
Why do you want me to leave ltuango?

294
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:33,209
I don't want to leave ltuango.

295
01:14:39,918 --> 01:14:41,334
No, I can't leave here.

296
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:43,959
I can't leave ltuango.

297
01:14:46,209 --> 01:14:49,959
Thanks, but there's no way.

298
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:51,751
Keep them.

299
01:14:54,876 --> 01:14:56,834
Thank you.

300
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:00,751
With this,

301
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,043
I'll buy my son

302
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:05,959
some really nice clothes.

303
01:15:07,793 --> 01:15:11,251
And for my wife,
I'm going to buy her a huge bed.

304
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:13,543
So she'll feel like a princess.

305
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:17,001
Thank you.

306
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:23,584
You sure?

307
01:15:29,293 --> 01:15:30,376
Alright.

308
01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:34,584
Finally I'm going to drive.

309
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:43,543
With this,
I'll even get myself a gift.

310
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:46,293
Maybe even buy myself a car one day.

311
01:17:19,043 --> 01:17:20,334
Left.

312
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:27,168
Let's

313
01:17:47,043 --> 01:17:47,751
Right.

314
01:18:02,543 --> 01:18:05,668
- Where is your house?
-This is my house.

315
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:10,001
- Do you have a phone?
-No, but there's one in the hotel.

316
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:24,084
Yeah, I found him on the street

317
01:18:24,293 --> 01:18:27,626
and you know
how his wife is really sick.

318
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:32,043
Yeah, his wife is real sick
and he's real sad.

319
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:33,334
Yes.

320
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,209
- Yes, please.
-Well then, I'll call you later.

321
01:18:38,668 --> 01:18:40,084
You can use the phone.

322
01:18:40,626 --> 01:18:41,626
Thank you.

323
01:18:58,751 --> 01:18:59,668
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

324
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:35,584
Martin de la Pena Vasquez.

325
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:38,709
At last we meet. A pleasure.

326
01:20:47,418 --> 01:20:48,834
Where's the gringo?

327
01:20:49,876 --> 01:20:51,959
If you tell me, I'll let you live.

328
01:20:52,126 --> 01:20:54,293
So you can give your family
a decent funeral.

329
01:20:55,334 --> 01:20:57,001

Hello. Who's there?

334

"When Mowgli stopped to rest,

335

a happy bear wandered over,

01:22:26,043 --> 01:22:27,126
named Baloo.

337
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:29,876
Baloo figured that the elephant

01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:32,126
-had much to learn..."
-Excuse me, patron.

339
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:38,543
There's a little problem
with the Canadian.

340
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:40,584
He never made it to the restaurant.

341
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,834
Darling, you know who's calling?

342
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:06,793
Nick, Maria's boyfriend.
Do you want to talk to him?

343
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:09,084
Ask him where he is. And tell him

344
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:12,543
we thought we lost him in the jungle,
like Mowgli.

345
01:23:15,834 --> 01:23:19,334
<i>where are you? You got lost
in the jungle lost like Mowgli?</i>

346
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:22,334
No. I'm not lost.
Can I speak with your dad, please?

347
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:24,709
We're drawing
the animal from the hacienda

348
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,793
And I'm going to draw you too.

349
01:23:35,293 --> 01:23:37,209
What's up, Nico? Everything good?

350
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:48,626
Yes.

351
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:50,793
The man is not coming
to the restaurant.

352

<i>Cap y, Drago.</i>

354

Get out of there and come over here.

01:25:27,001 --> 01:25:28,543
- Please, help me.
-The way out is back there.

356
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,751
- Open.
-The exit is back there.

357
01:25:48,959 --> 01:25:50,959
Where the hell are you going?
There's no exit over there.

358
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:52,543
Hey, what's wrong with you?

359
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:41,001
- Have you seen the gringo?
-Yes.

360
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:43,293
- How long ago?
-He left this way a minute ago.

361
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:45,584
Sit down and don't move.

362
01:27:49,418 --> 01:27:53,126
The man is nearby.
Go check the houses over there.

363

<i>Allo? Patron.</i>

364
01:28:00,918 --> 01:28:03,251
He escaped
when I was about to catch him.

365
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:08,834
I'm going to ask the police for help.

366
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:17,168
Don't worry, patron. Trust us.
He's not going to escape us.

367
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:27,001
Don't worry.

368
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:36,001
I've already checked the car.

369
01:28:36,168 --> 01:28:38,584
Go check the hotel,
the houses on the block.

370
01:28:42,251 --> 01:28:43,251
Get going!

371
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:50,251
Captain, this is Drago Gutierrez.

372
01:28:50,418 --> 01:28:53,293
I need a few men here
to close a perimeter around ltuango.

373
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:58,751
Send quite a few men. To return
the favor to the boss, is that clear?

374
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:04,584
We're looking for a gringo!

375
01:29:06,043 --> 01:29:07,209
He's dangerous!

376
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:11,668
This gringo is an enemy
of Pablo Escobar!

377
01:29:14,168 --> 01:29:15,459
Don't hide him!

378
01:29:18,043 --> 01:29:19,709
Don't help the gringo!

379
01:29:21,876 --> 01:29:24,334
If he gets into your house,
get him out.

380
01:29:25,918 --> 01:29:29,376
This gringo is an enemy
of Pablo Escobar!

381
01:30:27,209 --> 01:30:29,459
Come on, let's go!

382
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:05,751
Good afternoon, captain.

383
01:31:07,084 --> 01:31:08,959
He's hiding out somewhere around here.

384
01:31:09,126 --> 01:31:10,626
We'll look for him.

385
01:31:10,918 --> 01:31:14,459
- We have to find him, and kill him.
-Ok, we'll kill him.

386
01:31:15,043 --> 01:31:17,126
Look in that house over there.

387
01:31:17,293 --> 01:31:20,418
Over here, and up there.
Hurry before he escapes.

388
01:31:27,793 --> 01:31:30,043
You are the man of the family.

389
01:31:30,209 --> 01:31:32,584
Your priority is to take care
of your mom

390
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:36,334
-and your little sister.
-Yes, sir.

391
01:31:38,918 --> 01:31:40,168
For you, Papa-

392
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:49,043
Take care of yourself.
You know that we need you.

393
01:31:49,209 --> 01:31:51,584
Don't worry, my love.

394
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:53,751
The hard part is over.

395
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:57,626
I'll be safe, don't worry.

396
01:31:58,793 --> 01:32:00,334
You look nice in that.

397
01:32:15,334 --> 01:32:17,293
I'll call you when I'm inside.

398
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,793
Please do.

401
01:33:02,584 --> 01:33:04,834
What happened to Bambi
when he crossed the street?

402
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:07,793
- He got run over.
-Affirmative.

403

Affirmative.

I will ask the Lord

456
01:48:10,626 --> 01:48:13,834
When you talk to God,

457
01:48:14,001 --> 01:48:15,709
the Almighty,

458
01:48:17,209 --> 01:48:19,876
remind Him how much I do
for His church...

459
01:48:20,918 --> 01:48:23,418
and for the poor of Medellin.

460
01:48:23,626 --> 01:48:25,251
And tell Him

461
01:48:26,043 --> 01:48:29,543
that today I saw my family
for the first time

462
01:48:29,709 --> 01:48:32,709
after months of solitude and distress.

463
01:48:33,793 --> 01:48:36,418
And I probably won't see them
for a long time.

464
01:48:40,959 --> 01:48:43,793
He seems a bit distracted lately.

465
01:48:53,001 --> 01:48:56,126
You tell Him, Father,

466
01:48:56,293 --> 01:49:00,293
that I'll have a powerful telescope...

467
01:49:02,459 --> 01:49:04,793
pointed to the sky.

468
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:08,001
And from time to time,

469
01:49:08,168 --> 01:49:10,959
when I'll remember His existence,

470
01:49:12,209 --> 01:49:17,126
I, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

471
01:49:17,293 --> 01:49:19,376
will keep my eye on Him.

472
01:49:22,834 --> 01:49:25,418
Forgive me, Father.

473
01:49:28,876 --> 01:49:30,501
And God bless you.

474
01:51:11,543 --> 01:51:12,918
Help!

475
01:51:18,751 --> 01:51:20,668
