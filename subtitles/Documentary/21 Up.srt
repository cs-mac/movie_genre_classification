1
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,871
Hey, Melodie.

2
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,624
- Hey.
- Look, I know

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,257
we've known each other
for a really long time.

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,723
And we live across the street
from each other and stuff.

5
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,012
And...

6
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,937
I know, like, in four days,

7
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,686
I'm sure, if...

8
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,142
- You know, prom's, like, in four days...
- Oh, my God.

9
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,068
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

10
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,701
Fuck, no.

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,653
No, I... No, I just...

12
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:07,241
- You're probably going with someone.
- I'm sorry.

13
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,076
I don't know how to put this nicely.

14
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,627
There's not a nice way to put it.

15
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,170
You're a fucking nerd.

16
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,044
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,047
Look at her. Look at her.

18
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,546
- Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.
- I'll see you later.

19
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,885
- Bye.
- All right, buddy, good talk.

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,466
Dude, classic.

21
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,971
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.

22
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,772
- Shit.
- Good luck, bro.

23
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,974
I said loud and clear,

24
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,403
if you didn't get your grades up,
you weren't going to the prom.

25
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,277
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,241
I should pay who?

27
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,489
You're not going to the prom.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,821
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

29
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,290
But I'm going to be prom king.

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,334
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,045
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,397
Fuck! Fuck!

33
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,998
Welcome to the Police Academy.

34
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,452
Make sure your form is completely filled out,
then move along.

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,458
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

36
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,139
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,924
Oh, fuck!

38
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,097
- You're good at this, huh?
- Yeah, I am.

39
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,180
Thank you.

40
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,942
Such bullshit.

41
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,564
You're really good at this.

42
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,612
Yeah, I am.

43
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,194
Hey, you want to be friends?

44
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,870
Come on. Come on, let's go.

45
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,710
Come on, pick your knees up.
Pick your knees up.

46
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,789
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

47
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,297
Chill, all right?
Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

48
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,174
What did I tell you?
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

49
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,180
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

50
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,803
Faster. Let's go.

51
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,312
Clear!

52
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,103
Clear!

53
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,189
Come on, come on, come on! Stop.

54
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,819
Yes! Yes!

55
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,279
Let me see. Let me see.

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,535
Nice.

57
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,452
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,290
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

59
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,626
Get ready for a lifetime
of being badass motherfuckers.

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,052
I am.

61
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,436
I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,

62
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,643
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

63
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,982
Do you guys really think
this is a police matter?

64
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,233
To get your Frisbee back?

65
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,737
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,401
Shit.

67
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,537
Shit! Shit!

68
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,990
Yours isn't loaded, right?

69
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,201
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

70
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,660
What, you... No.

71
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,336
That's no fun. Come on.

72
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,004
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

73
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,252
It's right there.

74
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,379
- Don't you... Don't...
- Don't. Stop it.

75
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,428
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

76
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,300
You feel like a big shot?

77
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,762
No fucking way.

78
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,768
One Percenters?

79
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,932
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

80
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,016
If we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,317
You see what I see?

82
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,270
Cannabis sativa.

83
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,530
Chaka Khan.

84
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,734
Chaka Khan?

85
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,424
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

86
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,880
Have we forgotten
that the use of marijuana is illegal?

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,515
I have glaucoma.

88
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,968
I get nervous in crowds.

89
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,268
Herpes.

90
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,432
Then you won't mind
if I search your bike, now, would you?

91
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,900
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

92
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,778
- Get up.
- Cálmate, gringo.

93
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,404
Man, you guys even real cops?
You look like the kids on Halloween.

94
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,033
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,498
I know, right? I know.

96
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,366
It's hilarious.

97
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,918
So why don't you show us a little respect?

98
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,461
- Fuck you, pig.
- Hey.

99
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,164
You want me to beat your dick off?

100
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,294
You want to beat my dick off?

101
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,216
I'll beat your dick off with both hands.
What's up? Let's go.

102
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,260
- That's weird, man.
- I think what he was trying to say was,

103
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,930
he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area

104
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,133
that your dick's just going to fall off.

105
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,558
Why do you have salt in your...

106
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,557
- That's actual drugs.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,263
Get on the ground! Hey!

108
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,973
- Come here now!
- What do I do?

109
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,808
- Chase someone!
- Chase someone?

110
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,690
Are you leaving your bike here?

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,278
Okay. All right.

112
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,982
Don't run from me!
You're making it worse for yourself!

113
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,409
No! Get out of the way!

114
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,736
Stop!

115
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,036
I'm going to shoot you
if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

116
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,581
Hey! Come here!

117
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,163
I'm not playing anymore! I'm so not kidding!

118
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,122
I got him. I got him.

119
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,422
Freeze! Freeze!

120
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,641
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

121
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,351
That's it! Come here!

122
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,851
Freeze! Stop it!

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,230
You're a pussy!

124
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,119
You got the right to... Give me that!
You got the right to...

125
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,538
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

126
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,240
My elbow.

127
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,288
- You got nothing.
- How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

128
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,244
- Hey! Hey!
- How's it feel? How's it feel now?

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,955
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

130
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,457
We got one! I got him!

131
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,214
Yes! Yes!

132
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,885
- Yeah!
- We got an arrest!

133
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,305
- Yeah! We got him!
- Yes!

134
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,887
- Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
- Fuck you! Yeah!

135
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,014
What's up?

136
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:48,476
Drop my nuts
on your motherfucking forehead!

137
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,811
- That's right.
- Fuck you, park!

138
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,691
- We arrest people now!
- What up, park?

139
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,398
- What's up? What's up?
- What up, park? Who wants one?

140
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,498
Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

141
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,292
- Thank you, Cinnamon.
- Are those new?

142
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,878
The department was forced
to drop the charges

143
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,672
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda rights.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,049
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

145
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,300
you have to do when arresting someone?

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,300
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

147
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,516
- Do you even know the Miranda rights?
- Yes.

148
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,472
Let's hear them, then.

149
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,603
You got a lot of stuff to do.

150
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,650
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

151
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,818
We got time.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,404
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

153
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,734
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,

154
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,409
for a total of 57 words.

155
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,740
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with,
"You have the right to remain silent."

156
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,826
I know you've heard this before. And then,

157
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,413
I think it sounds something like...

158
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,796
- "You have the right to an attorney."
- Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

159
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,468
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

160
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,592
Did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?

161
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,301
You do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.

162
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,510
Where were you?

163
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,105
I was chasing my perp, sir.

164
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,023
And how did that go for you?

165
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,693
Honestly, he did get away,

166
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,603
and he threw me down pretty hard.

167
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,859
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

168
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,066
Can I see that?

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,618
Yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,155
Wow.

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,823
Fortunately for you two,

172
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,661
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s

173
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,416
and revamping it for modern times.

174
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,792
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

175
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,091
Iack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,

176
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,963
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

177
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,888
and expect us all not to notice.

178
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,181
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

179
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,978
immature-seeming officers.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,649
Sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,

181
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,602
a child sex slavery ring or something?

182
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,281
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

183
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,113
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

184
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,285
I think you idiots are perfect.

185
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,825
You're officially transferred.

186
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,452
- All right. Yeah.
- That's great.

187
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,249
Where should we report to?

188
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,951
Down on Jump Street.

189
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,911
37 Jump Street.

190
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,131
No, that doesn't sound right.

191
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,420
Is it...

192
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,220
This has got to be a joke.

193
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,131
This is it.

194
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,474
Aroma of Christ Church?

195
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,497
How's it going?

196
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,706
This place is weird.

197
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,552
Everybody comfortable?

198
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,304
Yeah.

199
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,192
Get your motherfucking ass up
when I'm talking!

200
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,480
You will be going undercover
as high school students.

201
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,569
You are here simply because you look young.

202
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,661
You some Justin Beaver,

203
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,581
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

204
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,119
Captain Sassy.

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,875
I know what you're thinking,

206
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,579
"Angry Black Captain."

207
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,256
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

208
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,709
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

209
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,044
I'm black.

210
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,222
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

211
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,888
And sometimes I get angry.

212
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,516
So suck a dick!

213
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,768
What I'm trying to show you is,

214
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,936
embrace your stereotypes.

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,024
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

216
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,688
And he's probably a dummy.

217
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,944
And then this guy.

218
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,073
He's short and insecure.

219
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,699
And he's probably good with money.

220
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,122
- You are good with money.
- What the fuck?

221
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,621
Didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?

222
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,247
I don't... I actually didn't...

223
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,544
I didn't get a letter or anything.

224
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,338
- Yeah, like, a start time...
- With a dress code or anything like that.

225
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,212
Teenage the fuck up!

226
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,588
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

227
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,340
Do not get expelled.

228
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,472
Nobody in the system knows you're here.
All right? Nobody.

229
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,144
You get kicked out of school,

230
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,894
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of Jump Street.

231
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,725
Rule number two. Burns.

232
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,405
Do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.

233
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,108
You hear that? That's you.

234
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,905
- Don't do it, man.
- Why...

235
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,612
- Keep that dirty dick in your pants.
- Dirty?

236
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,413
Don't fuck no students.

237
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,077
Don't fuck no teachers.

238
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,627
Sir, I know we come off
as a couple of lady-killers,

239
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,877
but I promise you
we will be super professional on the job.

240
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,424
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties.

241
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,756
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

242
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,179
I was talking to your partner over here.

243
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,222
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

244
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,266
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

245
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,514
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

246
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,061
- I'm talking to you.
- Cool.

247
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,682
Now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.

248
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,937
Right now!

249
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,609
Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.

250
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,275
So I bought these,

251
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,608
Which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right noW.

252
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,279
Cheers.

253
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,657
It's a new synthetic drug.

254
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,911
Goes by the street name H. F.S.

255
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,957
Holy fucking shit.

256
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,619
Holy...

257
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,795
They put this on the Internet
for everybody to see?

258
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,544
They're teenagers, man.
They're really stupid.

259
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,466
So you should blend right in.

260
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,812
Jessica, Will you go to prom With me?
But I already knoW the ansWer. It's yes.

261
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,709
I could watch this kid all day.

262
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,370
Man, this kid rules.

263
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,834
Ruled.

264
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,167
His parents found him OD'd
in his room a few days ago.

265
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,547
He's dead.

266
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,177
Whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.

267
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,351
And as you can see, this kid is white.

268
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,186
That means people actually give a shit.

269
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,225
Sir, I just want to throw out to you
that I would give a shit if he was black.

270
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:52,073
Right now, H.F.S.
is contained right there at Sagan High.

271
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,444
Now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.

272
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,240
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

273
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,292
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

274
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,415
Iike photography and drama.

275
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,918
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

276
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,749
Find out who's slinging this shit.

277
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,085
Schmidt, says you were a virgin

278
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,716
- through high school.
- It says that?

279
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,554
No. I just assumed it,

280
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:20,931
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.

281
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,351
It's the Juggling Society,
but it's fine. It's fine.

282
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,808
They're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.

283
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,019
That's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.

284
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,646
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

285
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,699
Here's your new identities, all right?

286
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,616
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

287
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,486
The mission is this.

288
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,993
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

289
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,914
We get to be brothers?

290
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,085
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

291
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,788
But if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.

292
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,625
God damn.
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

293
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,688
Hey, Korean Jesus.

294
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:14,447
I don't know if you only cater
to Korean Christians

295
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,693
or if you even exist. No offense.

296
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,201
I just...

297
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,002
I'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.

298
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,467
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

299
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:40,466
I know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe I'm not the best cop.

300
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,135
Korean Jesus,
I just really don't want to fuck this up.

301
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,808
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

302
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,482
The end?

303
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,935
I don't really know how to end a prayer.
The end?

304
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,190
Yeah.

305
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,860
Hey! Hey!

306
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,325
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

307
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,823
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

308
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,453
With Korean shit.

309
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,036
- You two get to your mama house ASAP.
- What?

310
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,796
You're teenagers now, all right?

311
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,090
You two are staying
at Schmidt's parents' house

312
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,883
for the duration of this assignment.

313
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,336
Fuck me.

314
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,047
This house is adorable.

315
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,762
My baby's home! Come here.

316
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,468
You will always be
my infant angel baby child.

317
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,269
There's my guy.

318
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,937
It's great to see you guys.

319
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,392
- Hey.
- Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

320
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,602
Oh, my God.
Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

321
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,813
- This is unbelievable.
- Well, yeah.

322
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,114
- I guess I did.
- It's gorgeous!

323
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,691
So are you.

324
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,241
Honey, listen, I want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room

325
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,538
'cause we're kind of using that
as a workout area,

326
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,281
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

327
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,080
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please.
No, no.

328
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,036
Don't touch that.
We just brought it back from Sedona.

329
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,622
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

330
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,173
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

331
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,467
- and you guys haven't moved on.
- Rid of it?

332
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,091
If we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.

333
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,423
I look like Fred Savage
from The Wonder Years,

334
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,388
but completely naked,
wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

335
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,470
That is a great picture, Morton.

336
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,895
You look like a young Jay Leno.

337
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,598
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

338
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,983
No.

339
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,777
I remember. You know why?

340
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,651
Because I've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.

341
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:24,076
I mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.

342
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,699
It's literally a medal for sucking.

343
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,701
- No, that is a medal for trying.
- Yes.

344
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,660
Let me tell you something.
This guy was always a great tryer.

345
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,871
That must be Phyllis.
She is just dying to see you.

346
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,002
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here?
She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

347
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,086
I told you, it's an undercover assignment.
It's super secretive.

348
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,470
"Undercover." That's so cute.

349
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,221
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, honey. I want you to know

350
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,721
- we are so glad you're here.
- Okay.

351
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,769
That's great. Thank you.

352
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,097
- All right. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

353
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,979
He just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.

354
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,356
- Bye-bye.
- I baked muffins!

355
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,821
If you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.

356
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,190
You got to study this stuff.

357
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,151
Forget those identities. They're bullshit.
They said I was held back a year.

358
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,952
You were. You were held back two years.

359
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,122
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

360
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,450
Fuck! Socks don't match.

361
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,955
I got to start all over.

362
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,127
It's the first day of school, dude.
I got to look awesome.

363
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,957
You know, back in the day,
you were super popular,

364
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,758
and I wasn't as much.

365
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,338
We didn't really get along in high school.

366
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,470
You don't think that's going to happen again,
do you?

367
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,520
No. Come on, man. We're adults now.
We're best buds.

368
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,971
It's definitely not going to happen again.

369
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,647
- We're good.
- Cool.

370
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,657
Beautiful day out there, boys.

371
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,863
Just shut up.

372
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,700
"Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

373
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,997
"You have the right to an attorney.

374
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,121
"If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."

375
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,579
Dude, do you still not know
the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

376
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,667
Come on, man. They always cut away on TV
before they finish them.

377
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,054
All right, let's do it.

378
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

379
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,007
What are you doing?

380
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,013
- What? What are you talking about?
- Are you two-strapping?

381
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,722
- My backpack? Yeah.
- Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

382
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,602
You got to one-strap it.

383
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,275
Seriously, I would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.

384
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,727
Okay, what makes you the expert?

385
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,154
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

386
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,194
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

387
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,788
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School,
by Jenko.

388
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,241
One, don't try hard at anything.

389
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,624
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

390
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,625
Three, be handsome.

391
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,957
Four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,

392
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,088
you punch them directly in the face.

393
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,545
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

394
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,884
Shit.

395
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,345
All right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,

396
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,273
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

397
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,896
We would never.

398
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,231
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

399
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,731
- Hey, you ready?
- Go!

400
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,245
That was awesome! That was amazing.

401
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,417
- Was I flying?
- That was amazing.

402
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,790
All right, do mine, do mine.

403
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,418
- Okay, ready? Here I go.
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,088
You okay?

405
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,928
I think I shit my pants.

406
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,607
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

407
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,482
- It'll make us look cool.
- That's awesome.

408
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,956
Dude?

409
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,914
- Everybody's two-strapping it.
- Just stay with the one-strap.

410
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,874
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

411
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,551
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

412
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,219
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to use two straps.

413
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,889
- One strap is peer pressure.
- No. No. You're fucking up right now.

414
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,924
Okay, those are Goths.

415
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,977
Those are nerds.

416
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,439
I don't know what they are.

417
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,690
What the fuck are those things?

418
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,145
I'm so confused right now.

419
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,820
Whoa.

420
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,125
- Hi.
- Hey.

421
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,951
- Hey.
- Good morning.

422
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,414
Hey, yo. Hey.

423
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,549
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

424
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,218
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

425
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,045
No, try, like, seven.

426
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,048
- What about you?
- Biodiesel, dawg.

427
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,508
Smells like egg rolls.

428
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,391
Yeah, it does.
Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

429
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,690
But we try to ride bikes when we can.
Global crisis and whatnot.

430
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,651
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

431
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,445
You don't care about the environment?
That's kind of fucked up, man.

432
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,113
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

433
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,907
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

434
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,573
Look at him. He's trying.

435
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,496
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

436
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,448
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

437
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,784
- Look at him. Look at the nerd.
- Who you calling a nerd, man?

438
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,210
I'm sorry. What...

439
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,955
- Shit!
- Shit, dude.

440
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,132
Are you okay, man? Hey, what the hell?
Are you serious?

441
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,880
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

442
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,836
- You punched me because I'm gay?
- What?

443
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,638
No. Come on.

444
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,885
That's not cool, man.

445
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,183
That is really insensitive.

446
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,600
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

447
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,806
I punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.

448
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,936
- I was gay when you punched me!
- In a weird way,

449
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,359
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you

450
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,277
- just because you were gay.
- Right.

451
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,356
You punched a little gay
black kid in the face,

452
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,782
and it's not even second period.
How do you explain that?

453
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,569
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

454
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,200
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

455
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,032
A kid died the other day from drugs,

456
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,460
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.

457
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,962
That's weird, guys.

458
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,041
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

459
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,343
causing trouble in my school.

460
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,263
I am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face

461
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,762
away from a nervous breakdown.
Do I make myself clear?

462
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,093
You guys cross my line again,

463
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:26,685
and you walk into this office,
I'm going to expel you. You got me?

464
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,108
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

465
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,608
Let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.

466
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,110
Which one of you is named Doug?

467
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,275
- No, dude, I'm Brad.
- Okay, good.

468
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,573
So that means your name is Doug, son.

469
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,154
- Yeah, I'm Doug.
- Great.

470
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,576
Here are your class schedules.

471
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,283
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.

472
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,085
I wouldn't.
But you as a drama geek, far less surprising.

473
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,538
Thank you.

474
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,247
Now we have the wrong identities,
you dumbass.

475
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,459
I'm in drama. I suck at drama.
It's girly and embarrassing.

476
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,966
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

477
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,340
I can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.

478
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,723
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry.
And, no, you can't,

479
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,724
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!

480
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,437
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes,
and I'm going to go to yours.

481
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,609
Okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?

482
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,019
Fuck.

483
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,774
So, we are going to hold auditions
for the Peter Pan part today.

484
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,161
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

485
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,291
When I was a young actor just starting out
in New York state,

486
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,787
Albany, to be exact,

487
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,086
- I booked a local television commercial...
- Hey.

488
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,164
...in which I had to play a young man...

489
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,170
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

490
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,262
So are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?

491
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,890
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

492
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,345
I was just busting your balls.

493
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,349
Okay. Good.

494
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,608
I remember, one time,
doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

495
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,358
and we were having so much fun.

496
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,660
And then I realized that she was dead.

497
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,781
I remember one summer...

498
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,870
Do kids still do this stuff?

499
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,742
Even after what happened to him?

500
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,334
Everyone's saying
that Billiam had a heart murmur.

501
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,507
Pretty much everyone I know does it,
but it's not my thing.

502
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,877
It's not really my thing, either,

503
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,759
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

504
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,762
Who would he call if he wanted it?

505
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,969
Well, you can tell your friend

506
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,395
that if he really wanted it,

507
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,473
it's not so hard to find.

508
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,980
When to take it.
He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

509
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,901
Drugs are bad.

510
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,149
But they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.

511
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,199
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

512
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,243
Notice the distinction.
I said "professional actor."

513
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,751
New person. Mr. Texty Texty.

514
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,705
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

515
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,253
Iet's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

516
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,210
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

517
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,798
I can't.
I'm fine just being a tree or something.

518
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,016
Doug, you never won't know

519
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,595
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.

520
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,805
My point is,

521
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,687
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

522
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,610
Yeah, sure.

523
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,733
My favorite molecule is water.

524
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,110
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter.

525
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,744
Its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.

526
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:32,120
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.

527
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,038
H2O.

528
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,787
H2O. H2O.

529
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,130
- H2O
- It's okay. Thank you.

530
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,967
Thank you, Zack. So good.

531
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,842
All right, anybody else
for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

532
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,556
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

533
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,925
A what?

534
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,847
I'm sorry.

535
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,429
What is your name? Brad?

536
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,396
- Brad. Yes, ma'am.
- Wow. Look at you,

537
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,099
Brad. Big.

538
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,690
What is a pop Quiznos?

539
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:07,155
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

540
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,320
- Today's quiz is on...
- You look really old.

541
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,500
- Were you held back or something or...
- No. You look super young.

542
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,451
Were you held forward?

543
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,625
I went to school in France, so...

544
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,174
And they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. It's so lame.

545
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,087
French, the language of love.

546
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,801
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

547
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,848
Hey.

548
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,352
Good luck.

549
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,324
I've gotta croW

550
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,618
I'm just the cleverest...

551
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,082
Okay.

552
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,587
Maybe try one cooler.

553
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,956
And faster.

554
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,543
And louder. And better.

555
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,381
And less insecure and more just cool.

556
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,972
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

557
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,226
I'm going to run outside,

558
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,105
and I'm going to utilize those,
and I'm going to come back.

559
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,404
It's such bullshit.

560
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,959
Wow. You're fast.

561
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,792
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

562
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,173
Let me check out your chest.

563
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,970
Check out your test... Let me...

564
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,594
Let me grade your quiz.

565
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,978
Can I go take a dump?

566
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,356
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

567
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,149
We have this "hurry back" rule,

568
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,276
so if you're not back in six minutes,
I have to send you to the principal.

569
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,779
Rules are rules, so,

570
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,033
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

571
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,867
- Which way is yearbook?
- I don't know.

572
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,993
- Is it this way?
- I don't know!

573
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,049
- Yo.
- Hey.

574
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,133
You guys, huh?

575
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,604
That was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.

576
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,806
- Yeah.
- He feels awful. He feels...

577
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,732
Totally, very nervous.

578
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,102
You're the dealer?

579
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,232
- You're the dealer guy?
- Is that you?

580
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,942
Yep.

581
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,148
So do you make the stuff or...

582
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,985
Do I look like a fucking scientist?
No, I just sell it.

583
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,615
- Yeah, he just sells it. Come on.
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

584
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,662
- I meant I just...
- How many you guys want?

585
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,411
20 bucks a pop.

586
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,378
One each? One pop each of drugs.

587
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,000
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

588
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,288
Whoa!

589
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,216
- Dude, come on.
- No! Maybe you're a narc.

590
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,176
You know who calls people narcs?

591
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,845
Narcs, narc.

592
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,132
First of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,

593
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,933
because if you call us narcs,

594
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,766
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

595
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,689
- 'Cause you just said that.
- They call people...

596
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,062
Look, I don't have time for this shit.
You guys want to do this or not?

597
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,234
- Jesus.
- Yes.

598
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,186
- Yes, yes.
- No problem.

599
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,815
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

600
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,990
I'm sorry. What?

601
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,112
- We were going to take it home.
- I gotta go back to class,

602
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,572
- is the only thing.
- I was thinking that I was going to go home,

603
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,165
maybe turn down the lights,

604
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,617
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

605
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,452
I was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.

606
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,380
Okay, I'm not asking.
Take it now or get the fuck out.

607
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,423
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.

608
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,592
Yeah?

609
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,721
Yeah, no, it's all good.

610
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,472
- I love doing drugs at school.
- I'll just take the drugs right here,

611
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,144
in our mouths.

612
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,892
There you go. That's it.

613
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,526
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

614
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,982
Have fun.

615
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,776
- You got to pull the trigger!
- Okay.

616
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,486
You got to pull the trigger!

617
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,367
- We got to throw up, man.
- I can't.

618
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,494
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died.
We got to throw up.

619
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,291
Just think of something gross.
Think of something gross.

620
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,994
- You fucking think of something.
- Okay, all right, all right.

621
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,546
Your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.

622
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,499
- What the fuck are you saying?
- I don't know! I'm just trying!

623
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,300
- I'm trying my best! I'm just trying!
- Fuck! Come on, man!

624
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,252
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths.

625
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,925
- No!
- Yeah.

626
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,131
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

627
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,933
- Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die?
- Okay, fine!

628
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,727
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

629
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,066
What are you doing?
Are you trying to find my G-spot?

630
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,148
- Just stick it in!
- I don't know. I've never done this before!

631
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,358
Just stick it in! Go!

632
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,409
Cut your fucking fingernails!

633
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,625
Oh, God!

634
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,746
Is it me?

635
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,171
I'm sorry.

636
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,339
I just can't sometimes.

637
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,172
Think we're going to be fine.
I don't feel anything.

638
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,673
Me, neither.

639
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,342
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

640
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,758
You got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

641
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,555
Pass, in your hand.

642
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,806
Hello.

643
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,563
Damn. You guys are late.

644
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,390
Now I'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.

645
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,603
- No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry.
- Come on, please.

646
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,689
You have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.

647
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,278
When'd you go through puberty?
Like, at seven or something?

648
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,575
You look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.

649
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,495
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

650
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,618
I read your file.

651
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,833
You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

652
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,081
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

653
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,003
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?

654
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,251
I consider that a threat.

655
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,082
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

656
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,010
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

657
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,837
That's Brad.

658
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,423
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

659
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,304
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

660
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,681
the track star, and this is Brad,
the science prodigy.

661
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,310
He's really fast.

662
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,030
Is this funny to you guys?

663
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,246
So you're Doug. You're Doug. You're Doug.

664
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,543
You're Doug. You're Doug.

665
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,203
Here's the deal.

666
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,127
My track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.

667
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,258
I mean, if I wasn't the coach,
I'd be laughing my ass off

668
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,713
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

669
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,764
so I need you.

670
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,133
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

671
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,343
Understand?

672
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,564
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400
at today's track meet.

673
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,233
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

674
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,360
Don't blow on me, son.

675
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,189
I haven't trained.

676
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,908
Guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.

677
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,073
Do we have a deal?

678
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,864
Yes.

679
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,082
Nice.

680
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,705
I don't like that.
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

681
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,419
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it.

682
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,210
What are you doing? Stop it.

683
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,587
Actually, that's not bad.

684
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,593
All right, here you go.

685
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,467
Are you guys on drugs?

686
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,224
Okay.

687
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,981
One particle of Unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

688
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,606
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner
into a radioactive spider.

689
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,443
Fuck you, science!

690
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,705
All right, all right, we're good.

691
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,707
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

692
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,459
We're good, baby.

693
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,965
Good work. Hit that shit.

694
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,723
I've gotta croW

695
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,304
I'm just the cleverest felloW

696
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,017
'TWas ever my fortune to knoW

697
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,103
I taught a trick to my shadoW

698
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,234
To stick to the tip of my toe

699
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,360
I've gotta croW

700
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,206
I've gotta

701
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:38,504
CroW!

702
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,164
Christoph, did you feel that?

703
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,669
Who are you?

704
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,550
Welcome aboard, Peter.

705
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,691
No, keep it going!

706
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,902
Keep it going. That was so tight!

707
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,237
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

708
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,994
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

709
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,783
All right! Yeah!

710
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,202
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

711
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,834
I know y'all seen this shit before.

712
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,332
I know you've seen this shit before.

713
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,081
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

714
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,049
You're looking amped!

715
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,382
Here we go.

716
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,804
Here we go! Here we go!

717
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,056
Hey, pick it up!

718
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,226
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up.
What are you doing?

719
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,353
What are you doing? Pick it...

720
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,598
What? McQuaid!

721
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,102
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

722
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,979
Come on!

723
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,735
McQuaid!

724
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,942
Run that way!

725
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,161
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

726
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,120
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

727
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,493
Let's go! Come on!

728
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,169
Oh, my God.

729
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,379
No, no.

730
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,256
No, stop.

731
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,837
Come here. Come here.

732
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,338
Don't make a...

733
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,919
That is a baton penis.

734
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,522
Speak of the devil!

735
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,271
Dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

736
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,603
Organized sports are so fascist.
It makes me sick.

737
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,563
That's just what I do.

738
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,614
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

739
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,946
I don't get this school.

740
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,448
That was awesome.

741
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,126
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

742
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,578
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

743
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,459
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

744
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,586
Okay, Captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,

745
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,883
but they're not normal popular.

746
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,427
They're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone

747
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,845
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

748
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,006
It's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.

749
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,808
Lead dealer, Eric Molson. Alpha dog.

750
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,978
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

751
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,266
Did the AIDS run this year.

752
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,890
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

753
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,350
and he totally gets me.

754
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,731
Who put this together? Are you autistic?

755
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,687
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

756
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,114
- the yarn actually indicates...
- We're compiling a list

757
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,237
of suspicious types at school.
The users are here.

758
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,615
This kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.

759
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:17,786
Cut the bullshit!

760
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,456
I want to know who's the supplier.

761
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,451
We don't know. That's why
there's a question mark on his face.

762
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,707
That's not the way his face looks.
That's just a question mark.

763
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,414
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

764
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,711
Simple.

765
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,006
Sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.

766
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,549
Great job. You guys are on fire.

767
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,965
- So proud.
- Like you could do any better?

768
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,929
We just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs

769
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,352
stripping down cars
in the Garfield High metal shop.

770
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,556
- What?
- Meanwhile, you two were standing around

771
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,516
finger-popping each other's assholes.

772
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,193
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

773
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,771
What we're doing is getting shit done.

774
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,280
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

775
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,983
I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech

776
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,411
drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.

777
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,120
- Password!
- Open the door!

778
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,171
- You have to say the password.
- I'm sorry. What?

779
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,623
What are you...

780
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,380
Geez.

781
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,216
What are y'all doing?
How'd you get a key in here?

782
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,552
Ms. Griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

783
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,975
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

784
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,639
- Let me see. You dealing drugs?
- No.

785
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,565
It's just a card game.
It's, like, a hybrid card game.

786
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,484
- See? They open up.
- Battle Brawlers.

787
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,402
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No.

788
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,024
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm here to study.

789
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,618
Good. You could use it.
You're pretty far behind, so...

790
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,778
You're behind. I'm ahead.

791
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,076
- I know everything.
- Really?

792
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,915
What's a covalent bond?

793
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,994
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

794
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,545
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry.

795
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,339
I just... I don't think you know everything.

796
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,715
I know everything.

797
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,463
Okay.

798
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,267
What kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?

799
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:10,691
They say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.

800
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,359
It helps them to stick together.

801
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,651
I could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.

802
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,733
What are you doing
with all those phones anyway?

803
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,861
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.

804
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,698
You know, I switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

805
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,998
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

806
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,953
No, no, I can't install a spyware
to remotely monitor calls

807
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,413
or anything that the mic picks up.

808
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,923
- I can't do that at all.
- Wait, you can't do it?

809
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,545
No, I can't.

810
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,711
- Is he being sarcastic?
- I don't know.

811
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,089
So you can.

812
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,266
Liking comic books is popular.

813
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,098
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

814
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,356
If I was just born 10 years later,
I would have been the coolest person ever.

815
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,353
I know. It's bullshit.

816
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,898
You know what?

817
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,324
I totally know the cause.

818
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,823
Glee. Fuck you, Glee.

819
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,829
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

820
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,039
I might become popular.
I might get in with the popular kids.

821
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,376
We just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

822
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,624
You saying we should throw a party?

823
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,592
I'll invite Molly,
and then Molly will invite Eric,

824
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,716
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.

825
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,173
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?

826
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,632
I think it would be better if you get in

827
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,263
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.

828
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,844
That'd be the best thing for the case.

829
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,976
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

830
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,533
- Hello?
- Hey. Is this Molly?

831
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,110
Speaking.

832
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,661
Hey. It's Schmidt.

833
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,540
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

834
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,913
Hey, man.

835
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,960
It's so weird that you're calling me.

836
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:58,166
I pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.

837
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,045
I was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,

838
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,220
- and...
- Hello?

839
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,509
Mom, get off the phone!

840
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,632
Sorry, Doug,

841
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,388
- my teen son.
- Mom!

842
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,849
I love you, honey, Dougie,
Doug, Douglas McQuaid.

843
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,771
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

844
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,444
I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.

845
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:23,613
She just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

846
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,945
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

847
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,456
Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.

848
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,793
There was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

849
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,670
The doctor thought
I Was gonna spontaneously groW a vagina.

850
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,706
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

851
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:40,587
Yeah, because you already had one.

852
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,171
Exactly. I already had one.

853
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,003
And you don't need two vaginas.
You just don't.

854
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,089
Although you could use one as a coin purse.

855
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,674
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

856
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,010
Wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

857
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,936
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.

858
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,391
I'm just fucking with you.

859
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,480
That is a weird joke.

860
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,194
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

861
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,862
No, he did walk out on us, though.

862
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,857
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

863
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,032
Just broken dreams.

864
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,453
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say,

865
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,613
well,

866
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,117
that there are some good guys out there,

867
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,796
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

868
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,214
taint your memory.

869
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,799
Oh, my God.

870
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,719
Are you getting choked up?
I'm sorry if I made you upset.

871
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,640
No, it's just, you knoW,
I don't like When guys are mean to girls.

872
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,058
Yeah. Well, thanks.

873
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,557
Normal transition here.

874
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,891
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come!

875
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,816
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

876
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,070
Do you mind if I just put, like,
a posting on Facebook?

877
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,148
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

878
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,861
I should call you back.

879
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,194
Well, all right, I'll see you at school.
You're a great person.

880
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,243
- Bye-bye. Bye.
- Bye.

881
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,867
What the fuck are you...

882
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,049
Are y'all throwing a party?

883
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:08,967
- What?
- There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

884
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,590
And if any of my officers

885
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,769
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

886
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,145
they'll find theyself in prison

887
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,563
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

888
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,859
and me shitting down that snorkel.

889
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,691
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

890
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,740
You're the best. You are the best.

891
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,446
- Oh, my God.
- We love you.

892
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,621
- Enjoy the vineyard.
- You boys be good, now.

893
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,995
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

894
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,455
Bye!

895
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,037
"We love you"? What are you doing?
Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

896
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,463
- I'm in character. Shut up.
- It's weird.

897
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,713
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

898
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,961
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

899
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,304
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

900
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,981
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

901
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,146
Oh, no.

902
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,945
We got a pound of coke.

903
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,403
We're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.

904
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,577
Pound of marijuana?

905
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,663
- Best party ever.
- Boo-yah!

906
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,473
To a brilliant idea

907
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,425
from my brilliant brother

908
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,553
that I love so very much.

909
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,263
And this is going to fucking rock.

910
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,186
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

911
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,690
- Who invited you guys?
- I did!

912
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,775
The party's here!

913
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,035
- What's up, Zack?
- Hey, buddy.

914
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,157
What's up, Roman?

915
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,615
This is crazy. This is, like,
the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

916
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,375
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

917
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,002
Do we have enough chips?

918
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,004
Is this playlist too dance-y?

919
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,210
- Feels too dance-y.
- Too dance-y?

920
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,717
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

921
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,643
What are you doing?

922
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,846
- That's my mom's Kokopelli vase.
- I got it, I got it.

923
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,397
Doug, Doug, hey!

924
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,647
Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.

925
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:28,861
Such a bad joke.

926
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,063
Terrible, terrible.

927
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,317
- You guys know each other, right?
- Yeah.

928
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,237
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric.
Wait for the signal.

929
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,239
And then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.

930
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,445
What?

931
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,413
What's up, man, how you doing?

932
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,286
Eco Suave.

933
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,825
Whoa.

934
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,082
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

935
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,335
Very Native American.

936
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,215
Yeah, our parents are actually

937
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,759
- really into Native American...
- Let's rock and roll.

938
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,051
- Sorry.
- What are y'all doing?

939
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,223
- Come on.
- Did you guys even see Eric?

940
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,350
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

941
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,602
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

942
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,432
Yo, this is butt.
There's, like, no hot dudes here.

943
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,266
- Man, let's bounce.
- We're out of here, man.

944
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,194
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here,
you just got here.

945
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,442
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

946
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,899
Okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,

947
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,530
just go as fast as you possibly can.

948
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,246
Taking out the SIM card.

949
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,288
Taking doWn Eric
With the SIM card information

950
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,116
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

951
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,826
- Are you drunk?
- No.

952
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,286
Have you even been drunk before?

953
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,917
- No, but...
- Give me this.

954
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,623
- What?
- Can we get some bitches up in here?

955
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,504
'Cause it's just boys right now.

956
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,301
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

957
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,087
This is my parents' bedroom.

958
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,510
- What the fuck, bro? Some privacy!
- Shit, shit, shit!

959
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,014
And that is a really gross three-way.

960
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,100
But what was the girl in the back doing?

961
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,182
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

962
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,016
Cool, yeah.

963
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,102
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

964
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,279
but we got to get going.
You know how it is, yeah?

965
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,980
Dude, tell me about it.

966
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,608
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

967
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,155
It's extracting right now.

968
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,157
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

969
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,988
Read this.
"Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

970
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,244
Shit! It's a bust.

971
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,629
- Keep it casual.
- Yeah.

972
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,713
- Go with the flow, dude.
- Cool, man.

973
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,165
- I don't like to make plans or whatever.
- You got it.

974
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,340
- Thank you again, though, man.
- All right.

975
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,841
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

976
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,013
Hey, why you here, Scott?

977
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,512
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

978
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,594
No, I heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.

979
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,187
Wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.

980
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,185
Got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...

981
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,356
I wasn't asking.

982
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,269
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

983
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,029
Take five, take five, man, let me get this.
I got this.

984
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,448
- Yeah? You sure?
- I got this one.

985
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,361
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

986
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,366
- Don't worry about who I am.
- I'm worried about it.

987
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,448
- Why?
- 'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

988
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,950
This is my temple,
this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

989
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,877
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,

990
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,456
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,

991
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,635
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott,
what, what, what, what, Scott?"

992
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,086
- It's that kind of party?
- Yeah, dude.

993
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,137
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

994
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,216
- No, it's getting real.
- It's getting very real.

995
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,097
Yeah. It's like seven strangers
living in one house. True story.

996
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,553
- You want Real World?
- Yeah, let's do it, man.

997
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,229
- Come on. What's your Real...
- Here's Real World.

998
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,227
What was that? Did you hear that?

999
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,774
Real enough for you?

1000
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,317
Schmidt. Doug.

1001
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,986
- What do I do?
- Hit him!

1002
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,528
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

1003
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,456
Fight normal.

1004
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,953
Yo, I'm serious.

1005
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,159
Sorry.

1006
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,882
- I'll fucking kill you!
- I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

1007
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,258
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

1008
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,053
I kicked him in the nuts.

1009
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,856
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

1010
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,441
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

1011
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,397
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- You'll knock over my mom's vase!

1012
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,528
- Fuck your mom's vase!
- Fuck this!

1013
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,871
Oh, shit!

1014
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:10,912
Yeah!

1015
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,830
That's my brother!

1016
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,255
- That was insane!
- You're so cool!

1017
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,217
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

1018
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,730
Oh, shit,

1019
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,725
when did I get stabbed?

1020
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,439
That's awesome.

1021
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,563
Yeah!

1022
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,568
Is that a cop?

1023
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,904
Where?

1024
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,247
No, it's not. Here.

1025
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.

1026
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,918
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

1027
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,412
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

1028
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,589
It's like we're living with a narc.

1029
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,632
The boy is an angel.

1030
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,293
Pull it out!

1031
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,347
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

1032
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,548
Sorry!

1033
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,809
Okay, let's take some shots.

1034
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,269
Shots, shots!

1035
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,738
That's like us fucking Mother Earth
without a condom.

1036
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,190
What the fuck is going on?

1037
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,157
Annie, hang on.

1038
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,871
Are you fucking kidding me?

1039
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,912
Get out of my house. I said get out!
The party's over!

1040
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,459
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry!

1041
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,336
The mom is coming!

1042
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,496
- Listen to me!
- Chill out! Chill out!

1043
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,294
- Let go of me!
- You're embarrassing me

1044
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,341
- in front of my friends!
- Get back here, you shit!

1045
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,471
Dude, that was so crazy, man.

1046
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,766
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

1047
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,468
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

1048
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,224
- like, all the time, man.
- I bet you are.

1049
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,768
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

1050
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,816
You, dude, I like you, man.

1051
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,485
How do you feel about making
a little extra money?

1052
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,650
Whatever it is, I'm in.

1053
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:46,981
All right, here's the deal.

1054
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,988
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own,
but I only bring in people I like.

1055
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,037
Okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

1056
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,202
I introduce you to my hookup.
How's that sound?

1057
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,454
- Cool with me.
- My man.

1058
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,410
That is my man...

1059
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:02,371
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

1060
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,175
Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

1061
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,627
Yo, yo.

1062
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,224
Come on!

1063
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,307
"I love dick"?

1064
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,888
You think that's funny?

1065
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,473
"Wonder Years douche"?

1066
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,775
What kind of a sick animal draws

1067
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,320
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?

1068
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,444
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

1069
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,906
You think I don't know
that's a dick and balls?

1070
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,903
I know all about dick and balls!

1071
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,364
I partied with Robert Downey Jr.
before he got sober,

1072
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,700
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!

1073
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,831
You know what?
From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

1074
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,208
You're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,

1075
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,917
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...

1076
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,261
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

1077
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,138
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

1078
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,933
and I had Zack put
this monitoring device in it,

1079
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,182
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.

1080
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,183
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

1081
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,234
What?

1082
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,277
- What if you had gotten found out?
- But it worked.

1083
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,230
This is, like,
the smartest move I've ever pulled,

1084
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,941
so, I'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?

1085
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,948
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad you have something to do.

1086
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,493
Good.

1087
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,044
What's up?

1088
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,051
Great job, Schmidt.

1089
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,027
- Password!
- Kneel before Zod!

1090
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,399
You may enter.

1091
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,071
Thank you, Zod.

1092
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,282
Let's tap that wire, huh?

1093
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,116
We were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.

1094
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,997
We were going to test what blows up.

1095
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,338
There's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right?

1096
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,625
Not that I can think of
that would make sense.

1097
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,631
Go for it, go for it.

1098
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,508
- Look out.
- Go, go, go!

1099
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,549
Yes!

1100
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,848
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

1101
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,349
That's what I'm talking about!

1102
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,896
I love this science shit!

1103
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,395
This is what you guys do all day?
Let's do it again.

1104
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,250
Are you texting Molly?

1105
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,747
What?

1106
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,670
I don't... Molly...

1107
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,626
Maybe. Is that...

1108
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,333
Whoa, it's cool, man, come on.

1109
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,591
I'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.

1110
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,298
I mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.

1111
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,510
I just, like... I don't know,
I don't believe in possessions, ja feel?

1112
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,387
Ja feel, ja definitely feel.

1113
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,477
- Yeah.
- Schmidty?

1114
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,229
Schmidty.

1115
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,394
Phyllis.

1116
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,064
- I'll be right back, dude.
- Okay.

1117
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,367
Hey. How are you?

1118
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,661
- How is my favorite police officer?
- Okay.

1119
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,285
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

1120
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:25,866
Listen, now is not a really good time.

1121
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,917
Are you undercover right now?

1122
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,461
Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

1123
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,254
Are those the bad guys over there?

1124
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,174
Do they have guns? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, this is so exciting.

1125
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,092
I have got to call Annie. She is gonna die.

1126
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,088
I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

1127
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,797
- Where is my phone?
- Okay, okay.

1128
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,177
Shut your fucking mouth.

1129
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,385
Shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?

1130
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,310
Let's go check this out.

1131
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,514
I will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.

1132
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,690
- There is no...
- A straight-up face punch.

1133
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,892
I swear to God, you're gonna get me killed.

1134
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,397
- Hey, yo.
- That is...

1135
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,109
Shit! She just tried to grab my dick, dude!

1136
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,407
- What? You tried to grab his...
- She tried to grab my junk.

1137
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,030
She was like, "Oh, my God, I have arthritis,

1138
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,782
"it hurts my hand,
I need to grab a handful of that dick."

1139
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:03,988
I was like, "Get the fuck off me!"

1140
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,447
She said, "I need to grab
a handful of that dick"?

1141
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,157
And it felt good,
but then it felt weird for a second,

1142
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,334
so I pushed her. We got to get out of here.

1143
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,410
All right, cool, let's get the...

1144
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:30,518
So your parents are just cool
with having people over whenever?

1145
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,356
Yeah, you know, they're out most nights.

1146
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,147
Pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.

1147
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,937
You're so lucky your parents
don't give a shit about you.

1148
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,238
Right?

1149
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,156
- This place is awesome.
- Yeah.

1150
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,442
Hey.

1151
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:42,901
Hey, what's up?

1152
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,452
How's it going?

1153
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,451
Wow, that's a bigger hug
than I was expecting.

1154
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,616
Sorry. I'm happy to see you.

1155
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,292
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

1156
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

1157
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,381
Good?

1158
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,007
- All right, come on.
- Yeah, let's...

1159
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,336
I brought tacos, so that's cool.

1160
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,259
Try to turn it, try to turn it, spoiler alert

1161
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,012
Spoiler alert, spoiler alert!

1162
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:10,930
Hey, boys, this eco-pussy
is going down today.

1163
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,686
Take doWn eco-pussy

1164
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,519
Take doWn eco-pussy!

1165
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:21,027
Mother Earth, Mother Earth is dying

1166
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,904
And When it rains

1167
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,860
It means that beautiful bitch is crying

1168
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,912
- It's really not a planet.
- It's for sure a planet.

1169
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,785
Pluto is a planet.

1170
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,911
- It's ready!
- It used to be a planet.

1171
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,037
- It's ready.
- Not anymore.

1172
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,292
Reduce, reuse

1173
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:37,543
Recycle

1174
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,749
I'm embarrassed.

1175
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,210
- I always feel exposed after playing.
- Do not feel exposed.

1176
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,381
I got to use the bathroom.

1177
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,379
- Is it in there?
- Yeah, yeah, right up there, dude.

1178
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,465
All right, all right, all right, all right.
God damn that.

1179
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,017
The mic is live and we can
hear how the other half lives.

1180
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,487
What are you doing?

1181
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,115
I heard something.

1182
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,321
Hey, can I ask you something? Sit doWn.

1183
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,576
Okay.

1184
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:14,160
I just want to make sure
that you and Eric are going to be careful

1185
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,872
with whatever it is
that you're getting involved in.

1186
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah, I promise we will.

1187
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,377
It would just suck
if something bad happened,

1188
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,551
because you're a good guy.

1189
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,849
Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you,

1190
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,767
except girl version.

1191
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,595
You're a girl.

1192
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,434
- I am.
- Yeah.

1193
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,516
That's why I put this dress on,

1194
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,021
- to remind you.
- Exactly.

1195
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,104
- Are you excited about the play?
- Yes.

1196
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,279
Yeah, you were just

1197
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,401
- right in there with excitement.
- Yes.

1198
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,857
- No hesitash.
- I'm very excited.

1199
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,488
Yeah.

1200
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,202
Does that make me a super nerd?

1201
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:50,904
No, not at all.

1202
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,409
We get to act together.

1203
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,367
What a vagina. He has no chance with her.

1204
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,542
So...

1205
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,870
- Shit.
- Sorry.

1206
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,750
You're on the prom committee.

1207
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,331
Do you think it's going to be fun?

1208
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:02,753
Did she just bring up prom on her own?

1209
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,630
- She did, she just brought up prom.
- What is she doing?

1210
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,336
I think it's going to be awesome.

1211
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,845
- Prom eats a dong.
- Multiple dongs.

1212
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,013
All right, anyone who says

1213
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,887
they don't care about prom
actually secretly does.

1214
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,060
Who we gonna take to the prom?
No one's going to prom with us.

1215
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,389
Come on, picture it.
You pull up in a white stallion of a limo.

1216
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,099
You got fine-ass honeys with you.

1217
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,355
You're dressed to the nines
with your best buds.

1218
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,437
Doves fly out behind you, slow motion.

1219
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,237
Doves. Why doves?

1220
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,942
'Cause doves make you look
like a badass, that's why.

1221
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,743
I am pretty skeptical,

1222
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:35,992
but maybe, if someone fun asked me,
I would go.

1223
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,078
Aren't... Isn't... Aren't you and Eric...

1224
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,754
Wouldn't you and Eric go together?

1225
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,712
Not that I know of.

1226
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,176
Would you...

1227
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,306
He's going to choke.

1228
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,059
He always chokes.
He's going to choke, wait for it.

1229
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,437
So would...

1230
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,231
So would...

1231
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,979
Would you...

1232
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,941
Mayb...

1233
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,235
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1234
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,413
That is the actual sound of choking.

1235
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:19,376
I was wondering if you...

1236
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,253
Would you

1237
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,544
maybe want to go

1238
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,669
with me to prom?

1239
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,879
Would you want to go to me...
Maybe with me to prom?

1240
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,551
Yes.

1241
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,683
I would love to go to prom with you.

1242
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,478
What? She just said yes!

1243
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,021
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1244
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,182
Good for you, Doug.

1245
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,392
Thank you for asking.

1246
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:53,739
Put her there, man.

1247
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,741
Just put... Put it right there.

1248
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,329
I'm putting it right there.

1249
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,333
Yeah. There you guys are.

1250
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,957
What's up, my man?

1251
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,037
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1252
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,793
- Whazzup?
- Yeah.

1253
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,217
Doug... Okay, settle an argument.

1254
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,052
You and your brother aren't related, right?

1255
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,345
'Cause you look totally different.

1256
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,763
He's adopted.

1257
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,091
We all suspect from a very lame family.

1258
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:18,802
Where is he tonight?

1259
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,681
Probably at home With those lame tools
he hangs out With. I don't knoW.

1260
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:25,358
You know how T om Cruise is
always pissed off at Rain Man?

1261
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,983
That's like my life,
except Brad is really shitty at math.

1262
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,907
Your brother's kind of a dick.

1263
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,530
Well, yeah,

1264
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,446
he kind of is, isn't he?

1265
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,788
Don't listen to that.

1266
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,865
I don't give a fuck.

1267
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,378
Dude, Eric is the funniest IM-er.

1268
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,677
Oh, fuck.

1269
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,811
Hey, guys. It's so funny seeing you here.

1270
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,559
How are you? Guess what, I don't care.

1271
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,107
We just closed our third
high school operation.

1272
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,105
And check what we found at Kennedy.

1273
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,778
Looks like we're going to have to do
your job for you.

1274
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,153
Your drugs is spreading
to different schools now, sucker.

1275
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,372
You failed to stop the outbreak,
and you have no leads!

1276
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,498
We are running out of time!

1277
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,325
You either find the supplier,

1278
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,912
or I'm gonna jump your asses
off Jump Street!

1279
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,962
I totally understand
where you're coming from, sir,

1280
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,462
but, look, I heard Eric
talking on the phone yesterday

1281
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,714
with somebody that sounded very suspect

1282
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,966
about meeting up with a stuffed piñata.

1283
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,716
Is that a code for sex?

1284
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,262
- Piñata? Really?
- Yep.

1285
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,227
Remember that wiretap
I put on Eric's phone?

1286
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,021
While you were having the time of your life
last night, I was listening.

1287
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,941
I overheard a phone call between Eric
and some dude about a piñata.

1288
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,190
That's all you heard?

1289
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:56,865
Yep.

1290
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,038
I am so nervous.

1291
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:05,204
We are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.

1292
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,752
I apologize in advance
if I throw up on you onstage.

1293
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,962
Serious question, though.

1294
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,248
How do I look?

1295
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,254
Ravishing.

1296
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,799
Is it too sexy of an outfit?

1297
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,175
Bend the knee a little bit.

1298
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,631
Yep, it is.

1299
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:25,058
It's going to be so much easier
having you onstage with me.

1300
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,638
I am so happy that I met you.

1301
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,021
You're, like, the only guy
that I can really trust.

1302
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,568
Yep. That's me.

1303
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,486
Doug.

1304
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,574
Potassium nitrate.

1305
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:45,449
Don't hate. It's great.

1306
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,329
It can act as an oxidizer.

1307
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,251
I didn't know that, but now I'm wiser.

1308
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,043
It has a crystalline structure.

1309
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,921
If you can't respect that,
you're a butt muncher.

1310
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:58,882
It's a key ingredient in gunpowder.

1311
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,007
K-NO-three, don't give no grief.

1312
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,306
It can be used to make corned beef.

1313
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,142
It's also known as saltpeter.

1314
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,271
- Brad?
- Shit.

1315
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,027
Where are you going?

1316
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,278
I don't want to look like
it's like I'm wearing makeup.

1317
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,076
- Right.
- Doug! Hi.

1318
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,528
Brad!

1319
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,829
Whoa. What are you wearing?

1320
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,497
Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.

1321
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,786
I need to borrow you.

1322
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,538
Now's not a good time, Brad.

1323
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,369
It's a really good time.

1324
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,628
'Cause my piñata is killing me.

1325
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,716
Is that code for a sex thing?

1326
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,419
It's leaving the parking lot.

1327
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,674
Piñata?

1328
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,761
Molly,

1329
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,808
I will be right back.
I need to help Brad with something, okay?

1330
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,477
I just need to help Brad
with something real quick.

1331
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,680
- What? No. What?
- I promise you...

1332
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,514
Do you understand how soon
the show is starting?

1333
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,190
I swear to you
I will be back in time for curtain.

1334
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,109
- I swear. I swear to you.
- Tell me you understand how soon...

1335
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,152
What? Are you kidding me?

1336
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,906
What did I say? What did I say?

1337
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,861
See? Whose wiretap is
working for him now, huh?

1338
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,750
Shit.

1339
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,168
Fuck!

1340
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:18,632
You told me not to worry about the tickets!

1341
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,881
I thought they made us look cool.

1342
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,088
- Cones, cones...
- Driver's ed car.

1343
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,217
- I'm driving.
- No, you're not.

1344
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,217
- I never get to drive. I'm driving this time.
- Fine! Drive!

1345
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:29,264
- Hey, guys.
- Just borrowing this for one sec.

1346
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,437
- Sure.
- Go. Go, go, go, go.

1347
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,606
Guys, hey, wait. Guys, you're not on the list.

1348
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,979
Hey, guys, wait! Who cares?

1349
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,750
- Holy fucking shit.
- No fucking way.

1350
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,711
Those are the guys from the park.

1351
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,083
That's just too crazy.

1352
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,466
What do you think's in that thing?

1353
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,214
I don't know, money, drugs.

1354
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,762
They could be a new buyer,
or they could be the supplier.

1355
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,714
If it's good, you'll hear from me.

1356
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,301
If it's not good, you'll hear from me
about telling you how it's not good.

1357
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,476
Makes sense.

1358
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,976
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, no worries, man.

1359
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,728
I'll see you guys.

1360
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,059
We definitely got to follow
them and find out, though.

1361
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,484
- Get down! Get down!
- Get down! Get down!

1362
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,197
- What are you doing?
- If they see us,

1363
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,528
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1364
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,113
- What? No!
- Yes. Stop.

1365
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,789
You pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1366
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,499
No, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1367
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,917
Why am I automatically blowing you?

1368
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,120
'Cause you're in
a fucking Peter Pan costume!

1369
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,295
Okay.

1370
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,510
Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1371
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,054
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, fine, we'll follow them.

1372
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,097
But we need to be back in
30 minutes for curtain.

1373
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,518
Dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?

1374
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,644
Yeah, you're following too close, dude.

1375
01:09:57,777 --> 01:09:59,438
- They're going to make us.
- Well, if I go too far back,

1376
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,360
it's going to look even
more suspicious, so just stop.

1377
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:02,607
God, just let me do my thing.

1378
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,321
I know what I'm doing.

1379
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:09,068
Seriously, if you do that again,
I'm going to Whac-A-Mole you in the balls.

1380
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,198
Just stay back.

1381
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,156
- I could not be more serious.
- Take your foot off the brake.

1382
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,617
- No. I'm not... No.
- Take your foot off the brake!

1383
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,009
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1384
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,381
- Look what you did!
- Look what you did!

1385
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,384
What the fuck?
You non-driving motherfuckers!

1386
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,261
Get the fuck out of the car!

1387
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,934
- Oh, fuck.
- Lock the door! Lock the door!

1388
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,136
What do I do? Go away!

1389
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,471
What are you, a fucking Keebler Elf?

1390
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,973
Get him out of that car!

1391
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,689
- No, no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

1392
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,483
- No, no! No, no, no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

1393
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:45,563
Like an angry walrus!

1394
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,240
- I stomp the car now!
- Oh, my God!

1395
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,653
- Stomp! Stomp!
- Oh, shit.

1396
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,030
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God! Stop, dude! Go!

1397
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,494
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1398
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,083
- Just let me drive!
- Stop hitting me!

1399
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,926
Dude, watch out!

1400
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,726
Will you stop front-seat driving?
Get your hands off the wheel!

1401
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,598
Man, you just hit two people back there!

1402
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,684
- You stop. I'm not...
- Take your hands off. Shit!

1403
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,610
- We're stuck in traffic!
- Oh, shit.

1404
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,987
- Shit, they're coming! They're coming!
- What?

1405
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,822
Oh, my God, dude.

1406
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:33,994
What do we do?

1407
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,287
What the... What the...

1408
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,160
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1409
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,616
Oh, shit.

1410
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,076
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong with you? Run!

1411
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,036
I can't! I'm wearing tights!

1412
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,497
I got skinny jeans on!
It's the same fucking thing!

1413
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,543
They're going to make us, or kill us.

1414
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,800
- Porsche! Porsche!
- Police! Get out of the car, douche!

1415
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,472
I'm on a call here, jackass.

1416
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,847
That's right. Go to sleep, bitch.
You just got head-butted, motherfucker!

1417
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,178
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit.

1418
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,062
Check around for a gun or something,
all right?

1419
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,484
Where? Where?
There's no glove compartment

1420
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,688
in this shitty-ass car!
There's golf balls and this.

1421
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,648
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- I don't know, man!

1422
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,358
I've never been in a freeway chase before!

1423
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:30,005
Watch out! It's going to explode!
It's going to go!

1424
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,674
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1425
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,005
- It just didn't explode.
- That's weird.

1426
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,389
Can anybody tell me where my Peter is?

1427
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,514
French! You're not my first choice,
but I need you to go on as Peter.

1428
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,725
Oh, gosh. And I've been in character
for months now.

1429
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,560
Great. Nobody cares.

1430
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,945
Come on! Another traffic jam?

1431
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,024
I'm sorry I didn't check the traffic report

1432
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,950
- before we got in a car chase!
- Let's go! Come on!

1433
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,074
- Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Shit!

1434
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,866
- Are you texting?
- No, I'm not texting!

1435
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,122
- Yes, you are! You're texting!
- No, I'm not!

1436
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,202
Okay, almost done.

1437
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,123
"LOL."

1438
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,709
I'm driving!

1439
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,635
Why do you always jump
over the car like that?

1440
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:14,929
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1441
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,381
- Hi.
- God damn, you are beautiful.

1442
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,716
- Oh. Hi.
- You are fine as shit.

1443
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,096
Don't worry. Someone will pick you up.

1444
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,018
- Wow.
- Hurry. Just drive.

1445
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,638
Wait. Pick me up?

1446
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,730
- They're coming! They're coming!
- I got an idea.

1447
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,982
Why don't you text them
and ask them to stop chasing us?

1448
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,197
Oh, shit!

1449
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,746
He's got a gun!

1450
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:42,789
I'm going to throw this thing at him!

1451
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:43,957
Okay, you don't have to narrate everything!

1452
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,410
- Just throw it!
- Okay! Okay, okay!

1453
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,427
- It's going to explode!
- Oh, my God! Roll up the windows!

1454
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,682
- What the fuck is that going to do?
- Roll it up!

1455
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:05,889
- I don't fucking care! Just do it!
- Oh, God!

1456
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:15,231
I really thought that one
was going to explode.

1457
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,822
Oh, shit!

1458
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,625
Look in the glove compartment for a gun.

1459
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,327
What are you talking about?
We're in a pink Bug!

1460
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:31,414
I don't care.
Look in the goddamn glove compartment!

1461
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,999
What the hell?

1462
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,221
- Shoot.
- Oh, my God. Okay! Okay!

1463
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,173
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

1464
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:43,384
Can't get a good shot, man!
I can't get a good shot!

1465
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,060
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Take the shot!

1466
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,471
Take the shot! Just shoot him! Let's go!

1467
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,896
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1468
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,356
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Shit, shit...

1469
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,909
That's what exploded? Holy shit.
That was crazy.

1470
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,414
Why did you shoot for me?

1471
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,165
You weren't shooting, you were choking,

1472
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:12,747
- so I had to save us.
- I was going to shoot.

1473
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,215
- You always do this, every single time.
- What?

1474
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,008
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.

1475
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,509
If I miss this play, Molly's going to freak out
and she's not going to go to prom with me.

1476
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,590
- Are you fucking serious right now?
- Fuck, yes, I'm serious!

1477
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,146
Can't believe you made me late.
You're so selfish.

1478
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,140
- I'm selfish?
- Yes, you're selfish!

1479
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,357
Are you fucking kidding me?

1480
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:33,855
Look at yourself!

1481
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,778
You're in too deep, man.

1482
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,652
Yesterday, I found
a college application on your desk!

1483
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,946
I don't know how long this case
is going to last.

1484
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,617
And Eric's going to get into Berkeley,
and, honestly, I can get in, too.

1485
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,370
Who knows? I could ride this thing out.
I could be a doctor or something.

1486
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,792
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1487
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,127
You screwed this investigation all up.

1488
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,751
At least I know my Miranda rights, you idiot.

1489
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,300
You are a very silly man indeed.

1490
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,507
Boys, squaws, come quickly.

1491
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,094
Hey! Sorry! It's okay. I'm here.

1492
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,353
I know I missed the first few scenes.

1493
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,807
I want to thank...
Give it up to French Samuels

1494
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:16,235
- for ably backing me up.
- Fuck you, Doug! What?

1495
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,313
I say we just roll right into this thing, huh?

1496
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,987
This is my twin. We're together in...

1497
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,326
Get the fuck out of here.

1498
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,989
What are you doing?
Have you completely lost your mind?

1499
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,540
What is this?

1500
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,913
I don't know, but it's already more exciting.

1501
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,460
You're embarrassing me.

1502
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:34,787
It's okay. I'll make it up to you.

1503
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,006
And... Let's fly!

1504
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,846
- Such bullshit!
- Get off of me!

1505
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,429
I'm not dumb! I'm smart!

1506
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,477
You think I'm stupid? You're stupid!

1507
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,306
- Go, Doug!
- I guess I should do something.

1508
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,106
I should probably not
just stand here watching.

1509
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,559
I should take action.

1510
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,019
Worst best friend ever!

1511
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,946
Molly, I'm sorry!

1512
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,948
I don't want to talk to you ever again.

1513
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:08,199
I'm sorry.

1514
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,251
You stupid idiot!

1515
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,626
- Come here!
- Come on!

1516
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,893
Make fun of me behind my back
and everybody laughs at me?

1517
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:35,310
I was a loser for four years!
You couldn't handle it for five minutes!

1518
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,517
Have some fairy dust, motherfucker!

1519
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:41,819
Hey, guys, no!

1520
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,242
I heard you call me Rain Man, you asshole!

1521
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,535
Principal Dadier sucks dick!

1522
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:52,873
You're supposed to be my friend!

1523
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,623
Stop! Stop it. You're expelled.
Both of you are expelled.

1524
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,006
And that's the end of Act Two.

1525
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,939
Is that it? You're not going to scream at us?

1526
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,778
Nope.

1527
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,493
I'm gonna just fire you.

1528
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,457
Moving out?

1529
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,753
Yep.

1530
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:26,425
You know what's crazy to me

1531
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,303
is that I think that I actually
thought that we were brothers.

1532
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,674
I would've tooken a bullet for you.

1533
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,938
Get in now. Both of you.

1534
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,143
Why should I?

1535
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,144
Just get in the car, man.

1536
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,614
Get in the fucking car.

1537
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:50,157
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

1538
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,611
Please get in the car.

1539
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,910
Come on, you guys. Come on. Please. Jesus.

1540
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,130
Some messed up shit went down yesterday.

1541
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,128
Yeah, after we made the exchange,

1542
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,711
our potential business partners
got followed by some fucking cops.

1543
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,216
That's insane, man.

1544
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,634
Are you serious?

1545
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,842
Okay, it's just I don't want to go to jail!

1546
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,302
You know what happens to
a handsome guy like me in jail?

1547
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,137
It rhymes with "grape"!

1548
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,272
It rhymes with "grape."

1549
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,520
I can't let that happen.

1550
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,726
So I got these from my dad's gun cabinet.

1551
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,482
- Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.
- Whoa. Come on. Whoa.

1552
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:31,361
Springfield.45s, police issue.
Very powerful guns.

1553
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,609
You ever use one?

1554
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,995
- We're not really gun people, man. No.
- No?

1555
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,365
A lot of things
have made me wonder about you.

1556
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:41,496
Come on.

1557
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,002
Your taste in music.

1558
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:46,751
The fact that you look
like a fucking 40-year-old man.

1559
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,672
Then after that shit at the play, I realized

1560
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,006
there's no way you guys could be cops.

1561
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,019
Yeah, I got this deal going down.
The supplier's going to be there.

1562
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,313
I need people I can trust.

1563
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,566
All right. All right, come on.

1564
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,314
Okay, right over here,
we're going to shoot these bottles.

1565
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,778
- We're going to practice, okay?
- Okay.

1566
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,250
That was... That was actually
really fuckin' awesome.

1567
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,577
Beginner's luck.

1568
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,002
All right.

1569
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,705
The supplier wants the deal
to go down at prom.

1570
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,290
All right, there's going to be
all these heavies there,

1571
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,916
but as long as you guys have my back...

1572
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:32,842
Yeah? Yeah? Shit.

1573
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,670
I always got your back.

1574
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,718
Time to get our jobs back.

1575
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:41,347
Let's get ready for prom.

1576
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,535
Schmidty! Chore time!

1577
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,950
Mom, we don't have time
for chores right now!

1578
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:04,875
If you stay in this house,
you have time for chores!

1579
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,247
Mom!

1580
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,810
Fuck this thing.

1581
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:30,563
Here.

1582
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,732
It'll be quicker if I help.

1583
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:35,988
There you go.

1584
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:38,818
Thanks.

1585
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,084
Your shotgun's hanging too low.

1586
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,786
They're gonna see it.

1587
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,210
Thanks.

1588
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,307
Jenko...

1589
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,849
Will you go to prom with me?

1590
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,362
I guess.

1591
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:21,194
Are we really going to take down
a whole drug operation by ourselves?

1592
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,122
I got some contacts that'll help us.

1593
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,208
Brad, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

1594
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,375
What if the principal sees you?

1595
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,670
- This is wrong, yet so right.
- What?

1596
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,040
I am so happy you're willing
to get in trouble for me.

1597
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,671
You have to go. Please, don't leave me ever.

1598
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,010
Ms. Griggs, stop. Stop.

1599
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,462
- Stay! Stay.
- Stop.

1600
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,213
- What?
- Stay.

1601
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,589
- Go!
- Okay.

1602
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:25,925
- Stay.
- Stop. Stop.

1603
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,725
- I'm lost without you.
- What?

1604
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,804
Get out of me. I'm going to throw up.

1605
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,098
You are so hot!

1606
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,108
All right.

1607
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:43,238
Hey, pumpkin head.

1608
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,660
I'm very mad at you. Dance with me.

1609
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,703
- Are you on that shit?
- So what if I am?

1610
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,745
Look, Molly, some serious stuff
is about to go down,

1611
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,043
and I don't want you to get hurt.

1612
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,542
I've already been hurt, Doug. I don't care.

1613
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:59,587
You need to leave. You need to leave.
You need to get out of here right now.

1614
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:01,418
Making a lot of hand gestures!

1615
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,213
Okay, my name's not Doug.

1616
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,593
- It's Schmidt.
- What?

1617
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,265
- And I'm a cop.
- What?

1618
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:11,061
Okay, and I care about you,
and I don't want you to get busted,

1619
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,264
so you have to leave right now.

1620
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,019
Leave the prom right now, Molly.

1621
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,600
- I'm serious.
- Hey. Hey.

1622
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:17,980
Penthouse now. Supplier's waiting.

1623
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,277
- What are you?
- Come on. Hey, come on.

1624
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,854
- Supplier's waiting.
- Is that Eric?

1625
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,985
- Molly, leave right now.
- What are you...

1626
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,488
- Just leave right now!
- What is this?

1627
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:40,798
Mr. Walters?

1628
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,667
Hey!

1629
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:45,254
Beautiful Brad, and his brother.

1630
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:46,680
Wow. You look great.

1631
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,257
You're the supplier? You're a teacher.

1632
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,967
And I was stuck on a teacher's salary, bro.

1633
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,553
Could barely pay my alimony.
What are you gonna do?

1634
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:54,554
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,477
You boys are so good at this.

1636
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,149
Oh, yeah, Cinnamon!

1637
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,818
Oh, my God,
we're getting such good evidence.

1638
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,646
I stole some of that Bunsen burner crap

1639
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:05,027
from the chem lab,
threw in some of my Cool Deets,

1640
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,074
and it was muy delicioso!

1641
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,403
Then one day I catch
Eco Butt-munch over here

1642
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,238
smoking a J.J. behind the field house,

1643
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,198
and I'm like,
"Hey, you want to make some coin?"

1644
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,249
What a green penis that guy is, huh?

1645
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,290
There's my quesadilla.

1646
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,419
I hurt my hands!

1647
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,416
Bitch.

1648
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:31,929
Oh, shit.

1649
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,352
You guys look crazy scary.

1650
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,519
How many of you are there?

1651
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:36,851
A lot.

1652
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,102
Karl.

1653
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,850
Patch looks pimp, man.

1654
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,776
Thank you.

1655
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,021
He's gonna recognize us, man.

1656
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,572
I'm freaking out.

1657
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,274
This is Walters, he made the stuff.

1658
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,860
- Real pleasure to meet you.
- Fuck what his name is.

1659
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,195
Your shit's good.

1660
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,245
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

1661
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,539
What, you having a party now?

1662
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,457
Who are these two motherfuckers?

1663
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,534
Fuck!

1664
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,170
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

1665
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:04,006
Nah, nah, it's cool, man,
they're my boys, so...

1666
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,458
- Are they?
- Yeah.

1667
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,960
I don't like strangers.

1668
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,971
How do you ever expect
to make any new friends with that attitude?

1669
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,891
It's, like, everyone's a stranger
till you give them a chance, man.

1670
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,388
What the fuck are you talking about?

1671
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,468
I don't even...

1672
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,145
Just fuckin' around.

1673
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:19,188
Do your thing, man. Proceed.

1674
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,479
Hey, kid, come here.

1675
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,648
You, you look familiar.

1676
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,650
- Me?
- Yeah.

1677
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:31,160
I was in a French fry commercial
when I was a kid,

1678
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,612
so people are like, you know, often say,
"Oh, I think I know you,"

1679
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,823
but I don't think we've ever met before.

1680
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,124
Do I look like I eat French fries?

1681
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,247
I don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,

1682
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:44,627
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day,
like a carb blowout, you know? I don't know.

1683
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:45,878
Nah.

1684
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,376
Yeah, the theme song was, like...

1685
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:52,680
Come to AndreW's French Fry Emporium

1686
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,052
Where friendship and French fries

1687
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,603
Go hand in hand

1688
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,021
That's my quesadilla!

1689
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,227
Who wants a piece? Huh?

1690
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,153
I know you're in there, Doug,
or whatever your name is!

1691
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,275
You lied to me!

1692
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,861
I'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!

1693
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,697
Hey, you guys, she just called me
a stupid fucking cock. That's rude.

1694
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,199
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

1695
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:22,206
Did she just say
"nickhead dark motherfucker"?

1696
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,628
That's just racist.

1697
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,171
I know these two.

1698
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,919
Your boys are cops! They're cops!

1699
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,212
Police! Get on the ground!

1700
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,214
You get on the fuckin' ground!

1701
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,261
- We asked you first!
- I don't give a damn!

1702
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,010
You're fucking cops?

1703
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,931
But we partied together, man.

1704
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,556
You bought us Taco Bell.

1705
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,974
Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.

1706
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,556
You made me this friendship bracelet.

1707
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:45,479
Well, he's not really your friend.
He was pretending the whole time.

1708
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:47,561
I'm gonna cut this the fuck off later, all right?

1709
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,564
What the fuck is going on?

1710
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,274
Shut this kid up!

1711
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,451
- Him, too.
- No, no! Hey, wait!

1712
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:56,699
No, no, no. Listen, I'm with you guys!

1713
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:57,905
I didn't know these guys were cops!

1714
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,239
I'm getting out of here.

1715
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,744
I fucking hate you!

1716
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,083
Get that out of my face!

1717
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,081
- Molly!
- Oh, there you are!

1718
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,162
What the fuck!

1719
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,715
Drop your guns, or I'll spray her brains
all over the room!

1720
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,168
Trying to take a hostage,
some goddamn TV show shit?

1721
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:14,300
I don't know! I'm trying to help, all right?
I've never done this shit before.

1722
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,426
Well, you're fucking up.

1723
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,179
- Drop the guns or she's dead!
- She looks dead already.

1724
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:19,802
What? No.

1725
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,511
Jesus.

1726
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:24,018
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

1727
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,316
She just passed out from the drugs.
We're good.

1728
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,483
Drop the guns or...

1729
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:29,152
All right, all right, just chill out.

1730
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:30,945
We're gonna drop our guns.

1731
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,195
You got to let the kids go,
and no one's gonna die, okay?

1732
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,368
Just drop the guns, and kick them over here.

1733
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:40,072
D.B., shoot these motherfuckers.

1734
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,532
Oh, come on, that's unfair!
We put our guns down in good faith.

1735
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,288
You're a liar, and you're mean!

1736
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,877
- That's unfair.
- We're all friends here.

1737
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,331
Let's just relax, and we can
all leave here as friends.

1738
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,712
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Y'all boys are stupid.

1739
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:55,420
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

1740
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:57,256
God damn it!

1741
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:59,466
Tom Hanson, DEA! On your knees!

1742
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,596
What the fuck?

1743
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,552
- Now!
- Fuck!

1744
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,729
Doug Penhall, DEA! You're under arrest!

1745
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,932
Guns down, all of you! Domingo, tell them!

1746
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,817
Put them down.

1747
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:11,436
Nice! Yes!

1748
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:13,526
Shut the fuck up!

1749
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,858
You little dweebs just ruined
a five-year investigation.

1750
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:18,068
We had no idea.

1751
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,528
You're, like, an amazing actor, man.

1752
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:22,121
You played saxophone
at my sister's wedding, man!

1753
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,698
Tough titty. I fucked her, too.

1754
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,204
What?

1755
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:26,580
You little turds.

1756
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,458
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to infiltrate a gang like this?

1757
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,209
Do you see this nose?

1758
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:35,885
That is a fake nose.

1759
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,925
Do you want to wear a fake nose
on your fuckin' head

1760
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,847
for, like, months on end? Glue and shit?

1761
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:42,259
Worse things in the world.

1762
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,595
We had to get fuckin' tattoos
on our dicks, man.

1763
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,554
Hey, actually, I just said that

1764
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,311
- to mess with you.
- What?

1765
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:49,766
Looks tough.

1766
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,523
Look, we know what
it's like being undercover.

1767
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:53,820
Metro Police, Jump Street Division.

1768
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:54,987
Come on, you guys are Jump Street?

1769
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,110
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1770
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,157
That's funny, because
we were actually Jump Street.

1771
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,700
- What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1772
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:01,281
Oh, shit!

1773
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,204
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

1774
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,280
Oh, my God, dude!

1775
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,616
Get them!

1776
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,325
Motherfucker!

1777
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:10,871
Shoot them!

1778
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,289
Fuck that.

1779
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:25,718
That was a gun.

1780
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,061
Somebody definitely got shot.

1781
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:32,058
All right.

1782
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:35,570
Here, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

1783
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,197
Did I hit anything?

1784
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,911
You were shooting at the fuckin' ceiling.

1785
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:49,958
Doug.

1786
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:53,959
I know sometimes I was a jerk to you

1787
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:55,961
when we were undercover.

1788
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,265
It's just... I didn't feel good about myself.

1789
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:10,098
All that stuff I wore, like the bracelets,
the rings, the tight pants,

1790
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:12,853
was just so

1791
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:15,356
that people would think I'm cool.

1792
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,524
The only approval

1793
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,322
that I ever needed

1794
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:23,659
was my best friend.

1795
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,945
Thanks, man.

1796
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:46,557
The money's gone!

1797
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,009
Come on, let's roll.

1798
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,431
We gotta get out of here, man.

1799
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:50,762
Are you telling me it's on?

1800
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,972
- Let's do this.
- Let's make a baby.

1801
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,815
- What? What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1802
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:56,480
I was trying to sound cool. Sorry.

1803
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,406
That was crazy! You killed a guy!

1804
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,199
Oh, fuckin' shit!

1805
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,002
Hey, hey, we'll lose them in the prom! Go!

1806
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,563
Go, go, go, go!

1807
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:22,858
Where'd they go?

1808
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:26,399
Molly!

1809
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:32,492
Shit!

1810
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:37,994
- You want to drive?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

1811
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,249
Okay, cool.

1812
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,416
- Nice!
- Did it look cool when I did it?

1813
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,421
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

1814
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:48,546
How you guys doing back there, huh?

1815
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:50,090
God, I love high school!

1816
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,428
Best prom night ever!

1817
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,765
- Shoot them!
- Stay on them!

1818
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:00,608
I'm on them! I'm on them!

1819
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,232
Oh, good, you guys,
come hang out with me back here.

1820
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,735
- Oh, fuck, dude. Lisa, what are you doing?
- Did she pass out back there?

1821
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,157
Hey, you got a gun.
Why don't you shoot back there?

1822
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:13,746
Shoot that gun, shoot that gun!

1823
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,164
All right, one second!

1824
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,533
Just shoot someone, you bitch!

1825
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,287
Peek-a-boo!

1826
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:21,625
Give me my money!

1827
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:24,669
Fuck that! Fuck that! No! No!

1828
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:27,377
I can't do this!
I'm supposed to go to Berkeley!

1829
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:29,970
I'm gonna get the party started!

1830
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:31,551
- I'm gonna get the party started!
- No! No! Lisa, no!

1831
01:35:31,643 --> 01:35:34,760
Hey, I'm living my dream
of standing in a limo!

1832
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:35,969
What?

1833
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,147
- You're killing my dream!
- Come in.

1834
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:41,353
- What? I'm trying to party.
- Down!

1835
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:42,646
Bitch!

1836
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,066
What? Fuck!

1837
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,488
I'll kill you!

1838
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,689
Kill you!

1839
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,572
- No! No!
- Stay where you are.

1840
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:52,823
Go! Go, go!

1841
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,623
No! Stop!

1842
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,917
I'm not fucking kidding!
Look, I'm trying to shoot people!

1843
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,335
Will you stop! Just for two seconds!

1844
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:03,253
You're really hot and you're really slutty
and it's awesome,

1845
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:04,626
but I got to shoot people right now!

1846
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,127
You think I'm hot?

1847
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,439
I wanna... Oh, my God!

1848
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,150
Wait, guys! Call me!

1849
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:26,944
Let me know where you're ending up later.

1850
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,779
I'm almost out of ammo.

1851
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,985
We're fucked.

1852
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,036
Give me my money!

1853
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:37,701
I got an idea.

1854
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,498
- You still got those shotgun shells?
- Yeah.

1855
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:41,330
Pop Quiznos.

1856
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:46,332
What do you get when lithium batteries
react to potassium nitrate?

1857
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,963
That would be a covalent bond, brother.

1858
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:51,544
That's when two atoms, they share electrons.

1859
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,630
You see, they both need
what the other one has.

1860
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:55,181
That makes them stick together.

1861
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:56,508
Are you saying we're covalent bonds?

1862
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:58,681
What? No.

1863
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:00,804
We're not atoms, dude.

1864
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,573
- What's this?
- Tequila?

1865
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:22,833
I don't know, it was supposed to explode.

1866
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,041
Oh, shit!

1867
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,418
Where'd you learn how to do that, man?

1868
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:33,753
App chemistry, bitch.

1869
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,097
Come on, blondie.

1870
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,017
Molly!

1871
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,229
Drop your weapon!

1872
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,944
Don't you fuckin' pull that arm up.

1873
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,319
Don't.

1874
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:55,032
Looks like you're out of ammo, asshole!

1875
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:56,366
Come on! Get out here!

1876
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,160
- What? What's going on?
- All right.

1877
01:37:58,247 --> 01:38:01,455
All right, here's the deal.
Nobody moves, or she's gonna get hurt.

1878
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,874
Do you understand? Nobody move!

1879
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,747
- All right.
- Eric, help me.

1880
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,874
Don't you have a gun?

1881
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,210
All right, don't move!

1882
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:13,296
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- No!

1883
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:15,636
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Hey, no, no, I said don't move!

1884
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:22,059
- Oh, fuck, you shot him!
- Oh, God!

1885
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,261
Are you okay?

1886
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,971
You shot my partner, you motherfucker!

1887
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,140
I didn't mean to shoot you!
I meant to shoot him!

1888
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:30,188
Are you alive, buddy? You okay?
You took a bullet for me, man.

1889
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,691
Yeah, I'm feeling a little ambivalent
about that right now.

1890
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,865
Didn't you hear me? I said don't move!
I said that! You heard, right?

1891
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,067
Eric, you heard me!

1892
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,492
- I said don't move!
- Eric, help me!

1893
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,035
- You got this.
- Hey, hold still.

1894
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,331
Freeze!

1895
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:49,670
Shoot!

1896
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:53,757
Come on.

1897
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,386
You peaked in high school, motherfucker.

1898
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:00,882
Oh, shit.

1899
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:02,179
I shot him in the dick.

1900
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,682
You shot me in the dick!

1901
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:05,929
Oh, my God!

1902
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:07,138
Yes!

1903
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,098
Yes! Yes!

1904
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:10,353
Yes!

1905
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:12,359
You are under arrest!

1906
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:15,946
- It definitely came out my asshole!
- You have the right to remain silent!

1907
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:19,116
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1908
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:20,283
in a court of law!

1909
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,861
You have the right to an attorney!

1910
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,414
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you!

1911
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,543
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

1912
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,415
Fuck you! Bitch!

1913
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,209
Yes! Yes!

1914
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,123
We did it, man!

1915
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:35,298
We did it.

1916
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,546
God, I feel so good.

1917
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,047
We did it, man!

1918
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,551
You're a goddamn rock star.

1919
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,344
Do you feel that?

1920
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:44,425
God damn, you're so cool.

1921
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,310
You just shot him in the dick.

1922
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,937
I've never seen that. Who does that?

1923
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,395
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.

1924
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,939
I know I didn't say you were,
but you're smart.

1925
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,653
You're a smart guy, and you're thoughtful,

1926
01:39:56,741 --> 01:40:00,950
and you're sincere and you're sweet
and you're loyal...

1927
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:03,778
And I fuckin' cherish you.

1928
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:07,740
Should we high-five?

1929
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:15,335
My hand!

1930
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:18,342
Are you all right?
Should we get you to the hospital, man?

1931
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,260
- Yeah, I think we need to call somebody.
- Hey, call somebody!

1932
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:22,342
I got to get my dick sewn back on.

1933
01:40:22,433 --> 01:40:23,969
- You shut the fuck up.
- Hey, you shut up.

1934
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:25,766
- That's not funny.
- Is that it?

1935
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,135
What?

1936
01:40:28,648 --> 01:40:30,058
That's my dick!

1937
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:31,810
Pick up my dick! Please!

1938
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,186
No, we're not picking up your dick.

1939
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:34,687
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

1940
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,979
Oh, fuck!

1941
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:45,657
He's my friend.

1942
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,615
They don't serve vegan in jail, bitch.

1943
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,506
Hey.

1944
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,460
Molly...

1945
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:02,878
I'm really sorry.

1946
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,804
I know you wanted a guy to trust,
and I wanted to be that person so badly.

1947
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:10,970
And I let you down in a lot of ways.

1948
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:12,809
And...

1949
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,855
It's good that you're mad at me.

1950
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:20,195
I think it's good.
I think you should be mad at more guys,

1951
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:25,323
because you deserve a guy who's good
and who doesn't lie to you.

1952
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:28,154
And you should never settle
for less than that.

1953
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:30,455
There are good guys out there

1954
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:33,997
who aren't assholes like me.

1955
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,585
Thanks for saving my life,

1956
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,416
asshole.

1957
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:45,005
Put her there, partner.

1958
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,977
I'll come back later.

1959
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,910
We're, like, in the end of Die Hard right now,
but it's our actual life.

1960
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:09,282
It's crazy.

1961
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,705
- Number one or two?
- Three.

1962
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,374
- Sam Jackson one. Yeah!
- Sam Jackson style.

1963
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:19,168
Boom, motherfuckers!
What's going on? Come on!

1964
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,549
Where is he? There's my guy!

1965
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:28,013
There he is! That's him. That's him.

1966
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:29,381
- Enough.
- Too long on the hug.

1967
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:33,682
Congratulations, you crazy,
sick, vigilante motherfuckers.

1968
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:35,513
You got your first arrest, huh?

1969
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:38,481
- Look. Got something made for you.
- You didn't!

1970
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:40,776
- Come on. All right, all right.
- Enough. Enough.

1971
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,231
New assignment.

1972
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:45,360
Since you two cowboys love to drink booze,

1973
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:49,657
smoke weed with kids, and fuck
anything with a big ass in jeans

1974
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,078
with low self-esteem,

1975
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:55,124
I'm gonna send you to a place
where all that shit is allowed.

1976
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:56,417
Oh, I love Disneyland!

1977
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:59,837
You two sons of bitches
are going to college!

1978
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,539
- Yes!
- No!

1979
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,789
Boo-yah!

1980
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,665
Oh, my God!
You're like two Hardy Boys in one!

1981
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:38,510
Oh, fuck!

1982
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:29,413
Hey, Why are you here, Scott?

1983
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,965
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

1984
01:46:31,965 --> 01:46:50,965
Thank You For Watching
