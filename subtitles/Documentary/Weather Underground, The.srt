1
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:16,855
<i>That was refreshing.</i>

2
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:20,622
<i>I'm refreshed.</i>

3
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:24,365
<i>I'm refreshing.</i>

4
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,625
Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.

5
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,385
- And I'm Anne Howard.
- Good stuff today.

6
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>- We're going to be busy.</i>
<i>- We've got pop superstar Elton John.</i>

7
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,975
<i>He's going to be with us.</i>

8
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:51,927
<i>And so, too,</i>
<i>will best-selling author Al Franken.</i>

9
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,812
<i>Along with some</i>
<i>super-smart fourth graders...</i>

10
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:55,668
<i>with a great idea</i>
<i>for getting schoolbooks...</i>

11
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:57,011
<i>to kids who really need them.</i>

12
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,486
<i>But here's an idea</i>
<i>whose time has come.</i>

13
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,493
<i>Why don't we just start with...</i>

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,708
<i>... and fill the tart shell.</i>

15
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:09,263
<i>Bryant, you put some ice cream</i>
<i>on our angel food cake...</i>

16
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:12,150
<i>- How much do you want?</i>
<i>- As much as you like.</i>

17
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,453
<i>What are you laughing about?</i>
<i>This is Baked Alaska.</i>

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,926
<i>- This is supposed to be low-fat.</i>
<i>- It is!</i>

19
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,168
Did they call?

20
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,716
Someone from the show.
The Gumbel show. They didn't call?

21
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:42,067
Are you sure?

22
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,047
- Once again, we're out of time.
- Thank you. Already?

23
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,722
We still got lots more ahead
this morning. We're going to be back...

24
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,649
- What's up, dude?
- Next person in line.

25
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:18,831
What's up?

26
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:23,059
- Hey, can I get your autograph?
- Next in line.

27
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:26,735
I'm not who you think I am, so...

28
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,814
You're not the weather guy?

29
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,163
Dan Spritz?

30
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:31,470
Dave Spritz.

31
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:34,510
I'm not Dave Spritz, no.
But I hear that a lot.

32
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,214
You don't have to be a dick.

33
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:48,816
Look, can you just...
All right, I'm just waiting in line.

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,203
Bro, I can read
your vehicle registration form.

35
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,413
So, whatever.

36
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,647
Can you...

37
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:02,477
All right, can you give me a break?
I just wanted to wait in line.

38
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:06,387
You're on TV, bro.

39
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,630
You're on TV.

40
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,750
- You're on TV, bro.
- So what? You keep saying that.

41
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:13,903
So you're on TV, bro.

42
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,251
Go work in a bank or something...

43
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:16,595
if you don't wanna be cool to people.

44
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,249
Whatever. Just...
Can you get out of my face?

45
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:21,973
Can you get out of my face?

46
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,341
- Asshole.
- You want to say that to my face?

47
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,758
I thought you wanted me
to get out of your face.

48
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,675
<i>People recognize me sometimes.</i>

49
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,444
<i>Some are dicks.</i>

50
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,870
This is the same system that created
those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.

51
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:44,374
It's meant some
slightly warmer weather...

52
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,479
<i>I should cool out a little, I guess.</i>

53
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,129
<i>I mean, I'm not just this</i>
<i>two-dimensional guy they recognize.</i>

54
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,500
<i>I do have a relationship to them.</i>

55
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,150
<i>I let them know</i>
<i>what they have to deal with.</i>

56
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,938
But listen, these warmer temperatures
are not going to last.

57
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,072
This wind system will keep pushing
colder air across the Midwest...

58
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,215
<i>I guess that's why</i>
<i>they think they know me.</i>

59
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,497
<i>But they don't, really.</i>

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,633
...our Spritz Nipper of the week
with a high of just 24.

61
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,230
<i>I'm not a hill of beans.</i>

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,621
<i>I have a plan.</i>

63
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,184
Okay, see you then.

64
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,455
- What's this afternoon?
- You're picking up Shelly.

65
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,988
- Where?
- Chicago Dance.

66
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:20,786
Then you're taking your dad
to Northwestern.

67
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,814
At 3:00?

68
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:24,342
Do you have that <i>Hello America</i> stuff?

69
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,846
- The letter?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,977
You have Mike, too.
5:30 at the Norris house.

71
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,007
Okay.

72
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,309
Do they have my cell phone?

73
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:51,341
Well, they should have
all the numbers in case.

74
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,329
And am I supposed to call
that guy Dersen?

75
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:56,017
Didn't he want me to call to touch base?

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,487
Okay.

77
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:01,805
- Dad, can we stop here?
- What for?

78
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,876
I need a notebook for school.

79
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,618
I'll just walk home.

80
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,228
Okay.

81
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,135
- Can I have some money?
- You don't have any?

82
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,221
No.

83
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,309
You're 12 years old.

84
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:22,711
You shouldn't be walking around
without money, okay, Shelly?

85
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,182
You're not a kid.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,614
- How's your mom doing?
- She's good.

87
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,889
Can I have a pack of Lights?

88
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,195
- Regulars?
- The 100s.

89
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:44,331
Strikes?

90
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,392
How's Shelly?

91
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:14,934
She's doing great.

92
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,837
- Little angel.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,180
She's doing great.

94
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,953
- Who's an angel?
- Shelly.

95
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,929
Shelly is grossly overweight
and unhappy.

96
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,941
I'm concerned about her,
as I am Michael.

97
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,213
- David.
- Yeah, Dad.

98
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,827
Robert Spritzel?

99
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:05,814
Would you get me a paper...

100
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,852
- for the way back, Son?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,168
Fifteen minutes?

102
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,477
Yes. I'll see you then.

103
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,294
Fuck.

104
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

105
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,579
- It's getting cold.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,706
- What's the Nipper this week?
- Thursday.

107
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:33,709
Thursday's the Nipper? All right.

108
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:43,862
Here.

109
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,634
Yeah, can I get some change?

110
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,359
Not really.

111
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:53,102
Can I just get some quarters?
I just need a quarter for a paper.

112
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,483
Not really.

113
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,455
All right. I'll get something then.

114
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,294
All right.

115
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,453
Small coffee.

116
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,360
It's 80 cents.

117
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,116
No, it says $0.72.

118
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:14,132
After the whole everything, it's $0.80.

119
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,656
- Hey.
- Hi.

120
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,574
Where's the paper, David?

121
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,189
I didn't have enough money.

122
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,593
You bought a coffee.

123
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,724
- What?
- You bought a coffee.

124
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:36,879
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have
enough money after.

125
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,507
What?

126
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:43,090
I didn't have enough money
after I bought the coffee, so...

127
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,750
You should carry more than $1, David.

128
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,276
You're a grown man.

129
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,966
Let me just move this letter
from <i>Hello America.</i>

130
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,291
<i>My father is Robert King Spritzel.</i>

131
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>He won the National Book Award</i>
<i>when he was 28.</i>

132
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,011
<i>And the Pulitzer when he was 33.</i>

133
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,632
<i>President Carter called him</i>
<i>a national treasure.</i>

134
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:42,102
<i>They played racquetball</i>
<i>in a regular game.</i>

135
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,751
<i>He was a great writer.</i>

136
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,760
<i>But what was the cost?</i>

137
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,325
<i>Did he neglect his family?</i>

138
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:51,732
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

139
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:53,967
<i>He was a fine father.</i>

140
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,143
<i>More than that, really.</i>

141
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,222
It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.

142
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:02,702
She should find another interest
that would be more rewarding to her...

143
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,168
that she can take more from, David.

144
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:08,500
- We've talked about that.
- Well, you should do something, Son.

145
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,762
We've tried a couple things.
We'll keep trying, so...

146
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:13,807
How's Michael?

147
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,464
I think that was an overreaction
on Noreen's part.

148
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,120
I don't think he has a problem with pot.

149
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,819
Let's hope.

150
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,631
How's the weather business?

151
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,696
<i>Last September...</i>

152
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,661
<i>I had encouraged Shelly to explore</i>
<i>some other activities and interests.</i>

153
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,037
<i>She picked archery.</i>

154
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,553
<i>So I took her to an archery range</i>
<i>in Bolingbrook.</i>

155
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:46,630
<i>It was a 90-minute drive.</i>

156
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,606
<i>It was a 90-minute drive.</i>

157
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,117
<i>We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...</i>

158
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,320
<i>and a leather wrist/forearm guard.</i>

159
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,178
Okay, we'll take that.

160
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,038
<i>And private lessons.</i>

161
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,308
All right, Shelly.

162
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,166
You take that one...

163
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,267
and go right ahead.

164
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,861
All right. Okay, just remember...

165
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,025
pull it straight back,
parallel to your ear, okay?

166
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,037
You can do it, Shelly.

167
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:35,380
<i>We purchased a five-pack lesson plan.</i>

168
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,392
<i>We haven't been back.</i>

169
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:45,709
Hello?

170
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,058
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

171
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,068
<i>Can you pick up Mike</i>
<i>at the mall on North?</i>

172
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,141
I thought he was at a friend's house.
Paul Norris.

173
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,246
<i>They went to the mall.</i>
<i>He just called me.</i>

174
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,588
<i>- He finished his rehab.</i>
- Okay.

175
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:07,057
- That's one of my counselors.
- In your program?

176
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,947
Don Boden. He's pretty nice.

177
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,181
- He swears all the time, though.
- Swears?

178
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,279
Yeah. To relate, I guess.
But he's pretty nice.

179
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,278
Hey, Don.

180
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,164
- What are you guys doing?
- Looking for clothes.

181
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:32,565
You're just looking for clothes.

182
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,406
- Yeah.
- That's great.

183
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,068
I'm looking for clothes.

184
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:39,948
Okay.

185
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:42,575
- This is Paul.
- What's up?

186
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,606
Hey.

187
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,479
It's cold today.

188
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,209
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no kidding.

189
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,066
What is it, like, 20 or something?

190
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,312
Yeah, like 22.

191
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,712
Yeah. Fuck.

192
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:54,742
Yeah.

193
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,327
Hey.

194
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,977
- Yeah, I like this.
- It's good-looking.

195
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,079
Yeah, I've been looking
for something like this.

196
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,419
Chuck it in here.

197
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,908
- What?
- Chuck it in.

198
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,724
I'm loading up. I got a discount card.
I'll get it for you.

199
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:14,546
- That's all right.
- Mike, big deal.

200
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,232
- I can get it.
- Bro, I got a serious discount.

201
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,309
It's gonna cost, like, $7.

202
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:27,472
- I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

203
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,709
That's my dad. I'll see you later.

204
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:37,488
Sure. I'll catch you later.

205
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,918
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,145
- Who's that?
- Don Boden.

207
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,380
- Who's Don Boden?
- He's one of my counselors.

208
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,406
Oh.

209
00:14:57,623 --> 00:14:59,794
- That's a nice sweater.
- Thanks.

210
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,653
I'll walk you up.

211
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,621
Hi.

212
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,053
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.

213
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,615
- Hey, how was your thing?
- It was good.

214
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,606
- I'll see you, Dad.
- Okay, Mike.

215
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,432
- I think he's gonna be okay.
- Well, we'll see.

216
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,002
What's new?

217
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,666
Nothing much.

218
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,163
I got a feeler from <i>Hello America.</i>

219
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,051
- What?
- I got a feeler.

220
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,863
Dales is leaving it.
I might get called to audition.

221
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,210
New York.

222
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,411
- If I get called.
- That's good.

223
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:55,029
What about the kids?

224
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,033
It's just a shot in the dark, that's all.

225
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:01,456
Well, thanks for getting Mike.

226
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:04,468
I had to take my dad
to Northwestern for a test...

227
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,574
so I was right there, anyway.

228
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:09,677
- Oh, is he okay?
- I think so. It was just a test.

229
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:22,989
Noreen!

230
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,503
Are you okay?

231
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,675
Yeah.

232
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,433
Fuck! What are you doing?

233
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:35,382
I was just... You turned into it.

234
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,747
I think you cracked the glass.

235
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,825
So do you have everything you need?

236
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,203
<i>Yeah, we got everything.</i>

237
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:56,150
<i>We'll pare it down to three applicants</i>
<i>after we watch the tapes.</i>

238
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,385
<i>- We'll call if you're one, Dave.</i>
- Okay, Mark.

239
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,013
It's nice to make your acquaintance.

240
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,395
<i>- You, too. Take care.</i>
- Hey, weatherman!

241
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:02,509
All right. Bye.

242
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:03,542
Fuck!

243
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,254
Fuck.

244
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,438
David?

245
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:09,462
Hey.

246
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:13,617
- What happened?
- I got hit with a Frosty.

247
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:15,824
- Why?
- What?

248
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:19,659
Why did you get hit with a Frosty?
What is a Frosty?

249
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:23,181
A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.

250
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,511
Why would someone throw
a shake at you?

251
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:31,638
- That happens sometimes.
- People throw shakes at you?

252
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,101
Stuff. People throw stuff
at me sometimes...

253
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,859
- if they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

254
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:37,519
- If they don't like me, or something.
- They don't know you.

255
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,866
From TV.

256
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:41,300
But you just read the weather.

257
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,017
Well, I predict it.

258
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,544
You don't have a degree in meteorology.

259
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:48,915
I make suppositions, or I...

260
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:51,149
What are you doing?

261
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:54,156
- I walked over.
- You walked? It's freezing.

262
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,790
I have lymphoma, David.

263
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,478
What?

264
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,142
I have lymphoma.

265
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,231
- Doctor Pritch called.
- What?

266
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:09,204
I was having tremors.
That's the reason that I went in.

267
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,606
Pritch read my scans.

268
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:16,300
- What's the prognosis?
- Well, it's not good.

269
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,180
We'll talk about it this week.
I wanted to tell you.

270
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:21,579
Yeah.

271
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:25,906
I'll call you
after I've talked to Pritch again.

272
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,061
I'll drive you home.

273
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,745
I like the fresh air.

274
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,464
- Well, I'll walk back with you.
- No, that's okay.

275
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,525
Okay.

276
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,792
<i>Every couple months,</i>
<i>someone throws something at me...</i>

277
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:06,738
<i>a shake, a burrito once.</i>

278

<i>I know that.</i>

283
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,588
What kind of name is Spritz?

284
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:29,745
It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.

285
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,890
He's bullshit.

286
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,354
Well, I like him. He's handsome.

287
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,371
He's an asshole.

288
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,838
I don't like his face.

289
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,880

317
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:37,196
Hi.

318
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,486
Hi.

319
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:43,083
Today's the company party.
I thought I'd take the kids.

320
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,117
Oh.

321
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,118
Well, Mike is out.

322
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,161
- Shelly's home?
- She's walking Jackson.

323
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:53,647
- Where do you want to take them?
- The rink. WCH.

324
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,437
Hey.

325
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,181
Hey.

326
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,965
What?

327
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,412
Dave.

328
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:12,045
Hey, Tim.

329
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,117
- I didn't know you were coming.
- I always come to these...

330
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,722
when I can.

331
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:22,098
I have some time this week if you want
to go back up to Bolingbrook.

332
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:25,875
- What's in Bolingbrook?
- Sportsman's. The archery range.

333
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:28,755
- Okay.
- Okay? You wanna go?

334
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:30,891
Okay, I remember it.

335
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:33,453
Well, do you wanna go back up?

336
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,410
Sometimes.

337
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:48,021
What's gonna happen?

338
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:49,995
What?

339
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:52,268
What are we gonna do here?

340
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,032
Great stuff.

341
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,779
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, on your marks!</i>

342
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:11,091
Let's go team Spritz!

343
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,556
<i>Get set!</i>

344
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,445
<i>Go!</i>

345
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,517
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

346
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,298
- Just keep up, Shell. Come on.
- I'm trying to.

347
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,677
We should finish.

348
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,717
We're last. We're way last.

349
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,012
There's a lesson here. Let's finish.

350
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,254
I'm hurt.

351
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,845
Hon, you can do it.
You can finish. Okay?

352
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,333
I don't want you to quit.
It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?

353
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,805
All right.

354
00:24:58,806 --> 00:24:59,821
Let's go.

355
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,837
That's my girl. That's it.

356
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,781
Good. I'm proud of you.

357
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,357
Okay?

358
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,860
Yay! That was great!

359
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,341
Hon. Hon, you okay?

360
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,709
You shouldn't have made me finish!

361
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,236
That was like 100 yards
you made me go.

362
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,798
I'm not a football-jocker.

363
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,391
What happened?

364
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,567
Just... We got tangled up in a sack.

365
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,645
- What happened?
- She tore her ACL.

366
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,757
These fucking crutches are too long!

367
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,488
- What did you say?
- Shelly!

368
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,158
- Well, what were you doing?
- It was a picnic.

369
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:48,979
- And she tore something?
- ACL. MCL.

370
00:25:49,078 --> 00:25:50,223
Which?

371
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:52,493
Both.

372
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,737
- Dave!
- Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!

373
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,529
It was a fucking potato-sack race!

374
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,703
- That's where she got it.
- What?

375
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,694
"Fucking" this. "Fucking" that.

376
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,383
No, I never said that around her.

377
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:06,163
You don't know you have, Dave,
because you don't pay attention!

378
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,082
Fuck that.

379
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:09,900
What?

380
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,559
- Just fuck that, Noreen. You know...
- Dave.

381
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,255
- What?
- Step back.

382
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:16,566
- Step back?
- Step back.

383
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:19,024
What are you talking about, Russ?

384
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,362
- Russ...
- Step back right now.

385
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:25,264
- Fuck you, right now.
- Fuck you, Spritz.

386
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,316
Fuck you, fat asshole!

387
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:28,910
Dildo!

388
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:31,665
David, what are you doing?

389
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,806
I'm talking to my wife!
I'm talking to Noreen...

390
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,568
and this clown,
whose business this isn't.

391
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,125
You call me a dildo,
it is my business, Spritz.

392
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,579
You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!

393
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,021
Stop, Son.

394
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,332
Would you?

395
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,845
Why don't you go?

396
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:49,072
Why are you here? Are you okay?

397
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,062
I came to talk to Noreen.

398
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:54,480
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.

399
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:02,928
- Dave, what's going on, Son?
- It's nothing. Just...

400
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:04,787
Why are you here, anyway?

401
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:08,334
I came to talk to Noreen
about an issue concerning Shelly.

402
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:12,437
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm her parent, too. So? What?

403
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,434
Shelly dresses in clothing
not appropriate for her...

404
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,187
clinging stuff.

405
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:21,683
All kids wear...
Dad, it's a different generation.

406
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:24,085
They call her camel toe.

407
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,078
- What?
- Are you aware of that?

408
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,557
What?

409
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:32,109
That her colleagues call her camel toe.

410
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:33,458
What are you talking about?

411
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:35,281
It means the crease in her vagina...

412
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:37,586
that they can discern
through her clothing.

413
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:39,247
- What?
- Camel toe.

414
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,936
Yeah, I heard you.
I mean, how do you know they do that?

415
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,118
I heard it.

416
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:48,078
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday,
heard taunting, the older boys calling it.

417
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,321
- You might have heard wrong.
- No, I heard camel...

418
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:51,797
Okay, okay, look. I'll deal.

419
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:53,322
I want to get her through this ACL thing.

420
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,477
I'm gonna take her shooting.

421
00:27:54,582 --> 00:27:55,564
I'm gonna reapply her there.

422
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,907
I'm gonna get her talking to me.
I'm gonna get to her...

423
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,893
and I'm gonna work it out.

424
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:19,313
<i>A camel toe is pretty much</i>
<i>what Robert said it was.</i>

425
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:26,196
<i>It's basically just when you</i>
<i>can make out more than you should.</i>

426
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:31,437
<i>But it's the kind of thing...</i>

427
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,168
<i>She's 12, you know?</i>

428
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,016
<i>If you're around and paying attention,</i>
<i>you catch it...</i>

429
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:39,892
<i>then name-calling doesn't start,</i>
<i>and maybe smoking doesn't start.</i>

430
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:44,115
<i>And maybe she can just stay</i>
<i>a happy kid for a couple more years.</i>

431
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,163
<i>She shouldn't be unhappy.</i>

432
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:50,702
<i>Fuck. What did she ever do</i>
<i>to anybody? Shelly.</i>

433
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,384
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>

434
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,593
Hey.

435
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,839
<i>Listen.</i>

436
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,215
<i>Noreen, I was thinking...</i>

437
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,772
this pushing and pulling...

438
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,308
the tug-of-war we do sometimes...

439
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:14,515
<i>it's not good for the kids.</i>

440
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:15,661
It's not.

441
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:20,207
Noreen, let's see somebody.
Work it out. Let's...

442
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,837
- Fuck!
- Asshole!

443
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:24,462
Are you okay?

444
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,855
- I got hit with a pop!
<i>- What?</i>

445
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:30,223
A fucking...

446
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,331
A Big Gulp.

447
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:37,613
- Man.
<i>- Are you okay? Are you okay?</i>

448
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:39,758
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...

449
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:41,613
what I was saying...

450
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:44,078
See somebody?

451
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:48,305
We're going to begin
with some trust-building exercises.

452
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:50,991
The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet.
Let's go.

453
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,961
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.

454
00:29:58,678 --> 00:29:59,692
Okay.

455
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,889
Now, Noreen,
you're just gonna let yourself go...

456
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:06,481
and Dave is gonna catch you.

457
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,707
- Just go back?
- Yeah. Cross your arms up front.

458
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,399
- Now?
- Whenever you're ready.

459
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:13,708
Okay.

460
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,645
Good. Very good.

461
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,068
All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.

462
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:22,254
Okay.

463
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,450
Now I want you to name something...

464
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:30,545
that you did that affected your partner...

465
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:32,909
and that you're not proud of.

466
00:30:34,678 --> 00:30:38,355
I had this thing with porno
on the computer, sort of.

467
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:39,730
I got a little preoccupied...

468
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,350
Actually, I want you to write it down,
not say it.

469
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:43,381
Okay.

470
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:46,064
I want you to put it on the paper
that you got for a reason.

471
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,093
Okay.

472
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:52,973
Now make sure it's something
the other person doesn't know about...

473
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:55,024
that they don't know.

474
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,362
All right.

475
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:08,625
Then you are going to give it
to the other person...

476
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,267
and the other person
is never going to look at it.

477
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:15,690
Ever.

478
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:17,909
That's trust.

479
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:45,644
What's up?

480
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,537
<i>I thought Dave's science-fiction novel,</i>
<i>or whatever it was...</i>

481
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:01,044
<i>was stupid and sucked...</i>

482
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:03,029
<i>and was a waste of time.</i>

483
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,973
<i>It was embarrassing. Four years?</i>

484
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:26,283
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

485
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,138
Yeah.

486
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:42,131
It wasn't science fiction,
just so you know.

487
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:44,947
- What?
- It wasn't science fiction.

488
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:47,570
- What are you talking about?
- Did you even read it?

489
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,939
No. One of the side characters
was a scientist...

490
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:52,459
- but that's not even important...
- God damn it, Dave. God damn it!

491
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:55,283
What? I'm just asking,
did you ever even read it?

492
00:32:55,382 --> 00:32:58,000
It was hard to read.
It was poorly written.

493
00:32:58,453 --> 00:33:00,341
You're an asshole. God.

494
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:03,147
You are a champion asshole.

495
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:05,774
You're a real blue-ribbon fuck!

496
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:11,092
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.

497
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,150
I just want to know everything,
so I can make it work. That's why I...

498
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:19,118
- I want to try again.
- I'm not going back. You fucked it up.

499
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:21,134
I mean, our marriage.

500
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:22,540
What?

501
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:28,916
I want to try again.

502
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:32,207
Fuck you.

503
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:35,025
You know, Dave, you can't even...

504
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:39,724
You looked at it. That's dishonest.
It's crappy.

505
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,356
- Noreen.
- Hey, should I look at yours?

506
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:42,832
That's all right.

507
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,341
No. No, no, Noreen...

508
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:48,628
"Throughout marriage
BJs lacked enthusiasm.

509
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:51,631
"Had difference of opinion
over how important that was.

510
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:53,010
"I thought very."

511
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,167
You know what, Dave?

512
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:02,131
You want to know
why my BJs lacked enthusiasm?

513
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:04,462
I hated you.

514
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,898
I hated your hair.

515
00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:10,256
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.

516
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:13,775
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?

517
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,772
And that's why I lacked enthusiasm
when your cock was in my mouth.

518
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:21,198
Hey, hon.

519
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,715
Shelly, it's cold.

520
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:28,149
Your father said it was going to be
65 degrees today, but...

521
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,806
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

522
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,378
How did it go?

523
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:36,906
Good.

524
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:40,852
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.

525
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:58,000
Did you start my novel yet?

526
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:00,366
What's that?

527
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:03,471
<i>Breaking Point.</i> Did you start that?

528
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:07,342
No, I haven't yet, Son.
I've been preoccupied.

529
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:12,369
Well, that's good, actually.

530
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,404
I want to make some changes, so...

531
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:18,133
I'll give you the new one.

532
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,249
What did he say?

533
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,483
It's further bad news.

534
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,405
The metastatic plane
was too wide for radiation.

535
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,026
He suggested I see a Dr. Frost
in New York for clinical trials.

536
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,338
I got a feeler from <i>Hello America.</i>

537
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:01,743
National.

538
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:04,812
They're looking at 20 guys, but
they'll be cutting down to three soon.

539
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:06,543
It's a possibility.

540
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:09,263
The salary's great. It's real strong.

541
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:13,420
It would mean moving...

542
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,729
but I'd like to move everybody,
you know?

543
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,717
Renew things with Noreen.

544
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:20,052
We've been seeing somebody.

545
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:25,356
Let the kids start over in New York.

546
00:36:26,134 --> 00:36:29,581
Keep them away from some
of the bad influences here that...

547
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:31,473
Just get a fresh start.

548
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:35,121
I think that would be great.

549
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:37,996
- That would be terrific.
- Yeah.

550
00:36:38,453 --> 00:36:42,065
You could rededicate yourselves,
knuckle down.

551
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,754
What's this?

552
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:56,530
It's a Big Gulp.

553
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,284
You should say,
"We might see some snow...

554
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:09,453
"but it might shift south, miss us."

555
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,720
I can say it,
but I sort of wanna understand it.

556
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:13,901
Why is it?

557
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:16,500
Well, it's Canadian trade winds.

558
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,514
Behind all of it?

559
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,297
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind
out of Canada.

560
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:23,666
- So what's it gonna do?
- I don't know.

561
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,193
It's a guess.

562
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:29,461
It's wind, man. Blows all over the place.

563
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:33,327
<i>For some reason...</i>

564
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,088
<i>I don't know.</i>

565
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:37,909
<i>I went back to Bolingbrook.</i>

566
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:41,165
<i>I bought a three-month lesson plan.</i>

567
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,405
Hang on.
Before you do that, you know...

568
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:45,964
let's go out here
and do a little stretching exercises.

569
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,018
You got to rotate your...

570
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,620
<i>We warm up...</i>

571
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:53,198
<i>then do basic focus drills,</i>
<i>stuff you never think about.</i>

572
00:37:53,302 --> 00:37:55,985
<i>Like closing an eye</i>
<i>without moving your face...</i>

573
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,954
<i>because your face</i>
<i>is the anchor point for your hand...</i>

574
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:01,236
<i>that allows you to focus.</i>

575
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:08,042
<i>You have to keep your triangle</i>
<i>against a lot of force.</i>

576
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,717
<i>We do draws for a half hour,</i>
<i>then releases.</i>

577
00:38:29,013 --> 00:38:31,697
<i>That's called "loosing,"</i>
<i>when you release.</i>

578
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:47,756
Great shot! All right!

579
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,505
<i>It's hard...</i>

580
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:53,329
<i>but that one good shot</i>
<i>leaves you thinking...</i>

581
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,339
<i>you might be catching on.</i>

582
00:38:56,821 --> 00:38:57,998
<i>Do you lift weights?</i>

583
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:00,589
- What's that?
- Do you lift weights?

584
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:01,898
Yeah.

585
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:05,390
- Cardio?
- Yeah, you have to do both.

586
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:06,890
Yeah.

587
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:10,324
Are you on any kind of a program?

588
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:12,941
Yeah, our gym coach
gave us a program.

589
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,145
- That should be good.
- Yeah.

590
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,027
Yeah.

591
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:20,015
Fuck.

592
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,004
Hey.

593
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,331
- You know what would be interesting?
- What?

594
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,396
We should take some pictures.
Some shots, like...

595
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,636
some now,
some in a month or whatever...

596
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,651
see if you're making gains.

597
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,717
Yeah.

598
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,340
I've got my mom's Nikon.

599
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:38,195
- Whip your shirt off.
- Whip my shirt off?

600
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,557
Yeah.

601
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:57,550
You're shredded.

602
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:04,047
This is great, man.

603
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:06,667
We can compare this shit.

604
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,306
That's a Nikon FM?

605
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:12,236
Well, yeah.
You know something about cameras?

606
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,638
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.

607
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:17,482
A couple more.

608
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:22,160
My dad's gonna get the F3 for me...

609
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:24,781
if I can finish the program
and maintain a B average.

610
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:28,201
It's like a $600 camera.
I'm psyched about it.

611
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,192
I could loan that to you.

612
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:31,756
Yeah?

613
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:34,194
I could loan that shit to you if...

614
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,525
you wanted it earlier.

615
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:38,891
Okay.

616
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,713
This is gonna go a lot better.

617
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,727
Why?

618
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:55,307
Because I got you some bobtail arrows.
They're easier.

619
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:56,781
Why?

620
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,277
Well, they're thicker at the ends.

621
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:01,932
See? They taper toward the nock.

622
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,304
- What's the nock?
- The arrow end.

623
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:07,947
- What was I using before?
- Chested arrows.

624
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,339
That guy didn't know
what he was doing.

625
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,645
Okay.

626
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:19,309
Fletch it.

627
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,939
- What?
- Fix your arrow in.

628
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:24,147
That's the term.

629
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:28,298
Arrow makers were called fletchers.
That's where the last name came from.

630
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,826
Here. There's a little bit of a...

631
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,125
It takes a little while.
Right there, right below the nock.

632
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,677
There!

633
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:39,373
Awesome!

634
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,356
Okay, let's loose a few.

635
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,373
Let's show our stuff.

636
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,618
Aim about a half-foot above.

637
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:50,894
- Okay.
- You wait till you're steady.

638
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,355
- Are you aligned?
- Yeah.

639
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:55,217
Okay. Let it go.

640
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:57,516
Fuck!

641
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:59,627
Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.

642
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,480
We probably didn't home long enough.

643
00:42:02,581 --> 00:42:05,964
That's the pause between drawing back
and firing.

644
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:08,277
Let's pause a little longer.

645
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:12,846
What?

646
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,673
Nothing.

647
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,158
- Are you just not interested?
- Yeah.

648
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,551
Yeah, you're not interested?
Or, yeah, you are interested?

649
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:24,140
Yeah, I'm not. Really.

650
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,794
What was it you liked?
Let's think of it that way.

651
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:33,326
What?

652
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:36,944
What interested you
when you thought about archery?

653
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,279
When you wanted to do it.

654
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:43,408
I don't know.
Going hunting or something.

655
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:45,647
Hunting?

656
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:47,092
Yeah.

657
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,858
- For animals?
- Yeah.

658
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,641
You wanna shoot animals with arrows?

659
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,529
- Yeah.
- You do?

660
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,607
Yeah, to kill them.

661
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,608
But that's not archery. That's hunting.

662
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,814
That's called bowhunting.
That's what you wanted to do?

663
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,502
- Bowhunting?
- Yeah, I saw it on TV.

664
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:13,011
Well, I don't really wanna kill animals
with arrows...

665
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:15,530
so that's not going to happen.
We can target shoot, Shelly.

666
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,612
- It's not fun.
- It's a lot of fun.

667
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:20,138
- You have to apply yourself.
- Targets don't move.

668
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:21,903
Well, you know, Shelly...

669
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:24,306
you haven't really hit one yet.

670
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:25,484
You should support me.

671
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:28,524
I do support you. I support.

672
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,345
All right, forget it. Take your bracer off.

673
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:37,649
- We're not shooting anymore.
- Okay.

674
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:59,571
There's a chance
I might be going to New York.

675
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,880
A small chance.

676
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,940
You think you'd like to come,
maybe, if I go?

677
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:06,220
Yeah.

678
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,332
We could maybe go with Poppop.

679
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,771
- He's got some tests.
- Yeah.

680
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:56,818
Hey.

681
00:44:57,813 --> 00:44:59,122
Hey, Mike.

682
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:00,944
You don't look real good, Dad.

683
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:02,768
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

684
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:06,413
- What are you doing out here?
- Just sitting here.

685
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,770
Sometimes I just sit here
and look at the house.

686
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:13,329
- You park here sometimes?
- Yeah. Sometimes.

687
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:18,100
I just like to see you guys.
I see you playing guitar up there.

688
00:45:18,997 --> 00:45:20,142
Okay.

689
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:22,001
- Sounds good.
- Thanks.

690
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:26,191
- You know, Poppop...
- Yeah.

691
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:28,460
...he's sick.
- Mom said.

692
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,917
I was thinking about that, too.

693
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:37,938
Why do you have a bow and arrow
in there?

694
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:41,423
I was just out with Shelly.
I'm not playing favorites.

695
00:45:41,525 --> 00:45:43,892
I just think we need to be together
for a while.

696
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:45,549
Yeah, that's okay.

697
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:48,623
- How's your program going?
- Great.

698
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:59,339
You're gonna get that camera
if you keep it up!

699
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,777
<i>Look at this house.</i>

700
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:08,427
<i>Someone should be happy here.</i>

701
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,963
<i>How did I fuck this up?</i>

702
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:12,881
<i>Seriously.</i>

703
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:17,547
<i>What if I remembered the tartar sauce?</i>
<i>Would things be different?</i>

704
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,235
<i>Would Robert die</i>
<i>not thinking I'm a jerk-off...</i>

705
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:22,830
<i>jerk-fuck?</i>

706
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:26,155
Don't forget the tartar sauce.

707
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,243
Just call the order in, Noreen...

708
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,771
and quit busting
my you-know-what, okay?

709
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:32,114
You always half-listen
to what I'm saying to you!

710
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:34,001
I heard you. Tartar sauce.

711
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,617
<i>Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

712
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:44,683
<i>Tartar sauce, tartar sauce,</i>
<i>tartar sauce, tartar sauce.</i>

713
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,126
<i>Man, how I'd like</i>
<i>to put my face in there.</i>

714
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,748
<i>Right in there. Tartar sauce.</i>

715
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,883
<i>My hips are cold. Tartar sauce.</i>

716
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,507
<i>That's when you know it's cold.</i>

717
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:00,336
<i>I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.</i>

718
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:01,844
<i>A lot of guys don't.</i>
<i>Well, maybe they do.</i>

719
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:04,308
<i>Maybe that's just black guys.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

720
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,771
<i>What happened to the guy</i>
<i>who was trying to go around the world...</i>

721
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,047
<i>in a balloon? Did he make it?</i>

722
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:09,359
<i>I should put some espionage...</i>

723
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,283
<i>or stolen plutonium in my novel.</i>
<i>Tartar sauce.</i>

724
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,097
<i>Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!</i>

725
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:17,134
<i>Neil Young?</i>
<i>Why am I thinking about Neil Young?</i>

726
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:19,309
<i>Neil Diamond. Neil.</i>
<i>There's not a lot of famous Neils.</i>

727
00:47:19,412 --> 00:47:21,005
<i>Is this Wednesday?</i>
<i>I wish I had two dicks.</i>

728
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:23,956
<i>I thought the whole family was going</i>
<i>to learn Spanish together this year.</i>

729
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:25,613
<i>That never really happened.</i>

730
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,704
<i>I haven't had a Spanish omelet</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

731
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:27,691
<i>I haven't had a Spanish omelet</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

732
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,129
<i>Here we go.</i>

733
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,744
Anything else?

734
00:47:34,612 --> 00:47:35,660
No.

735
00:47:40,501 --> 00:47:42,443
Where is the tartar sauce?

736
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,962
They were out. They apologized.

737
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:49,230
- They were cool about it.
- They were out?

738
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:53,298
- They were out.
- They were out of tartar sauce?

739
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:55,920
I'm calling them.

740
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,603
Fuck, Noreen.

741
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,025
It's not about the tartar sauce.
It's about you. You don't care!

742
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,815
I don't care about tartar sauce!

743
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,444
I'm trying to make a living for this family.

744
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:08,653
I've got work things to think about
and pressure.

745
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:10,829
Tartar sauce?
Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?

746
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,307
You are so selfish!

747
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,947
I would do anything for you...

748
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:20,361
- Everything you say is right.
...as if we're not happy.

749
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:26,578
- I'm trying to take care of the family.
- You come in here, looked in my face...

750
00:48:26,677 --> 00:48:27,789
and you lied to me, Dave.

751
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:30,543
Do you think I'm a moron? "They're out."

752
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:34,700
<i>We both just think it's better</i>
<i>for the kids.</i>

753
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:38,575
David, sacrifice is...

754
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:45,967
To get anything of value,
you have to sacrifice.

755
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:48,621
I know that, Dad. But I think
if we continue down this road...

756
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,318
it's going to be too detrimental
for the kids.

757
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:52,046
It's just too hard.

758
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:55,826
Do you know that the harder thing to do
and the right thing to do...

759
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,475
are usually the same thing?

760
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,381
Nothing that has meaning is easy.

761
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,357
Easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.

762
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:24,077
I'm not comfortable
with an 18-degree variance.

763
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:26,545
- Why even forecast?
- It's a technical art...

764
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,532
not a science. People get that.

765
00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:31,825
- Let's narrow it down, Tim.
- Dave, it's random.

766
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:33,684
We do our best.

767
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:35,981
A day can have that variance.

768
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,657
- Dave, phone call.
- Tell him to take a message.

769
00:49:40,757 --> 00:49:42,164
It's <i>Hello America.</i>

770
00:50:03,988 --> 00:50:05,395
Can we shop here?

771
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,076
Sure. Where is that?

772
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:09,901
- Bendel.
- All right.

773
00:50:22,293 --> 00:50:23,275
Dad?

774
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:29,804
You know what? Let's go for a walk.
Take a break.

775
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:31,437
You don't like it?

776
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:34,508
No, maybe we'll come back later.
We'll just take a break.

777
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:41,228
- So how's everything going?
- Good.

778
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:43,252
- How's school?
- Good.

779
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,523
- Dance school?
- Good.

780
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:49,809
You know, when I was in school...

781
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:53,836
I guess the hardest thing
was how other kids can be a little mean.

782
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,266
Names and stuff.

783
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,490
Do you ever get called names?

784
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,001
Like what?

785
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't know, like "dummy"
if you miss a question...

786
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:07,824
or "camel toe."

787
00:51:08,404 --> 00:51:10,160
Yeah. Camel toe.

788
00:51:12,532 --> 00:51:14,092
Do you know why?

789
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,664
Why what?

790
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:18,452
Why you get called camel toe?

791
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:20,525
Yeah.

792
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:24,492
Why, hon?

793
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:28,620
Because camel toes are tough.

794
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:32,978
They can walk all over the desert
and all the hot rocks.

795
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:35,312
I'm tough.

796
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,294
That's right. It's because they're tough.

797
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:45,357
You ready to shop again?

798
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,291
I think they make car tires
out of camel toes.

799
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,629
Yeah, I think I heard that.

800
00:51:57,556 --> 00:52:00,458
I just think you're more grown-up
than that other stuff.

801
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:02,026
I don't think I like it.

802
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:04,075
But that was sort of kid stuff.

803
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,864
I like this dress. It's New York style.

804
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:08,976
Let me see.

805
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:17,044
Hey.

806
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:20,593
- You like it?
- I like it. Yeah.

807
00:52:20,948 --> 00:52:22,475
Do you like it?

808
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,402
Yeah, I think I do.

809
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,981
Do you feel comfortable in it?
Because, you know, that's the thing.

810
00:52:28,405 --> 00:52:29,811
Yeah, it's comfy.

811
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:31,920
You look great.

812
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:33,968
You look all grown-up.

813
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:36,275
Okay, change. Let's get some more.

814
00:52:36,372 --> 00:52:37,321
Really?

815
00:52:37,428 --> 00:52:40,330
Sure, and then we'll go show Poppop
some of this stuff.

816
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:09,037
Poppop! Poppop!

817
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:12,364
- Check this out.
- That's nice, hon.

818
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:14,672
I know. I got a lot more, too!

819
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:18,157
Dave.

820
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:20,880
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right.

821
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:23,764
Mike got arrested.

822
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,675
What?

823
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:30,670
He fucked his drug counselor's car up.
They were on their way to a movie.

824
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,744
A movie?

825
00:53:41,364 --> 00:53:44,780
Mike said he was trying to suck him off.

826
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,098
Then Mike chucked a rock
through his car's passenger window.

827
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:54,921
What is this sucking
and chucking rocks?

828
00:53:55,028 --> 00:53:56,719
I mean, what is this?

829
00:53:58,164 --> 00:53:59,626
What did the guy say?

830
00:53:59,732 --> 00:54:02,994
He said Mike tried to jack his wallet.

831
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,199
What is this sucking and chucking
and jacking and fucking-up, Son?

832
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:15,273
He's 15 years old!

833
00:54:16,148 --> 00:54:17,555
What is this shit?

834
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:21,004
- Where is he?
- He's at home.

835
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:22,832
What is this?

836
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:24,364
Fuck.

837
00:54:34,677 --> 00:54:36,586
Are you ready for the doctors?

838
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:38,312
Yeah.

839
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,660
Got you! You're dead.

840
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:45,652
I think just what he said happened,
happened.

841
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,603
I think the guy was trying
to make a move on him...

842
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,675
and Mike got surprised and scared.

843
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,010
Hon, will you get me a pop
from the pop machine?

844
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,178
<i>Can you get your pop later?</i>

845
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:59,309
I'm trying to send Shelly away
so she doesn't have to hear this.

846
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:01,998
<i>This guy says that Mike</i>
<i>tried to steal his wallet...</i>

847
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,329
<i>and that's why they were fighting</i>
<i>when the police came.</i>

848
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:08,363
- How is he?
<i>- He's scared. I don't know.</i>

849
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,890
I can come home.

850
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:14,738
<i>No, stay there</i>
<i>and do your</i> Hello America <i>thing.</i>

851
00:55:15,444 --> 00:55:17,549
- You act like...
<i>- What?</i>

852
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,497
Like Mike's in trouble...

853
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:22,091
'cause I'm interviewing
at <i>Hello America.</i> Give me a break!

854
00:55:22,196 --> 00:55:23,690
I don't have any money.

855
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:28,720
<i>Russ is helping anyway.</i>

856
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,984
- That dildo's what?
<i>- He's been a big help, okay?</i>

857
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:33,834
<i>You can stay there.</i>

858
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,467
Fine. I'll stay here with camel toe.

859
00:55:35,572 --> 00:55:37,481
You just take care of stuff there!
You take care of it!

860
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:39,279
<i>Camel toe? What are you talking about?</i>

861
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,551
I had to find out how kids
taunt Shelly about that...

862
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:42,862
and you're letting her get taunted.

863
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,971
You're not paying attention
to the way she goes to school!

864
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:46,483
<i>I take care of everything around here.</i>

865
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:47,563
Well, I bought her new stuff.

866
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:49,042
I bought her a bunch
of brand new stuff...

867
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,562
- and she told me all kinds of stuff, so...
<i>- Don't be such a dick.</i>

868
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:53,097
<i>You have her for one weekend.</i>

869
00:55:53,204 --> 00:55:55,026
You know what, Noreen? Just...

870
00:55:55,412 --> 00:55:58,641
Fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike.

871
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,042
<i>He's sleeping,</i>
<i>and don't talk to me like that.</i>

872
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,344
More dildo, more fucking...

873
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:06,513
Listen, I have to go, Noreen.
I'll talk to you soon.

874
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:07,790
<i>Whatever.</i>

875
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:12,268
I thought you were trying
to improve matters with Noreen...

876
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,779
if not reconcile.

877
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:15,818
I am. What did Frost say?

878
00:56:16,212 --> 00:56:18,798
He wants to speak to me
in about 10 minutes.

879
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,526
It was cold in there.

880
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,014
Would you get me a coffee, Dave?
So I can warm up.

881
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,678
Yeah, Dad.

882
00:56:25,941 --> 00:56:28,079
Dildo. Jacking...

883
00:56:39,092 --> 00:56:40,139
Hi.

884
00:56:40,341 --> 00:56:41,518
Hi. $0.65.

885
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,028
Fuck.

886
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:50,092
- Hey.
- Hi.

887
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,689
Poppop went in?

888
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:53,738
- Yeah.
- Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee.

889
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,305
Do you have my wallet?

890
00:56:59,156 --> 00:57:00,814
You only had $1.

891
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,466
You should carry more money than that.

892
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:05,644
I know.

893
00:57:16,756 --> 00:57:20,171
Well, did he say
whether any more therapy could...

894
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:23,536
No, he didn't have a different opinion
than Pritch.

895
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:27,978
There's too large a plane.

896
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:30,835
It's a no-go.

897
00:57:32,437 --> 00:57:34,803
- Well, did he say...
- He said months.

898
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:40,462
- Did he say a lot of months?
- Well, what's a lot?

899
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:44,176
I don't know, like 12.

900
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,403
Well, if he meant 12,
he probably would've said a year, Son.

901
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:52,268
I think he meant three or four.

902
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,715
Well, you have a big day tomorrow.

903
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,497
The <i>Hello America</i> show.

904
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:18,604
Yeah.

905
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:23,632
<i>... and here comes the grand marshal,</i>
<i>Dave Spritzel.</i>

906
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:25,488
<i>Didn't his name used to be Spritz?</i>

907
00:59:25,588 --> 00:59:26,700
<i>Yeah, it sure did...</i>

908
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,943
<i>but he changed it back</i>
<i>to the original Spritzel.</i>

909
00:59:29,044 --> 00:59:30,059
<i>Why the change, Ed?</i>

910
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,269
<i>Well, when you're national,</i>
<i>there's no more up.</i>

911
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:33,387
<i>So he changed it back...</i>

912
00:59:33,492 --> 00:59:37,071
<i>like John "Cougar" Mellencamp.</i>
<i>He's realer now and more authentic.</i>

913
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:40,172
<i>- Who's that with him?</i>
<i>- Those are the wife and kids.</i>

914
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,697
<i>Didn't they used to have</i>
<i>a real fucked-up relationship?</i>

915
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:45,225
<i>Not anymore.</i>
<i>That's something else that changed.</i>

916
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,339
<i>It seems</i>
Hello America <i>with Byrant Gumbel...</i>

917
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:48,818
<i>gave them all a fresh start...</i>

918
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:53,323
<i>and an increase in salary to $980,000</i>
<i>outside promotional fees...</i>

919
00:59:53,428 --> 00:59:56,559
<i>which puts Dave</i>
<i>well over $1 million a year.</i>

920
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,140
<i>- That got his wife's ear, I bet.</i>
<i>- You bet. That buys a lot of face time.</i>

921
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:02,578
<i>Now everything's great.</i>

922
01:00:02,676 --> 01:00:05,425
<i>- Did he say that?</i>
<i>- Yeah, he told me that...</i>

923
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,093
Hello, America.

924
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:51,789
<i>What are your hobbies?</i>

925
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:54,189
Writing. Archery.

926
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:01,455
And you don't have a degree
in meteorology?

927
01:01:02,356 --> 01:01:04,145
General communications.

928
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:07,597
Well, listen. We've seen a lot
of your work in Chicago.

929
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,627
Okay.

930
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,307
We think you're great, refreshing.

931
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,253
We love the Spritz Nipper.

932
01:01:14,356 --> 01:01:15,468
Great.

933
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,638
Why don't we run some blue screen,
and we'll do a walk-through on the set?

934
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,722
Great.

935
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,231
Here's your station.
We'll run some screen.

936
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:31,219
Give me a second to set it up.

937
01:01:57,716 --> 01:01:59,025
- Hi.
- Hi.

938
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:01,457
I'm waiting for Mark.
I'm running some screen.

939
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:03,050
- Dave.
- Bryant.

940
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:05,129
- Nervous?
- No.

941
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,987
- Sure?
- Yeah.

942
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:11,346
You look just a little bit nervous.

943
01:02:11,443 --> 01:02:12,687
It's not nerves.

944
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,995
- Other shit.
- Yeah.

945
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:20,816
...mild in the Northwest.

946
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,509
As this high-pressure system
gives way...

947
01:02:22,611 --> 01:02:24,106
we'll see warm temperatures
in New Mexico...

948
01:02:24,212 --> 01:02:25,870
<i>I know it's not neurosurgery...</i>

949
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:29,070
<i>but green screen is the one part</i>
<i>of my job that's not really easy.</i>

950
01:02:29,172 --> 01:02:31,725
...35 in New York with colder
temperatures west to Michigan...

951
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:34,064
<i>You need a sense of where put-ons</i>
<i>will come from...</i>

952
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:35,855
<i>and a pretty strong sense of scale.</i>

953
01:02:35,955 --> 01:02:37,963
...there are travel advisories
in New Orleans and Atlanta.

954
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:39,017
It's pretty heavy weather...

955
01:02:39,124 --> 01:02:40,847
<i>I've gotten real good at it.</i>

956
01:02:41,076 --> 01:02:43,443
<i>I thought everything went over</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

957
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,654
So we'll let you know
in a couple of days.

958
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:49,836
Okay.

959
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,974
This is my father, Robert Spritzel,
and my daughter.

960
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:54,577
We're a little late for our plane...

961
01:02:54,676 --> 01:02:55,854
so we thought we'd leave from here.

962
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:58,029
- Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late.
- That's cool.

963
01:02:58,131 --> 01:02:59,560
- So you've got the numbers?
- Yes.

964
01:02:59,668 --> 01:03:01,904
There's a built-in with Purina
I forgot. $42,000.

965
01:03:02,004 --> 01:03:02,931
Okay.

966
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,165
- What's a built-in?
- It's a compulsory endorsement...

967
01:03:05,268 --> 01:03:07,024
if I'm offered the job.

968
01:03:07,379 --> 01:03:09,419
- Dog food?
- Yeah. Pet products.

969
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:13,715
Dave doesn't own a pet.

970
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,823
Well, I have Jackson.

971
01:03:16,244 --> 01:03:18,731
Jackson lives with your wife and kids.

972
01:03:21,523 --> 01:03:23,181
We'll let you know.

973
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:42,124
- Russ is here.
- Okay.

974
01:03:42,836 --> 01:03:45,203
- Where's Mike?
- Inside.

975
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:53,002
- Dave.
- Hi, Russ.

976
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:57,394
He's upstairs.
He's still pretty upset about it.

977
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:00,458
- Did he talk about it?
- Yeah.

978
01:04:01,556 --> 01:04:04,589
- To you?
- He's told us what happened.

979
01:04:04,692 --> 01:04:07,342
He was with his counselor, Don Boden.
I guess he...

980
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:10,575
<i>I don't really know why</i>
<i>what happened next happened.</i>

981
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:14,924
<i>He was talking about my son,</i>
<i>and I was taking my gloves off.</i>

982
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:17,552
Apparently, they were going to a movie...

983
01:04:17,844 --> 01:04:19,305
- What the fuck?
- Why are you here?

984
01:04:19,412 --> 01:04:20,873
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

985
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,769
- I'm helping Noreen!
- Why are you helping?

986
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:24,755
- Dave.
- Son. Jesus.

987
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:33,485
<i>Here's something that...</i>

988
01:04:33,587 --> 01:04:36,402
<i>if you want your father to think</i>
<i>you're not a silly fuck...</i>

989
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,282
<i>don't slap a guy across the face</i>
<i>with a glove.</i>

990
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,617
<i>Because if you do that,</i>
<i>that's what he will think...</i>

991
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:45,293
<i>unless you're a nobleman or something</i>
<i>in the 19th century...</i>

992
01:04:45,396 --> 01:04:46,825
<i>which I'm not.</i>

993
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,209
- You can get inside okay, Dad?
- Yeah.

994
01:05:23,856 --> 01:05:26,277
<i>"When my back's against the wall,</i>
<i>I order a chink call-girl...</i>

995
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:27,660

<i>to help her with Robert dying.</i>

1005
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,658
<i>It's where someone's family</i>
<i>and friends gather...</i>

1006

<i>like they might at the person's funeral...</i>

<i>only when the person's alive,</i>
<i>so they can see everybody.</i>

1008
01:06:50,032 --> 01:06:51,559
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

1009
01:06:51,664 --> 01:06:53,158
Hey, what's the Nipper?

1010
01:06:53,264 --> 01:06:55,752
- What's that?
- What's the Nipper this week?

1011
01:06:55,856 --> 01:06:57,133
I don't know.

1012
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:58,475
You don't know yet?

1013
01:06:58,576 --> 01:06:59,918
Come on, man.

1014
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,990
What? I just asked you
about the Nipper.

1015
01:07:02,096 --> 01:07:04,943
Monday, okay? That's the... Okay?

1016
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,262
- What's your problem?
- It's February, man. It's cold.

1017
01:07:10,576 --> 01:07:11,721
Fuck!

1018
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,768
- Fuck you, then.
- Fuck you!

1019
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:16,744
Do you know what variance is?

1020
01:07:16,848 --> 01:07:19,052
You think you could pick out a day...

1021
01:07:19,152 --> 01:07:21,967
a week ahead and give a realistic...
You know?

1022
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,694
- Did you know that?
- Weatherman!

1023
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,036
God! Fuck!

1024
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:36,171
I have kids!

I have to go see my kids!

1026

You put fucking pie shit on my coat!

1027
01:07:41,968 --> 01:07:44,903
I have to see my kids

1028
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:46,761
Go see your kids with shit on you!

Hey, calm down, man!

1030

- Hello?
<i>- Hello? Dave?</i>

1033
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,764
- What?
<i>- It's Mark Dersen from</i> Hello America.

1034
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:13,993
Hi, Dave.

1035
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:26,950
- Take care.
- Okay.

1036
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,800
Noreen.

1037
01:08:30,288 --> 01:08:31,532
- Hi.
- Hi.

1038
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:35,405
Shelly looks nice.

1039
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:38,060
We bought that in New York.

1040
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,232
Yeah, I know. That's why I said it.

1041
01:08:40,336 --> 01:08:41,743
It's very nice.

1042
01:08:43,856 --> 01:08:47,718
Noreen, I got offered the show.
<i>Hello America</i> with Bryant Gumbel.

1043
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:50,470
Well, that's great.

1044
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:56,141
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

1045
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,393
It's a pretty substantial salary,
and you know the venue. It's big.

1046
01:09:00,496 --> 01:09:02,951
It's a pretty big salary jump, I guess.

1047
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:07,530
$1.2 million all in, Noreen.

1048
01:09:10,096 --> 01:09:11,983
Can we think about that?

1049
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:13,641
What?

1050
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:19,116
What that kind of change
could be like for everybody.

1051
01:09:19,536 --> 01:09:21,478
Mike, Shelly, you know?

1052
01:09:23,888 --> 01:09:26,921
If we thought about trying again.

1053
01:09:31,312 --> 01:09:33,319
Dave, I'm marrying Russ.

1054
01:11:18,832 --> 01:11:21,483
<i>Accuracy equals focusing on a point.</i>

1055
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,095
<i>Gravity pulls an inch a yard.</i>

1056
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:27,758
<i>You point up.</i>

1057
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:33,709
<i>But you have to factor in wind...</i>

1058
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:34,731
<i>But you have to factor in wind...</i>

1059
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:37,035
<i>which is the most difficult part.</i>

1060
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,452
Noreen.

1061
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,542
<i>I had to go in anyway.</i>

1062
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:57,135
<i>It was time for my speech.</i>

1063
01:12:04,431 --> 01:12:06,853
<i>And that's what I know</i>
<i>about Robert Spritzel.</i>

1064
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,531
<i>Forbearance, charity, wisdom.</i>

1065
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:15,375
<i>There are too few like him.</i>

1066
01:12:15,984 --> 01:12:18,188
<i>And now Robert's son, David.</i>

1067
01:12:31,663 --> 01:12:32,972
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1068
01:12:37,008 --> 01:12:39,342
<i>Many of you came</i>
<i>from long distances...</i>

1069
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:43,720
<i>and I know I speak for my mom</i>
<i>and Noreen...</i>

1070
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,596
<i>and my family, Mike and Shelly,</i>
<i>when I say thank you.</i>

1071
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,851
<i>When I think of my dad,</i>
<i>I think of Bob Seger's</i> Like a Rock.

1072
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,287
<i>And then the power went out.</i>

1073
01:13:13,903 --> 01:13:17,286
<i>Then, when the lights came back on</i>
<i>in 40 minutes...</i>

1074
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:20,868
<i>everyone had pretty much forgotten</i>
<i>that I was talking...</i>

1075
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:25,260
<i>and we never finished</i>
<i>that part of the thing.</i>

1076
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:28,969
<i>So my speech was,</i>
<i>"When I think of my dad...</i>

1077
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,460
<i>"I think of Bob Seger's</i> Like a Rock."

1078
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,502
<i>That's all I said</i>
<i>at my dad's living funeral...</i>

1079
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:38,021
<i>something about Bob Seger.</i>

1080
01:13:56,272 --> 01:13:59,850
<i>You've reached 272-7638.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1081
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:04,680
<i>Dave, it's Mark Dersen</i>
<i>from</i> Hello America.

1082
01:14:05,328 --> 01:14:08,557
<i>Can you give me a call back?</i>
<i>I called a couple of times Friday...</i>

1083
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,689
<i>and I'm wondering</i>
<i>why you haven't called me back.</i>

1084
01:14:11,984 --> 01:14:15,213
<i>If I need to move down on my list,</i>
<i>look, I need to know. Okay?</i>

1085
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:18,410
<i>It's not "Hello, you know,</i>
<i>whatever, Orlando."</i>

1086
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:21,384
<i>Look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave.</i>

1087
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:23,943
<i>I just need to hear from you.</i>
<i>Give me a call.</i>

1088
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:35,401
Your phone's ringing.

1089
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:38,441
I know.

1090
01:14:42,031 --> 01:14:43,919
Why aren't you getting it?

1091
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,755
It's the Bryant Gumbel thing.

1092
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,080
So why aren't you getting it?

1093
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:54,191
Did you bring that stuff?

1094
01:14:54,736 --> 01:14:56,143
It's by the door.

1095
01:15:03,984 --> 01:15:05,577
You should get it.

1096
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,734
<i>Fuck.</i>

1097
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:21,733
<i>It was a McDonald's hot apple pie.</i>

1098
01:15:22,191 --> 01:15:23,598
<i>They're not kidding.</i>

1099
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,515
<i>It was hot.</i>

1100
01:15:49,135 --> 01:15:51,623
<i>The other thing that gets to people...</i>

1101
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:54,090
<i>that leads to pies, I guess...</i>

1102
01:15:54,575 --> 01:15:56,779
<i>are these catch phrases</i>
<i>we're required to use...</i>

1103
01:15:56,879 --> 01:15:58,919
<i>to single the program out.</i>

1104
01:15:59,599 --> 01:16:01,487
<i>It gets under people's skin.</i>

1105
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:02,696
<i>Spritz Nipper.</i>

1106
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:09,935
<i>But the whole thing about all of it...</i>

1107
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,974
<i>all the getting hit with stuff...</i>

1108
01:16:12,687 --> 01:16:15,306
<i>the whole thing is, who gets hit</i>
<i>with a fucking pie, anyway?</i>

1109
01:16:15,407 --> 01:16:17,317
<i>Did anyone ever throw a pie</i>
<i>at Thomas Jefferson?</i>

1110
01:16:17,423 --> 01:16:19,463
<i>Or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it.</i>

1111
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:22,088
<i>But this is like the ninth time I got...</i>

1112
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:24,878
<i>Clowns get hit with pies.</i>

1113
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:41,294
- Fuck!
- I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit!

1114
01:16:50,448 --> 01:16:52,619
I saw you buy this at the mall
on North Avenue!

1115
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,410
And I'm telling the cops, too!

1116
01:16:54,511 --> 01:16:57,827
So you can cut your crap
about Mike jacking your wallet!

1117
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:05,290
He's just a kid. See!

1118
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:08,264
He looks grown, but he's just a kid!

1119
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:11,534
You fucking asshole.

1120
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:19,275
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like...</i>

1121
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,758
<i>Harriet Tubman, the founder of</i>
<i>the Underground Railroad.</i>

1122
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:25,704
<i>I'll bet you a million fucking dollars.</i>

1123
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:57,482
<i>The first time I was struck</i>
<i>with something...</i>

1124
01:17:58,031 --> 01:18:00,398
<i>a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers...</i>

1125
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,301
<i>I was standing next to a garbage pail.</i>

1126
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,817
<i>I thought it might've been an accident,</i>
<i>that they were throwing it out.</i>

1127
01:18:07,919 --> 01:18:10,821
<i>The second time,</i>
<i>it hit me square on the chin...</i>

1128
01:18:11,023 --> 01:18:12,430
<i>a soft taco.</i>

1129
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,279
<i>Then, pop.</i>

1130
01:18:15,184 --> 01:18:16,590
<i>A falafel.</i>

1131
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:19,147
<i>McNuggets.</i>

1132
01:18:21,103 --> 01:18:22,663
<i>Always fast food.</i>

1133
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:25,291
<i>Fast food.</i>

1134
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:29,350
<i>Shit people would rather throw out</i>
<i>than finish.</i>

1135
01:18:29,647 --> 01:18:31,556
<i>It's easy. It tastes all right...</i>

1136
01:18:31,663 --> 01:18:34,729
<i>but it doesn't really provide you</i>
<i>any nourishment.</i>

1137
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:38,213
<i>I'm fast food.</i>

1138
01:18:39,759 --> 01:18:40,741
Hey.

1139
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,533
Hey.

1140
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:48,686
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

1141
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:54,191
Am I gonna get in trouble?
I didn't do anything.

1142
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,050
You're not in trouble. I took care of it.

1143
01:19:00,912 --> 01:19:02,155
I got on him.

1144
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:05,508
I let him know
we're not messing around.

1145
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:06,955
I whaled on him.

1146
01:19:07,695 --> 01:19:08,710
What?

1147
01:19:09,423 --> 01:19:11,790
I caught him one clean one for sure,
on the forehead...

1148
01:19:11,887 --> 01:19:14,189
and then I fucking whaled on him.

1149
01:19:14,927 --> 01:19:16,203
Seriously?

1150
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:20,871
He's not going to say you stole anything,
and you're not in trouble.

1151
01:19:28,783 --> 01:19:31,500
- What are you eating?
- Corn dog.

1152
01:19:46,992 --> 01:19:49,031
You're a kid, Mike. Fuck.

1153
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:51,726
- I'm not a kid.
- You are a kid.

1154
01:19:51,823 --> 01:19:56,013
Don't put yourself in grown-up situations
again until you're a grown-up.

1155
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:57,739
- Okay.
- Okay?

1156
01:19:57,839 --> 01:19:58,887
Yeah.

1157
01:20:01,007 --> 01:20:03,822
- Do you want me to get you a corn dog?
- What? No.

1158
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:06,796
What do you want?

1159
01:20:08,431 --> 01:20:09,576
Nothing.

1160
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:27,563
Weatherman!

1161
01:20:35,855 --> 01:20:37,196
- Hey.
- Hi.

1162
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:41,453
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1163
01:20:42,991 --> 01:20:44,933
I just wanted you to...

1164
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:45,988
What?

1165
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:50,058
<i>I was eighteen</i>

1166
01:20:50,383 --> 01:20:51,976
<i>Didn't have a care</i>

1167
01:20:53,455 --> 01:20:55,146
<i>Working for peanuts</i>

1168
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,482
<i>Not a dime to spare</i>

1169
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,214
<i>But I was lean and solid everywhere</i>

1170
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:05,482
<i>Like a rock</i>

1171
01:21:08,271 --> 01:21:09,995
I don't really get it.

1172
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:12,548
Am I following it?

1173
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:19,308
It was just a lead up
to other things I wanted to say.

1174
01:21:20,303 --> 01:21:21,547
Here's the part.

1175
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,752
<i>And I held firm</i>

1176
01:21:24,207 --> 01:21:25,995
<i>To what I felt was right</i>

1177
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:28,203
<i>Like a rock</i>

1178
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:30,951
I wanted to talk about that part...

1179
01:21:31,311 --> 01:21:32,871
about you.

1180
01:21:33,903 --> 01:21:35,147
That's like you.

1181
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:37,352
<i>I was strong as I could be</i>

1182
01:21:37,743 --> 01:21:39,402
<i>Like a rock</i>

1183
01:21:42,255 --> 01:21:43,662
I got the job.

1184
01:21:44,975 --> 01:21:46,218
New York?

1185
01:21:47,567 --> 01:21:50,469
That's terrific.
That's a remarkable income.

1186
01:21:51,055 --> 01:21:53,957
That's more money than I ever made,
that salary.

1187
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:55,654
Yeah.

1188
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:58,663
That's quite
an American accomplishment.

1189
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,454
Thanks.

1190
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:05,447
Are you okay?

1191
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,092
I can't knuckle down.

1192
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:16,457
Noreen's marrying Russ.

1193
01:22:16,559 --> 01:22:18,828
There's nothing
to knuckle down on, so...

1194
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:21,293
I can't fucking knuckle down.

1195
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:26,027
Your hand.

1196
01:22:29,135 --> 01:22:31,240
I just saw Mike's counselor.

1197
01:22:32,366 --> 01:22:35,912
Mike mentioned that you
were gonna fix this business up.

1198
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,239
He's in no trouble?

1199
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:42,797
Good job.

1200
01:22:49,327 --> 01:22:50,636
Your hand okay?

1201
01:22:50,767 --> 01:22:51,912
It's okay.

1202
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:54,342
- You certain?
- Don't worry.

1203
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,381
You always worry about your kids...

1204
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:00,965
no matter how old.

1205
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,815
There's always looking after.

1206
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:17,063
I read your book.

1207
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:18,790
Fuck.

1208
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:25,579
I was going to do some more work on it,
then I chucked it.

1209
01:23:26,095 --> 01:23:28,266
- You chucked it.
- Garbage.

1210
01:23:30,863 --> 01:23:34,954
It's just what I do, David.

1211
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:38,090
I've practiced and I've gotten good.

1212
01:23:38,543 --> 01:23:40,877
Like you and the weather business.

1213
01:23:44,047 --> 01:23:45,574
But I don't predict it.

1214
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,068
Nobody does, 'cause it's just wind.
It's wind.

1215
01:23:48,175 --> 01:23:49,735
It blows all over the place!

1216
01:23:49,839 --> 01:23:51,300
What the fuck?

1217
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:01,160
I have to go to work.

1218
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:02,567
David.

1219
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:10,734
This shit life...

1220
01:24:13,999 --> 01:24:16,039
we must chuck some things.

1221
01:24:21,263 --> 01:24:22,823
We must chuck them...

1222
01:24:24,303 --> 01:24:26,026
in this shit life.

1223
01:24:33,103 --> 01:24:34,990
There's always looking after.

1224
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:39,499
You have time.

1225
01:24:46,191 --> 01:24:47,206
Thanks.

1226
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:46,310
<i>Pretty soon after Robert's living funeral,</i>
<i>we had his real one.</i>

1227
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:44,174
I'm sorry for your loss.

1228
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:49,132
That's a lovely thing to say to me.

1229
01:26:50,703 --> 01:26:52,197
Where'd you hear that?

1230
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,028
His friends.

1231
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:04,167
I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella.

1232
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:07,148
I had a feeling
it was going to rain today.

1233
01:27:07,407 --> 01:27:09,261
You're not going to take my job,
are you?

1234
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:13,352
No. I'm going to be a cameraman
for <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

1235
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:16,203
Is that okay?

1236
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:20,715
Yeah. That's good.

1237
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,109
There are a great many
of Robert's friends here, even in winter.

1238
01:27:28,654 --> 01:27:31,916
I think it's because Robert was unusual.

1239
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:34,884
I think that's what
brought so many of you out.

1240
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:39,146
A loving husband
and father for 40 years.

1241
01:27:39,247 --> 01:27:42,411
And a good friend to some of you
for longer.

1242
01:27:43,247 --> 01:27:47,338
I'm sure that's why
we appreciated and loved Robert.

1243
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,863
He was excellent.

1244
01:27:50,575 --> 01:27:51,819
Selfless.

1245
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:53,995
Resolute.

1246
01:27:54,926 --> 01:27:56,420
<i>I remember once...</i>

1247
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:01,290
<i>imagining what my life would be like,</i>
<i>what I'd be like.</i>

1248

01:28:25,391 --> 01:28:29,701
<i>all of them got reduced every year</i>
<i>to fewer and fewer...</i>

1255
01:28:30,254 --> 01:28:32,775
<i>until finally they got reduced to one...</i>

1256
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:34,956
<i>to who I am.</i>

1257
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:43,081
<i>And that's who I am...</i>

1258
01:28:46,607 --> 01:28:48,200
<i>the weatherman.</i>

1259
01:29:38,735 --> 01:29:41,484
<i>But first Dave Spritz has the check</i>
<i>of our national weather. Dave.</i>

1260
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:44,518
<i>Well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like</i>
<i>spring if you're in the Northeast.</i>

1261
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:45,735
<i>Is it gonna last? Let's take a look.</i>

1262
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:48,588
<i>We've got a warm weather system</i>
<i>to thank for these high temperatures...</i>

1263
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:50,726
Mike, you ready for school?

1264
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:51,911
Russ?

1265
01:29:52,622 --> 01:29:54,051
Let's go, guys.

1266
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:55,622
Come on.

1267
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,606
You're gonna get it!

1268
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,586
- Bye, Shelly.
- Bye, Mom.

1269
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:03,239
<i>That's your national weather.</i>
<i>I'll be back with your local focus...</i>

1270
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:04,936
<i>at the bottom of the hour.</i>

1271
01:30:24,494 --> 01:30:27,112
- Hey, are you Dave Spritz?
- Yeah.

1272
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:29,994
- Can I get your autograph?
- Sure.

1273
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:36,295
So is it going to rain today?

1274
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:39,242
Who knows?

1275
01:30:44,175 --> 01:30:45,582
Hey, <i>Hello America.</i>

1276
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:49,068
<i>I've been doing the show</i>
<i>for a few months.</i>

1277
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:51,719
<i>People don't throw things</i>
<i>at me anymore...</i>

1278
01:30:52,015 --> 01:30:54,382
<i>maybe because I carry a bow around.</i>

1279
01:30:54,543 --> 01:30:55,787
<i>I don't know.</i>

1280
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:03,237
<i>I go back to Chicago weekends...</i>

1281
01:31:03,342 --> 01:31:05,131
<i>keep it steady with Mike and Shelly...</i>

1282
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:08,907
<i>come back, do the weather.</i>
<i>So... Forecast?</i>

1283
01:31:09,743 --> 01:31:10,920
<i>Come on.</i>

1284
01:31:11,151 --> 01:31:13,223
<i>Another man is with my family.</i>

1285
01:31:13,839 --> 01:31:16,708
<i>Things didn't work out</i>
<i>the way I predicted.</i>

1286
01:31:16,911 --> 01:31:18,950
<i>Accepting that's not easy...</i>

1287
01:31:20,078 --> 01:31:22,599
<i>but easy doesn't enter</i>
<i>into grown-up life.</i>

1288
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:28,168
<i>I'll take this American accomplishment.</i>

1289
01:31:28,558 --> 01:31:30,151
<i>That's where I live...</i>

1290
01:31:30,255 --> 01:31:33,353
<i>behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay.</i>

1291
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,758
<i>But in front of SpongeBob.</i>

1292
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:39,620
<i>Hello, America.</i>

1293
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:37,391
