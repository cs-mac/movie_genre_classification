1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:28,805
Surviving progress.

2
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,872
In defining progress,

3
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,420
I think it is very important
to make a distinction

4
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:38,272
between good progress and bad progress.

5
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:42,084
I mean, things progress in
a sense that they change.

6
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:47,424
Both in nature and in human society there appears
to be a clear trend towards increasing complexity.

7
00:03:51,240 --> 00:04:01,040
As change proceeds, we tend to delude ourselves
that these changes always result in improvements.

8
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,276
....from the human point of view.

9
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,980
SURVIVING PROGRESS

10
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,360
We are now reaching a point in which technological
progress and the increase in our economies and our numbers

11
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:20,944
threaten the very existence of humanity.

12
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,428
WHAT IS PROGRESS?

13
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,239
What is progress.....

14
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,899
I think..... mhm. That's
too hard question....

15
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:20,656
When I think of the word 'progress'...

16
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:38,949
<i>Progress will not come easy, it won't come quick,
but today we have an opportunity to move forward.</i>

17
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:03,698
It seems we are stuck in this trap for the last
200 years, since the industrial revolution

18
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,300
where we think progress is
more of the same, like:

19
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:11,088
We should make our machines
better and get more machines

20
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:15,027
but we've been doing it for 200 years,
so doing more of that is not progress.

21
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,772
We're like stuck in this
like a record......

22
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:54,504
Things are start out to seem
like improvement or progress.

23
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:58,992
These things our seductive, there seems
like there is no downside to these

24
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:05,112
but when they reach a certain scale they
turn out to be dead ends, more traps.

25
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,052
PROGRESS TRAPS

26
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:15,236
I came up with a term 'progress trap'
to define human behaviors that

27
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:19,656
sort of seem to be good things, seem
to provide benefits in a short term

28
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,700
but which ultimately lead to disaster,
because they are unsustainable.

29
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:29,644
One example would be going right
back to the old stone age

30
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,928
the time of when our ancestors
were hunting mammoths.

31
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:36,084
They reached a point, where their weaponry
and hunting techniques got so good

32
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,392
that they destroyed hunting as a way
of life through the most of the world.

33
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:46,112
The people who discovered how to
kill two mammoths instead of one

34
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:49,169
had made real progress, but the
people who discovered that they can

35
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:53,024
eat very well by driving a whole herd
over a cliff and kill 200 at once

36
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,964
had fallen into a progress trap

37
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,660
they'd made too much progress.

38
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:12,616
Our physical bodies and physical
brains as far as we can tell

39
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:16,844
have changed very little
in past 50 000 years.

40
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:22,896
We've only been living in
civilization for the last 5000 years

41
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:28,028
...at the most which is less then
0.2% of our evolutionary history.

42
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:35,017
So the other 99.8 we were
hunters and gatherers

43
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,140
and that is the kind of
way of life that made us.

44
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,275
We are essentially the same people
as those stone age hunters.

45
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:55,873
What makes our way of life different from theirs
is that culture has taken off at exponential rate

46
00:08:56,856 --> 00:09:01,156
and has really become detached
from pace of natural evolution.

47
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:11,012
So we are running 21st century
software, our knowledge,

48
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,164
on hardware that hasn't been
upgraded for 50 000 years

49
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,852
and this lies at the core
of many of our problems.

50
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,943
All of this is because our human nature is back
in hunting-gathering era of the old stone age

51
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:36,844
whereas our knowledge and technology, in other words, our ability
to do both good and harm to ourselves and to the world in general

52
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,828
has grown out of whole proportion.

53
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:46,376
One thing to remember, of course,
about human mind is that it's not

54
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:50,344
that fundamentally different from,
say, a brain of a chimpanzee.

55
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,644
Most of the human brain, the
basic structure of the brain

56
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,756
is much older than human species

57
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:00,428
some of it goes back to bacteria

58
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,020
some of it goes back to worm, some
of it originated in first mammals

59
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:08,384
some of it within the first primates,
some of it in first human beings.

60
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:11,584
Very little however changed
in the last 50 000 years.

61
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:16,176
And so most of what we do, we
do with hardware components

62
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:19,736
that are much older than any
of the problems that we face.

63
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:29,244
When I first began to study chimps

64
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:34,296
I thought that the task was to just
map out more and more similarities

65
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:38,412
to find the areas of cognition
that hadn't been studied yet

66
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:42,708
and simply show that
chimps were just like us.

67
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,628
WHY

68
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:09,724
You can imagine teaching a small
child to stand up a block up right

69
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,657
and you can teach a chimp
to do the same thing

70
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:17,164
'oh I set up a block here, set up a block here,
I can see everything, it’s very, very clear'

71
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,632
'and I get a piece of fruit for doing it'

72
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:25,332
But what happens when you introduce a
small subtlety into the situation

73
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:31,172
when you trick them and make the block off
center just that the block keeps falling over.

74
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,980
Well, the chimp will come
in, set up the good block

75
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,008
set up the block that
we've tricked them with

76
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,156
but then it falls over.

77
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:50,748
Well the chimp can see that it's
not the way it's supposed to be

78
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,524
so they try again, and they try again

79
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,296
and they move it to one place, and
they move it to another place

80
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,272
and they keep trying to get it to stand up

81
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,361
because they know what
is supposed to happen.

82
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,980
But they have no understanding
or no inclination to ask why.

83
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:11,188
What unobservable part of the situation is
causing that block to keep falling over.

84
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:15,856
The young child will enter
set up the good block

85
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:19,072
try to set up the block that
we've tricked them with

86
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:22,168
but when it falls over, well
first they'll try again

87
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:28,116
then maybe try again, but very quickly they'll
turn it over, feel the bottom of it, shake it,

88
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:35,504
try to concern what unobservable property
of that block is causing it to fall over.

89
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:41,028
That's the fundamental, core difference,
I believe, between humans and chimps

90
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:50,492
that humans ask why, we're constantly probing for
unobservable phenomenon to explain the observable.

91
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,492
It's what's driven us to discover gravity,

92
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,608
it's what's driven us to probe
into the mysteries of quasars,

93
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,820
and it's the same thing that drives us
to probe into mysteries of each other

94
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,124
in our every day life’s.

95
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,140
'Why does she keep doing that?'

96
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:13,804
'Why does he keep behaving like that, he must think
this, he believe this, I don't understand...'

97
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,140
'Why, why, why, why...'

98
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:28,492
So the upside of the human
capacity that asks why,

99
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:31,232
to continuously probe behind appearances

100
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,304
and to try to find out how
the world really works

101
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:40,808
is we develop fabulous new medicines, fabulous new
therapeutic techniques to take care of people,

102
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:45,852
we invent the whole cascade
of modern technology.

103
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,748
But the downside is that

104
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:15,616
we invent the whole cascade
of modern technology.

105
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:30,032
Arguably we are the most intellectual
creature that ever walked on planet earth.

106
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:37,576
So how come then that so intellectual being

107
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,732
is destroying its only home,
because we only have the one home.

108
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:47,052
Maybe one day people will be on Mars, but
at the moment we've got planet earth.

109
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,880
We are destroying, we are polluting, we are
damaging the future of our own species

110
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,872
which is very counterproductive
from the evolutionary perspective.

111
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,068
This capacity that seems
so wonderful to us,

112
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,572
ability to ask 'why'

113
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,040
the very ability that
defines modern science

114
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,280
as a double-edge sword.

115
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,772
If humans go extinct on this planet

116
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:39,172
I think what's gonna be our
epitaph on our gravestone is:

117
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:44,396
'Why?'

118
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
We have the ability to
think into the future

119
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,760
but most of our mechanisms,
most of our brain mechanisms

120
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:06,688
evolved before we had any ability
to think forward to the future

121
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:10,356
and when it made some sense for
decisions to be short-term.

122
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,980
A lot of our brain mechanisms, what I call
ancestral mechanisms or reflexive mechanisms

123
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,940
are tuned to making snap decisions,
right away, like fight or flight

124
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,540
you see a lion, either you're
gonna fight or you gonna run

125
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,200
no time to think about
long-term consequences

126
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:30,292
and that's good when we're stressed about something
immediate that we can deal with, for example

127
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:33,076
but those very systems that work by reflex

128
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:38,452
are not so good at cooperating with these
more modern systems, deliberative systems

129
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,900
that allow us to make
long-term decisions, and say

130
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:45,244
is this good for me, is it good
for my society, for my planet.

131
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:56,892
NOT ENOUGH PLANETS

132
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,636
Between the fall of the Roman empire

133
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:03,744
and Columbus sailing it took 13 centuries

134
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:07,012
to add 200 million people
to the world’s population

135
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,516
now it takes only 3 years.

136
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:17,316
A simple thing like pasteurization, the warming
of milk so that the bacteria are killed

137
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,756
and the control of smallpox.

138
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,600
Things like that have led to a
great boom in human numbers.

139
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:33,452
Overpopulation, which no one
really wants talk about

140
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,400
because it cuts that things like religious believes and the
freedom of individual and autonomy of family and so on

141
00:17:40,944 --> 00:17:43,744
is something that we
will have to deal with.

142
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:52,372
We probably have to work towards a much smaller
worldwide population then 6 or 7 billion.

143
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:57,149
We probably need to go down to a half
of that or possibly even third of that

144
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:02,208
if everybody is going to live
comfortably and decently.

145
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,276
The other side of this problem

146
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,120
and perhaps the more dangerous side is

147
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:13,968
the footprint of the individuals
at the top of the social pyramids

148
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:15,756
who are consuming the most.

149
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:20,084
Somebody in the U.S. or Europe is
consuming about 50 times more resources

150
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,256
then a person in a place like Bangladesh.

151
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,804
If China is going to reach
the level of consumption

152
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:06,228
of the U.S. or Europe it's very unlikely that the world could
support the addition of billion consumers at that level

153
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:31,784
I'd say in China, maybe 200, 300
million people are affluent

154
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,900
they could afford a lot, all
that we can in the west

155
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:43,252
in India ca. 200 million, so you add up
this affluent segments of population

156
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:44,844
in these developing countries

157
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,360
but still what you come up with is no more
then one and half, maybe two billion people.

158
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:56,176
So there is still five billion people
waiting to tap into these bonanzas

159
00:19:56,304 --> 00:20:02,004
of plentiful food, cars, decent housing,
right education for their children.

160
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:04,728
So the potential demand
for resources is immense.

161
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,960
For thousands of years, you know,

162
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:31,100
China has the longest continuous
civilization in the world.

163
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,000
And it is only in the recent period of time

164
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:41,232
when the European countries
started to industrialize

165
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,200
that China started to lag
behind and therefore, you know,

166
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:54,424
between the First Opium War in
around 1840 all the way to 1978

167
00:25:54,792 --> 00:26:01,392
China went through a roller coaster of great
humiliation, wars, aggression of foreign nations

168
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:09,984
Japanese aggression against China, Civil War, collapse of
Qing Dynasty, great cultural revolution, chaos in China

169
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,036
that's when Deng Xiaoping reemerged in 1978

170
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:17,536
he basically pointed out
the only correct path.

171
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,492
We need to go out to the path of growth

172
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:31,372
and China needs to
modernize and insutrialize.

173
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:58,192
NATURAL CAPITAL

174
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,096
Some people have written about, ehm,

175
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,536
natural capital, the capital
that nature provides

176
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:06,464
which is the clean air and clean water

177
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,420
the uncut forest, the rich farmland and
the minerals, the oil, the metals,

178
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:16,544
all these things are the capital
the nature has provided

179
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:22,236
and until about 1980 human
civilization was able to live on

180
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,148
what we might term interest of that capital

181
00:27:24,552 --> 00:27:27,852
or surplus that nature was able to produce

182
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:31,908
the fruit that farmland can grow without
actually degrading the farmland

183
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,536
or the number of fish you can put out of sea
without causing the fish stocks to crash

184
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:43,728
but since 1980 we've been
using more than the interest

185
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:50,572
so we are in effect somebody who thinks he's rich cause he
is spending the money that has been left in his inheritance

186
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:53,908
not spending the interest
but eating into the capital.

187
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,152
The last time I visited the
New York Stock Exchange

188
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,884
was in 1980 and the mood
sure was different than.

189
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:07,672
Government with its high taxes,
excessive spending and over regulation

190
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,972
had thrown a wrench in the
works of our free markets.

191
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:21,408
With tax reform and budget control our economy
will be free to expand to its full potential

192
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,320
driving the bears back
into permanent hibernation.

193
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:28,864
That's our economic programme for next four
years, we're going to turn the ball loose.

194
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:56,428
The world is this big.

195
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:59,996
It's not this big and it can't be this big.

196
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:03,756
It's just this big, it's a finite sub.

197
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:11,052
Instead of thinking that nature is
this huge bank that we can just....

198
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:15,248
this endless credit card that
we can just keep drawing on.

199
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:20,176
We have to think about the
finite nature of the planet

200
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:28,272
and how you keep it alive, so
that we too may remain alive.

201
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:38,856
And less we conserve the planet there
isn't going to be any "the economy".

202
00:29:45,772 --> 00:29:48,972
The ice-age-hunter is still us, it's in us.

203
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:52,212
Those ancient hunters who thought
that there would always be

204
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,840
another herd of mammoth other the next hill

205
00:29:55,512 --> 00:30:01,512
shared the optimism of a stock trader, that there's
always gonna be another big killing on the stock market

206
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,396
in a next week or two.

207
00:30:39,764 --> 00:30:43,164
If you are watching the earth over
the last 5 or 6 thousands of years

208
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:45,743
and you're speeding up your film

209
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:50,244
what you see is civilization
breaking out like forest fires

210
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:54,824
in one pristine environment after another

211
00:30:55,608 --> 00:31:03,008
and after a civilization has arisen as it
burnt out natural resources in that area

212
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:07,188
than it dies down and another
fire breaks out somewhere else.

213
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:17,788
And now of course we have one huge
civilization around the world

214
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:23,168
which we have to confront the possibility
that the entire experiment of civilization

215
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:25,488
is in itself a progress trap.

216
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,660
"When will the economy
turn around?" "yeah."

217
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:10,144
"I'm not an economist, but I do believe we are
growing and I can remember this press conference"

218
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:15,348
"saying about recession as
if you were economists."

219
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,648
"I'm an optimist, I believe there is a
lot of positive things for the economy."

220
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:25,364
Faith in progress has become
a kind of religious faith

221
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,240
a sort of fundamentalism rather,
like market fundamentalism

222
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,748
that have just recently crashed and burned.

223
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:35,064
The idea that you can let market leap

224
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,164
is a delusion just like
the idea that you could

225
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:42,516
let technology leap and it will solve
the problems created by itself

226
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:44,676
in a slightly earlier phase.

227
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:49,808
That has become a belief very
similar to religious delusions

228
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:52,832
that caused some societies to
crash and burn in the past.

229
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:54,876
A SHORT HISTORY OF DEBT

230
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:59,832
Written records go back
about four thousand years

231
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,920
and from 2000 BC to the time of Jesus it was
normal for all of the countries in the world

232
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,780
to periodically cancel the debts
when they became too large to pay

233
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:17,216
so you have Sumer, Babylonian,
Egypt, other regions

234
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,916
all proclaiming these debt cancellation and

235
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:26,616
the effect was to make a clean slate so
that society would begin all over again.

236
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:33,292
This was easy to do in a society when
most debts were owed to the state

237
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:38,652
it became much harder to do when enterprise
and credit pasted out of the hand of state

238
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,272
into the private hands, into
the hand of an oligarchy

239
00:33:44,932 --> 00:33:48,732
and the last thing that they
wanted was to have a king

240
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,540
that would actually cancel the
debts and restore equality

241
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Rome was the first country of the
world not to cancel the debts.

242
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,240
It went to war in Sparta, in Greece to
overthrow the governments and kings

243
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,380
that wanted to cancel the debts.

244
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:19,317
The wars of the first century BC ended up
stripping these countries of everything they had.

245
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
it's stripped the public buildings,

246
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:27,856
it's stripped the economies off
their reproductive capacity

247
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,888
it's stripped them of their works

248
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,940
it made a desert out of the land

249
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:35,028
and it said: "a debt is a debt".

250
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,005
The collapse seems to
have been closely linked

251
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,800
to ecological devastation which led to also
social and economic and military problems.

252
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,964
In the early stages of the
Roman Republic you had

253
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,329
a fairly egalitarian land owning system

254
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:56,792
the peasants had access to public land

255
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:01,544
but as the Roman state became more
powerful and the lords the generals

256
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,816
began to appropriate public land
for their own private states

257
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,880
more and more peasants became landless

258
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,936
at the same time corrosion was
serious problem, so bad that

259
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:22,108
some of the Roman ports stilled up with top soil that
have been washed down from fields into the river.

260
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:30,332
Archeologists have been able to establish how badly
degraded much of Italy was by the fall of Roman empire

261
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:33,636
and how it took a thousand years
of much reduced population

262
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,392
during the middle ages for
fertility in Italy to rebuild.

263
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:48,488
What was absolutely new in a Roman Empire was irreversible
concentration of wealth at the top of economic pyramid

264
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,620
and that what's progress
has met ever since.

265
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:54,588
Progress has ment: "you will never
get back what we take from you".

266
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:59,312
That's what brought on the dark age and
that's what threatens to bring dark age again

267
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:05,880
if society doesn't realise that if it lets the
wealth to concentrate in the hands of financial class

268
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,491
this class is not going to be any
more intelligent in long term

269
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:16,492
in disposing of the wealth then predecessors
were in Rome, and other countries.

270
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,840
Well, the term oligarchy,
sounds a little esoteric

271
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:37,296
it just means a small groups of people
that got a lot of political power

272
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,340
based on their economic power.

273
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:46,392
We like to think that the U.S. is much more democratic,
much more spread out, in terms of who has the power

274
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:50,908
and oligarchy is something usually
associated with relatively poor countries

275
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:56,076
but that view has to be updated, because
we've got an essential part of that problem

276
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:57,769
of that structure in the
United States today.

277
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:03,488
People who have all this economical power
were in financial sector, it was Wall Street.

278
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:11,328
Wall Street became really powerful, they use
that power to buy influence in Washington

279
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:16,256
get more deregulation, so to get more of
the play field shaped in a way they wanted

280
00:37:16,516 --> 00:37:20,016
which is no government intervention,
no restrictions on what they wanna do.

281
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,272
That'd enable them to make a lot more money

282
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,540
which bought them more political power and
this went on for considerable period of time

283
00:37:26,908 --> 00:37:29,108
until of course there
was an enormous crash.

284
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:40,228
But basically you come to us today on your bicycles after
buying girl-scout cookies and helping out Mother Teresa

285
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:47,804
telling us: "we are sorry", "we didn't mean
it", "we won't do it again", "trust us".

286
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:53,624
Well, I have some people at my constituancy
that actually robbed some of your banks

287
00:37:53,472 --> 00:38:00,372
and they say the same thing! They're sorry, they didn't
mean it, they won't do it again, just let'em out.

288
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:09,264
Do you understand that this is a little difficult for most
of my constituants to take that you learned your lesson.

289
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:12,148
The bankers can't stop themselves.

290
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:18,516
It's in their DNA, in DNA of their organizations to take
massive risks, to pay themselves ridiculous salaries

291
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:23,668
and to collapse. And the more that reasonable, responsible
people at the center and the left and the right

292
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:33,724
see this, the closer we'll get to constrain the
power of these, out of control, factual oligarchs.

293
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:38,331
It's not a mystery, it's not a surprise, we
know we have crisis every 5 or 10 years.

294
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,684
My daughter called me from
school one day and said:

295
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:44,436
"Dad what's a finansial crisis",
I tried to be funny, I said:

296
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:47,228
"It's something that happens every
5 or 7 years", than she said:

297
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:50,256
"Why everybody is so suprised?", so
we aren't, we shouldn't be suprised

298
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,664
I read scroll on the wall somewhere, that

299
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:06,376
everytime history repeats
itself the price goes up.

300
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,399
If you look at the increasing
complexity of civilization

301
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,100
what you can see is that towards
the end of classic Maya period

302
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:27,743
it is the enormous amount of effort
put to build palaces and temples

303
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,444
that were controlled entirely by nobility and from
which, what I imagine, the peasantry was excluded

304
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:39,364
just as ordinary folks are excluded from
gated communities in many countries today

305
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:43,172
and one imagines also that
therefor the people at the bottom

306
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:47,104
were becoming more and more
disenchanted with the rulers

307
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:50,076
as they felt that the social
contract, that had once existed,

308
00:39:50,212 --> 00:39:55,912
that the rulers were the mediators
between the gods and themselves

309
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,468
and would help them get good
weather, good crops and all that

310
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,500
as they saw that begining to break down
and their rulers in effect loosing touch

311
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:06,506
with the people who they claim to represent

312
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:10,204
it's the pattern I think we can
see a lot in the modern world now.

313
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:17,183
Every society in history for
the last 4 thousand years

314
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:21,584
has found that debts grow more
rapidly that people can pay

315
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:28,724
the problem is a small oligarchy of
10% of the population on the top

316
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,764
to whom all of these debts are owed to.

317
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,720
You want to annule the debts to the top
10%, thats what they're not going to do.

318
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:38,512
The oligarchy is running things.

319
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:44,584
They would rather annule the bottom 90% right to
live then to annule the money thats due to them

320
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:49,504
they would rather strip the planet and
shrink the population and be paid

321
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,468
rather then give up their claims.

322
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,536
That's the political
fight of the XXI century.

323
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,628
DEBT PUSHERS

324
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:04,684
Our job on Wall St. was to balance the payments of
economies for Chase Manhattan Bank in the 1960's.

325
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:13,152
My first job there was to calculate how
much debt could third world countries pay

326
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:17,075
and the answer was, well,
how much do they earn,

327
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:20,076
and whatever they earn, that's what
they could afford to pay in interest

328
00:41:20,524 --> 00:41:24,724
our objective was to take the entire
earnings of a third world country

329
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:29,356
and say, ideally, that would
be all paid as interest to us.

330
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:35,628
Look, don't give me a hard look
story, I hear them every day

331
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:40,028
and quite frankly they bore me.

332
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:49,764
The facts are simple: Ä°n 1973 this bank gave
you a loan and you still haven't paid it back.

333
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:55,828
Admittedly you paid back the
inital sum, but not the interest

334
00:41:55,852 --> 00:42:00,652
which to date amounts to nine times
the amount origianaly borrowed.

335
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:03,064
Nine times

336
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:07,304
so you better get your act
together, times are tough,

337
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:11,036
and we all having to clamp down

338
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:20,712
and don't look at me like that,
this is a bank, not a charity.

339
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:30,216
The number 1 costs for foreign lending through
some of the multilateral associations.

340
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:35,004
IMF or World Bank is the
death tomb on the continent.

341
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:43,796
We can look at the support of the dictators
that took place thirty years ago

342
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:49,812
from 1960 till 1997, of a brutal dictator.

343
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:04,432
He was given humengous loans.

344
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:10,372
Everyone knew he wasn't using
that for the population

345
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:15,868
he was propped up as one of the biggest
leader in the whole african continent.

346
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:19,764
While your country is
young, only 10 years of age

347
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,500
that it is had a period of
progress in that period,

348
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:31,444
which has been an example for
nations throughout the world.

349
00:43:32,956 --> 00:43:38,256
You have moved forward economicaly, you
have estabilished unity in your country

350
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:46,672
and you have a vitality, which impresses
every visitor when he comes to Congo.

351
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:52,576
What is interesitng is all the money
and plunder from all iternational debt

352
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:57,464
is found in western banks, so
as he was removed from power

353
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,520
the money never returned to the Congies.

354
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:12,344
The population didn't have
access to medical services

355
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,660
didn't have access to adequate
education, living wage and

356
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:22,732
calculating up to date, now
Congo has 14 bln dollar debt

357
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:30,064
structure and the weight where the people
do not benefit and human cost is so high.

358
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:34,432
In Congo we have 6 million
deaths since 1996.

359
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:50,104
Rich countries lend, so called, "developping
countries" a big wack of "money".

360
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:54,556
Debt is incurred on behalf of people who have nothing
to do with it and don't know anything about it.

361
00:44:55,104 --> 00:45:02,204
Then they are expected to pay the price by scraping
off their livelihood turning it into money.

362
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,020
Giving it to somebody else...

363
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:08,663
Howcome the money given to
common benefit of the people

364
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,664
use some of the funds to make sure that there
are strongest against secesion in the country

365
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:17,188
protecting against human rights violation,
so many other issues that we face

366
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,948
but these funds are not used for
that because whatever is given

367
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,696
they tell you specifically what
project you have to use it for

368
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:27,472
and mainly is usually mining
projects to get access to resources.

369
00:45:41,232 --> 00:45:42,932
DIGGING HOLES

370
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:32,260
You can relate to the destruction of the rainforest in
Brasil directly to the Wall St. and London financial sector

371
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:37,188
the story begins in 1982 whe countries
couldn't pay their debts any more

372
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:42,508
and the result is that Latin American coutries
generally stopped paying because they said

373
00:46:42,836 --> 00:46:47,236
we're already paying all of the balance
of payments surplus we have to the banks

374
00:46:49,564 --> 00:46:52,864
we don't have any money to import,
to sustain living standards

375
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:56,568
we don't have money to import, to
build new factories to pay the debt

376
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:59,856
so the IMF at that point said:

377
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,480
Don't go bankrupt! You have an option, you
can begin to sell off the public domain

378
00:47:04,848 --> 00:47:07,548
you have plenty of assets to sell to pay us

379
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:14,876
you can sell off your water rights, your forests, your
subsoil mineral resources, you can sell us your oil rights

380
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:22,844
and so Brazil, Argentina and other countries began
to sell off their resources to private investors

381
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,370
and private investors bought
these resources on credit.

382
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:52,393
MARINA SILVA.
- FORMER MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT, BRAZIL

383
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,320
RAQUEL TITSON-QUEIROZ.
- ENVIRONMENTAL POLICE OFFICER IBAMA

384
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:48,684
ENITO BEATA - SAWMILL OWNER

385
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:35,608
They're cutting down the rainforest,
they're emptying out the economy

386
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:40,912
they're turning it to a hole in the ground to repay
the bankers, that's the financial buisness plan

387
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:44,788
that's how it ends up because the
bankers goal is take their money

388
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:48,472
and begin digging holes in another
country and empyting out that country

389
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:51,096
that's the global financial system.

390
00:55:09,796 --> 00:55:15,496
The economists say: Ä°f you clearcut the forest,
take the money, and put it in the bank

391
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:17,176
you can make 6 or 7%.

392
00:55:17,736 --> 00:55:22,136
If you clearcut the forest, put it into
Malysia or smth you can make 30 or 40%.

393
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,320
So who cares whever you keep the forest,
cut it down, put the money somewhere else

394
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:29,888
when those forests are gone, put it in fish,
the fish are gone, put it in computers.

395
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,680
Money doesn't stand for anything and money
now grows faster then the real world.

396
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,740
Conventional economics is
a form of brain damage.

397
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:39,804
DAVID SUZUKI - GENETICIST/ACTIVIST

398
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:46,464
Economics is so fundamentally
disconnected from the real world

399
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,040
it is destructive.

400
00:55:48,504 --> 00:55:51,204
If you take an introductory
course in economics

401
00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:55,008
the professor in the first lecture
will show a slide of the economy

402
00:55:55,348 --> 00:56:01,346
and it looks very impressive, you know, raw material,
extraction processes, manufacture, wholesale, retails,

403
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:02,844
with arrows going back and forward

404
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:05,868
and they try to impress you because
they think that they know damn well.

405
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:12,636
Economics is not a science but they're trying to fool
us into thinking that it is a real science. It's not.

406
00:56:12,796 --> 00:56:17,496
Economics is a set of values that they then try
to use mathematical equations and all that stuff

407
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,624
and pretend that it's a science.

408
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,540
But if you ask the economist in that
equation where do you put the ozone layer

409
00:56:24,936 --> 00:56:28,536
where do you put the deep underground
aquafiers of fossil water

410
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,900
where do you put topsoil or
biodiversity, their answer is:

411
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:34,468
Oh, those are externalities.

412
00:56:34,636 --> 00:56:36,237
Well, then you might as well be on Mars.

413
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:39,416
That economy is not based in
anything like a real world.

414
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:44,144
It's life that filters
water in hydrologic cycle

415
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:49,276
it's microrganisms in the soil that create
the soil that we can grow our food in

416
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,700
nature performs all kinds of services

417
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,640
insects fertilize all
of the flowering plants

418
00:56:54,768 --> 00:56:58,168
these services are vital to
the health of the planet

419
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,160
economist call these externalities.
That's nuts!

420
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,720
Unlimited ecoomic progress in the world of
finite natural resources doesn't make sense.

421
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,560
It's a pattern that is bound to colapse
and we keep seeing it collapsing

422
00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:46,224
but then build it up because there
are these strong vested interests

423
00:57:46,344 --> 00:57:47,844
we must have buisness as usual

424
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:54,348
and you know, you got, the arms manufacturers,
the petroleum industry, pharmaceutical industry

425
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:59,580
and all of this feeding into helping
to create corrupt governemnents

426
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:04,692
who are putting the future
of their own people at risk.

427
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:12,079
You can imagine lilies growing in a pond.

428
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,680
Lilies grow very rapidly,
they double every day

429
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,580
they're going to cover the whole surface and there
won't be any way for the fish getting oxygen

430
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:23,292
and all the life is going
to die in the pond

431
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:25,072
that's how rapidly things can grow.

432
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:31,516
One day you are half full of lilies
and the next day you're dead.

433
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:37,456
You could say that today we're at the
point in which the lily pond is half full

434
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:44,352
the life is being snuffed out of national
economies and the debt goes on doubling

435
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:48,792
how long can it do it.
It has one day to go.

436
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:06,596
All the civilizations of the past and, I
think our own, only seem to be doing well

437
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:11,556
when they're expaning, when the population is
growing, when the industrial output is growing

438
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:15,044
and when the cities are spreading out.

439
00:59:20,116 --> 00:59:23,816
Eventualy you reach the point at which
the population has overrun everything.

440
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:27,444
The cities have expanded over the farmland

441
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:34,404
the people at the bottom begin to starve and
the people at the top loose their legitimacy

442
00:59:37,132 --> 00:59:38,812
and so you get hunger, you get revolution.

443
01:00:09,268 --> 01:00:12,368
Now, one scary thing about
the moment we're in is that

444
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:16,168
for the first time there
is kind of only one system

445
01:00:18,144 --> 01:00:26,844
so if the whole thing goes down, you won't have
what you've had in previous eras of epic collapse

446
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:31,084
which is that even if one civilization goes
down and it may take a while to recover

447
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:36,760
there are other robust civilizations
that can be guardians of progress.

448
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:39,664
ROBERT WRIGHT.
- AUTHOR OF NONZERO: THE LOGIC OF HUMAN DESTINY

449
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,880
In that sense some of the things that
have been reassuring in the past

450
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:49,208
about progress don't necesserily
apply to the current situation

451
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:54,392
'cause once you get to the global level
you've only got one experiment working.

452
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,808
That's just the inevitable combination
of its growth ever since the stone age

453
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:04,716
and there were waystations
like the Roman empire

454
01:01:05,424 --> 01:01:08,724
and now here we are and more and
more people, we're in the same boat

455
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,440
and they face problems and either they will
solve them together or suffer together

456
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:16,636
possibly on a catastrophic scale.

457
01:01:16,856 --> 01:01:18,356
ESCAPING THE TRAP

458
01:01:24,128 --> 01:01:29,328
We are entering an increasingly
dangerous period of our history

459
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:42,380
our genetic code still caries the selfish and agressive
intincts that were survival advantage in the past

460
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:44,704
but I'm an optimist.

461
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,161
STEPHEN HAWKING - THEORETICAL PHYSICIST

462
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:03,420
If we are the only inteligent beings in the galaxy
we should make sure we survive and continue.

463
01:02:14,308 --> 01:02:20,608
If we can avoid diseaster for the next
two centuries our species should be safe.

464
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:30,888
We have made remarkable progress
in the last hundred years.

465
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:47,655
Our only chance of going through survival
is not to remain on planet earth

466
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:49,848
but to spread out into space

467
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:03,708
I was at the conference a few
years back with George Lukas

468
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,516
and he came up and said

469
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:10,052
there is only two hopes for humanity.

470
01:03:11,096 --> 01:03:15,396
Either we find another planet to
colonize after we've destroyed this one

471
01:03:16,032 --> 01:03:24,732
or perhaps your technology, meaning what we are doing
with genetic code, might allow us to transform ourselves

472
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:28,704
or other aspects of the planet
where we can continue to live here.

473
01:03:29,592 --> 01:03:31,092
J. CRAIG VENTER.
- BIOLOGIST / CEO SYNTHETIC GENOMICS

474
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:35,808
We're here to celebrate the complition of
the first survey of the entire human genome

475
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:42,816
without a doubt this is the most important,
most wondrous map ever produced by human kind.

476
01:03:43,308 --> 01:03:48,908
We are announcing today that the first time our species
can read the chemical letters of its genetic code.

477
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:57,708
For the last several years my team
has been sailing around the world

478
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,540
looking for all the species in the
ocean, the microspecies, on filters

479
01:04:02,712 --> 01:04:06,412
and we isolate all the DNA,
all at once from all of them

480
01:04:07,228 --> 01:04:09,428
I have a novel way of
looking at these genes

481
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,860
I've use them as the design
components of the future.

482
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:19,308
It's mind-bugging concept, even
though we're doing it everyday,

483
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:24,868
that we can simply start with four bottles
of chemicals, write the genetic code

484
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,120
and change the genetic code of species,
basically developing new species

485
01:04:29,528 --> 01:04:36,128
and we can try and find ways to make fuels
that other people haven't even imagined

486
01:04:36,316 --> 01:04:39,016
we can do this with novel source of food

487
01:04:39,228 --> 01:04:44,228
we're limited only by our imagination
and whatever biological reality is

488
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:53,723
when we consider trying to replace oil,
we use bilions of gallons of oil a year

489
01:04:53,960 --> 01:05:00,360
it's a, I can't even, i think I have pretty good
imagination, envision what a billion gallons of oil is

490
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:09,320
making a billion gallons of oil from invisible
microbs is a certain leap of faith

491
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:11,608
in fact that's how we proceed in science.

492
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:25,552
Instead of writing software for computers,
we can now write software for life.

493
01:05:36,992 --> 01:05:44,527
By changing and taking over evolution,
changing the timecourse of evolution

494
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:48,828
and going into deliberate design
of species for our own survival

495
01:05:50,672 --> 01:05:57,072
at least gives us some points of optimism
that we have a chance to control our destiny.

496
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:03,004
We're here today to announce
the first synthetic cell.

497
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:08,996
This is the first self-replicating species that
we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer.

498
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:14,508
GODS R US?

499
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:20,164
One of the challanges that
faces the human species is

500
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,000
we're more and more in a
position of acting like gods

501
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,260
it has been true for a while because we have
the ability to change the climate for example

502
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:33,108
this is gonna be even more
true with genetic technologies

503
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:36,804
we're gonna be able to manipulate
other species ad eventualy ourselves.

504
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,780
We're gonna be in a position of
controling our own faith in a way that

505
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,920
no creature has ever, you know, in billion
years on the planet had an opportunity to do.

506
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:54,832
I once wrote a poem in
which a mad bishop said

507
01:06:55,032 --> 01:07:00,832
"a man became god, became greater
than god, and the godhood of man"

508
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:10,828
I do not see anyone living in this materialistic
society as being anything like god

509
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:12,588
I don't know what god is,

510
01:07:13,036 --> 01:07:21,036
but in my wildest dreams I would never
conceive of god or a god as being like

511
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:25,732
a modern human being in
a materialistic society.

512
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,208
We're anything but godlike, I think

513
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:34,608
the challenges are so
overwhelming to all of us

514
01:07:35,716 --> 01:07:42,016
that we're all trying to use whatever new
tools we can to try and change the future.

515
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:45,028
Synthetic biology is a
progress trap par exellence.

516
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,568
JIM THOMAS.
- ACTIVIST/AUTHOR OF THE NEW BIOMASSTERS

517
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:52,752
Biologist have pointed out that whese
engineering aproach is all very well

518
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:58,156
and that engineers can try to treat life as it
was some kind of computer engineering substrate

519
01:07:58,732 --> 01:08:01,632
but ultimately the microbes are
gonna end up loughing at them

520
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:06,036
the life doesn't work like that.

521
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:23,192
I think the problems that we're seeing
now whever we are talking about hunger,

522
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,000
massive inequity, when we're talking about
climate change or the loss of biodiversity

523
01:08:28,296 --> 01:08:32,796
have been driven over the last 200 years
by a system of overproduction of stuff

524
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,620
and overconsuption of stuff

525
01:08:35,592 --> 01:08:40,692
and that's being inflated and inflated and inflated to a
point where there really is not in any way reasonable

526
01:08:41,136 --> 01:08:47,036
the companies and those of the
governements who supported that approach

527
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:52,076
are now saying that they will provide new
technologies to continue that consumption of stuff

528
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:56,124
that level of production.
It's just not realistic.

529
01:08:55,592 --> 01:08:59,092
ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics
have built a new facility

530
01:08:59,544 --> 01:09:02,144
to identify the most
productive species of algea.

531
01:09:02,352 --> 01:09:06,052
How'd you imaigne amazing little criters make
crit oil which we could turn into biofuels.

532
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:10,688
They also absorb CO2. We are hoping to
suplemet fuels that we use in our vehicles

533
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:14,475
to some day help meet the
words energy demands.

534
01:09:14,476 --> 01:09:19,576
What is harder mapping the entire
genome set that makes up a human being

535
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:22,588
or making algea produce energy?

536
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:28,084
Making algea produce energy is not hard but doing
it on a scale required to have a major economic

537
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:31,576
and environmental impact is
going to be a huge challenge

538
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:37,892
but have got partner in ExxonMobil to try
and get it to a scale that it needs to be

539
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:39,612
of billions gallons a year.

540
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,540
A lot of engineering is reqired for
facilities the size of San Francisco

541
01:09:43,992 --> 01:09:45,912
I think that they are
serious and we're serious.

542
01:09:46,656 --> 01:09:52,256
What we're seeing alongside the development of synthetic
biology is a massive corporate grab on plant life.

543
01:09:52,704 --> 01:09:57,104
Literaly speaking that means a grab
on land and a grab on seas as well.

544
01:09:57,936 --> 01:10:02,136
Where people have been moved out of land
to make way for the growing of plant life

545
01:10:02,504 --> 01:10:06,704
that can be transformed into plastics,
chemicals, fuels and so forth

546
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:12,568
and what drives synthetic biology is not an
attempt to save the planet or help humanity

547
01:10:13,128 --> 01:10:17,328
but an attempt to increase the bottom
line for certain very large corporations.

548
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,460
If we're gonna feed the
upcoming nine billion people

549
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:31,444
we can't afford to use our prime crop land for trying
to produce billions of gallons of fuel that we use.

550
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:35,228
What we're doing is writing the
genetic code, changing this species

551
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:43,244
allows us to use desert land mhm..
we just need sunlight and CO2

552
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,540
for using this new
engineered algea for example.

553
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,760
Synthetic biology in a way, you know, it's frightening
but I'm very sympathetic to this on many ways

554
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,060
that it will be nice to get a
more water efficient plants

555
01:10:56,236 --> 01:10:57,736
but still it would still need water

556
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,360
Greg Venter cannot create a plant
which needs no water and no nitrogen

557
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,705
or it totaly fixes on nitrogen
by sucking it from the air

558
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,928
which is....., it cannot go that far.

559
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:09,376
This does not fundamentally
change the game.

560
01:11:09,744 --> 01:11:12,944
What fundamentally changes the game
and what people don't want to hear

561
01:11:13,104 --> 01:11:18,604
and I'm telling this all the time and people say: "don't
talk to us like that because it's just a no-starter"

562
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,740
but for me this is the only
starter: We have to use less.

563
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:24,396
LIMITS

564
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:28,712
The poor people need more. There is no
noubt, there is no discussion there.

565
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:34,940
If you are average villiger somewhere in Rajastan
or Panjab or Nigeria u need more. Period.

566
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:38,676
There's a basic human decency that commends
you to say: These people need more

567
01:11:39,048 --> 01:11:41,769
more clean water, more basic food,
more education for their children

568
01:11:41,984 --> 01:11:43,624
the discussion goes like before it begins

569
01:11:44,928 --> 01:11:50,928
but as far as us is concerned we certainly
could and should use much, much, much less.

570
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:54,476
People have been conditioned that
things have to always go better

571
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:59,344
and immediately if you say: "limit something",
people think this is not getting better

572
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,116
but it would be.

573
01:12:00,672 --> 01:12:04,572
It is even a no-starter when you say: You should
eat less, you should eat less meat, right?

574
01:12:04,896 --> 01:12:08,796
Even that is a no-starter. You
should use less electricity, right?

575
01:12:08,952 --> 01:12:12,252
You should build smaller cars. I saw the
vice-president of GM talking about new GM

576
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:20,648
and one of the journalists asks him: "but your cars are
still so heavy", and he says: "yes, we are working on it"

577
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:24,612
what is there to work on it?!? There
are so many things that we could do.

578
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:28,928
Not to surrender our stand of living,
not to live in gutter, right?

579
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:33,104
But we don't need one-and-a-half ton
car to go from red light to red light.

580
01:12:34,056 --> 01:12:37,256
People are not willing to go back on these things.
Most of them simply aren't

581
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:39,988
because they've totally hijacked
by this material culture.

582
01:12:40,392 --> 01:12:45,392
Let's not underestimate the persuasion,
the power of this material culture.

583
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:47,244
It's immense, it's just immense.

584
01:12:47,832 --> 01:12:50,532
When I've seen so many people
being genuinly unhappy

585
01:12:50,496 --> 01:12:56,096
that they cannot afford a 50 000 sq foot,
sorry, 50 000 dollar bathroom remodelling

586
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,580
I mean, there is something wrong
with that values set, right?

587
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:04,508
'Cause bathroom is a place where you just spend,
like, 10 minutes to take shower, brush your teeth

588
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:09,968
so it doesn't have to be very... but, you know, how
much money people are.... because I can't... yhm...

589
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,800
because we are thinking about redoing our bathroom, right, so..
in my mind... it's very interesting

590
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,780
for me it's a char because it has to be done, but for
many people it's a life-affirming thing, you know.

591
01:13:20,784 --> 01:13:25,484
People are renting storage spaces, right?
that they will never access, right?

592
01:13:25,644 --> 01:13:29,444
to store the junk which they cannot
store in their 5000 sq. foot homes

593
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,580
so do we need that? It's amazing!
eh.... it's, it's, it's.....

594
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:41,792
This is very difficult to put the geany in the bottle,
so everything is defined in this material thinking

595
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:48,388
I could make a lot more coherent but it's difficult because
if you make it more coherent you make it prescriptive

596
01:13:48,312 --> 01:13:51,412
and prescriptions never work, really.
Because I don't have the solution

597
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:57,132
I can't say "we should follow this and then it
will click and we will live happily everafter"

598
01:13:57,984 --> 01:14:02,384
so I'm making it deliberatly uncoherent. I could
be very doctrinate, I could be, but you see,

599
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,040
I lived for 26 years in communist society I'm
inoculated against any doctriner grand solution,

600
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:12,724
you know, "this is the path, this is the must,
this is the paradigm which we have to follow"

601
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:16,912
I'm just totally set agains it, so I'm
making deliberatly, kind of, you know,

602
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:22,688
messy, uncoordinated, because that's how life is.
We don't know what path will emerge.

603
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:29,448
As long as we are living on this sea of
afluents and opportunities and material riches.

604
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:35,932
It's just very difficult to make this individual,
voluntary resolutes that are saying "enough", "back"

605
01:15:43,588 --> 01:15:46,388
I was walking around pointing my
finger at everybody, you know,

606
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,100
you people, you know, blaming
the culture for its consumption

607
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:58,064
finaly one day I came home and air-conditioners
were on even though there was no one at home

608
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:02,848
and I was like: Wait, I've been going around blaming
everybody else but the fact of the matter is

609
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,780
that my lifestyle requires a huge amount of
resources too, so how can I blame other people

610
01:16:08,472 --> 01:16:14,572
and I realized that before I go around and try to change
other people maybe I should look at myself and change myself

611
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:16,644
keep my side of the street clean.

612
01:16:17,976 --> 01:16:23,676
So I came up with this idea that I would live as environmentaly
as possible for a year and see how that affected us.

613
01:16:24,048 --> 01:16:26,608
COLIN BEAVAN.
- ENGINEER / AUTHOR & DIRECTOR OF NO IMPACT PROJECT

614
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,620
So we did this No Impact
experiment, we did it.

615
01:16:29,016 --> 01:16:30,516
We live in New York, in the
middle of the New York City

616
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:37,264
which made it unussual because most people can think of
environmental living as some kind of back to tha land thing

617
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,660
but of course, back to the land, is not the
right idea when it comes to saving our habitat

618
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:47,536
if all of us in New York were to go back to
the land we would very much destroy the land.

619
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,900
We're not biologicaly consumptive this
is not got to do with human nature.

620
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:05,388
Human nature is to do what everybody
else does, that's human nature

621
01:17:05,452 --> 01:17:10,052
that we want... and it's wonderful, it's like: I
want to be with you, I want to be the same as you,

622
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:13,304
I want to love you and I want
you to love me, thats not bad.

623
01:17:13,392 --> 01:17:19,192
So that's... that's also part of the problem.
I want to be the same as you and you consume

624
01:17:19,584 --> 01:17:21,464
so I'm not going to be
the first not to consume.

625
01:17:21,484 --> 01:17:25,384
But it also tells us that if we can move
from non-consumption to consumption,

626
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,001
we can also go from consumtion
back to non-consumption.

627
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:40,292
We need to begin by saying: We're
at the end of the failed experiment

628
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:42,136
and it is time to say good bye to it.

629
01:17:42,336 --> 01:17:46,536
An economic experiment, it's a technological experiment
that's been going on for couple of hundred years

630
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:50,632
and it's not worked, it's brought
us to this point of crisis.

631
01:17:50,812 --> 01:17:58,612
Then we can start sainly and inteligently say how can
we live within the real limits that our planet gives us

632
01:17:58,756 --> 01:18:02,356
and create a safe operating
space for humanity.

633
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:08,752
Admitedly we've used are brains in ways that are
detrimental to the environment and the society

634
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:15,124
but brains are begining to get together
around the planet to find solutions to some

635
01:18:15,936 --> 01:18:17,436
of the harm that we've inflicted.

636
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:22,776
You know, we humans are a problem solving species. We
always do pretty well with our back's to the wall.

637
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:24,948
THA PLANETARY BRAIN

638
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:30,592
It's easy now to see kind of a giant
social brain or planetary brain

639
01:18:30,768 --> 01:18:36,568
'cause it's in a physical form of the internet, it looks so
much like a nervous system, you almost can't miss the analogy.

640
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:46,428
You might say that there always have been a lot of little social brains around the
planet getting bigger, starting to form little interconnections among themselves.

641
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:52,144
Now more than ever you could tell
that there is a unified social brain.

642
01:19:14,452 --> 01:19:20,752
Even if the overall arc of history is toward an expended moral
horizon, more and more people acknowledging the humanity

643
01:19:21,096 --> 01:19:25,996
more and more different kinds of people, there is always
the risk of backsliding and it can be catastrophic.

644
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:33,808
From a point of view of strict self-interest it
is imperative that we make further moral progress

645
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:39,648
that we get more and more people to
acknowledge the humanity of one another

646
01:19:39,696 --> 01:19:41,497
or it will be bad for
pretty much all of them.

647
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:48,040
If we don't develop which you might
call a moral perspective of god

648
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:57,052
than we'll screw up the engineering part of playing god
because the actual engineering solutions depend on

649
01:19:58,012 --> 01:20:03,712
seeing things from the point of view of other
people, insuring that their lives don't get too bad

650
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:06,576
because if they do it
will come back to harm us

651
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:12,668
so, you know, half of being god is just
have been handed to us and the question is

652
01:20:13,224 --> 01:20:18,124
whether we'll master the other
half of being god, the moral half.

653
01:20:23,956 --> 01:20:27,456
The bad news is the enlightment
is sometimes hard to come by

654
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,300
because of human nature in
some cases, because you know,

655
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,780
we've got these kinds of animal minds,
desgined for very different environment

656
01:20:36,244 --> 01:20:44,344
facing novel problems, so enlightment part is going
to require some real education and reflection

657
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:47,508
and self-discipline and
may not come natural

658
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:02,112
I think what weâ€™re up against
here is human nature,

659
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:10,864
we have to reform ourselves, remake ourselves in a way that
cuts against the grain of our, our inner animal nature,

660
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:19,916
and transcend that Ice Age hunter, that all of us are,
if you, if you strip off the thin layer of civilization.

661
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:48,516
We always have been the initiators of this experiment,
weâ€™ve unleashed it but weâ€™ve never really controlled it.

662
01:21:48,292 --> 01:21:53,792
But now itâ€™s more likely that weâ€™re going to
come to grief because of environmental problems.

663
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,300
If we do, then that is really nature saying the experiment
of civilization is a failed evolutionary experiment,

664
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:09,160
that making apes smarter is a, is a dead end. So,
itâ€™s up to us to prove nature wrong, in a sense,

665
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:20,216
to show that we can take control of our own destinies and behave in a wise
way that will ensure the continuation of the experiment of civilization

666
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:09,182
