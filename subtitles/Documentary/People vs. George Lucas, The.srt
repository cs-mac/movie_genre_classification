1
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,915
Outside of the world you know...

2
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,671
...there exists the Realm Eternal,
Asgard.

3
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,633
The shining light of the Nine Worlds...

4
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,804
...Asgard is home to the gods...

5
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,102
...all of whom bow down
before the All-Father...

6
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,355
...Odin.

7
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,985
Odin's lifeblood
flows through Asgard...

8
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,030
...and Asgard is Odin.

9
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,365
His power is all...

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,535
...and he keeps
the Asgardian realm safe.

11
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:04,207
But once each winter,
the All-Father must rest...

12
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,169
...and enter the Odinsleep.

13
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:14,383
While Odin slumbers, his absence
leaves Asgard vulnerable...

14
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:20,181
...and this is when the wicked
descend upon his kingdom.

15
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,151
Charge!

16
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,121
For seven days,
an onslaught of trolls...

17
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,250
...giants, dark elves and demons...

18
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,087
...seek to take control
of the Nine Worlds.

19
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:56,259
But they are eternally defeated
by him...

20
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,016
...my arrogant,
oafish brute of a stepbrother...

21
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,685
...Thor.

22
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,018
...Thor.

23
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,696
I don't understand.

24
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,616
Where--? Where am I?

25
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,752
Hear me, human.

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,465
You have been brought to Asgard
because in all the universe...

27
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,887
...only you
have ever brought near defeat...

28
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,139
...to the Mighty Thor.

29
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,142
What?

30
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,436
I-- I couldn't.

31
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,147
Not thee, Bruce Banner.

32
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,942
You are but a sniveling, sad creature.

33
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,778
I speak of your other half.

34
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,114
I speak of the Hulk.

35
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,996
There is one day left of the Odinsleep.
The cycle is nearly complete.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,336
As always, the Asgardians
will emerge victorious...

37
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,838
...against the siege of darkness.

38
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,343
My brother will seek peace,
and then....

39
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,013
Then I shall destroy him.

40
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,612
Verily, ye must say...

41
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,658
...that went far better than last winter.

42
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,242
Tell us, Volstagg...

43
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,912
...are you going to dispatch that troll
beneath you...

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,289
...or are you saving him for dinner?

45
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,795
That all depends
on how much mead I partake in.

46
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,797
Did my ears deceive me?

47
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,716
Did Hogun the Grim make a joke?

48
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,260
And here we thought
you were still in a foul mood...

49
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,888
...because you didn't get
to slay a frost giant.

50
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,724
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.

51
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:12,561
But we shall see
whom the maidens reward more.

52
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:29,537
In mere hours, the All-Father
will awaken, and then we may rejoice.

53
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,254
The Lady Sif would know
what vexes thee.

54
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,799
Aye, we won the day.

55
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,969
All is well in the realm of Asgard...

56
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,513
...but only until the next Odinsleep.

57
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,766
It is as it has always been.

58
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,437
We must learn
to savor the moments of peace.

59
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,605
And accept the cycle of death?

60
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,027
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?

61
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,779
Must we be chained
to this eternal struggle?

62
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,782
Be careful what you wish for,
my love...

63
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,953
...for when the cycle does break,
when things do change...

64
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,789
...then comes the end of days...

65
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,459
...then comes Ragnarok.

66
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,046
Perhaps our fates
are not ours to choose.

67
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,840
But come.

68
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,802
Let us return to my father's palace
and prepare for his awakening.

69
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,063
Please, I'm begging you, don't do this.

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,982
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.

71
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,445
You don't know the destruction
he can cause.

72
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,656
Don't know?

73
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:52,244
You fool. I'm counting on it.

74
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,831
Look at you, so weak.

75
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,501
Were it not for you
inside the Hulk's mind...

76
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,669
...suppressing his power...

77
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,464
...he would rule Midgard
with his rage.

78
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,343
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.

79
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,845
You won't let me?

80
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,265
How amusing you mortals are.

81
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,018
Let me see if I recall correctly.

82
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,147
It is anger that unleashes the beast.

83
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,536
I seem to have forgotten the frailty
of mortals.

84
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:38,040
Look, Amora,
I do believe he's going to weep.

85
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,583
No.

86
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,211
It's impossible.

87
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,810
Now.

88
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,427
And so begins the end of Thor.

89
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,814
Well, what think thee, Balder?

90
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,192
One last troll
with dreams of conquest?

91
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,487
Perhaps.

92
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,288
Come, Hogun, Fandral...

93
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:27,543
...let us give unto this scoundrel
the gift of battle.

94
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,209
Oh, the creature's power
is incredible.

95
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,753
Take care, Loki.

96
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
My spell bonds you to the creature...

97
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,801
...and while you are master to it,
I can feel him fighting you.

98
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,597
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.

99
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,849
Do not try my patience, worm...

100
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,935
...lest I turn my attentions to thee.

101
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,578
You are no troll, monster.

102
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,180
'Tis Balder's horn,
but this is not right.

103
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,683
Asgard's enemies are all defeated.

104
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,978
And yet the alarm has sounded.

105
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,605
Stay at Odin's side.

106
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,483
Should I fail to meet this threat,
you must protect him.

107
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,872
But if Thor should fall,
what hope has Asgard?

108
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,719
You will have to kill me, monster...

109
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,472
...for I shall not yield.

110
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,168
Thor, the creature...

111
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,421
...like nothing I have ever seen.

112
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,423
Aye, my friend.

113
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:05,427
This is no immortal evil
that we face now.

114
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,596
The Hulk has come to Asgard.

115
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,446
Dr. Banner,
can you hear me inside the beast?

116
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,035
Why have you come here?

117
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,289
Why, to kill you, of course,
dear stepbrother.

118
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,333
Loki?

119
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,633
I have waited an eternity for this.

120
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,136
To crush you with my bare hands.

121
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,639
To match your might.

122
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,017
To feel your life fade away...

123
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,396
...as my hands
wrap around your throat.

124
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,824
Never!

125
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,512
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...

126
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,223
...and let us smite my stepbrother...

127
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,019
...for there are none stronger
than Loki now.

128
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,032
Rise, cursed hammer.

129
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,744
Loki, enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.

130
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,913
I can feel the spell breaking.

131
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:43,752
I will have this hammer!

132
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,642
Nay, you will have its thunder.

133
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,952
For Odin. For Asgard!

134
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,301
The monster...

135
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
...it is rage incarnate.

136
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,889
It has shattered the spell.

137
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,477
The Hulk is free.

138
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,948
Will thou yield, Loki?

139
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,015
Truly, this is the best of both worlds.

140
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:24,144
I need not control the beast
to enjoy its wrath.

141
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,354
Goodbye, brother.

142
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,816
This.... This is not what I wanted.

143
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,863
There's no going back, Amora.

144
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,493
After all,
if not for your black, broken heart...

145
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,579
...none of this
would have been possible.

146
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,168
You don't know what you've done.

147
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:53,006
With no one to reign the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.

148
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,885
I find your prattling useless, mortal...

149
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,554
...just as you are now useless to me.

150
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,445
For Odin.

151
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,115
For Asgard.

152
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,009
Thor.

153
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,484
Thor.

154
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,862
My love, I....

155
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,282
I was angered
when you chose Sif over me.

156
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,537
I did not--
I wanted thy love, not your death.

157
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,414
Please.

158
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,209
Please come back to me.

159
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,888
-Amora.
-Yes, my love.

160
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:01,361
Where is Loki?

161
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:46,573
What is that monster doing?
It travels towards Odin.

162
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,085
Loki, I would have words with thee.

163
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:03,590
No. You were at Hela's door.
I defeated you.

164
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,725
You. You dare cross the god of--

165
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,830
The Hulk will be sent back to Midgard,
and then you will answer to Odin.

166
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,916
Fine, take the creature.

167
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,834
It provided me
with amusement enough...

168
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,212
...seeing it pummel you
nigh unto death.

169
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,091
Loki, you fool. You killed him.

170
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,843
Do you know what you've done?

171
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,056
Because the mortal died here,
Hela claimed his soul.

172
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,850
Without his soul,
I cannot return him to Midgard.

173
00:23:56,018 --> 00:24:01,439
Without Bruce Banner,
the Hulk cannot leave Asgard.

174
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:39,060
Valkyries, warriors,
your seats in Valhalla are promised.

175
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:43,398
Protect Odin with your lives.

176
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,984
For Asgard!

177
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,575
I saw the beast's eyes, brother.

178
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,871
It will not stop
until all of Asgard is destroyed...

179
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,539
...until Odin is broken.

180
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:03,710
You have brought a new Ragnarok
down upon us all.

181
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,922
Possible I made a poor choice.

182
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:17,390
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Sif.

183
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,269
As you wish.

184
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:31,571
Loki, you will send whatever dark
forces you have left to battle the Hulk.

185
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:36,451
Then you and I,
we go unto Hel this day.

186
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,801
Rest your weapon, shield maiden.

187
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,930
I have come to aid thee
in Odin's defense...

188
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,640
...at Thor's request.

189
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:03,853
His request, you say?
More likely his penance, witch.

190
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,481
No doubt he saw your hand
in this attack.

191
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:12,654
A punishment more cruel
than you can imagine, cow.

192
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:44,018
Loki, the god of mischief,
bids you death, mortal creature.

193
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,695
Long have I wished
never to see this realm.

194
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:11,379
I always forget what a busy time
the Odinsleep is for my daughter.

195
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,215
Dost thou see any
newly arrived friends here, brother?

196
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,468
Have a care, Loki, lest ye stay here.

197
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,899
Where am I?

198
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:59,052
No. This doesn't make any sense.

199
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,972
Bruce?

200
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,016
Are you okay?

201
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
Betty?

202
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,103
I thought....

203
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,439
I don't understand.

204
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,860
-I was alone, and then--
-You're not alone, Bruce.

205
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,112
Not anymore.

206
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,743
Daddy.

207
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,457
Come play with me.

208
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,269
Hail Hela, goddess of the dead.

209
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,897
We seek an audience.

210
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:01,948
The sons of Odin risk much
entering my realm.

211
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:05,952
The Nine Worlds of Asgard
are in great peril, mistress...

212
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,287
...including Hel and Niflheim.

213
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,833
A new Ragnarok is upon us,
and we need your help.

214
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,502
We need Bruce Banner.

215
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,678
The mortal's soul is mine, Asgardian...

216
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,889
...as yours nearly was this very day...

217
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,183
...and may well be again.

218
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,311
You would risk everything
for the sake of one soul?

219
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,648
Just as you would, Odinson.

220
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:41,612
But you do not have one soul,
daughter, you have half a soul.

221
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,531
You have Bruce Banner.

222
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,826
You need the Hulk
to complete your prize.

223
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,124
-Are you all right?
-I feel....

224
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,793
I feel great.

225
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,924
I can't imagine anything better.

226
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,305
Bruce Banner.

227
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,531
Wake from this dream.

228
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,703
Betty?

229
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,874
Betty? Where are you?

230
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:23,130
The world of the living
has need of you.

231
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,845
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

232
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,181
Not I, he.

233
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,477
Friend Banner,
for the sake of all of Asgard...

234
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,813
...you must become the Hulk
once more.

235
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,316
Betty.

236
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,319
Where's...?

237
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,823
No.

238
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,076
No!

239
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:46,130
No. No, you can't ask me to do that.

240
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,216
I finally had peace.

241
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,719
You don't know what you're asking.

242
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:56,474
Your time in Hel certainly has not
made you less of a worm, mortal.

243
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,259
Bruce Banner,
I know thee to be a man of honor.

244
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,178
I know thee to be a hero.

245
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:38,432
The lives at stake are not
your concern, not even human...

246
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,601
...but I ask you anyway.

247
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,520
Be that hero now.

248
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,567
No.

249
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,111
I can't.

250
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,612
Die, beast.

251
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,418
The Hulk's soul is rightfully yours,
daughter.

252
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,379
Take it. Bring the Hulk to Hel.

253
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,718
Merge the two halves of his soul
and claim him.

254
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,860
Bruce Banner...

255
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:35,406
... I will not force you
to forsake the rewards of the afterlife.

256
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:40,494
-But you must be whole.
-No. I won't.

257
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,497
You don't understand.

258
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,342
No!

259
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,180
Curse you, Loki...

260
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,226
...for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm.

261
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,729
Stay thy hand, Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.

262
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:49,897
We?

263
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,691
The Hulk's fists have addled
your mind, thunderer.

264
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:57,029
Fight with me, brother, or die alone.

265
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,366
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in Hel.

266
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,037
Have at thee.

267
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,262
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.

268
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,122
Hulk!

269
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,335
Let them go. I'm the one you want.

270
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,842
Come on.

271
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,768
Dr. Banner.

272
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:04,031
Hulk tired.

273
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,877
You called him weak, Loki...

274
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,546
...but there is more strength
and courage in that man...

275
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,881
...than you will ever know.

276
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,301
This soul is too dangerous
to keep in Hel...

277
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,513
...and too valuable to lose
to Valhalla.

278
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,016
I will return him to Midgard.

279
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,276
Enough of this ridiculousness.

280
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,863
To think that Loki,
prince of darkness...

281
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,742
...should waste his time
with defending Asgard.

282
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,244
Nay, brother.

283
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,248
We leave together,
for you still have much to answer for.

284
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,334
Indeed, you both do...

285
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,838
...for today,
Hela has relinquished a soul...

286
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,924
...and she demands one in exchange.

287
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,802
You may try to take my soul,
death goddess...

288
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,846
...but I will make you fight for it.

289
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,099
And your realm
has suffered much already this day.

290
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,146
You speak the truth.

291
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,607
So I shall take his soul instead.

292
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,900
What?

293
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,574
Thor. Thor!

294
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,618
I helped you. I--

295
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,125
I could fight you for Loki's soul.

296
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,086
-Will you?
-No.

297
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:45,257
He is my father.
His stay will not be eternal.

298
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,093
But know this, Odinson...

299
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:54,141
...your soul will be mine,
and I will keep it forever.

300
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,728
Your fate is inescapable.

301
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,646
We shall see.

302
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,770
Thus, the cycle begins anew.

303
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,856
Asgard is safe once again...

304
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,692
...defended to the end by its heroes.

305
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,029
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.

306
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,950
The day was saved by loyalty
and sacrifice.

307
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,495
We honor those who fought
beside us...

308
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,705
...those who are no longer with us.

309
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,837
And we defy those
who would see us brought to ruin.

310
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:11,009
And while the rewards of Valhalla
await all of Asgard's heroes...

311
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,555
...this day we honor
a hero of Midgard...

312
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:20,227
...a mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.

313
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:26,525
This day, a human showed the gods
what legends are made of.
