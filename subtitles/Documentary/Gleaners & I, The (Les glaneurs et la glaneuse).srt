1
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,458
THE GLEANERS AND I

2
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,058
G as in gleaning -

3
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,334
To glean is to gather
after the harvest.

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,175
A gleaner is one who gleans.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,473
In times past only women gleaned.

6
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,106
Millet's Glaneuses
were in all dictionaries.

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,145
The original painting
is at the Orsay.

8
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,343
Gleaming, that's the old way.

9
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,773
My mother'd say, "Pick everything up
so nothing gets wasted".

10
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,081
But sadly we no longer do

11
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,154
because machines
are so efficient nowadays.

12
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,292
But before, I used to glean

13
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,449
together with my neighbors,

14
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,324
for wheat, and rice too.

15
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,457
I would put my big apron on

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,163
and we'd go gleaning ears of wheat,

17
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,240
lovely ears we would find.

18
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,772
A whole day in the sun,
with gnats and mosquitoes biting,

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,345
it wasn't too nice,

20
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,109
but we liked it.

21
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:53,589
Evenings, we were exhausted. Once
home with our bags and our aprons

22
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:59,460
we'd have a good time laughing
and drinking coffee together.

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,557
I was born in that farmhouse,
and I'll die there too.

24
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,465
- But not quite yet!
- OK, thank you very much.

25
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,538
Thanks very much, all of you.

26
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,642
I'm mixed up,
you've confused me now.

27
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,745
Yes, I've always gleaned.

28
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,312
I remember, with my grandmother
and my brothers and sisters.

29
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:25,315
Before, during the war, they had
to glean, they were starving.

30
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,426
They pounded the grain
to make flour,

31
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,194
for bread.

32
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,597
We no longer pick these days,
we no longer glean to eat.

33
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,998
There are still
a few gleaners of corn around.

34
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,270
<i>Gleaming might be extinct</i>

35
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,173
<i>but steeping has not vanished
from our sated society</i>

36
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,641
<i>Urban and rural gleaners
all stoop to pick up</i>

37
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,243
<i>There's no shame, just worries</i>

38
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,818
<i>Yeah, food, grub</i>

39
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,187
<i>It's bad, sad, man</i>

40
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,727
<i>To bend down is not to beg</i>

41
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,996
<i>But when I see them sway
My heart hurts!</i>

42
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,666
<i>Eating that scrap-crap</i>

43
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,332
<i>They've got to live on shit-bits</i>

44
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,097
<i>They've got to frisk for tidbits</i>

45
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,702
<i>Left on the street, leftovers</i>

46
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,305
<i>Rough stuff with no owners</i>

47
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,036
<i>Picking up trash like
the streets weeper</i>

48
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,610
<i>Zero for us, for them much better</i>

49
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,752
<i>They got to roam around
to kill the hunger</i>

50
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,450
<i>It's always been the same pain
will always be the same game.</i>

51
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,623
In the towns today
as in the fields yesterday

52
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,325
gleaners still humbly stoop
to glean.

53
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,432
But men have now joined
with women

54
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,367
in gleaning.

55
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:54,274
What strikes me is
that each gleans on his own.

56
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,610
Whereas in paintings

57
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,979
they were always
in clusters, rarely alone.

58
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,616
But there's a famous one

59
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,315
painted by Jules Breton
at the museum in Arras.

60
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,996
We took the road north.

61
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,688
Lots of big trucks,
but I'll come back to that,

62
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,666
and we arrived in the town of Arras,

63
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,402
we saw its square,

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,037
we saw its museum,

65
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,433
and Breton's Woman Gleaning.

66
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:28,479
There is another woman gleaning
in this film, that's me.

67
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,490
I'm happy to drop the ears of wheat
and pick up my camera.

68
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,154
These new small cameras,

69
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,487
they are digital, fantastic.

70
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,631
Their effects are stroboscopic

71
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,359
narcissistic.

72
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,631
And even hyper-realistic.

73
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,674
No, it's not O rage,

74
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,711
<i>no,</i> it's <i>not O despair,</i>

75
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,280
<i>it's not Ola/age, my enemy,</i>

76
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,719
it might even be Old age, my friend
but still, my hair

77
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,322
and my hands keep telling me
that the end is near.

78
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,767
OK, right now,
we are driving towards Beauce,

79
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,093
renowned for its wheat.
The harvest being over

80
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,232
we'll focus on potato
gleaning instead.

81
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,077
Destalking the fields makes furrows

82
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,406
and ridges ready
for the grubbing machine.

83
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,182
Once the grubbing is over,

84
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,319
we can glean the whole field.

85
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,125
- Hello.
- Hello Mrs. Buard.

86
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:26,028
Since this morning,
I've collected a full 250 lbs alone.

87
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,197
And these are good ones
you eat with herring.

88
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,735
Lots of restaurants buy them.

89
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:39,040
Some people are quite pleased
when the machine malfunctions.

90
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,573
There are lots left here.

91
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,717
The tractor ploughs too deep
and gets stuck.

92
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,045
They free it by lifting the machine
and they miss potatoes there.

93
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,122
So gleaners have a field day?

94
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,782
Oh yes definitely.

95
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,296
The owners don't give a damn

96
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,625
so long as there's nothing left.

97
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,490
They won't have to treat.

98
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,067
You still must sort them.

99
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,578
In supermarkets,
the firm ones are sold

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,273
in containers of 5 1/2 to 11 pounds,

101
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,716
and these have to be
of a specific caliber,

102
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,080
of a specific size.

103
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,323
So we dump anything bigger.

104
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,196
The potato harvest
averages 4,500 tons per season.

105
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,532
But 25 tons are rejected

106
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,468
and dumped.

107
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,115
We reject all the outsized,
green ones, and stones,

108
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,989
the cut or damaged ones.

109
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,198
Because they're unsellable.

110
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,926
To the trade, we sell potatoes

111
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,162
within a range of 2 to 4 inches

112
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,173
and anything bigger
is automatically thrown away.

113
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,378
Potatoes remain
a staple foodstuff for many

114
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:24,573
and because large quantities
of potatoes are dumped,

115
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,480
the practice of gleaning
has reappeared.

116
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,484
In general people wait nearby

117
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,317
and follow the trailers.

118
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,452
We followed the trailers
but didn't see anyone

119
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,289
except a man who might have known,

120
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:44,266
not through a newspaper though
for they never announce

121
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,166
dumping here tomorrow,
there next week.

122
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,040
Potatoes left in the open like that

123
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:53,673
soon become green
and dangerous to eat.

124
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,979
Sometimes the children give
the signal.

125
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,114
Hey, we found a big one here!

126
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,356
C'mon, catch it!

127
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,516
<i>Monday, potatoes</i>

128
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,354
<i>Tuesday, potatoes</i>

129
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,260
<i>Wednesday, potatoes again</i>

130
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,033
<i>Thursday, potatoes</i>

131
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,171
<i>Friday, potatoes</i>

132
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,738
<i>Saturday, potatoes again</i>

133
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,400
<i>Sunday, potatoes au gratin</i>

134
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,446
Look, I've picked up more or less

135
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,949
200 or 300 pounds.

136
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,182
You find very large ones
in the leftovers.

137
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,484
The damaged ones we leave.

138
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:44,459
Some are too small,
we take the large ones rather.

139
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,958
See,

140
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,065
misshapen ones,

141
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,390
heart-shaped ones.

142
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,060
The heart, I want the heart!

143
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,595
I was glad.

144
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,573
I immediately filmed them up close,

145
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,177
and set about filming
perilously with one hand

146
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,180
my other hand
gleaning heart-shaped potatoes.

147
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,695
Then I took a few home with me.

148
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,126
I looked at them again,
filmed them again.

149
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,540
Then it dawned upon me:
the Good Heart Charity Meals.

150
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,781
Why not organize an expedition

151
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,482
on the day the potatoes

152
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,448
are to be dumped?

153
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:47,183
<i>When I think of all the food gone
bad that's enough to make me mad</i>

154
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:51,086
<i>If you've been kicked out
and you're down and out</i>

155
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,595
<i>Then you need food for nought</i>

156
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,324
I take a few for me and my kids,

157
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,770
and we collect together.

158
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:07,106
I've joined the Charity Meals
because I was unemployed.

159
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,544
I still am but I expect
to start on a trial job soon

160
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,743
and meanwhile, I'd rather
help people than do nothing,

161
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,146
help people in dire straits.

162
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,584
I'm a single mother.

163
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,794
I get food from the Red Cross
and the Charity Meals.

164
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,089
When I see all this go to waste

165
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,236
and that some people
have nothing to eat,

166
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,166
it's really disgraceful.

167
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,643
On that day
they collected almost 700 lbs.

168
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,279
At least that's something.

169
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,117
A little later,
almost on the same spot,

170
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,317
we saw a man approaching.

171
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,656
I went over to him and asked him

172
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,332
how much he thought there was.

173
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,697
Almost a ton if you add
all the mounds together,

174
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,706
a ton of potatoes wasted.

175
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,346
Same thing with cauliflowers,

176
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,211
fruit and vegetables
in other regions,

177
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:22,786
but here it's potato country,
and we take what we find.

178
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,691
We're better off working
in the fields than shoplifting.

179
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,787
It's the same for all of us,
I'm not alone.

180
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,496
We get by as best we can.

181
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,498
We do potatoes,
we look in trash cans,

182
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,763
that keeps me going for now.

183
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,272
It's a hard life, that's all.

184
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,808
The year 2K is upon us, great, heh?

185
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,679
OK, I'm on my way with my 7O lbs,

186
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:58,356
and there are several tons left,
which could be picked,

187
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,255
but people don't know
where to come to. There you are.

188
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,509
They are hoboes in caravans.

189
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,705
We are gypsies, we travel around.
They're different from us.

190
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:30,013
It needs to be cut up
for the scrap merchant to come.

191
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:34,656
We don't have the necessary tools.
No electricity,just candles.

192
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,658
What do you do for water?

193
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,091
What?

194
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,597
Water?
That's all we have. It's over there.

195
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,195
That's our tap.

196
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,438
- What if it freezes?
- If it freezes...

197
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,077
we pad around the pipe,
or we let it drip

198
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,606
to stop it freezing
when it gets really cold,

199
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,310
like last year,
when it got to -7OF on the ground.

200
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,346
You get used to it.

201
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,631
You seem to like beer?

202
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,133
I'd drink anything.

203
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,238
How many beers is that?

204
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,237
I drink a pack a day.

205
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,104
- What?
- Yeah, a pack of 24 a day.

206
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,744
24 or even 32.

207
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,705
Tell me what happened to you.

208
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,246
Did you have a house before?

209
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,649
Yeah, I had a job.

210
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,520
I worked impossible hours,

211
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,591
21 or 22 hours a day.

212
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,250
- Truck driving?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,725
- A trucker?
- Yes.

214
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,658
I drove long vehicles.

215
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,336
Then one day the police
breathalyzed me and then...

216
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,766
that's howl lost my job.

217
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:01,271
Then my wife left me,
she took my three kids with her,

218
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,505
and I was in free-fall after that.

219
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,116
Divorce, everything?

220
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:10,085
Yes, and I haven't seen my kids
for almost 2 years.

221
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,482
They're 500 miles away from me.

222
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,421
I can't go and see them.

223
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,652
I don't have a car or a license.

224
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,721
- It's terrible.
- Yes it is.

225
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,556
I think of them every single day.

226
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,166
- Here's Guilene.
- She'll tell you everything.

227
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,271
Did you know that once
they're through picking potatoes,

228
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:36,210
you're allowed to take leftovers?
- No.

229
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,447
You didn't know?

230
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,085
- It's not allowed.
- Yes it is!

231
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,154
I have something
very important to say:

232
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:48,191
Why has the Mayor put us here,
I've been here four years,

233
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,419
and now he wants us to go.

234
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,324
He says he was fed up
with us gypsies,

235
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,263
but I want to stay here.

236
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,694
I had an apartment
but it cost too much.

237
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,707
Her first trailer cost her $350

238
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,641
and the latest one,

239
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,344
where I am housed at the moment,
$35.

240
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,571
<i>We met</i>

241
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:14,480
when I was working
in a café as a cleaning woman,

242
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,450
that's how we met.

243
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:22,357
So long as there's welfare
money left, OK, but after...

244
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,591
we have to get by somehow.

245
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,427
Then we have to beg

246
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,763
and forage through the trash.

247
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,600
We find food in the garbage.

248
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:35,739
Good food?

249
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:40,443
We're badly off. We do find
good food. Which could still be

250
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:45,083
sold in shops. But they have to
change their shelves.

251
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,718
We take advantage of that,
it's a lucky draw.

252
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,455
But we have to comb
all the garbage cans everywhere

253
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,216
to recover stuff.

254
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:55,753
See for yourself.

255
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,032
For the soup!

256
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,673
My bunch of flowers!

257
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,168
- Another cucumber.
- Sure, there's plenty.

258
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,239
That comes from the trash.

259
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:19,243
The expiry date is 11-29,
two days ago.

260
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,147
- One day ago.
- Right.

261
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,723
That's still valid for seven
or eight days, a week or so.

262
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,259
I've got fish which I found there.

263
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,962
It's good until 12-24.

264
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,621
We found it in the trash.

265
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:38,364
We're not afraid to get our
hands dirty. You can wash hands.

266
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,071
Hey, guys, the new appetizer

267
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,414
is lamb kidney in a chicory
root sauce

268
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,650
with a potato fritter

269
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,044
and an aniseed and nut soup

270
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,622
and mushroom mousse
with truffle oil.

271
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,585
As I watched all this cooking,

272
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,426
I asked the chef
if there were lots of leftovers, and

273
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,125
what he did with them.

274
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,028
Nothing should be wasted.

275
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,469
With the leftover lentils,
we make a lentil soup,

276
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,973
we mince the greenery into a gratin,

277
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,169
the meat bones we use for stock

278
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,178
the fish bones for sauce.

279
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,678
We don't throw anything away.

280
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,013
You have to be economical.

281
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:33,481
If I had to buy all the herbs
I pick daily on the hills...

282
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:36,628
A small bunch of savory
like this is $1.50

283
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,390
and we use about 2O
of them every day.

284
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,124
We'd be spending a fortune on herbs.

285
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,132
Anyway, I love picking them.

286
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,670
That nice inventive and thrifty chef

287
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,479
offers a gourmet menu for $100.

288
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:58,015
Edouard Loubet
is the youngest French chef

289
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:00,652
to have earned 2 stars
in the Michelin guide,

290
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,954
now called the Red Guide.

291
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,385
Surprisingly enough,
Edouard is also a born gleaner,

292
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,459
or rather a born picker.

293
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:14,361
With his hat on, in his shirt sleeves,
he looks like a Provencial figurine.

294
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,563
Don't tread on the apples!

295
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,739
We take what
the farmers leave behind

296
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:26,544
or we pick the ripe fruit
on the trees.

297
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,374
This is the best thing you can use

298
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,483
to make good spirits
or good fruit jelly.

299
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,345
I never miss the chance.

300
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,486
How come you, a chef, also pick?

301
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,394
Firstly because
my grandparents taught me to

302
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,191
along fields and roads,

303
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:51,097
and also because

304
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:55,297
I then know what produce I get
and where I get it from.

305
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,375
I don't want
refrigerated produce from Italy

306
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:02,446
which is sold only when someone
feels like saying it is ripe.

307
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,675
As we're talking grapes and wine...

308
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,111
Let's go, Isa!

309
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,380
...we might as well go to
a wine area.

310
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,581
We're off to Burgundy.

311
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,796
On the road,
there are trucks, lots of trucks,

312
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,494
of the kind we loved
when we were kids.

313
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,294
We pass them and gaze at them.

314
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,067
Here's a very big one
passing us, transporting cars,

315
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,471
and here's another one.

316
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:39,141
And now we are passing him,

317
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,684
we struggle a little
to pass this one.

318
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,583
It's like a child's game.

319
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,525
We're arriving in Burgundy.

320
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,131
Beaune to me
is above all the Hospices

321
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,426
and the painting by Van der Weyden,

322
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,499
The Last Judgment.

323
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:04,532
The Archangel Michael weighs
and judges the deeds of the dead.

324
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:10,038
The ones who are light
are to be resurrected,

325
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:13,708
and the heavy ones
are to suffer in hell.

326
00:21:57,084 --> 00:22:01,260
The grape harvest is over,
and yet nobody is in sight.

327
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,633
Why is that?

328
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:06,300
If you want your wine
to be ranked as vintage,

329
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,462
the yearly production is limited.

330
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,439
That means you can only produce

331
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,579
a certain quota per plot.

332
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:19,607
Growing up, I didn't hear
much about pickers.

333
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:24,415
Wine growers have always
protected themselves against them,

334
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,658
for if you let people
pick in your vines,

335
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:30,591
how can you be sure they are not

336
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:33,264
going to pick on a large scale?

337
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:40,002
These vintage vines
have been entirely harvested

338
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,472
and the surplus has been
deliberately left on the ground.

339
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,805
They're drying out,
lost for everybody.

340
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,814
It's a measure to protect
our profession and capital.

341
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,647
What you see here,

342
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:59,580
is called second
generation grapes, verjuice,

343
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:03,392
or conscripts,
depending on the area.

344
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:05,991
Conscripts.

345
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,456
Like soldiers?

346
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:12,502
Exactly, like conscripts.
Some people pick them.

347
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,397
It's a second harvest
and yields a cheaper wine

348
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,304
called wine of the pickings.

349
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,742
- Will it taste of Pommard?
- No, not at all.

350
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:27,514
It makes a table wine,
a really cheap table wine.

351
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:32,218
The vintage wine region
is not a good one for picking.

352
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:37,427
Gleaming, or picking,
is forbidden in Burgundy.

353
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,030
It ended 3 or 4 years ago.

354
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,394
It's sad, but that's the way it is.

355
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,531
Gleaning was lovely.

356
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:49,201
<i>We would see the gleaner,
tramping along,</i>

357
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,740
<i>Gathering the relics</i>

358
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:54,409
<i>of that which is falling
Behind the reaper...</i>

359
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,308
- Do you know?
- Du Bellay?

360
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,617
- Right?
- It is.

361
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:01,143
Impressive, you know it by heart!

362
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:05,023
I took over my father's estate.

363
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,156
From the grape to the bottle,

364
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,320
lam the only master on board.

365
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,564
I have no cellarman,
no head cellarman.

366
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,972
With Nadine, we choose the best
blends for our Chateau bottles.

367
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,509
- Do you both choose?
- We both do.

368
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,009
Jean Laplanche,

369
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:30,744
a keen wine grower,

370
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:34,218
has another calling, psychotherapy.

371
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:39,081
I am a practicing therapist,
but above all a theoretician,

372
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,590
or rather a philosopher of therapy.

373
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:43,726
What's your theory?

374
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:48,522
What distinguishes me,
is that I have tried to integrate

375
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,766
into man's psyche.

376
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,470
The Other above the Ego, i.e.
I developed an anti-ego philosophy,

377
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:01,078
a philosophy which shows
how man first originates

378
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:03,010
in the Other.

379
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,381
He copes with his double life?

380
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,610
- Rather well.
- He's good, isn't he?

381
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:11,587
- Rather well.
- He's intelligent, I think. And modest.

382
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,649
It keeps me going.

383
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,725
- Isn't it daunting for you?
- What is?

384
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,758
That he is a therapist
and makes wine too.

385
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,159
I was analyzed
so as to learn a little more.

386
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:24,734
- By him?
- No, by Lacan.

387
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,198
<i>'</i> Ages ago.
" <i>I</i> Was very young,

388
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:28,999
A long time ago.

389
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,140
We'll be married 5O years

390
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,278
in the year 2000.

391
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:37,015
Tell me how you met.

392
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,152
At a village dance,
where most people meet.

393
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,521
- The kiss!
- Right...

394
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,089
No one's interested in that!

395
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:51,096
I must tell you something,

396
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:54,198
something the whole world
should know about.

397
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,033
I met him,
it was like a lightning bolt.

398
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,159
You see?

399
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:02,330
The way he was dressed,
I couldn't possibly miss him.

400
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:06,367
He had a red cap on, honest,

401
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,571
he was back from the Riviera.
He looked so...

402
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,649
He had a red cotton cap,

403
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:15,544
a green shirt,

404
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,952
mustard yellow pants,

405
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:21,491
rope espadrilles and...

406
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,059
- Yellow ones!
- Right.

407
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:27,757
And a multicolored belt.
I couldn't miss him,just couldn't.

408
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,468
How was she dressed?

409
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,400
That I can't remember.
Yeah, it's the old story.

410
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,234
But I didn't fall
for her right away.

411
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,311
It all came later with me.

412
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:44,310
How mean of me!

413
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,087
Is it true, Huguette?

414
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:51,746
- I'm not in his heart.
- It's true.

415
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,627
This is Laurent, my son.

416
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,062
A gleaner or a picker,
I'm not sure.

417
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:03,724
But I heard Glanum, not gleaning,

418
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:07,631
that's why I talked
about Saint-Rémy, where Glanum is.

419
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:11,999
Gleaming, no.

420
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:16,012
Because gleaning is very different
from picking, you see.

421
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,478
But picking, yes.

422
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,473
What's the difference?

423
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,019
The difference is that
you pick fruit that hangs,

424
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:27,353
that is hanging,
but you glean things that sprout.

425
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,323
Like grain. It's different.

426
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,155
Olives and grain.

427
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,130
Almonds...

428
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,969
Figs too,
people make jams out of figs.

429
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,673
The fig, you pick.

430
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:46,636
Look, nature's wonders!

431
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,041
Overripe and beautiful!

432
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,122
That's fruit from heaven!

433
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:03,493
I half-feel like interfering,

434
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,496
but it is none of my business,
it's their fruit.

435
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:13,197
This one's almost
pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy.

436
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:16,632
Anyway, half the people are stingy.

437
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:22,577
They won't allow gleaning because
they don't feel like being nice.

438
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,312
There's a lot left.

439
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,642
The harvest is over now.

440
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,216
Are these not edible?

441
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,382
Edible, yes, but not good
for making candied fruits.

442
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:37,562
Do you allow people to collect them?

443
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:42,161
No. I'm not the owner, but up to now,
it's never been allowed.

444
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:46,194
The harvest of the cabbages is over,

445
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,670
only a few are left here and there.

446
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:51,567
These cabbages can be gleaned

447
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,679
with absolute impunity

448
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,448
by gleaners from Avignon or around.

449
00:28:58,472 --> 00:28:59,974
Here are lovely tomatoes.

450
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,986
The machine couldn't take
what's too low.

451
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:05,213
All these tomatoes,

452
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,623
which are just as red
as my bible, the penal code,

453
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:12,054
all can be gleaned.

454
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:16,059
And it's not me,
it's the penal code that says so,

455
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:19,602
in article R-26.10. Here:

456
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:25,135
gleaning is allowed
from sunup until sundown.

457
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,642
First requirement.

458
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,938
The second requirement

459
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,639
is that gleaning
occurs after the harvest.

460
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,948
And here, we can clearly see
the harvest is over.

461
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,684
Paging through
an old law commentary

462
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,958
I happened upon a decree,

463
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:45,655
or rather an edict,
dated Nov. 2, 1554

464
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,656
which says
just the same as the law today.

465
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:53,301
It allows the poor, the wretched,

466
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,431
the deprived, to enter the fields
once harvesting is over.

467
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,103
Old documents talk
of the poor, the destitute,

468
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:05,182
but how are we to consider
those who want for nothing

469
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:07,351
and glean just for fun?

470
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:10,114
It's as if they needed
something too.

471
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:14,121
If they glean for fun, it's because
they have a need for fun.

472
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:17,490
So if the requirements
and the times are adhered to,

473
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,222
they can glean as the poor used to.

474
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:21,556
Thank you.

475
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,760
Sure.
I'll take a walk in the cabbages.

476
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:34,341
I'll walk my small camera
among the colored cabbages

477
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,505
and film other vegetables
which catch my eye.

478
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:05,168
On this type of gleaning,
of images, impressions,

479
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,278
there is no legislation,

480
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:11,541
and gleaning is defined figuratively
as a mental activity.

481
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,185
To glean facts, acts and deeds,

482
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,287
to glean information.

483
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:18,215
And for forgetful me,

484
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,122
it's what I have gleaned
that tells where I've been.

485
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:26,626
From Japan, I brought back in
my case souvenirs I had gleaned.

486
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,205
I am back home, the cats are here,

487
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:38,340
there's mail,

488
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,338
one plant's died,
the others haven't.

489
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:45,379
Then I look at the leak
in the ceiling and the mold,

490
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:46,744
I got used to it.

491
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,418
I like it in the end.

492
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,284
It's like a landscape,
an abstract painting,

493
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,818
a Tapiés.

494
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,516
A Guo Qiang.

495
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,795
A Borderie.

496
00:31:58,352 --> 00:31:59,763
There's water dripping.

497
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,533
I open my suitcase.

498
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,589
Amazing,
in a department store in Tokyo,

499
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,667
on the top floor,

500
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:38,058
there were Rembrandt paintings,

501
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,037
original Rembrandts.

502
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,467
<i>Sasha, up chase.</i>

503
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,333
And then my hand up close,

504
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:49,639
I mean, this is my project:

505
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,374
to film with one hand my other hand.

506
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,149
To enter into the horror of it.

507
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,256
I find it extraordinary.

508
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:00,649
I feel as if I am an animal,

509
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:04,358
worse, I am an animal I don't know.

510
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:09,497
And here's Rembrandt's
self-portrait,

511
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:14,098
but it's just the same in fact,
always a self-portrait.

512
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,071
Maurice Utrillo's

513
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:25,075
we saw in a very small museum

514
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:28,344
in the former City Hall of Sannois.

515
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,682
We were going

516
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:34,651
to film nearby, at Hervé's,
alias VR99.

517
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:38,389
In the year 2000,
his alias will be VR2OOO.

518
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,162
'Loading up'

519
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:46,270
means retrieving
heavy objects people get rid of.

520
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,432
To do so,

521
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:53,010
town councils and city halls provide

522
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,011
small maps such as this one.

523
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,583
It shows all the streets,
the districts and the days

524
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:05,088
on which one can go
and pick them up.

525
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,628
I think the maps show
where to dump things rather.

526
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,961
Yes, right, well,

527
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,658
I read the map my own way because

528
00:34:17,257 --> 00:34:20,397
that's where I find my raw material.

529
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:26,176
I am, among other things,
a painter and a retriever.

530
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:29,079
I prefer night time,

531
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:34,982
and because I go by bike,
I can only carry small things home.

532
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,519
It'll be easier if I show you.

533
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,194
I make images
from salvaged material,

534
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,762
frames from wood,

535
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,531
I use food packages, slates,

536
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:53,300
and then I also recycle

537
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:57,135
my own packets of cigarette paper,

538
00:34:57,798 --> 00:35:01,302
and what's good about these objects

539
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:04,548
is that they have a past,
they've already had a life,

540
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:07,275
and they're still very much alive.

541
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,581
All you have to do
is give them a second chance.

542
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,196
All you need to do is
wander around, locate sites,

543
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:24,700
and then simply help yourself,
like in a real department store.

544
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:30,433
On site, you find heaps
of heavy objects,

545
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:33,271
it is best to get there quickly,

546
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,710
because the competition is fierce.

547
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,243
Objects go quickly.

548
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:53,726
They're like presents left
on the street, it's like Christmas.

549
00:35:55,722 --> 00:36:00,000
When I was a kid, my grandfather
used to salvage things as well.

550
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,432
He made piles.

551
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:05,133
I've always liked
the world of dumps and salvage,

552
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,041
anything that's been
sort of discarded by society.

553
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,982
It's like a cavern here.

554
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,517
My own little cavern, that's right.

555
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:20,020
A place where I combine

556
00:36:20,314 --> 00:36:21,622
objects differently.

557
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,327
I need to accumulate.

558
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,225
It's a shelter as well?

559
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,393
From what?

560
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:32,167
From emptiness.
Because it's full here.

561
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:38,441
I'm moving towards emptiness now,
or rather, towards minimization.

562
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,545
As much minimization as possible.

563
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,738
- You're still a long way away!
- I am.

564
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:46,277
Right now, I store up things

565
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,649
because I know
I will need to recycle some.

566
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,314
The encounter happens
on the street.

567
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:56,291
The object beckons me,
because it belongs here in a way.

568
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:01,659
The encounter also happens
on the road,

569
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,559
and it happened to us.

570
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,064
On our left, an abandoned factory.

571
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:11,234
On the other side, a sign " Finds".

572
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:15,136
"Curios" is common,
but "Finds” is more inviting.

573
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,488
Hello, how are you?

574
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,315
Hello.

575
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,991
Turn and face me!
He won't.

576
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,756
I spotted some wheat behind
that chap,

577
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:37,363
and behind the robot,
I discovered a painting on gleaning.

578
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,562
It contained both

579
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,366
the humble stooping
of Millet's Glaneuses

580
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:45,305
and the proud posture
of Breton's Gleaner.

581
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:48,737
The painter
had an old dictionary at hand.

582
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:52,313
Honest, this is no movie trick,

583
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:56,182
we really did find these Glaneuses
purely by chance.

584
00:37:56,644 --> 00:38:01,218
The painting had beckoned us because
it belonged here in this film.

585
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:07,661
On the road again, off to the
Ideal Palace of Bodan Litnanski,

586
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,525
a much visited,
much publicized place.

587
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:19,008
This retired brickmason came
from Russia

588
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,646
and started building totem towers

589
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:24,171
made of scraps he found in dumps

590
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:28,285
and brought back in his trailer
hooked up to his moped.

591
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:31,115
It's solid stuff,
you know, very solid.

592
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:34,623
I am a brickmason.

593
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,633
I like dolls, they're my system.

594
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,471
Dolls are characters.

595
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,116
What do you think of all this?

596
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,045
- He's an amateur.
- Sorry?

597
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:03,448
He's an amateur.

598
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,951
We can't stop him, we let him.

599
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,419
But your husband is an artist.

600
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:10,425
An artist, well, maybe...

601
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,257
Why not?

602
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,331
There's better than that.

603
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:18,629
- What?
- Better, much better than that.

604
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:23,368
Like Louis Pons, for instance,

605
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,601
who uses junk as an inspiration.

606
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,444
He draws through objects,

607
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:30,206
he accommodates chance.

608
00:39:32,473 --> 00:39:35,352
All these objects around here

609
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,647
are my dictionary.

610
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,515
Useless things.

611
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:45,523
People think it's a cluster of junk.

612
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:48,633
I see it as a cluster
of possibilities.

613
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:54,399
Each object gives
a direction, each is a line,

614
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:57,132
picked up here and there,

615
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,504
indeed gleaned,

616
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,204
and which become

617
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:03,741
my paintings.

618
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,142
The aim of art is to tidy up

619
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,217
one's inner and exterior worlds.

620
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,720
These are just crayons,
children's crayons.

621
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:16,222
Here we have tins and spools...

622
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,725
This is the tongue of a small bell.

623
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,092
I make sentences from things.

624
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:26,767
A cricket on a heap of trash.

625
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:32,443
Cages are interesting too,
a bit like boats, like violins

626
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,102
and things whose...

627
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:39,510
shapes at first are very simple
and the same,

628
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:42,654
but the possible variations
are infinite.

629
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:46,317
These are skirting boards
and frames.

630
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,188
There is a... from cars...

631
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,290
a windshield wiper.

632
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,557
But for me they are streaks.

633
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,428
I have to balance the streaks.

634
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,265
That's a statement.
Horizontal statements, nothing else.

635
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:17,046
Again one hand filming
the other hand, and more trucks.

636
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:19,452
I'd like to capture them.

637
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:22,019
To retain things passing?

638
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,456
No,just to play.

639
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:10,572
Noirmoutier is an island

640
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:14,473
renowned for its causeway
and its oysters.

641
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:17,707
People glean there

642
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:21,315
after rough storms
and very low tides.

643
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:30,358
Storms dislodge oysters
from their beds

644
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:32,393
and wash them ashore.

645
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,397
But they all know
that around Christmas time,

646
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:40,369
we are so busy
that we leave it to the gleaners.

647
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,030
They go as soon as

648
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,301
the storm has abated.

649
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:57,184
A high sea over the beds
is a pretty sight

650
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,549
but to profit from the low tide

651
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:03,058
gleaners need a copy
of the Tide Tables.

652
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,763
We come every year
for the lowest tide.

653
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:11,569
They're going to follow
the receding sea

654
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,205
and anything they find they pick up.

655
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:30,144
People collect the oysters
that have come loose.

656
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:34,591
In theory, they keep out
of the poles around the beds.

657
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,419
They must keep out.

658
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:38,756
They are too close.

659
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,592
Here the oyster farmers
let them carry on, but...

660
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,066
it degenerates sometimes.

661
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:47,334
We don't trespass!

662
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:50,236
The limit must be here, but...

663
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,707
we encroach a little sometimes.

664
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:56,373
We're not stupid.
We see others and do the same.

665
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:59,140
If they tell us anything, we scram.

666
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,316
It's tolerated
but not really allowed.

667
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:04,589
It's not downright illegal.

668
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:07,489
There still exists a right to glean,

669
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:11,323
provided people glean
15 yards from the beds.

670
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:14,431
- 25 yards away.
- Is it 25 yards now?

671
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,302
What are people allowed to do?

672
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,439
To collect up to <i>7</i> pounds each,
nothing more.

673
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:23,370
- I O yards away minimum.
- Right.

674
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:25,100
11 pounds per person.

675
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:29,273
<i>7</i> pounds of clams
and 11 pounds of oysters,

676
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,006
something like that.

677
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,711
11 pounds per person, I think.

678
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,978
Three dozen per person

679
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:38,623
but surely they take more than that.

680
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:41,356
They pick up small inedible oysters

681
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:45,190
that were churned
by the waves and are full of sand.

682
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,128
People from the mainland eat them,

683
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:50,199
and then say they get sick.

684
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,240
The Jura region was flooded.

685
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:04,973
The river Dard barred our route.

686
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:15,684
I liked it when
animals barred my way,

687
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:17,722
or I just stopped for them.

688
00:45:58,292 --> 00:46:00,932
The Nenon family,
in the hills near Apt,

689
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:03,336
present a special case of picking.

690
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:07,339
The vineyard they found
was wholly abandoned.

691
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:11,142
That's a fully fledged harvest here!

692
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,451
Yes, the entire vineyard
was left unpruned last year.

693
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,724
An entire harvest
going to waste.

694
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:23,055
I spotted this place
and I was very intrigued by it.

695
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,161
Could anybody say anything?

696
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:29,759
- Don't the owners care?
- No. After Nov. 1,

697
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:33,367
we are allowed
to pick grapes in the vineyards.

698
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:38,969
If not, they're eaten
by wild boars or birds.

699
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:42,376
- Do wild boars like grapes?
- They love grapes.

700
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,049
On that day,

701
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,581
I filmed dancing pruning shears.

702
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:50,722
I forgot to turn my camera off,

703
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:54,216
which is why we get
the dance of the lens cap.

704
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:47,009
The cap has stopped its crazy jig.

705
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,673
We're off to see the only owner

706
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:52,211
who cares for his gleaners.

707
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,216
I warn children about the terrible
effects if they eat too much,

708
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:01,985
but I take for granted that the
adults know and I leave them alone.

709
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:03,160
Jérome Noél-Bouton

710
00:48:03,384 --> 00:48:05,591
shows us an old photo of his vines

711
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:08,029
which used to be Marey's.

712
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,130
There is a mini-museum
in the cellar.

713
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:14,036
An engineer
and erudite physiologist,

714
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:17,472
Marey invented chronophotography.

715
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:19,167
He was a visionary.

716
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,243
He analyzed movement

717
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:26,009
before Muybridge and the Lumieres.
He is the ancestor of all movie makers,

718
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,219
and we're proud to be family.

719
00:48:29,243 --> 00:48:34,090
Marey was my father's grandfather,
which makes him my great-grandfather,

720
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,558
and to be more specific,

721
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:41,694
my grandfather
was Marey's son-in-law, since...

722
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:44,593
his wife, my grandmother,
was Marey's daughter.

723
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,638
She married a man named Bouton

724
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:52,403
and this estate, which used
to be in the Bouton family,

725
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:54,307
was bought by Marey,

726
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:59,308
and returned to the Bouton family
when his daughter married a Bouton.

727
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:01,077
Congratulations!

728
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,585
The tower you can see over there,

729
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:06,046
he built with his own two hands

730
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:08,726
to house his still camera equipment.

731
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,053
He set up wires and waited.

732
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,333
Animals or birds went past,
triggering the camera.

733
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:17,992
That's the hut

734
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,727
from which,

735
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,164
with his chronophotographic rifle,

736
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:24,740
he broke down the flight of birds.

737
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,748
That's Demeny, Marey's assistant,

738
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:33,517
holding the rifle and the film reel.

739
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:37,712
I wonder who the boy
with a bowler hat is.

740
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,553
Marey's experimental pictures

741
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:44,255
and film bits,

742
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:48,195
technical prowess aside,
are pure visual delight.

743
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:18,126
Our train leaves Paris

744
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:20,162
and happens to slow down

745
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,731
as we pass
lvry waste collection center.

746
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,468
The heart of our topic,

747
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:28,240
since we're going to Prades,
home of our musician Joanna.

748
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:32,707
She met youngsters
who had had a brush with the law

749
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:36,173
for damaging
the trash bins of a supermarket

750
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:39,249
because the contents
had been doused in bleach.

751
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:44,247
I thought I could film them
explaining the case

752
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:46,549
if I met all the protagonists -

753
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:49,354
the youngsters gathered
on the square,

754
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,454
the manager of the shop,

755
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:55,265
and the magistrate from the court,

756
00:50:55,723 --> 00:50:57,760
who seemed concerned and polite.

757
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,403
I wanted to know how
these homeless

758
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:03,098
coped with the law.

759
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:07,441
Should squatting be legalized?

760
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,639
I could work on it,
if not for this robe.

761
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,250
But your robe is lovely!

762
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:18,379
It was a simple case
of youngsters vandalizing things.

763
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:20,422
I found them guilty of violence.

764
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:22,527
Before bleach was sprayed on?

765
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:25,027
They'd knock over the trash

766
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:28,394
and my staff had
to clean up after them.

767
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:35,496
That led me to apply the law

768
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:38,667
and bleach the trash,
which they didn't appreciate.

769
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,146
- We got angry.
- But nothing serious.

770
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:44,212
We knocked over trash cans,

771
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:47,750
and damaged the wall
with graffiti and tomatoes.

772
00:51:48,142 --> 00:51:49,553
They broke the camera.

773
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:53,088
It was locked,
we had to climb a little.

774
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,758
They went over the fence.

775
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,620
They were trespassing
on private property.

776
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:01,594
Appearing in court
was itself a penalty

777
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:05,202
for these youths
who want to be free of all rules.

778
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,235
We only stole trash.

779
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:11,637
The aim isn't to fine them
but to remind them of the law.

780
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,472
They all played their part,
applying their own logic.

781
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,477
The kids said
what they were supposed to.

782
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,053
We filmed them with their dogs.
It was picturesque.

783
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,282
I'm not that antisocial.

784
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:29,390
- May I ask you how old you are?
- 22.

785
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,999
Their beauty is poignant when you
realize that, for whatever reason,

786
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:37,031
they get most of their food
from trash cans.

787
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,369
In court, I was told

788
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:43,633
it was a dialogue of the deaf,
but not of the dumb.

789
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:45,806
They seized the chance
to have fun.

790
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,679
I said she was mad,
she cited me for contempt of court.

791
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:54,412
We said she was out of her mind,
and she would go: Write it down!

792
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,550
Recorder, write down:
Out of her mind!

793
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:02,318
We felt it was a foregone
conclusion. It was sickening.

794
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:06,727
She opted for trial in closed court.
I shouted and slammed the door.

795
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:11,261
They're not through
talking about this episode,

796
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:15,032
and I'm not through thinking
about it in my hotel room.

797
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:19,076
We filmed and continue to film
people who hang around trash cans.

798
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:21,440
They have various reasons
for doing so.

799
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:24,015
Each experiences it differently.

800
00:53:27,341 --> 00:53:28,547
- Hi!
- Here he is!

801
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:29,779
<i>How are you?</i>

802
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:32,147
Sit down, there's coffee for you.

803
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:36,321
We had been told: "He wears

804
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,757
rubber boots.
He salvages everything“.

805
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:42,659
Yes, I live almost 100%
on things from the trash.

806
00:53:47,228 --> 00:53:48,764
Everybody, rich or poor,

807
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:51,006
throws food away. Why?

808
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:53,736
Because we are so stupid with food!

809
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:58,243
If we're past the sell-by date
of a yogurt, people go:

810
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,749
"Oh my God, I can't eat this!

811
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:03,112
It'll kill me!"

812
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:04,585
So stupid.

813
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,691
It's easy

814
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:10,186
to tell from the smell of it
if it's OK or not.

815
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:14,656
It's quite simple, I've eaten
100% trash for 1 O years now...

816
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:17,496
for 1 O or 15 years,

817
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:20,104
I've never been ill.

818
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:22,474
- You don't have a job?
- I do.

819
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,737
I have a job, a salary,
a social security number.

820
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,377
So you are not forced to do that?

821
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:32,039
Absolutely not.

822
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:35,779
Salvaging is a matter
of ethics for me,

823
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,114
because I find it
utterly unacceptable to see

824
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,624
all this waste on the streets.

825
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:46,690
That proves we're heading for
disasters, like the Erika oil spill.

826
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:48,191
<i>Oil Slick</i>

Sea birds,

830

guillemots, razorbill penguins,

831
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:27,097
all those who were smashed up
real good by Total Fina Oil,

832
00:55:27,428 --> 00:55:30,637
those who will get
smashed up real good

833
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:34,142
by this over-consuming society...
if they are cleaned,

834
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:37,339
the birds might still get caught
in nets,

835
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,212
it's for them that I'm an activist.

836
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:42,684
All the rest can die
in their apartments,

837
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,219
on their trash,
I don't care. Birds first.

838
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,627
Do you always wear boots?

839
00:55:53,787 --> 00:55:57,132
Yes, rubber boots have 2 advantages,

840
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:01,239
on this hostile ground,
they're really good stuff.

841
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:04,135
There's a psychological aspect too,

842
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:07,302
with my boots,
I'm like the lord of this town.

843
00:56:07,468 --> 00:56:09,277
All these idiots dump away,

844
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:12,349
I come after them
and rake in the chips.

845
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:19,621
<i>Trash is Beautiful!</i>

846
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,193
An exhibition featuring
demonstration trash cans

847
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,524
was organized to teach children

848
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,495
how to sort out the trash.

849
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:39,002
At Trash is Beautiful,
they like colors,

850
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,071
and children play with bits of junk.

851
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:44,716
This is just plastic
from the street.

852
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,985
Gino Rizzi is in charge
of the kids' workshop.

853
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:56,792
He himself transforms
pots of yogurt into flowers

854
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,225
and plastic bottles into mobiles.

855
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:07,439
Where does play end
and art start?

The American artist Sze

00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:19,948
exhibits mobiles
made with lots of bits and pieces.

859
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:25,116
The kitchen trash
has made it to the art world,

860
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:28,383
where junk is highly-prized
and priced.

861
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:43,564
In any case, museum trash

862
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:47,371
is small, cute,
clean and colorful.

863
00:57:47,534 --> 00:57:50,708
Have those kids ever seen
brooms in action,

864
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:55,212
or shaken hands with
a garbage collector?

865
00:57:59,546 --> 00:58:00,718
- How are you?
- Fine.

866
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:05,188
That's neighborhood life.

867
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,124
I live here

868
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:11,427
at Mr. Charlie Plusquellec's,
because he's a friend.

869
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,397
More than a friend,

870
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,367
a protector, a godfather,
he's everything to me.

871
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:21,603
I am so very very happy,
very glad, I am here

872
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,444
surrounded by nature.

873
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,680
You see,

874
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:27,211
it's worse than paradise.

875
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:31,282
Salomon is a little bit
like a migrating bird.

876
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,618
He arrives, he moves in,

877
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:36,660
and then one day, he disappears.

878
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:40,431
And then he comes back again,
and then leaves.

879
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,197
So far he's been back 3 times.

880
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,438
Every day, I come out of here,

881
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:51,003
I wander around,

882
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:55,580
looking here and there
for throw-aways.

883
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:10,060
Don't touch anything!

884
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:12,528
- You hear me?
- Yes, Ma'am.

885
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:15,166
Don't you understand what I said?

886
00:59:16,523 --> 00:59:20,596
Every morning, early,
you come across a little something.

887
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:22,706
It's like a lottery.

888
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,510
It's good.

889
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,383
There's lots.

890
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:35,582
Do you need it?

891
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,744
Wait, he might want some.

892
00:59:38,178 --> 00:59:39,657
Want some bread?

893
00:59:41,015 --> 00:59:43,495
I always come here and help myself.

894
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,631
Sometimes you get good cold meats,

895
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:50,735
sometimes fowl, a bit of everything.

896
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,503
Salomon found

897
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,707
chicken legs.

898
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:02,742
So I'll cook
the meat before it goes off.

899
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:07,715
You're going to eat
chicken and rabbit for a month!

900
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:10,112
No, don't worry.

901
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:13,349
We always find someone
to share with.

902
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:20,131
We give it to the neighbors,
the woman next door especially.

903
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:32,703
That's good.

904
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:34,504
Right now.

905
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:36,646
We have 1, 2, 3.

906
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:40,650
4 fridges and 2 freezers

907
01:00:40,808 --> 01:00:44,346
that we picked up and fixed.

908
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:48,025
I patch them up, I fix them,

909
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:51,059
and when the machine works
I sell it or...

910
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:53,763
I give it away to our neighbors.

911
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:06,972
Fridges are everywhere
on the streets.

912
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:10,277
Sometimes they work, sometimes not.

913

01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:21,483
and recycle them
as fully furnished, fitted spaces.

918
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,277
My neighbor the Lion of Denfert

919
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:50,184
is made of bronze.

920
01:01:51,645 --> 01:01:54,626
My friend the Lion in Arles
is made of stone.

921
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,051
We got there in the early hours.

922
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:03,264
The people from the fair
were still asleep,

923
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,060
and I saw a man
looking at the river flow by.

924
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:13,574
I half-felt like talking to him.

925
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:23,277
Further on, along the Rhone,

926
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,046
in a blissful orchard

927
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,456
I saw gleaners arrive.

928
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:30,426
You can tell them

929
01:02:30,618 --> 01:02:34,088
from their boxes,
sacks and plastic bags

930
01:02:34,255 --> 01:02:38,726
which don't look anything like
the standard containers of the workers.

931
01:02:39,393 --> 01:02:42,704
My name's David,
I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.

932
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:45,367
We often allow

933
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,476
gleaners to come in

934
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:49,476
after our pickers

935
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,276
provided they remain
10 yards behind.

936
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:57,620
Look, there's still
a lot left in the trees.

937
01:02:58,312 --> 01:03:00,553
We just take advantage of this.

938
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:04,422
I collect them
so that they don't go to waste,

939
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:07,327
and I share them out,

940
01:03:07,488 --> 01:03:09,764
we stew them or whatever.

941
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:14,501
I want to pick them because
there're lots left as you can see.

942
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:17,405
I don't take damaged ones,

943
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:20,102
because my children
are very particular.

944
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,747
They're used to getting the best.

945
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,315
This one is damaged
sol chuck it away.

946
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:30,580
We gleaners also discard some fruit.

947
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:35,488
Here's an apple
which has got nothing going for it,

948
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:38,323
it's like an ugly and stupid woman.

949
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,022
It's small and sunburnt.

950
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,293
Commercial value: zero.

951
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:47,433
We can't prevent people

952
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:51,605
from providing themselves
with apples

953
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:54,245
once we have finished harvesting.

954
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,405
So we proclaim
an official gleaning period,

955
01:03:57,571 --> 01:04:00,017
we take car registrations down,

956
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:03,748
if it's a moped,
we ask for a Xerox of the owner's ID

957
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:09,027
and we tell them from when to when
they can come and collect.

958
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,652
Isn't it a bit over-regulated?

959
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:15,363
Well, it's either that
or nothing at all.

960
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:20,098
Once people are registered,

961
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:25,072
they can take 400 pounds, I don't
mind, even if it's a whole lot.

962
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:27,205
Good for them.

963
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:30,307
In this field of 3 hectares,

964
01:04:30,537 --> 01:04:33,780
at least 1 O tons
will be left unpicked.

965
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:37,514
That gives the gleaners
quite a lot of exercise.

966
01:04:40,748 --> 01:04:44,491
You have to find them
behind the trees, under the leaves.

967
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:46,757
It takes a while
to fill up a basket.

968
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:50,432
Picking is not a piece of cake,
it's hard work.

969
01:04:58,198 --> 01:05:00,041
Quite a few have fallen here.

970
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:03,675
You just have to pick them up.

971
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:10,211
Robert, a gleaner of many crops,
let us follow him.

972
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:24,633
I'm looking for pine nuts.

973
01:05:25,159 --> 01:05:26,763
You're really thorough!

974
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:30,473
Right, I really don't
let anything go by.

975
01:05:30,664 --> 01:05:33,736
In this greenhouse,
the tomato harvest is over.

976
01:05:34,068 --> 01:05:37,140
We pick the remains
before they clean the place.

977
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:40,143
Here, see the tomatoes...

978
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:44,078
That's nature,
it shouldn't be wasted.

979
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:48,089
It's abandoned.
Once the harvest is over,

980
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:51,195
it's not worth
hiring people just for those.

981
01:05:51,352 --> 01:05:53,229
They'd rather let us do it.

982
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,031
Can anybody go in the greenhouses?

983
01:05:57,191 --> 01:06:00,502
No, not the greenhouses.
I don't know what the law is.

984
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:03,998
Greenhouses are a facility
to grow vegetables.

985
01:06:04,165 --> 01:06:06,145
Once the harvest is collected,

986
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,339
there's some left, a few tomatoes,
grapes, carrots or celery.

987
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:13,184
If gleaners remain within the law

988
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,342
farmers can't say anything,

989
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:18,388
can't sue them for anything.

990
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:20,081
Even on their property?

991
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:21,590
Even then, precisely,

992
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:24,320
gleaning is always
on private property.

993
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:30,165
Mr. Dessaud, our lawyer in the fields,
explained gleaning rights.

994
01:06:31,025 --> 01:06:35,531
Mrs. Espie, our lawyer in the streets,
tells us about salvaging rights.

995
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:45,742
The law on gleaning
doesn't apply to these objects.

996
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,344
"Res derelictae"

997
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:50,078
are ownerless things,

998
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:54,384
since the owner's intention
has been clearly expressed:

999
01:06:54,548 --> 01:06:57,461
they have deliberately
abandoned them.

1000
01:06:57,751 --> 01:07:00,527
Only the penal code
deals with their status

1001
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:05,137
and says this property can't be
stolen since it has no owner.

1002
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:10,100
Those who take the object
become its legal owners.

1003
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:14,006
This acquisition is unusual,
since it comes from no one.

1004
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:17,979
Once taken,
the object belongs to them

1005
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:20,015
irrevocably.

1006
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:21,951
Thank you very much.

1007
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:23,213
You're welcome.

1008
01:07:23,677 --> 01:07:26,214
<i>Yeah. Sidelined beds on the sidewalk</i>

1009
01:07:26,513 --> 01:07:29,187
<i>Washed-out machines,
tired-out fridges</i>

1010
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,694
<i>lust bend down
and grab your furniture</i>

1011
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:35,159
<i>Yeah. Cookers,
cushions, club armchairs</i>

1012
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:39,133
<i>Weary wood chairs and TV sets,
Worn-out couches</i>

1013
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:42,136
<i>lust bend over, you're made over</i>

1014
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,640
<i>Street rehab and TV rap, yeah, yeah!</i>

1015
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:46,068
<i>Broken TVs</i>

1016
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:53,245
I've seen lots of TVs abandoned,

1017
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,353
and within a few minutes

1018
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:59,786
somebody was taking out the copper.

1019
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,960
It's the copper
from the deflector coils.

1020
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:25,274
I looked at the magic screen
thinking I began this film

1021
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,484
right after the eclipse shown on TV,

1022
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:32,722
continued while the countdown
to Y2K was shown on TV,

1023
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:36,660
and ended the film
on the 1st of May...

1024
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:43,033
Other people

1025
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,063
take TVs home,
hoping to repair them.

1026
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:51,703
I found 2 small chairs on the street
and took them home.

1027
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:59,451
One night when the bulky refuse
is thrown out,

1028
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:03,952
I drove around with Francois
who had done one of my film scores

1029
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,952
and who also sang.

1030
01:09:16,056 --> 01:09:19,060
He has dressed
in white for 25 years.

1031
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:23,609
Francois is curious,
he likes rummaging,

1032
01:09:23,764 --> 01:09:26,404
but he didn't find anything
that night.

1033
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,116
He looked at an empty clock

1034
01:09:31,272 --> 01:09:32,945
and he turned it down.

1035
01:09:34,141 --> 01:09:36,712
I picked it up and took it home.

1036
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:44,754
A clock without hands
is my kind of thing.

1037
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,329
You don't see time passing.

1038
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:18,585
I like filming rot,
leftovers, waste,

1039
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:21,260
mold and trash.

1040
01:10:25,126 --> 01:10:27,163
But I never forget

1041
01:10:27,328 --> 01:10:31,572
those who shop in the leftovers
and trash when the market is over.

1042
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,221
It's past 2 o'clock.

1043
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:47,218
I've done my shopping
and I linger on

1044
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:49,592
until the market is over.

1045
01:10:51,519 --> 01:10:55,433
I notice a man with a large bag
eating on the spot.

1046
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:04,372
I would see him now and then,
always with his bag,

1047
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:06,541
always eating.

1048
01:11:12,806 --> 01:11:14,513
The day he was eating parsley

1049
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:16,619
I went over to him.

1050
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:19,154
Do you often eat parsley?

1051
01:11:19,313 --> 01:11:22,556
Sometimes yes. Parsley's
full of vitamin C and E,

1052
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:26,425
beta carotene, zinc,
magnesium, it's excellent.

1053
01:11:28,322 --> 01:11:30,427
His answer amazed me.

1054
01:11:31,525 --> 01:11:34,369
Over the following weeks,
I filmed him

1055
01:11:34,628 --> 01:11:38,770
repeatedly, with or without sound,
and he talked in snatches.

1056
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,610
I pick up food at the markets

1057
01:11:43,537 --> 01:11:46,279
and I save money that way.

1058
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:50,150
I'm mostly a vegetarian,

1059
01:11:50,311 --> 01:11:52,655
sol find what I need.

1060
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:56,818
I don't make much,

1061
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,755
but I still have to eat.

1062
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:05,570
You should see what
they get rid of...

1063
01:12:08,629 --> 01:12:11,576
From the markets, I get fruit,

1064
01:12:11,732 --> 01:12:13,211
vegetables mostly,

1065
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,207
sometimes cheese too,
but that's rare.

1066
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:25,146
I eat a lot of apples.

1067
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:29,055
And here I can get
as many apples as I want.

1068
01:12:30,317 --> 01:12:33,594
- How many apples a day do you eat?
- 6 or 7.

1069
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:36,397
Is it your staple diet?

1070
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:39,067
I also eat bread.

1071
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:45,476
I get up at 4, I take the train

1072
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:50,148
and I arrive in Paris at 5:45.

1073
01:12:51,405 --> 01:12:53,407
Between 6 and 7,

1074
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:57,283
they throw away all of the bread
from the day before.

1075
01:12:57,645 --> 01:13:00,319
If you spot
a trash can near a bakery

1076
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,462
it's likely
to contain sandwiches, bread,

1077
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:05,062
and all that.

1078
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:13,495
I eat a lot of bread. It's a staple
food full of proteins and glucids.

1079
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:15,766
It's strange to be concerned...

1080
01:13:16,096 --> 01:13:18,076
- About balanced diets?
- Yes.

1081
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:20,637
Since I studied biology,

1082
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:25,181
it's quite normal
I should be concerned.

1083
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:30,047
I used to be a teaching assistant.

1084
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:33,192
When people find out
I have a Master's degree,

1085
01:13:33,347 --> 01:13:37,591
they don't understand why
I sell papers to make money.

1086
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:41,529
I sell street papers or magazines.

1087
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:47,129
Most times in front
of the train station.

1088
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:18,402
I live in a shelter where 50%

1089
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:21,000
of the people are illiterate.

1090
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:26,044
Immigrants from Mali
and Senegal mostly.

1091
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:30,980
I arrived in that shelter
8 years ago,

1092
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:35,050
and I've been teaching them
to read and write for 6 years.

1093
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:40,049
I am not part of the school system,
I don't get paid for it.

1094
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:46,991
I teach every evening
from 6:30 <i>/</i> 7:00

1095
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:49,394
until 8:30 <i>/</i> 9:00.

1096
01:14:54,361 --> 01:14:57,274
He arranged
and decorated the classroom himself

1097
01:14:57,832 --> 01:15:01,939
for the students who may attend
whenever they please.

1098
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:17,320
Ac, ec, ic, oc...

1099
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:19,153
And see, for example,

1100
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:23,191
a nocturnal activity.

1101
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:28,429
Right, a nocturnal activity.

1102
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:30,302
What does "nocturnal" mean?

1103
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:36,076
Success? Success is...

1104
01:15:36,237 --> 01:15:38,717
Isn't success like a behavior?

1105
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:41,710
It's to succeed in life.

1106
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:44,117
Somebody who has succeeded.

1107
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:47,087
- Like Céline Dion has?
- Right.

1108
01:15:47,481 --> 01:15:48,653
Famous?

1109
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:51,160
But it's more like the will to...

1110
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,422
Succeed.

1111
01:15:52,586 --> 01:15:55,328
Yes, when you've succeeded,
that's success.

1112
01:15:58,426 --> 01:16:01,032
<i>A use-M... "m-sect.</i>

1113
01:16:01,962 --> 01:16:02,633
What's that?

1114
01:16:03,097 --> 01:16:04,440
A cockroach.

1115
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:08,005
I don't know if it is useful but...

1116
01:16:08,636 --> 01:16:10,582
but it is an insect.

1117
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,754
Meeting that man

1118
01:16:18,112 --> 01:16:21,616
is what impressed me the most.

1119
01:16:22,449 --> 01:16:26,022
And the time it took
to find out about his nocturnal

1120
01:16:27,088 --> 01:16:29,728
and voluntary activity
in a suburban basement.

1121
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:40,773
The other high point
is quite different in kind.

1122
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:44,045
I talked the Museum of Villefranche

1123
01:16:44,204 --> 01:16:46,206
into bringing out from its reserves

1124
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,042
a painting by Hédouin

1125
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:51,622
which I had seen
reproduced in black and white.

1126
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:55,617
Brigitte, the curator,
and her assistant, Julie

1127
01:16:55,783 --> 01:16:58,059
had to disturb
several sleepy paintings

1128
01:16:58,252 --> 01:17:01,028
before finding the one
I wanted to reveal:

1129
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:03,695
Gleaners Fleeing Before the Storm.

1130
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,147
To see them in broad daylight,

1131
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:21,479
with stormy gusts
lashing against the canvas,

1132
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:24,054
was true delight.

1133
01:18:37,985 --> 01:18:42,297
THE GLEANERS AND I
in under 3 minutes

1134
01:21:29,824 --> 01:21:32,236
Right now... the BONUS

1135
01:21:36,731 --> 01:21:38,210
TWO YEARS LATER

1136
01:21:38,365 --> 01:21:41,312
THE GLEANERS AND I
TWO YEARS ON

1137
01:21:44,705 --> 01:21:46,013
With the gleaners
of yesterday and today

1138
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:47,618
I thank them

1139
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:54,585
These thumbnails are from
The Gleaners and I

1140
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:56,819
which came out in 2000.

1141
01:21:57,218 --> 01:22:01,598
You can see the repeated gesture
of bending down to pick things up.

1142
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,692
Gleaming urban waste,

1143
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:08,671
gleaning the earth's fruit,
food abandoned on the ground.

1144
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,842
Strangely, I was given
some earth in Mainz

1145
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:13,979
from several European countries.

1146
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:17,672
The Heimat Prize
- "Heimat" meaning "homeland" -

1147
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,818
is the most appropriate trophy

1148
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:21,816
that this film has picked up:

1149
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:24,922
the medals, diplomas,
pyramids, columns, etc.

1150
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:28,953
And the prizes given to me
in my old age.

1151
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,959
Here they are.
Shows over.

1152
01:22:31,685 --> 01:22:33,665
Now let's move on.

1153
01:22:33,854 --> 01:22:35,925
Other rewards: letters and gifts

1154
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:42,039
None of my films
elicited so many letters.

1155
01:22:42,196 --> 01:22:44,904
Often containing original items,

1156
01:22:45,066 --> 01:22:46,773
embroidered cards,

1157
01:22:47,234 --> 01:22:49,339
unusually-sized envelopes,

1158
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:52,343
tiny wallets,
fragile little notes,

1159
01:22:52,873 --> 01:22:56,286
feathers, images, photos,
beautiful pictures...

1160
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:59,088
Sometimes I replied,
not always.

1161
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,726
Colors, collages...

1162
01:23:01,882 --> 01:23:04,829
If I didn't reply, I apologize
and say thank you.

1163
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,128
Who wrote to me from a train'?

1164
01:23:10,624 --> 01:23:13,230
And put a stamp
on his travel wallet?

1165
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,335
And sent
his cinema ticket

1166
01:23:15,696 --> 01:23:18,108
and spoke for both of them'?
Who are they?

1167
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:21,613
Curious to meet them,
I also took a train ticket

1168
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:23,612
and my new backpack.

1169
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:25,982
As I went along the Loire,

1170
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,017
I look at Mauves Bridge.

1171
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:31,213
"Jacquot" made an animation film
on it when he was 'l 'l.

1172
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:34,386
You can recognize the crosspieces

1173
01:23:34,715 --> 01:23:37,628
and the bombing
drawn frame by frame.

1174
01:23:42,323 --> 01:23:44,200
The airplanes go away...

1175
01:23:45,893 --> 01:23:47,634
And I arrive in Trentemoult.

1176
01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:51,370
My passport!

1177
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:54,202
That day I had a sore throat.

1178
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:58,974
We've never met but...

1179
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:01,015
I feel I know you.

1180
01:24:01,175 --> 01:24:03,746
This letter brought us together!

1181
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:06,685
They take me home,

1182
01:24:06,847 --> 01:24:09,726
an old butcher's shop,
now their workshop

1183
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:11,988
and the neighborhood workshop

1184
01:24:12,686 --> 01:24:14,188
which salvages materials.

1185
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,771
When we first arrived,
we salvaged

1186
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:21,672
a lot of things
from the markets.

1187
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:23,740
Food... and these crates.

1188
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:28,336
We find them useful
for making all kinds of things.

1189
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:32,874
We transform everyday life,
we make it our own.

1190
01:24:33,707 --> 01:24:35,186
It takes different forms.

1191
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:39,154
It may become a book
or an installation.

1192
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:40,791
Objects, too.

1193
01:24:41,282 --> 01:24:43,922
- Practical, everyday objects?
- That, too.

1194
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:47,298
They show me a collective book,

1195
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:50,060
made of leftovers,
offcuts of drawings,

1196
01:24:50,224 --> 01:24:52,295
pieces of paper and paintings.

1197
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:54,063
Everyone did their bit.

1198
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,968
They also show me
a photo album.

1199
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:01,105
Oh, look!

1200
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:02,940
We have this
in common, too.

1201
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:05,105
This potato warms my heart!

1202
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:08,719
As does their letter
which he rereads to me.

1203
01:25:09,176 --> 01:25:12,714
I may be a boy
who "doesn't cry", they say.

1204
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,020
Tears came to my eyes
for the second time that day.

1205
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,286
I'm writing for both of us.

1206
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:23,058
What effect does a film have'?

1207
01:25:23,257 --> 01:25:25,897
What reaches the filmgoer'?

1208
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:27,834
That's my question.

1209
01:25:29,096 --> 01:25:31,007
What came through to you'?

1210
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,771
I think that seeing this film
was like a rebirth.

1211
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,415
After what had happened...

1212
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:41,880
We had come
for the death of a friend.

1213
01:25:42,042 --> 01:25:45,080
Then, this film just completely

1214
01:25:45,246 --> 01:25:49,717
put us back in touch
with ourselves... with life.

1215
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:53,495
Yet it talks a lot
about leftovers...

1216
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:55,798
things that are abandoned.

1217
01:25:55,956 --> 01:25:59,802
Yes, but...
it's made by someone who's alive.

1218
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,501
The filmmaker is very much alive.

1219
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:04,776
So far, so good!

1220
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:11,246
So many people are poor,
in precarious situations.

1221
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:15,046
- But they...
- ...get by, they adapt.

1222
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,491
That's what life's about -
learning to adapt.

1223
01:26:23,017 --> 01:26:25,759
I'll remember
this lunch in the sunshine,

1224
01:26:25,919 --> 01:26:28,832
with sunflower seeds
in the salad.

1225
01:26:31,225 --> 01:26:33,796
I'll remember
their lovely, smiling faces.

1226
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:37,233
Philippe carefully reading
his own letter,

1227
01:26:37,798 --> 01:26:41,041
Delphine's hair
held up by a pencil,

1228
01:26:41,235 --> 01:26:43,340
her hands upturned
in offering,

1229
01:26:44,338 --> 01:26:47,285
and the gust of wind
when I was about to leave...

1230
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,189
shaking the pink flowers
of their fruit tree

1231
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:54,383
while they finished their drinks.

1232
01:26:56,483 --> 01:26:58,929
The letters on the wall
reminded us

1233
01:26:59,086 --> 01:27:01,965
we were near Nantes,
home of LU cookies.

1234
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:05,295
Other letters awaited me
when I arrived home.

1235
01:27:07,595 --> 01:27:09,802
The letter writers
liked the film.

1236
01:27:09,964 --> 01:27:12,945
Some tell me about their lives,
about gleaming...

1237
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,338
They enjoyed meeting
the gleaners in the film,

1238
01:27:16,503 --> 01:27:19,814
especially Alain F
who impressed them.

1239
01:27:20,074 --> 01:27:21,610
They use the same words:

1240
01:27:21,942 --> 01:27:23,944
"vegetarian", "black faces",

1241
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:27,185
"volunteer", "vegetarian",

1242
01:27:27,948 --> 01:27:29,985
"biologist",
"teaching illiterates"...

1243
01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:31,629
ALAIN F, market gleaner,

1244
01:27:31,952 --> 01:27:33,590
newspaper seller and teacher

1245
01:27:34,488 --> 01:27:37,196
I've often met Alain
over the past 2 years.

1246
01:27:37,358 --> 01:27:40,032
Saturdays, I come
at the end of the market.

1247
01:27:40,194 --> 01:27:43,471
We have a coffee when he's finished
filling his big bag.

1248
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,870
His blue bag was stolen,

1249
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:47,010
so now it's a red bag.

1250
01:27:47,368 --> 01:27:50,474
My personal situation
hasn't changed.

1251
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,482
I'm still a volunteer,
gleaner and paper seller.

1252
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:55,314
No change there!

1253
01:27:55,476 --> 01:27:59,652
Financially speaking, yes,
some people stop and buy my paper.

1254
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:03,257
People who never stopped before

1255
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:05,419
do now
after seeing the film.

1256
01:28:06,053 --> 01:28:07,964
They talk to me more.

1257
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:11,066
Theater managers
asked him to come along

1258
01:28:11,258 --> 01:28:12,430
to the debates.

1259
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:14,163
We said, "OK, hire him".

1260
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:18,138
After the film,
I was contacted...

1261
01:28:18,632 --> 01:28:19,940
5 times.

1262
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:21,940
He was paid to talk.

1263
01:28:22,102 --> 01:28:24,912
His pet subject:
famine, world hunger.

1264
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,620
He knows his subject
and can quote statistics.

1265
01:28:29,543 --> 01:28:30,544
And the film?

1266
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:32,548
What do I think about it'?

1267
01:28:32,713 --> 01:28:36,354
Personally, I think
that the film is...

1268
01:28:37,318 --> 01:28:38,626
well-done...

1269
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:41,024
It has reached a lot of people.

1270
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:43,526
What are you less fond of'?

1271
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:46,295
Your presence, mainly!

1272
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:49,202
I think your self-portrait
is not well-done.

1273
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:51,274
At least that's what I think...

1274
01:28:51,432 --> 01:28:53,139
Not well-done or unnecessary?

1275
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,337
I think it's unnecessary.

1276
01:28:55,936 --> 01:28:58,940
It didn't bother people
too much, though.

1277
01:28:59,106 --> 01:29:01,347
I haven't heard
any remarks about it.

1278
01:29:02,443 --> 01:29:04,650
I glean, too.
I glean images

1279
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:06,150
for my film.

1280
01:29:06,313 --> 01:29:09,988
No, that's not it.
It's when you film yourself.

1281
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:13,097
You're not picking things up -
you're just there.

1282
01:29:13,254 --> 01:29:16,428
When you show
your hair, your liver spots...

1283
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:19,230
You're showing your old age...

1284
01:29:19,393 --> 01:29:22,966
If people find it interesting,
good for them, but I don't.

1285
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,610
I didn't like that,
but that's my opinion.

1286
01:29:29,303 --> 01:29:32,944
She's not that present.
She's always behind her camera.

1287
01:29:33,107 --> 01:29:34,484
I think so, too, but...

1288
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:36,747
it's good to hear other opinions.

1289
01:29:37,077 --> 01:29:40,354
Well, I saw the film
several times, but...

1290
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:43,358
- It was on TV recently...
- Yes, on Arte.

1291
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:47,761
Someone recorded it for me,
and I enjoyed watching it again.

1292
01:29:48,089 --> 01:29:50,535
- Still teaching people to read?
- Oh, yes.

1293
01:29:55,796 --> 01:29:58,402
He's a plucky lad. Amazing.

1294
01:29:58,566 --> 01:30:02,378
What he does is so great...

1295
01:30:03,003 --> 01:30:04,573
Don't exaggerate...

1296
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:07,242
I'm not exaggerating.

1297
01:30:08,342 --> 01:30:12,347
It makes you want to be
a better person...

1298
01:30:14,715 --> 01:30:17,161
to pay more attention
to other people.

1299
01:30:17,384 --> 01:30:20,024
"Makes a change"
as TEIErama wrote.

1300
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:21,461
Text and photos

1301
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,794
of Alain teaching students by night

1302
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:26,332
and gleaming his food by day.

1303
01:30:26,494 --> 01:30:29,270
He's exemplary.
He's much talked about.

1304
01:30:29,663 --> 01:30:32,542
He's a star
ever since I saw him on TV.

1305
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:36,411
After that TV report,
I had the opportunity

1306
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:40,517
to go up and speak to him.
I wouldn't have dared to, otherwise.

1307
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:43,415
He's clearly pleased by this.

1308
01:30:43,844 --> 01:30:46,415
Have the two of you become pals'?

1309
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:48,526
When we run into each other...

1310
01:30:48,682 --> 01:30:50,184
Let me buy you coffee.

1311
01:30:50,351 --> 01:30:51,694
We're acquaintances.

1312
01:30:52,052 --> 01:30:54,589
It was a surprise to see

1313
01:30:54,755 --> 01:30:57,031
that he was a volunteer

1314
01:30:57,758 --> 01:31:01,433
although he's in a difficult
financial situation.

1315
01:31:01,629 --> 01:31:03,768
- Decaf?
- For me.

1316
01:31:08,502 --> 01:31:12,245
They talked about consumerism,
ecology, gleaming.

1317
01:31:12,406 --> 01:31:13,817
She asked questions:

1318
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:16,178
Did he find all his food'?

1319
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:19,351
Didn't he buy anything?
Yes, the coffee.

1320
01:31:20,214 --> 01:31:23,559
And eating raw, cold fruit
and vegetables and bread -

1321
01:31:23,717 --> 01:31:25,321
is that a healthy diet'?

1322
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:29,534
Yes, indeed. In fact, next month,
I'm running the marathon.

1323
01:31:30,491 --> 01:31:33,404
Forte de Versailles,
the day before the race.

1324
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:35,606
Here's where it starts.

1325
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:39,434
City Hall offers the runners
a plate of pasta.

1326
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:07,770
Alain eats theses slow sugars...
slowly.

1327
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:09,737
He's taking it seriously.

1328
01:32:10,564 --> 01:32:12,168
I'll go home slowly,

1329
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,643
drink some horsetail tea,

1330
01:32:14,802 --> 01:32:17,646
a yogurt, and there you are.

1331
01:32:20,674 --> 01:32:22,312
I drink the horsetail

1332
01:32:22,509 --> 01:32:26,616
so that my knees don't hurt
during the marathon,

1333
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:31,193
to make my joints solid.

1334
01:32:31,685 --> 01:32:34,325
7:30 next day,
he's on the Champs Elyslées.

1335
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:37,792
It's cold.
He walked from Montparnasse.

1336
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,494
He's warming up.

1337
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:41,469
Do you train beforehand?

1338
01:32:41,629 --> 01:32:43,302
No, but I walk.

1339
01:32:43,631 --> 01:32:47,511
Sometimes I walk
from La Verriere to Paris.

1340
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:49,147
It's 2O miles.

1341
01:32:49,503 --> 01:32:51,676
It's still cold.
The others are dressed

1342
01:32:51,839 --> 01:32:55,719
in pullovers, space blankets,
garbage bags, fine sweaters.

1343
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,857
He's the only one
in a "Street" jersey,

1344
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,251
an anti-exclusion newspaper.

1345
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:03,562
And his special running shoes?

1346
01:33:03,717 --> 01:33:06,630
Reeboks I gleaned in a trash can!

1347
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:09,929
Where?

1348
01:33:10,658 --> 01:33:11,796
Montparnasse.

1349
01:33:12,493 --> 01:33:14,370
A decent pair of Reeboks.

1350
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:17,509
- Your size?
- Yes.

1351
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:20,969
One last orange,
then he's off

1352
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:22,743
on his 10th marathon.

1353
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:27,612
They all throw away
their pullovers and sweaters.

1354
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:37,592
I never thought
I'd find gleaning here.

1355
01:33:38,586 --> 01:33:40,566
Walking through the garbage bags,

1356
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:42,960
they pick up
the discarded pullovers.

1357
01:33:43,324 --> 01:33:44,997
They are very picky

1358
01:33:45,326 --> 01:33:46,896
as they fill their bags.

1359
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:01,385
Then, along come
the garbage trucks.

1360
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:03,852
The runners are already far away.

1361
01:34:04,345 --> 01:34:07,519
29,000 at the start.
Based on their average,

1362
01:34:07,715 --> 01:34:10,628
we more or less know
when they'll come by.

1363
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:13,558
I wait in the park.
Alain shouldn't be long.

1364
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,394
I scrutinize the crowd.

1365
01:34:18,392 --> 01:34:20,929
Jean-Noil manages
to film Alain from the side.

1366
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:24,909
I get distracted
and nearly miss him.

1367
01:34:27,468 --> 01:34:30,506
I'm not much use
as a sports reporter!

1368
01:34:31,405 --> 01:34:33,009
Further on, a supplies post.

1369
01:34:33,974 --> 01:34:36,250
Isabelle films Alain.

1370
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:39,847
Meanwhile, I hurry off in the car

1371
01:34:40,314 --> 01:34:43,318
to Solflérino Bridge,
then I approach the runners.

1372
01:34:43,484 --> 01:34:45,521
I hope in vain to see Alain.

1373
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:47,793
I go to the finishing line,

1374
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:50,663
the scene of enthusiasm
and exhaustion.

1375
01:34:51,092 --> 01:34:53,936
Will Alain salute, yell,
embrace someone? No.

1376
01:34:54,462 --> 01:34:56,533
He's arrived, he's here...

1377
01:34:57,064 --> 01:34:59,806
just as calm and serious
as at the start.

1378
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:02,478
He has the microchip removed

1379
01:35:02,636 --> 01:35:04,741
that was inserted at the start

1380
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:07,010
to record his exact time.

1381
01:35:09,777 --> 01:35:12,383
Alain ran the 26 or so miles

1382
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:13,820
in 3 hours 37 minutes.

1383
01:35:13,981 --> 01:35:17,394
He then walked for 4 hours
to loosen up his muscles.

1384
01:35:17,885 --> 01:35:19,387
What a guy!

1385
01:35:21,956 --> 01:35:23,958
I walk slowly, but often,

1386
01:35:24,124 --> 01:35:26,536
sometimes with the camera
pointing down

1387
01:35:26,694 --> 01:35:30,403
to record the voices of people
who don't want to be filmed.

1388
01:35:32,533 --> 01:35:33,511
In town

1389
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:35,312
or in the country.

1390
01:35:38,606 --> 01:35:41,109
I return to the potato growers
of Beauce,

1391
01:35:41,475 --> 01:35:42,977
the region of a thousand towns
("villes").

1392
01:35:57,525 --> 01:36:00,404
Potato growers

1393
01:36:01,829 --> 01:36:04,435
We came to film you
2 years ago.

1394
01:36:05,866 --> 01:36:08,073
Do we look older'? Younger?

1395
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:10,541
You don't look bad.
You've kept well!

1396
01:36:10,738 --> 01:36:13,014
Everyone says
those farmers are handsome.

1397
01:36:13,173 --> 01:36:14,447
They said that?

1398
01:36:14,642 --> 01:36:17,714
No one ever phoned up
to ask to marry us!

1399
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:20,390
Did you see the film?

1400
01:36:20,581 --> 01:36:25,030
Actually, I arrived 10 minutes
after the start of the film.

1401
01:36:25,186 --> 01:36:28,633
Unluckily for us,
the bit we're in

1402
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:30,860
is at the start.

1403
01:36:31,392 --> 01:36:33,372
So, I had to stay in the theater

1404
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:35,564
and watch the second showing.

1405
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:37,368
Shows I was determined!

1406
01:36:38,132 --> 01:36:41,170
Lots of people from around here
phoned up to say

1407
01:36:41,502 --> 01:36:43,539
they'd seen us on TV.

1408
01:36:43,737 --> 01:36:46,809
We're not necessarily
on the right side.

1409
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:48,585
The bosses' side...

1410
01:36:48,743 --> 01:36:51,189
Right, we're on
the bosses' side but...

1411
01:36:51,512 --> 01:36:54,254
it takes all sorts
to make a world.

1412
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:58,891
They were going
to dump potatoes.

1413
01:36:59,053 --> 01:37:00,623
Nicolas took me with him.

1414
01:37:01,522 --> 01:37:02,557
On the way,

1415
01:37:02,756 --> 01:37:06,670
he told me about his life,
his family... his children, mostly.

1416
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:08,804
Over the engine noise,

1417
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:12,043
his confidence
and his confidences moved me.

1418
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:14,773
He empties the truck.

1419
01:37:15,102 --> 01:37:17,912
I hoped I'd find
more heart-shaped potatoes.

1420
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:19,778
It's now the film's symbol.

1421
01:37:20,107 --> 01:37:21,643
Perhaps my emblem.

1422
01:37:21,809 --> 01:37:24,790
I film, I look...
Ah, here's one!

1423
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:28,990
Phew, found one!

1424
01:37:36,123 --> 01:37:39,434
One day, I receive
an original drawing from Cardon.

1425
01:37:39,794 --> 01:37:42,536
A winged horse...
and perhaps me.

1426
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:45,506
I reply at once
on my dictionary paper:

1427
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:48,943
"Thank you, dear Cardon."
Then, he sends another gift.

1428
01:37:49,103 --> 01:37:50,673
A whole book.

1429
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:53,150
I think to myself:

1430
01:37:53,674 --> 01:37:57,178
"Thanks to my film
which Cardon discovered,

1431
01:37:57,511 --> 01:37:59,752
I discovered Cardon's world."

1432
01:38:06,487 --> 01:38:07,795
Solitary people,

1433
01:38:07,955 --> 01:38:10,128
people who have trouble
understanding...

1434
01:38:10,658 --> 01:38:12,160
A screaming man.

1435
01:38:14,929 --> 01:38:17,466
Soon after, I see
Edward Munch's Scream

1436
01:38:17,665 --> 01:38:20,236
in Oslo where I went
to present the film.

1437
01:38:20,568 --> 01:38:23,777
The Scream
along with other paintings by him.

1438
01:38:25,706 --> 01:38:28,186
I tend to agree
to show my film

1439
01:38:28,509 --> 01:38:29,510
in towns with museums

1440
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:31,587
to discover or rediscover.

1441
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:33,247
The title of my film

1442
01:38:33,747 --> 01:38:35,886
in French, "The Gleaners

1443
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:38,563
and the Gleaneress"
became "and I".

1444
01:38:39,186 --> 01:38:42,963
In Portugal, I'm a "Respigadora".
Ola!

1445
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:48,199
In Japan, it's
"O Chi Bo Hi Lo Hi"... I think!

1446
01:38:48,562 --> 01:38:49,734
More or less.

1447
01:38:49,897 --> 01:38:51,433
"Gleaming fallen wheat".

1448
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:55,410
The subtitle is
"Agnes travels with her camera".

1449
01:38:57,605 --> 01:39:00,552
Talking of traveling,
it's always the same:

1450
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:01,914
windows of sky,

1451
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:04,179
stewed tea,

1452
01:39:04,345 --> 01:39:06,291
and numb feet.

1453
01:39:07,548 --> 01:39:09,118
Back home.

1454
01:39:09,283 --> 01:39:12,287
Zgougou drinks milk,
and me mild tea.

1455
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:15,300
A gift:
jam made from gleaned grapes.

1456
01:39:15,923 --> 01:39:19,029
A gift:
my initials made of chocolate.

1457
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,540
Another gift from Japan

1458
01:39:21,695 --> 01:39:23,800
for Children's Day:

1459
01:39:23,964 --> 01:39:25,910
tiny candies.

1460
01:39:31,672 --> 01:39:33,652
Sophie from the 101 Nights crew

1461
01:39:33,808 --> 01:39:36,186
sends a book
made by her brother Guillaume.

1462
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:38,289
It's a "thing for writing in".

1463
01:39:38,613 --> 01:39:40,991
I never will - it's too good.

1464
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:45,021
I can't get used to
all the gifts from the audience.

1465
01:39:45,185 --> 01:39:46,823
I'm filled with wonder.

1466
01:39:48,923 --> 01:39:51,699
I receive books and projects
on the subject

1467
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:54,237
of leftovers.
And beautiful leftovers.

1468
01:39:56,597 --> 01:39:58,907
Gleaner of inconsolable things

1469
01:40:01,302 --> 01:40:03,873
I'll get everything out.
A doily...

1470
01:40:04,038 --> 01:40:07,076
I think this is magnificent,
it's like a signal.

1471
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:10,188
These little things...

1472
01:40:15,082 --> 01:40:16,891
By the huge
Palais de Chaillot,

1473
01:40:17,051 --> 01:40:19,964
Macha gets out
her tiny, shabby objects.

1474
01:40:20,388 --> 01:40:22,800
It's as if gleaming
is my mission.

1475
01:40:23,891 --> 01:40:25,063
I pick things up

1476
01:40:26,126 --> 01:40:27,833
to tell our story.

1477
01:40:27,995 --> 01:40:30,839
I think that objects
contain a part of us.

1478
01:40:31,298 --> 01:40:33,335
- Tell our story or...'?
- Contain us.

1479
01:40:33,701 --> 01:40:36,341
- Are you in this yellow doily'?
- Yes.

1480
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:38,378
It's fragile...

1481
01:40:40,174 --> 01:40:43,155
I'm not a collector, I don't...

1482
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:46,257
look at an object for itself but...

1483
01:40:46,981 --> 01:40:50,087
There's a huge transfer
of things that are lost...

1484
01:40:50,284 --> 01:40:51,922
lost, picked up...

1485
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:55,657
There's this trade in all things...

1486
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:58,730
Connections, things which circulate.

1487
01:40:59,193 --> 01:41:02,140
They leave wonderful traces of...

1488
01:41:02,997 --> 01:41:07,707
I imagine... the relationship
people had with these objects.

1489
01:41:08,669 --> 01:41:12,674
It's a rather indirect, modest way

1490
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,342
of meeting these people.

1491
01:41:14,675 --> 01:41:17,178
It's as if they gave me a sign.

1492
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:20,983
Are they the couple
off a wedding cake'?

1493
01:41:21,148 --> 01:41:22,650
They were still wrapped.

1494
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:24,660
They weren't used

1495
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:27,060
or chosen.
That interested me.

1496
01:41:27,221 --> 01:41:29,326
An inert object tells of life

1497
01:41:29,756 --> 01:41:31,394
and celebrates it.

1498
01:41:31,726 --> 01:41:34,434
That's what ah exhibition is:
a celebration.

1499
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:37,937
There's something painful
in all of this.

1500
01:41:38,099 --> 01:41:41,273
The order seeks
to ease that pain.

1501
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:42,470
At the same time,

1502
01:41:42,837 --> 01:41:45,443
there's an attempt at humor.

1503
01:41:48,843 --> 01:41:50,982
Dried, abandoned,
artificial flowers.

1504
01:41:52,046 --> 01:41:54,856
I just put them there like that,

1505
01:41:55,049 --> 01:41:57,393
as if they just landed
on a table.

1506
01:41:58,118 --> 01:41:58,960
The table,

1507
01:41:59,487 --> 01:42:02,297
the bed:
the key furniture in the house.

1508
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:04,699
This is the bed.

1509
01:42:04,858 --> 01:42:07,498
It is the scene
of both desire and disaster.

1510
01:42:07,828 --> 01:42:09,398
It is both a bed...

1511
01:42:10,397 --> 01:42:13,901
a nuptial bed,
a tomb, a dream...

1512
01:42:14,101 --> 01:42:17,412
the remains
of an unforgettable day.

1513
01:42:23,377 --> 01:42:25,357
A sentimental gleaner, no doubt.

1514
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:27,322
A gleaner of yore, perhaps.

1515
01:42:51,805 --> 01:42:53,113
Handwritten letters,

1516
01:42:53,574 --> 01:42:55,315
some collectively written,

1517
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:57,286
all friendly.

1518
01:42:57,978 --> 01:42:59,457
A few neatly typed ones.

1519
01:43:00,881 --> 01:43:02,758
One with an anagram

1520
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:06,022
and a button stuck on it
and a giant button photo.

1521
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:09,467
Michel does button theme parties.

1522
01:43:10,057 --> 01:43:11,536
I call him Mr Buttons

1523
01:43:11,892 --> 01:43:14,133
and off I go to see him.

1524
01:43:14,295 --> 01:43:16,297
Will we come unstitched'?

1525
01:43:16,898 --> 01:43:20,778
I identified with every twist
and turn of your film.

1526
01:43:20,968 --> 01:43:23,312
I pick up watch parts.
That's lost time.

1527
01:43:23,504 --> 01:43:26,110
Your clock with no hands
is perfect.

1528
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,081
I collect little things
which are scattered here and there

1529
01:43:30,244 --> 01:43:31,985
and which are no use.

1530
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:36,327
4 or 5 years ago,
I just became interested in buttons.

1531
01:43:36,484 --> 01:43:39,988
I started with the idea
of a flock of buttons.

1532
01:43:40,154 --> 01:43:41,599
In terms of the form...

1533
01:43:41,922 --> 01:43:44,232
A flock of mutton
or buttons?

1534
01:43:44,391 --> 01:43:48,567
A flock of buttons because of
the slight shift in meaning.

1535
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:52,441
I thought, there's nothing
more dumb than a button!

1536
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:55,046
It's round
with 2 round holes.

1537
01:43:55,202 --> 01:43:58,342
In terms of the form,
it's interesting to explore.

1538
01:43:58,505 --> 01:44:00,178
A mine of possibilities.

1539
01:44:00,341 --> 01:44:04,118
Then I started to sew on
a white button with white thread

1540
01:44:04,278 --> 01:44:06,952
in tribute to Malevich's
White Square.

1541
01:44:07,114 --> 01:44:11,460
Then, a black button and thread.
And one thing just led to another.

1542
01:44:12,486 --> 01:44:16,525
As a child, I would play
with my mom's button box.

1543
01:44:16,891 --> 01:44:19,269
So, I sensed
there was something in it

1544
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,164
linked to the mother.

1545
01:44:21,528 --> 01:44:23,371
Patrimony with an "M"!

1546
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,907
I have my mother's button box.

1547
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:28,370
My daughter does costumes,

1548
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:30,412
so she collects buttons.

1549
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:34,886
In the end, I realized it had to do
with the emotions,

1550
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:37,545
that it conveyed memories.

1551
01:44:39,246 --> 01:44:41,988
Today I picked up eleven.

1552
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:43,893
Where?

1553
01:44:44,051 --> 01:44:46,258
This one,
Rue de la Pierre PIantee.

1554
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,195
- On the ground?
- Yes.

1555
01:44:48,355 --> 01:44:49,959
You're a button gleaner?

1556
01:44:50,124 --> 01:44:53,503
It shows my journey.
I found the first in Buenos Aires,

1557
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:57,871
the second in Phom Penh,
the third here in Villefranche.

1558
01:44:58,032 --> 01:45:01,036
Maybe this was a portent
of our meeting:

1559
01:45:01,201 --> 01:45:04,045
I lost a button
half an hour ago. Here.

1560
01:45:04,605 --> 01:45:06,585
Maybe I can pick up
one off you.

1561
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:10,352
What you need is a little pink one
with two holes.

1562
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:11,884
Yes, that one.

1563
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:15,349
Someone who lost a button
misses it.

1564
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:19,897
So, you're always in touch
with the person who lost it.

1565
01:45:21,589 --> 01:45:24,627
I'd lost touch
with the people from the caravans.

1566
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,663
The people from the caravans
Claude M.

1567
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:29,406
Claude had left the travelers' camp
where I had filmed him.

1568
01:45:29,563 --> 01:45:33,909
I heard from various people
that he was in central France.

1569
01:45:34,268 --> 01:45:36,009
I went back on the road.

1570
01:45:36,603 --> 01:45:38,105
I found him.

1571
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:44,282
Things weren't working out
too great at Etampes, you know.

1572
01:45:44,478 --> 01:45:46,219
Living in a caravan...

1573
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:47,324
Well, a friend

1574
01:45:47,515 --> 01:45:49,552
said he'd help me out:

1575
01:45:50,117 --> 01:45:52,461
"You can come here, no problem."

1576
01:45:54,455 --> 01:45:56,298
Let me tell you something.

1577
01:45:58,358 --> 01:46:01,931
For now he lives here
for now...

1578
01:46:02,496 --> 01:46:05,136
I took him in.

1579
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:06,573
That's good of you.

1580
01:46:06,734 --> 01:46:08,543
For a few months, then...

1581
01:46:10,437 --> 01:46:12,383
Little George came to the camp

1582
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:14,450
and asked if I'd help his mom.

1583
01:46:14,641 --> 01:46:18,145
If it's for his mom,
there's no problem.

1584
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:22,126
I fix up the house,
do this and that... the gardening.

1585
01:46:22,282 --> 01:46:25,195
The leaves need picking up,
so I do it.

1586
01:46:25,352 --> 01:46:29,232
I look after...
I look after the whole place.

1587
01:46:30,191 --> 01:46:32,728
In exchange,
he gets board and lodging.

1588
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:35,040
Well, a meal a day.

1589
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:37,338
Your family?

1590
01:46:37,565 --> 01:46:38,976
Your children?

1591
01:46:39,433 --> 01:46:40,741
Not much news.

1592
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:45,345
I don't even have any news
of my mom. That's partly my fault.

1593
01:46:45,506 --> 01:46:49,420
For a while I really let myself...

1594
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:52,751
I did it myself.
I let myself go.

1595
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:58,989
Now I want to fight back.

1596
01:46:59,754 --> 01:47:02,564
He seemed sincere
and he hadn't drunk anything,

1597
01:47:02,723 --> 01:47:06,227
but in the car,
he stank of wine.

1598
01:47:06,727 --> 01:47:09,264
I might have the odd glass,

1599
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:13,606
but compared to before,
when it was 2 or 3 bottles...

1600
01:47:13,768 --> 01:47:16,044
I've totally changed!

1601
01:47:16,236 --> 01:47:18,807
Claude's old pals

1602
01:47:20,775 --> 01:47:24,018
One day in Etampes,
while I focus my camera,

1603
01:47:24,178 --> 01:47:26,385
I recognize Gislaine.
I go nearer.

1604
01:47:27,247 --> 01:47:28,453
We met 2 years ago.

1605
01:47:28,616 --> 01:47:31,392
Yes, at the travelers' camp.

1606
01:47:31,552 --> 01:47:33,463
- You're not there anymore?
- No.

1607
01:47:33,754 --> 01:47:37,566
- And Bebert'?
- I'm living with him in a garden.

1608
01:47:37,758 --> 01:47:39,760
A friend has a garden shed.

1609
01:47:40,194 --> 01:47:42,174
- This is my place.
- His place.

1610
01:47:43,197 --> 01:47:45,609
But it's tough.

1611
01:47:47,835 --> 01:47:50,839
We share our meals.

1612
01:47:51,405 --> 01:47:53,442
We help each other out.

1613
01:47:54,308 --> 01:47:57,084
You know,
you look better than before.

1614
01:47:57,812 --> 01:48:00,224
I got a boyfriend.
We'll see...

1615
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:02,486
A lot of people don't like it.

1616
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:04,356
Oh, why?

1617
01:48:04,518 --> 01:48:05,553
He's West Indian.

1618
01:48:06,387 --> 01:48:10,130
I've known him for a month,
but we see each other once a week.

1619
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:11,793
I'm seeing him tomorrow.

1620
01:48:12,126 --> 01:48:13,070
You're in love'?

1621
01:48:13,227 --> 01:48:16,640
Well, yeah!
They say that at my age...

1622
01:48:18,132 --> 01:48:19,770
But you're never too old.

1623
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:22,479
I'm 49 and he's 31.

1624
01:48:22,637 --> 01:48:25,208
- He's a bit younger.
- Yes, a bit.

1625
01:48:26,273 --> 01:48:29,345
Now I can go 5 or 6 days
without drinking.

1626
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,888
- Maybe it's love'?
- Maybe.

1627
01:48:32,246 --> 01:48:33,884
You used to drink a lot'?

1628
01:48:34,215 --> 01:48:37,389
Yes, I did, but I still drink.

1629
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:39,462
Less than before,
but I still do.

1630
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:41,531
How much is "a lot"?

1631
01:48:41,689 --> 01:48:44,431
Drinking a lot means...

1632
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:48,164
10 to 15 liters a day.
It's an awful lot.

1633
01:48:48,329 --> 01:48:49,637
Liters of what?

1634
01:48:49,797 --> 01:48:52,676
I drink rose. It's terrible...

1635
01:48:53,267 --> 01:48:57,682
Last time, I filmed you
when you were shouting.

1636
01:48:57,838 --> 01:49:00,876
- Can I put it in the film?
- No problem.

1637
01:49:01,709 --> 01:49:05,122
Claude, let's go see
Gislaine, because...

1638
01:49:05,413 --> 01:49:06,756
we got on well.

1639
01:49:08,616 --> 01:49:10,391
We can try...

1640
01:49:12,453 --> 01:49:13,557
Get lost.

1641
01:49:13,721 --> 01:49:15,223
The lady wants to talk.

1642
01:49:15,389 --> 01:49:19,599
I don't wanna talk to anybody!
Shut the door! Leave me alone!

1643
01:49:20,227 --> 01:49:21,672
Are you angry?

1644
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,838
Or are you sick?

1645
01:49:25,633 --> 01:49:28,307
Shut the door
or I'll kick your head in!

1646
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:35,410
I was afraid I'd upset you.
You were so drunk that day.

1647
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:37,179
Yes, I know. So what?

1648
01:49:37,711 --> 01:49:41,158
I want a lot of people
to see that and understand.

1649
01:49:41,315 --> 01:49:44,455
Then they'll see what it's like
to live in poverty

1650
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,828
in the street and all,
and why they drink.

1651
01:49:49,223 --> 01:49:52,932
Some people want to stop drinking.
If they don't get help,

1652
01:49:53,661 --> 01:49:55,436
they'll never manage it.

1653
01:50:03,004 --> 01:50:05,211
Will I still see you on Saturday?

1654
01:50:06,307 --> 01:50:08,514
It's sunny here today.

1655
01:50:08,675 --> 01:50:10,245
Isn't it sunny there'?

1656
01:50:11,378 --> 01:50:14,450
Well, the sun's in your heart.
That's a good start.

1657
01:50:16,984 --> 01:50:18,292
6 months later,

1658
01:50:18,485 --> 01:50:19,657
quite by chance,

1659
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,731
while looking for someone

1660
01:50:21,922 --> 01:50:23,868
at the Catholic Aid canteen,

1661
01:50:24,425 --> 01:50:26,405
I was surprised to find Claude.

1662
01:50:30,264 --> 01:50:31,937
I let him finish eating

1663
01:50:32,299 --> 01:50:33,642
his good, Catholic meal:

1664
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:36,805
salad, chicken, potatoes,
cheese, and fruit.

1665
01:50:37,337 --> 01:50:38,680
We meet in the yard.

1666
01:50:38,839 --> 01:50:40,876
He has a nice jacket and shirt.

1667
01:50:41,042 --> 01:50:42,612
Now he's wired for sound.

1668
01:50:43,677 --> 01:50:45,782
I came back,
I've got friends here.

1669
01:50:46,814 --> 01:50:49,385
I met Gislaine.
She got me in there.

1670
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:51,860
I lived there
for a couple of months.

1671
01:50:52,386 --> 01:50:54,889
When I saw
how things were there,

1672
01:50:55,056 --> 01:50:58,230
I went to Coluche's.
They helped me find...

1673
01:50:58,392 --> 01:51:02,602
The Coluche who started
the Restaurants of the Heart.

1674
01:51:02,963 --> 01:51:05,876
I know Pquerette (Daisy).

1675
01:51:06,033 --> 01:51:07,808
She runs the Restaurant.

1676
01:51:08,269 --> 01:51:12,240
She helped me
get into the Sonacotra shelter.

1677
01:51:12,406 --> 01:51:14,511
They took me right away.

1678
01:51:14,908 --> 01:51:17,548
Now I don't sleep
in caravans or outside.

1679
01:51:17,712 --> 01:51:18,952
I'm in the warm.

1680
01:51:20,514 --> 01:51:22,425
- Is life better?
- Much.

1681
01:51:22,616 --> 01:51:23,424
Got a TV'?

1682
01:51:23,584 --> 01:51:26,963
In the evening, I watch the news.
I like that.

1683
01:51:28,355 --> 01:51:32,565
I helped Gislaine
get into the Sonacotra.

1684
01:51:32,727 --> 01:51:35,037
She's there now, not outside.

1685
01:51:35,362 --> 01:51:38,002
- You're still friends?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

1686
01:51:38,799 --> 01:51:42,975
We're not together how, but
we get on, we see each other a lot.

1687
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:44,843
A change for her, too'?

1688
01:51:45,005 --> 01:51:49,420
Yes, I think so. Starting with
personal hygiene and so on.

1689
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,021
Is she still in love'?

1690
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:56,428
With her guy from Martinique,
I suppose so.

1691
01:51:58,886 --> 01:52:01,492
I'm more independent now.

1692
01:52:01,655 --> 01:52:05,797
I'm not at the mercy of...
Do this or do that...

1693
01:52:06,093 --> 01:52:09,631
The man from Aix who had big boots

1694
01:52:15,068 --> 01:52:18,072
- Peek-a-boo! It's me!
- Ah, it's Franaois.

1695
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:20,347
A little kiss.

1696
01:52:20,841 --> 01:52:23,845
We were to meet in Aix,
but Franaois came to Paris.

1697
01:52:24,011 --> 01:52:25,354
That's right.

1698
01:52:25,513 --> 01:52:26,617
We saw you

1699
01:52:26,981 --> 01:52:30,793
walking around Aix,
proud and virtually proclaiming

1700
01:52:31,652 --> 01:52:33,598
the right to salvage things.

1701
01:52:33,887 --> 01:52:36,458
2 years later,
I still proclaim that right,

1702
01:52:36,624 --> 01:52:40,834
but that right
isn't granted to me anymore.

1703
01:52:43,097 --> 01:52:44,906
I thought there was a problem.

1704
01:52:45,065 --> 01:52:47,841
One day, you called me,
not from home.

1705
01:52:48,001 --> 01:52:51,539
I wasn't exactly home -
I was in the psychiatric ward.

1706
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,017
Franaois took home stuff

1707
01:52:55,376 --> 01:52:57,879
which he stored in the cellar
and stairwells.

1708
01:52:58,045 --> 01:52:59,991
The neighbors called the police.

1709
01:53:00,181 --> 01:53:02,821
There was trouble
between them and me.

1710
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:05,926
- And'?
- The police considered it necessary

1711
01:53:07,421 --> 01:53:11,699
to put me
under psychiatric observation.

1712
01:53:12,193 --> 01:53:13,729
How did you feel?

1713
01:53:13,894 --> 01:53:15,396
It was hard.

1714
01:53:15,563 --> 01:53:18,669
I felt victimized
and condemned at the same time.

1715
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,511
By who? Society?

1716
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:23,148
By society, in a way.

1717
01:53:23,704 --> 01:53:26,412
They don't like the way I live.

1718
01:53:26,574 --> 01:53:28,884
Didn't a neighbor say
you were nice?

1719
01:53:29,476 --> 01:53:33,447
Being nice isn't enough for them.
You have to be normal, too.

1720
01:53:34,982 --> 01:53:36,723
What happened to your boots'?

1721
01:53:37,685 --> 01:53:40,131
The boots are very symbolic,

1722
01:53:40,454 --> 01:53:42,832
because
when I was institutionalized,

1723
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:45,903
they were worn out
and went in the trash.

1724
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:49,232
So, what the trash gave,
the trash took away.

1725
01:53:50,798 --> 01:53:53,210
I'm no longer the lord of the town.

1726
01:53:53,534 --> 01:53:56,811
In a way,
I'm the prisoner of the town.

1727
01:53:57,972 --> 01:54:00,213
And yet, not long before,

1728
01:54:00,574 --> 01:54:04,613
on the TV show, Nulle Part Ailleurs
(Nowhere Else),

1729
01:54:04,812 --> 01:54:07,122
he was sure
of his right and his choices.

1730
01:54:07,448 --> 01:54:09,985
You've lived 100% off salvaging
for 10 years.

1731
01:54:11,986 --> 01:54:13,124
So, is it by choice?

1732
01:54:13,487 --> 01:54:16,525
Absolutely. I'm someone
who eats 100% trash.

1733
01:54:16,691 --> 01:54:20,161
The body's cells are regenerated
every 7 years,

1734
01:54:20,494 --> 01:54:23,873
so I'm 100% trash.
My clothes are 100% trash.

1735
01:54:24,765 --> 01:54:26,938
It's a choice
on ethical grounds.

1736
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:33,451
What I hate seeing is people
all over the world going hungry.

1737
01:54:33,607 --> 01:54:35,211
That will always be the case,

1738
01:54:35,543 --> 01:54:38,990
but most of all, I hate seeing
everything people throw out.

1739
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,989
What's the best you found?

1740
01:54:41,148 --> 01:54:44,686
A whole vacuum-packed "foie gras".

1741
01:54:44,885 --> 01:54:47,593
Top quality...
Vacuum-packed duck.

1742
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:50,964
Another thing
which breaks my heart is

1743
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:52,866
the stock of frozen fish.

1744
01:54:53,027 --> 01:54:56,634
This wastage is scandalous,
so gleaning makes sense.

1745
01:54:56,797 --> 01:55:00,768
It makes sense not to throw out
yogurt once it's expired,

1746
01:55:00,935 --> 01:55:04,212
not to throw out fish
once it's officially expired.

1747
01:55:04,538 --> 01:55:08,782
The food industry has got
incredibly high safety standards.

1748
01:55:08,976 --> 01:55:11,081
Do you never get sick?

1749
01:55:11,512 --> 01:55:12,855
Never! No, never.

1750
01:55:16,317 --> 01:55:17,625
RECYCLING HAP

1751
01:55:34,335 --> 01:55:36,315
Are you OK with people starving?

1752
01:55:36,637 --> 01:55:37,741
No one cares

1753
01:55:37,938 --> 01:55:39,781
Look at the market stalls

1754
01:55:40,174 --> 01:55:42,654
Look at the food thrown away

1755
01:55:46,947 --> 01:55:49,052
Bend down,
but don't lower yourself

1756
01:55:49,216 --> 01:55:52,288
When I see them stooping
I suffer for them

1757
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,827
I hurt to see them
salvaging for food

1758
01:55:55,022 --> 01:55:57,525
Having to pick up food
that's rotting

1759
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:00,137
Going around markets,
eating trash

1760
01:56:00,694 --> 01:56:02,674
There are only leftovers left

1761
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:04,969
They salvage things
of no value to us

1762
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,773
Before the street sweepers come

1763
01:56:07,935 --> 01:56:09,744
The man with the artichoke

1764
01:56:15,242 --> 01:56:18,155
As well as salvaging food,
I'm a vegetarian.

1765
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:22,688
- Is that all you live off'?
- No, but...

1766
01:56:24,585 --> 01:56:26,622
I try to keep my hand in.

1767
01:56:26,787 --> 01:56:29,563
With our present
and future governments,

1768
01:56:29,723 --> 01:56:32,761
I don't think we'll have

1769
01:56:32,927 --> 01:56:37,171
much chance of moving forward
and saving people from poverty.

1770
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:40,072
Look at this well-cleaned artichoke.

1771
01:56:42,069 --> 01:56:44,276
Even in poor countries,

1772
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:47,050
some social classes

1773
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:50,248
waste a lot, too.

1774
01:56:51,411 --> 01:56:55,086
Wasting something
shows a lack of respect

1775
01:56:55,249 --> 01:56:57,388
for the worker who made it.

1776
01:56:57,718 --> 01:57:00,324
That's one
of the main reasons I salvage.

1777
01:57:01,889 --> 01:57:05,268
I've "recycled" myself
in anti-consumerism.

1778
01:57:06,127 --> 01:57:09,904
As I'm a vegetarian,
I don't have the problem

1779
01:57:10,097 --> 01:57:13,237
of eating meat
that has gone bad.

1780
01:57:13,667 --> 01:57:17,080
If a vegetable has gone bad,
it shows.

1781
01:57:17,437 --> 01:57:19,713
You don't take it.

1782
01:57:20,341 --> 01:57:22,150
And in theory, it's not toxic.

1783
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:25,350
- Where do you live'?
- In a squat.

1784
01:57:26,046 --> 01:57:28,322
We don't live in places now -
we squat.

1785
01:57:28,649 --> 01:57:30,128
Why are you filming this?

1786
01:57:30,951 --> 01:57:33,124
I tell him it's a documentary.

1787
01:57:33,287 --> 01:57:36,291
I've spent 2 years
talking to salvagers

1788
01:57:36,457 --> 01:57:38,164
and I film them.

1789
01:57:38,359 --> 01:57:40,202
I enjoyed filming him.

1790
01:57:40,694 --> 01:57:43,265
I also enjoy filming potatoes,
life going by,

1791
01:57:43,697 --> 01:57:44,675
and cats.

1792
01:57:51,638 --> 01:57:53,777
Hi Salomon, so long Charlie

1793
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:56,452
Hello, Salomon.

1794
01:57:57,111 --> 01:57:58,454
How goes it'?

1795
01:58:00,414 --> 01:58:02,724
- It's been a while.
- Unbelievable!

1796
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:04,427
Two years!

1797
01:58:05,786 --> 01:58:09,029
Salomon takes me to the house
we filmed in.

1798
01:58:11,993 --> 01:58:13,063
Charlie's house.

1799
01:58:13,694 --> 01:58:15,696
A face like Ho Chi Minh's.

1800
01:58:15,897 --> 01:58:16,932
Charlie is no more.

1801
01:58:17,465 --> 01:58:19,376
He died a few months ago.

1802
01:58:24,738 --> 01:58:25,808
He was your friend.

1803
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:28,816
Yes, and it's hard to...

1804
01:58:31,045 --> 01:58:33,286
get along without him.
It really is.

1805
01:58:33,881 --> 01:58:35,792
I feel so sad.

1806
01:58:36,817 --> 01:58:37,761
Charlie

1807
01:58:37,952 --> 01:58:39,397
went out on Wednesdays

1808
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,224
to go to the Post Office
and to come see me.

1809
01:58:44,058 --> 01:58:46,766
More than a customer,
he became a friend.

1810
01:58:46,927 --> 01:58:48,804
One thing I remember about him

1811
01:58:48,996 --> 01:58:52,876
was that he came to offer me
champagne before Christmas.

1812
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:58,012
And he had a sword in his cane.
Everyone knew that.

1813
01:58:59,407 --> 01:59:01,819
What can you say about Charlie'?

1814
01:59:01,976 --> 01:59:04,718
He was a wise man. A wise man.

1815
01:59:05,746 --> 01:59:07,726
Here and there, bit by bit

1816
01:59:08,215 --> 01:59:10,388
I work with the merchants

1817
01:59:10,551 --> 01:59:13,430
every Wednesday and every Sunday.

1818
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:18,868
I unload the goods
off their trucks.

1819
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:20,869
I help them set up.

1820
01:59:21,095 --> 01:59:23,837
This morning, I got 150 francs.

1821
01:59:24,398 --> 01:59:27,504
And later on,
when the market's over,

1822
01:59:27,868 --> 01:59:29,779
they'll pay me some more.

1823
01:59:29,937 --> 01:59:31,541
Every little helps...

1824
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:35,751
Yes, but it's not much.
They just take advantage.

1825
01:59:36,978 --> 01:59:40,448
Oh, you know...
I don't do very much.

1826
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:42,783
Here and there, bit by bit...

1827
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:45,123
Is it enough to live on'?

1828
01:59:45,285 --> 01:59:46,764
Well, it's not bad.

1829
01:59:51,058 --> 01:59:52,833
This is my bedroom.

1830
01:59:56,564 --> 01:59:59,477
- Can you sleep in there'?
- Sure, no problem.

1831
01:59:59,934 --> 02:00:02,346
Where do you find water
and so on'?

1832
02:00:02,503 --> 02:00:04,949
- I've got water.
- Where? Show me.

1833
02:00:06,307 --> 02:00:08,014
I've always got water.

1834
02:00:10,177 --> 02:00:12,589
- Where do you wash?
- At the garage.

1835
02:00:14,215 --> 02:00:15,888
- They have a shower?
- Yes.

1836
02:00:16,183 --> 02:00:19,130
If you know how to get by...

1837
02:00:20,488 --> 02:00:22,490
you'll always be alright.

1838
02:00:22,957 --> 02:00:24,368
Are you mad at anyone?

1839
02:00:24,525 --> 02:00:26,505
No, no! No way.

1840
02:00:26,827 --> 02:00:29,433
On the contrary.
I prefer to make people laugh,

1841
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:32,373
make them happy,
cheer them up.

1842
02:00:36,503 --> 02:00:38,915
A bedroom in an old van,

1843
02:00:39,106 --> 02:00:41,177
the washing machine
on the sidewalk,

1844
02:00:41,909 --> 02:00:43,183
an armchair,

1845
02:00:43,444 --> 02:00:44,980
two armchairs,

1846
02:00:45,413 --> 02:00:46,653
a sofa...

1847
02:00:47,214 --> 02:00:48,955
That reminds me of something.

1848
02:00:49,116 --> 02:00:50,959
An Emotion Picture by Agnes

1849
02:00:53,854 --> 02:00:56,027
- This one?
- Yes.

1850
02:01:02,063 --> 02:01:03,337
Let's roll it.

1851
02:01:06,167 --> 02:01:07,407
Don't hurt yourself.

1852
02:01:45,973 --> 02:01:47,953
3 children run past.

1853
02:01:48,675 --> 02:01:49,881
3 children.

1854
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:54,088
There's the tale
of the three little children

1855
02:01:54,248 --> 02:01:55,921
who gleaned in the fields.

1856
02:01:57,251 --> 02:01:58,992
Alone or with mom.

1857
02:01:59,153 --> 02:02:00,291
Poor children.

1858
02:02:05,793 --> 02:02:08,399
The sky is threatening,
a storm is brewing.

1859
02:02:08,562 --> 02:02:10,667
The children must be afraid.

1860
02:02:11,365 --> 02:02:14,278
The storm also threatens
the Chambaudoin Gleaners,

1861
02:02:14,435 --> 02:02:18,008
painted by Hedouin in 1852
before Millet's Gleaners.

1862
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:21,378
When a painting leaves its reserve

1863
02:02:23,611 --> 02:02:25,557
Now we can caress the painting!

1864
02:02:29,016 --> 02:02:30,359
I was invited,

1865
02:02:30,517 --> 02:02:34,226
having brought this painting
out of the shadowy reserve,

1866
02:02:34,388 --> 02:02:37,528
to witness its unpacking
after its restoration.

1867
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:40,969
I'm completely carried away

1868
02:02:41,128 --> 02:02:43,972
to take part
in this painting's history.

1869
02:02:52,072 --> 02:02:56,521
After the film came out, many people
asked to see this painting.

1870
02:02:57,345 --> 02:03:00,986
I thought
that it should be the first painting

1871
02:03:01,182 --> 02:03:04,629
to be restored and displayed

1872
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:08,191
for the opening
of the old museum's reserve.

1873
02:03:09,323 --> 02:03:11,769
Here's Brigitte Lauren/Son,
the curator,

1874
02:03:11,925 --> 02:03:13,370
telling the story:

1875
02:03:13,527 --> 02:03:17,475
I phoned up and spoke of
this hidden painting I knew about,

1876
02:03:17,631 --> 02:03:20,771
I had come to film,
the painting had been brought up

1877
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:23,081
into the light of day.

1878
02:03:23,804 --> 02:03:28,617
When we came
to your little courtyard,

1879
02:03:29,243 --> 02:03:30,916
it suddenly became windy.

1880
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:33,354
Your hair and your skirt all...

1881
02:03:33,547 --> 02:03:38,087
Suddenly there was the gust of wind
before the impending storm.

1882
02:03:38,386 --> 02:03:41,697
It seemed like a miracle of cinema:
you organize things,

1883
02:03:42,056 --> 02:03:45,003
the people are kind, competent,

1884
02:03:45,159 --> 02:03:47,400
favorable, cooperative...

1885
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:50,371
Then, this marvelous gust
of wind comes along.

1886
02:03:50,531 --> 02:03:53,512
And no filmmaker
can order and obtain that.

1887
02:03:54,702 --> 02:03:58,240
Nor did I order
or choose this calendar

1888
02:03:58,406 --> 02:04:00,682
with Jules Breton's
The Gleaners' Return.

1889
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:03,814
The mailman from Bonnieux
chose it for me.

1890
02:04:04,378 --> 02:04:07,120
He also gave me a painting
in which he's tall

1891
02:04:07,281 --> 02:04:10,387
and handing me a letter.
At least I think it's me.

1892
02:04:12,053 --> 02:04:14,556
This is the painting mailman,
Jackie Patin.

1893
02:04:15,056 --> 02:04:16,831
I liked his gift.

1894
02:04:18,292 --> 02:04:19,896
Another funny gift.

1895
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:21,471
Now it's the opposite:

1896
02:04:22,263 --> 02:04:23,606
I'm the giant,

1897
02:04:25,633 --> 02:04:29,274
according to this supposedly
crazy guy, Jacques Arnaud.

1898
02:04:30,103 --> 02:04:34,245
A drawing by Chris Marker with
the famous cat, Guillaume en Egypte.

1899
02:04:35,376 --> 02:04:39,017
He reminds me that in his (DD-ROM
lmmemory - a unique work -

1900
02:04:39,347 --> 02:04:43,193
we see gleaners picking up
a bloody silhouette,

1901
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:46,126
crushed by a nightmarish tank.

1902
02:04:48,155 --> 02:04:49,828
Gleaners galore!

1903
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:53,870
I'm shown them, I'm sent them,
I see them everywhere.

1904
02:04:54,261 --> 02:04:56,832
Could Jean-Franaois Millet
ever have imagined

1905
02:04:57,198 --> 02:04:59,678
so many of his Gleaners
in so many colors?

1906
02:04:59,834 --> 02:05:02,280
Hand-colored postcards...

1907
02:05:02,436 --> 02:05:05,349
The brightest one
was sent to me by Paoni.

1908
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,187
The most eccentric
is Prevert's version.

1909
02:05:09,610 --> 02:05:11,681
Laurent Roth
sent a copy of the collage.

1910
02:05:14,015 --> 02:05:16,689
I go to the National
to film the original

1911
02:05:16,851 --> 02:05:18,831
and study the collage
close up.

1912
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:24,297
It becomes a game of
Spot the Differences!

1913
02:05:25,426 --> 02:05:29,340
To compare the aprons,
the photocopy and a postcard.

1914
02:05:29,563 --> 02:05:31,543
The bow
has become a propeller.

1915
02:05:31,699 --> 02:05:34,270
Only the gleaner on the right
can fly!

1916
02:05:36,504 --> 02:05:40,850
Lubtchansky sends me a photo of
his collection of "chromo-gleaners".

1917
02:05:41,809 --> 02:05:44,449
Like me, he's a fan
of "picker-uppers".

1918
02:05:45,346 --> 02:05:49,488
Not to be outdone, Leendert de Jong
sends me a Dutch porthole

1919
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:51,254
with the Gleaners inside.

1920
02:05:51,418 --> 02:05:53,261
The frames vary.

1921
02:05:53,420 --> 02:05:55,627
Except the Orsay one,
they're modest.

1922
02:05:55,956 --> 02:05:58,129
This painting has become popular.

1923
02:05:58,525 --> 02:06:00,596
Even embroideresses reproduce it.

1924
02:06:01,962 --> 02:06:03,236
And advertisers.

1925
02:06:03,397 --> 02:06:06,344
This is the smallest picture
of the Gleaners

1926
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:09,240
with advertising on the back.

1927
02:06:09,636 --> 02:06:12,446
Against poultry cholera
Gallia Powder

1928
02:06:12,907 --> 02:06:15,217
The stamps from Togo
are small, too.

1929
02:06:15,376 --> 02:06:18,152
The gleaners of stars
is a charming idea.

1930
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:20,155
Leftover stars.

1931
02:06:20,314 --> 02:06:22,988
Gleaners of stardust.

1932
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,864
More down-to-earth:
let's talk potatoes!

1933
02:06:29,957 --> 02:06:31,834
Some light-hearted education...

1934
02:06:34,595 --> 02:06:37,599
The heart-shaped potato I launched
bounced back:

1935
02:06:37,932 --> 02:06:41,379
I get them in my mailbox
and even in a letter.

1936
02:06:42,236 --> 02:06:43,579
Or in pictures.

1937
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:47,115
This one offered up
in memory of a child.

1938
02:06:47,274 --> 02:06:48,947
One can't help
but be moved.

1939
02:06:50,144 --> 02:06:51,953
People bring them, too.

1940
02:06:53,114 --> 02:06:55,185
I treat them like treasures.

1941
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,028
I watch them grow old.

1942
02:07:03,524 --> 02:07:06,164
Then, I get a heart-shaped carrot.

1943
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:09,504
A carrot with 2 ventricles
or 2 heads.

1944
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:13,204
It was taken by a documentary
maker, Remy Batteault.

1945
02:07:13,367 --> 02:07:17,281
He says his mother found the carrot.
I have to go find her.

1946
02:07:20,073 --> 02:07:22,485
Ah, it's the card he sent you'?

1947
02:07:23,177 --> 02:07:24,918
I didn't know.

1948
02:07:25,713 --> 02:07:29,593
"After the now ubiquitous
heart-shaped potato,

1949
02:07:30,718 --> 02:07:32,356
Ma Josette has found..."

1950
02:07:32,519 --> 02:07:36,262
I'm far too emotional
to be able to speak!

1951
02:07:36,423 --> 02:07:38,130
What your son did
was great.

1952
02:07:38,292 --> 02:07:40,067
Yes, that's true.

1953
02:07:40,227 --> 02:07:41,831
Read it out to me.

1954
02:07:41,996 --> 02:07:45,068
"After the now ubiquitous
heart-shaped potato,

1955
02:07:45,233 --> 02:07:49,147
Ma Josette has found for you
the heart-shaped carrot.

1956
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:53,509
The whole thing was of course done
without any special effects

1957
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:58,353
and can be used in
The Gleaners and I, Part ll."

1958
02:07:58,512 --> 02:08:00,185
What a story!

1959
02:08:01,449 --> 02:08:04,396
He talks of his projects
in his letter to me.

1960
02:08:05,253 --> 02:08:08,257
"I'm thinking of you
as I'm making a documentary

1961
02:08:08,956 --> 02:08:10,993
on my family's butcher's."

1962
02:08:12,393 --> 02:08:17,001
The store gives me the chance
to communicate with people.

1963
02:08:17,398 --> 02:08:21,574
I have a lot of customers
with whom I exchange

1964
02:08:21,735 --> 02:08:24,511
impressions and so on.

1965
02:08:24,672 --> 02:08:27,482
The Gleaners and I,
for everyone here,

1966
02:08:27,641 --> 02:08:31,418
- was marvelous.
- Very instructive.

1967
02:08:31,712 --> 02:08:34,693
People are deeply moved
by this film.

1968
02:08:35,015 --> 02:08:37,325
There is an intensity of feeling.

1969
02:08:37,484 --> 02:08:41,091
It's the people in it
that are extraordinary.

1970
02:08:41,255 --> 02:08:42,393
Make no mistake.

1971
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:45,297
They are the actors in the film

1972
02:08:45,492 --> 02:08:49,167
and it's true
that they are very touching.

1973
02:08:54,368 --> 02:08:58,180
I've got Rosette sausages
for you all, which I made myself.

1974
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:00,441
Ah, the Rosette is my passion.

1975
02:09:01,242 --> 02:09:03,620
It's the thing
I like making best of all.

1976
02:09:04,178 --> 02:09:07,091
I've won 12 gold medals
with that Rosette

1977
02:09:07,281 --> 02:09:09,124
since I started.

1978
02:09:11,151 --> 02:09:14,689
I'm so fond of this particular
product that I like it

1979
02:09:15,022 --> 02:09:18,367
when people try it
and give me their opinion.

1980
02:09:18,525 --> 02:09:20,630
- 3 Rosettes...
- There you go.

1981
02:09:20,795 --> 02:09:22,797
Thanks, Josette,
thanks, Roger.

1982
02:09:23,431 --> 02:09:27,208
Rosette comes
from Roger and Josette:

1983
02:09:27,367 --> 02:09:29,574
"Ro" and "sette".

1984
02:09:29,737 --> 02:09:34,482
As luck would have it,
Roger met Josette,

1985
02:09:34,641 --> 02:09:37,383
and Roger likes making Rosettes!

1986
02:09:37,678 --> 02:09:41,023
- For a long time...
- A long time what?

1987
02:09:41,181 --> 02:09:43,161
I've liked Josette!

1988
02:09:43,518 --> 02:09:45,464
A fine declaration! Thank you.

1989
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:48,992
Dare I say it'?
From Rosette to rose...

1990
02:09:49,524 --> 02:09:54,530
Let's just say, from a Beaune street
to the slopes of Pommard...

1991
02:09:55,596 --> 02:09:58,440
Psychoanalysis is gleaming

1992
02:09:59,533 --> 02:10:01,479
I'll open up.

1993
02:10:02,469 --> 02:10:05,109
You came to see 2 years ago
for this film.

1994
02:10:05,273 --> 02:10:07,150
I didn't know you were...

1995
02:10:07,308 --> 02:10:11,120
a learned philosopher
of psychoanalysis.

1996
02:10:11,345 --> 02:10:13,791
I didn't even know
you had written books

1997
02:10:14,115 --> 02:10:18,154
nor that you compiled the Language
of Psychoanalysis with Pontalis.

1998
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:21,596
But one has to accept
that one makes a documentary

1999
02:10:21,755 --> 02:10:24,258
spontaneously,
instinctively even.

2000
02:10:25,326 --> 02:10:27,636
In the film, we went

2001
02:10:27,828 --> 02:10:30,365
from wine growing
to psychoanalysis.

2002
02:10:30,698 --> 02:10:34,373
I spoke about the question
of grape gleaning.

2003
02:10:34,535 --> 02:10:37,141
Of course, that was
what attracted you:

2004
02:10:37,305 --> 02:10:41,344
seeing all those grapes on the
ground, wondering how to use them.

2005
02:10:41,509 --> 02:10:43,455
And it didn't occur to me

2006
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:48,219
that you didn't ask me if there was
gleaning in psychoanalysis.

2007
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:52,489
And yet that's what was missing
in what I told you.

2008
02:10:52,886 --> 02:10:54,729
When I left, I felt stupid...

2009
02:10:54,889 --> 02:10:57,301
And I couldn't believe
my stupidity

2010
02:10:57,457 --> 02:11:00,233
for not having thought about it.

2011
02:11:01,128 --> 02:11:04,200
The analyst's job,
when he is analyzing someone

2012
02:11:04,365 --> 02:11:08,575
in the Freudian way
- with a chair and a couch -

2013
02:11:08,736 --> 02:11:12,684
you really can call it
a kind of gleaming.

2014
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:14,649
That's not going too far.

2015
02:11:14,809 --> 02:11:17,346
In other words, we pay attention

2016
02:11:17,512 --> 02:11:19,549
to things no one else does:

2017
02:11:19,713 --> 02:11:21,386
what falls from speech.

2018
02:11:21,815 --> 02:11:23,886
What is dropped,
what is picked up...

2019
02:11:24,218 --> 02:11:26,459
Words which are beside usual speech

2020
02:11:26,620 --> 02:11:29,191
are of special value
to psychoanalysts,

2021
02:11:29,357 --> 02:11:32,497
because things
which are picked up or gleaned

2022
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:35,300
are more valuable to us
than what is harvested.

2023
02:11:35,663 --> 02:11:38,644
Isn't there also
a notion of poverty'?

2024
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:41,170
- A lack'?
- Yes, indeed.

2025
02:11:41,335 --> 02:11:45,340
The psychoanalyst
is also in a state of poverty

2026
02:11:45,506 --> 02:11:49,648
in that he is in a state
of not knowing.

2027
02:11:49,810 --> 02:11:52,757
He doesn't know beforehand
what he'll glean.

2028
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,651
- So, that's his poverty.
- That's funny.

2029
02:11:55,816 --> 02:11:59,389
Isn't it the patient
who comes to see the analyst

2030
02:11:59,653 --> 02:12:00,859
who lacks something?

2031
02:12:01,188 --> 02:12:03,759
Yes, he lacks...
He comes and asks:

2032
02:12:04,091 --> 02:12:06,628
"Doctor, what's wrong with me'?
You know.

2033
02:12:06,794 --> 02:12:08,705
Doctor, what's wrong with me?"

2034
02:12:08,862 --> 02:12:12,366
But the doctor
has no more idea than the patient.

2035
02:12:12,533 --> 02:12:13,773
That's the great thing.

2036
02:12:14,101 --> 02:12:17,310
Both are poor...
poor in knowledge.

2037
02:12:17,471 --> 02:12:21,442
And even if the doctor knows,
or thinks he knows,

2038
02:12:21,608 --> 02:12:23,679
he must give up
what he knows

2039
02:12:23,844 --> 02:12:28,418
so he can be receptive to something
which is completely new.

2040
02:12:28,882 --> 02:12:32,329
I really liked
your oddly-shaped potatoes.

2041
02:12:32,486 --> 02:12:35,899
We'd never seen
heart-shaped potatoes like that.

2042
02:12:36,257 --> 02:12:38,828
It's a rather symbolic shape.

2043
02:12:39,427 --> 02:12:40,804
Better than the real thing!

2044
02:12:41,128 --> 02:12:42,198
Pretty, isn't it'?

2045
02:12:58,512 --> 02:13:01,356
This photo was taken
in my kitchen

2046
02:13:01,515 --> 02:13:04,359
in front of a painting
found in a junk store.

2047
02:13:04,552 --> 02:13:06,327
STRAIGHT TO THE HEART

2048
02:13:06,721 --> 02:13:10,259
That photo appeared in Aden,

2049
02:13:11,492 --> 02:13:14,439
because I was interviewed
by Philippe Piazzo.

2050
02:13:14,728 --> 02:13:17,504
I was here,
and something strange happened.

2051
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:21,513
Philippe was talking to me
about the Gleaners.

2052
02:13:21,969 --> 02:13:24,643
He said
he was deeply moved by the shots

2053
02:13:24,806 --> 02:13:27,412
in which I showed
my hands and hair.

2054
02:13:28,943 --> 02:13:30,547
Then, he said,

2055
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:34,625
"I was also moved, because it
reminded me of Jacquot de Nantes

2056
02:13:34,782 --> 02:13:38,355
and of the shots you filmed
of Jacques Demy,

2057
02:13:38,652 --> 02:13:40,654
of his arms and hands,

2058
02:13:40,821 --> 02:13:43,495
and one which went
from his hair to his eye."

2059
02:13:43,991 --> 02:13:46,801
When he said that,
I started crying.

2060
02:13:47,595 --> 02:13:50,474
I wasn't particularly crying

2061
02:13:50,631 --> 02:13:52,907
for Jacques or something, but...

2062
02:13:53,567 --> 02:13:55,774
I realized
I'd done it unwittingly.

2063
02:13:55,937 --> 02:13:58,611
I realized something extraordinary:

2064
02:13:58,773 --> 02:14:01,481
without ever thinking about it,

2065
02:14:01,975 --> 02:14:05,445
I redid on myself...
I refilmed on myself...

2066
02:14:05,846 --> 02:14:08,122
what I had filmed
of Jacques Demy.

2067
02:14:09,283 --> 02:14:12,890
But as the context was different:
what I did

2068
02:14:13,054 --> 02:14:17,833
concerned ageing. I wanted to be
as honest as the Gleaners had been...

2069
02:14:18,192 --> 02:14:20,399
So, I never saw the similarity.

2070
02:14:20,561 --> 02:14:23,235
But when he said that,
I saw there was...

2071
02:14:23,397 --> 02:14:26,810
a sort of thread
linking the two films,

2072
02:14:26,967 --> 02:14:29,140
between Jacques' hands,

2073
02:14:29,303 --> 02:14:31,544
his skin damaged by disease

2074
02:14:31,872 --> 02:14:33,874
and mine damaged by old age.

2075
02:14:34,041 --> 02:14:36,521
His white hair, my white hair.

2076
02:14:37,544 --> 02:14:39,854
I said to my daughter
and the others:

2077
02:14:40,013 --> 02:14:43,256
"Piazzo said it reminded him
of Jacquot de Nantes,

2078
02:14:43,417 --> 02:14:46,057
of the close-ups of Jacques."

2079
02:14:46,386 --> 02:14:50,357
Rosalie said: "Yes, of course,
everyone saw that."

2080
02:14:50,558 --> 02:14:52,868
Everyone except me.

2081
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:56,164
I'm not trying
to sound stupid or naive, but...

2082
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:59,106
it struck me how we work...

2083
02:14:59,266 --> 02:15:01,974
how we work
without knowing, without...

2084
02:15:02,536 --> 02:15:06,916
We don't work on the meaning
or with continuity...

2085
02:15:07,074 --> 02:15:10,920
People say to me:
"Your work is very consistent".

2086
02:15:11,211 --> 02:15:14,124
They say what they like, of course.
I realize...

2087
02:15:14,281 --> 02:15:16,318
that I work as best I can.

2088
02:15:16,917 --> 02:15:20,421
Sometimes, 6 or 12 months later,
someone says something...

2089
02:15:20,587 --> 02:15:23,067
And that really amazed me.

2090
02:15:23,223 --> 02:15:26,466
I was very grateful to Piazzo
for telling me.

2091
02:15:26,627 --> 02:15:29,369
I was amazed
no one had told me before

2092
02:15:29,530 --> 02:15:32,101
and even more amazed
to have done it.

2093
02:15:48,415 --> 02:15:52,295
May 1st 2000: I filmed some lily of
the valley for The Gleaners' last shot

2094
02:15:53,287 --> 02:15:56,268
and quickly put it in the film
before Cannes.

2095
02:15:56,957 --> 02:16:02,236
And now I end this film with more
lily of the valley for May Day.

2096
02:16:02,663 --> 02:16:03,698
And what a May Day!

2097
02:16:04,298 --> 02:16:06,835
A march
against the Front National.

2098
02:16:07,001 --> 02:16:09,277
Against the far right
of Le Pen.

2099
02:16:13,707 --> 02:16:16,711
Down with the Front National!

2100
02:16:16,911 --> 02:16:20,188
F for Fascist
and N for Nazi

2101
02:16:37,365 --> 02:16:40,812
First, second, third generation

2102
02:16:41,102 --> 02:16:43,981
We're all children of immigrants

2103
02:16:44,171 --> 02:16:45,775
Erase the shame - Vote

2104
02:16:57,919 --> 02:16:59,193
LE PEN OUT!

2105
02:17:55,609 --> 02:17:58,283


2106
02:17:58,446 --> 02:18:01,052
