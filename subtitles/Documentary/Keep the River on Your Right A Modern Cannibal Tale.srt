00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,558
Man is un???

3
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,745
Nothing is impossible for him.

4
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:16,348
What seemed to be a unthinkable undertaking yesterday

5
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,119
are history today.

6
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:20,306
The conquest of the moon for example

7
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,972
Who talks about it anymore

8
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,409
Today we are already on the threshold of conquering are galaxy.

9
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,596
and in the not to distant tomorrow

10
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:30,303
Will be considering the conquest of the universe.

11
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:33,844
and yet man seems to ignore the fact that on this very planet

12
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:38,114
there are still people living in the stone age and practicing cannibalism.

13
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,447
..... Primitive tribes isolated in ruthless hostile enviroments

14
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,571
where the prevailing law is survivial of the fittest

15
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:48,841
And this jungle its inhabitaince refer too, as the Green Inferno

16
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:52,277
Is only a few hours flying time from New York City

17
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:54,569
was it to remind us that four brave Americans 

18
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,693
went there to make a documentry on life in the jungle

19
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,984
was it also to remind us for instance

20
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,963
that before venturing into space.

21
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:05,191
We should become more aquanted with the planet that we live on.

22
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:08,836
Four young and fearless Americans children of the space age.

23
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:12,273
Armed with cameras, microphones, and curiosity.

24
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:15,814
Alan Yates, director famous for his documentry's on

25
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,792
Vietnam and Africa.

26
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:22,271
Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl.

27
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:27,269
and there two cameramen,  Jack Anders and Mark
Tomaso

28
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:30,602
Four youngsters never came back.

29
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,164
But let's have a look at them

30
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,768
at the beginning of there incredible adventure.

31
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:37,163
Here at the border between Brazil and Peru.

32
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,183
They are about to board a plane to take them to the Rio Ocoro.

33
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:43,620
A last outpost from which they will continue on foot.

34
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,286
Deep into the Amazon Jungle.

35
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,410
Into the area known as the Green Inferno.

36
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,639
Hey, are you really not scared?

37
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:56,325
Not at all...I've been in plenty of dangerous places with them.

38
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,887
 What about you, Alan?

39
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,595
Well there's one thing scares me.

40
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,990
and that's marriage..

41
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,323
He'd take me to the North Pole to put it off...

42
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:09,031
I'd say you succeeded this time too.

43
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,114
And this last time.

44
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,925
Yes, provided that to come back in one piece.

45
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,737
Alright, alright...Let's go.

46
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:20,903
Well you four are certainly the first to embark on such an adventure.

47
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,798
There was a expedition in 59 and another in 67 

48
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:27,672
And neither of them came back.

49
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,588
Yeh, that was Smith and a bunch of Frenchman.

50
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:35,066
Yeh, Frenchman, they were amateurs a bunch of jerks.

51
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,837
They never succeded in doing anything.

52
00:05:37,358 --> 00:05:39,128
For us the difficult doesn't exist.

53
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:41,211
The impossible just takes a little more time.

54
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,106
We have Felipe our guide.

55
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:49,855
All right, gentlemen, are you ready?

56
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,540
Those are the last pictures we have of them.

57
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:02,248
Two months have passed since they were last heard from.

58
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,393
Are you still alive?

59
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,684
And if you so where are they?

60
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,392
These are the questions that the rescue team sponsored by

61
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,725
New York University and the Pan American Broadcasting System.

62
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:13,703
...hope to be able to answer.

63
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,598
Thank you for accepting Professor
Monroe. Good luck

64
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,285
Professor Harold Monroe, NYU's noted anthropologist.

65
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,825
Has taken part in various expiditions exploring primitive cultures.

66
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:30,054
But this will be his first journey into Amazonea

67
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:40,504
Here you are Lieutenant ...

68
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,751
Well Professor Monroe...Do you think you can turn that 

69
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,147
Thanks... All I can say is that your...

70
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:58,416
Anthropologists and missionaries, are made out of special stuff.

71
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,916
If hell holes like this didn't exist

72
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm sure you would invent one.

73
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,082
Where as I'd give both my ???

74
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:07,685
well let's say I'd give anything to be somewhere else.

75
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,351
Look, Lieutenant.

76
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:12,059
I'll be as little trouble as possible, it's just...

77
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,038
I'm sure you got enough problems of your own.

78
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:16,121
I'll have to be honest with you...

79
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:17,579
No, no thanks...

80
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:21,432
I need your help in organizing your expedition.

81
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,994
How can I refuse.

82
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,806
You have been recommended by everybody.

83
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,930
Only a sure guarantee that you'll

84
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:31,117
still be breathing when you return

85
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:37,158
Look, I know this is not  going to be a picnic, believe me.

86
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,657
This is not my first trip into bush.

87
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,198
A skunk must of pissed that...

88
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:51,009
Lieutenant ...

89
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:55,487
This lighter belonged to Faye Daniels' 

90
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:59,340
Come with me, Professor. I'll introduce you to your guide

91
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:02,568
He's the best there is, if you can get along with him

92
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,045
Chaco Hey! This professor of Monroe.

93
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:18,086
Hello ... Nice to meet you.
Lieutenant here was telling me...

94
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,481
What a excellent guide you are.

95
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,460
You gonna take all of this with you in the jungle?

96
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:26,001
Yes, well forget it. We gonna need some weapons...

97
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,188
some amunition plus some medicine

98
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:29,646
that's all we need

99
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,937
I already told your friends.

100
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,853
The more you carry, the quiker you get tired...

101
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:36,311
the sooner you die.

102
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,498
Alright,alright...

103
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,685
All I wanna know Mr. Chaco is

104
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,434
do we have a chance of finding them alive?

105
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,829
Who's to say?

106
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,016
The only thing I know, is were gonna risk our lives to

107
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,682
save those fuckers...Let's go

108
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,556
Great warriors, these Yacumos!

109
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,264
They're afraid of know one except the Tree People.

110
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,492
No white man has ever seen them

111
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,512
Or the ones who have, never lived to tell.

112
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:12,552
Did you see this?

113
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:15,052
The sacred scar of Ateri

114
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:18,801
That's what is is. a son of a shaman.

115
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:21,300
and he's been concicrated to the spirit of the jaguar

116
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:24,529
Which also explains what they were doing this far from home.

117
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,779
What do you mean?

118
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:29,528
They were caught, yet they are not really cannibals.

119
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,880
To chase evil spirits outta the jungle 

120
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:38,484
White men's spirits

121
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:10,977
Come on, Professor ...

122
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,893
Quit worrying Yacumo!

123
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,600
You can't aford to waist your strength helping that savage.

124
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,536
He'll out live all of us!

125
00:15:44,302 --> 00:15:45,656
Can you make it?

126
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,259
will have to wade across.

127
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,341
But there's no piranhas here.

128
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:56,695
Come on!

129
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,214
Come on...come on...

130
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,984
There may not be any Piranhas

131
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:11,275
but there is always a few hungry cavemen around.

132
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,188
Leeches!

133
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,037
Leave that shit alone.

134
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,120
He can't do it by himself and there's three of us here..

135
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,098
Why can't we help him? Don't try this again Proffessor.

136
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:59,181
Here, we do as I say, and this bastard...

137
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,993
needs to know who is the strongest.

138
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:04,076
Chaco justified, Senior. This guy is completely
full of hate.

139
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,575
Soon as you don't look, this guy will slit your throat.

140
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:30,320
They went this way. Yacumo eat here
A pit dug for.

141
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,131
And what does this mean?

142
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,359
We're following the same trail, right? Right.

143
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:04,153
Hey, Professor!

144
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,131
I recognize these teeth.

145
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:08,110
This is Felipe Ocana.

146
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,818
He knew the jungle as well as I do.

147
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,150
That makes me feel terrific.

148
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:16,650
I wonder what was his mistake?

149
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:28,730
See that? We're near his village, he can already smell his home.

150
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,750
Mira!

151
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,666
Here comes dinner...

152
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,500
Hey. Mira!

153
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:36,541
A vole!

154
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,832
Today we eat meat, Ok?

155
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:44,039
This is Miguel ... hurry up I'm hungry

156
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,681
It's dying that's for sure...

157
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,847
Hey, Chaco, what in the hell are you doing?

158
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,513
it's for our Yacumo friend.

159
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,075
A little bit of this stuff

160
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,303
and he'll forget all about trying to run away tonight.

161
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:15,282
Atalaka, catra!

162
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:24,447
This will make you very happy, just wait and see.

163
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,217
Drug addicts in the jungle.

164
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,528
hey, give him some of this.

165
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,299
A little muskrat stomach.

166
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,173
He'll love it.

167
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:41,630
You like that? Eat it it's all yours, go on stuff yourself.

168
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:36,930
What the hell is that?

169
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:42,471
I swear, that looks like a ritualistic punishment for adultery. That's what it is.

170
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:50,240
Just sit back and enjoy the show, because afterwards he's gonna take us to the village.

171
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,245
Don't be a fool!

172
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,223
Come on, Professor!

173
00:23:57,211 --> 00:24:00,335
That punishment is  considered a divine comandment.

174
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,459
If he had not killed her. The tribe would have killed him.

175
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,646
Here he comes!

176
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:20,539
Follow him!

177
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:31,265
it's know masterpiece but, it'll do.

178
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:35,327
Please let me try Chaco, please let me try...

179
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:37,097
Ok, is it possible that this way that don't know..

180
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:40,118
How many of us there are until we talk with them?

181
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:41,784
Miquel not learn fast?

182
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:44,596
Terrific, just terrific!

183
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:55,218
They're coming ..

184
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:57,093
Where?
I do not see a thing

185
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:58,759
Don't worry, they are there ..

186
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,467
I know they are there, but
Where?!
I do not see anything.

187
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,341
Come on, let's send out our ambassador.

188
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:04,904
Andale, Miquel.

189
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,944
Mierda una Buena Suerte!

190
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,235
Andale, muchacho ...

191
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:46,457
We 'may be in trouble ....

192
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:49,373
Good you've raised deductive reasoning to an art.

193
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,310
Instinct ...

194
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:53,747
Something says your friends have made quite a mess of things.

195
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:01,766
Wait!

196
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:06,973
If Miquel pulls this off, I swear
I'll buy him a bottle of whiskey.

197
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:21,240
This is suppose to demonstrate they're good intentions.

198
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,780
There, their going to show themselves now.

199
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,086
Where the hell are you going? 

200
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,960
They're going to lead you into an ambush.

201
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:03,835
No, this is a sign of a good professor.

202
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,813
You could a fooled me...

203
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:08,209
They just want to show us they are brave warriors.

204
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,604
They want us to follow them to the village.

205
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,854
Follow them?

206
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,666
Ya, to return the prisoner and to talk.

207
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,332
Listen, I do not know about this.

208
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,727
I think they want us for dinner tonight.

209
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,217
Chaco ...

210
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:07,883
Pretend you've seen nothing.

211
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:11,111
OK.

212
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:26,823
Friends shot him.

213
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:29,427
Let's hope he doesn't die from ????

214
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:30,989
Get busy, Miquel!

215
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:07,855
Breath easy it's alright now, Professor.

216
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:26,184
Kimnamma ...

217
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:28,267
Cheers, Professor ...

218
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,600
You now have the honor of drinking Hisimo

219
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:36,703
Yes.

220
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,321
The group we are looking for...

221
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:09,612
Is probably headed for the center of the jungle.

222
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,487
or the center of the Matos.

223
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:13,986
No white man has ever seen before.

224
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:19,818
This area is under the domination of two cannibal tribes.

225
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,734
They are so fierce, they are feared by all of the tribes in the area.

226
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:26,067
Including the tough courageous warriors of the Yacumo Tribe.

227
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:28,254
These are the two super powers of the Green Inferno.

228
00:31:28,358 --> 00:31:30,128
Perpecually at war with each other.

229
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:31,899
The Yamamomo or Tree People.

230
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:35,648
and Shamatari, or Swamp People.

231
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,418
Each considers the other fair game.

232
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:38,251
Hunted...

233
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,022
Then eatin.

234
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:43,354
This will keep you high and dry.

235
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:44,604
No, thanks.

236
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,457
Yacumo blame the Alan Yates' crew..

237
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:50,228
...for the great calamity...

238
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:52,102
exactly what happened remains a mystery.

239
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:54,810
Only know the four whites picked up and moved on...

240
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:56,164
Hey! Shut up!

241
00:31:57,934 --> 00:31:59,392
God, we're in the middle of a hunt.

242
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:00,330
tree people or both?

243
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:03,037
Both hunting each other...let's get going.

244
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,954
Despite the fact that are intervention saved them from the Shamatari 

245
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:08,724
The Tree People

246
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,432
Although they welcomed us into there territory

247
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,515
continue to behave strangly towards us.

248
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,222
With a mixture of fear and distrust.

249
00:35:17,472 --> 00:35:19,971
Never the less we've been permitted to observe the execution..

250
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,992
of one of the warriors. Death by mutilation.

251
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:25,491
Criminal ??? the Chief

252
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:37,363
Criminal for the way he was detroyed.

253
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,175
Must have done something horrible to incur the wrath of his own people.

254
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,508
It is not clear whether it was to pay a debt of honor towards us...

255
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,320
or only to demonstrate how they dispence justice?

256
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:48,819
Careful, they're referring to us...

257
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,416
We weren't able to get anything out of the Yamamomo.

258
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,707
Except for the wristwatch they gave us.

259
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,582
as a token of the gratitude to a ally

260
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,873
In our eye, they continue to fear and mistrust.

261
00:36:29,122 --> 00:36:31,726
So I decided to try a experiment in psychology.

262
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,496
to strip myself completely

263
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:37,870
Clothes, weapons, dogtags, rings everything to become like them...

264
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,849
Naked and unfettered as Adam.

265
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,445
The Tree People would not let us bury the ghastly remains.

266
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,049
 they had painted ochre

267
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:50,028
To drive away the evil spirits which the dead represented.

268
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:52,423
Once again I ask myself

269
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:56,693
What unspeakable crime could have called for such attrocious retribution.

270
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:58,672
I know are lives are hanging by a thread.

271
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,483
But I can't turn back without at least trying to recover

272
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:04,087
the footage Allen Yates and the others paid for with they're lives.

273
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:07,628
I'm thinking of the enormous human and scientific

274
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:09,919
interest it's going to contain.

275
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,689
I must do something.

276
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,501
Chaco and Miguel can't possibly understand this.

277
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:18,355
Yet, I must somehow gain the confidence of these savages.

278
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:21,791
Afterall, they to have rules of conduct.

279
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:29,706
Hold it.

280
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,580
You did it, God damn it!

281
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:06,871
They just invited us to dinner.

282
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:33,910
By some incredible act of God

283
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,466
they hadn't tried to open it.

284
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,645
Hoping the climate hadn't damaged it to much

285
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,824
And so in exchange for the tape recorder.

286
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,938
The Cannibal chief let you take away the cans of film. Is that it?

287
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,909
Yes, they thought since I was capable of capturing the human voice

288
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,985
that I was also capable of capturing their spirit. This convinced them...

289
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:51,136
that I was the only one capable of capturing there spirit.

290
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,494
This convinced them that I was the only one capable of breaking the evil spell

291
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,363
That had been cast over the Tribe...

292
00:42:57,466 --> 00:42:59,437
...by the murder of the whites...

293
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,928
Of course, they had no inclin of what was really in those cans.

294
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:04,730
How could you explain what a movie is

295
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,013
They just felt they were a threat.

296
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,777
Why do you say threat?

297
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:10,541
Well the Yamamomo's understood how important

298
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:14,070
these film cans were to Alan Yates' crew

299
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:16,871
They thought these silver boxes contain power

300
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:19,050
The power which I must say again...

301
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:22,060
Caused much damage and violence.

302
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:24,757
A fantastic story. Thank you, Professor
Monroe.

303
00:43:25,277 --> 00:43:26,626
Your very welcome.

304
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:31,191
As we conclude this special interview

305
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:34,513
We would like to remind you Wednsday at 9pm

306
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:35,653
here on Pantheon.

307
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:38,871
Will be presenting Part 1 of The Green Inferno.

308
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:42,087
The dramatic film testimony, of a extrodinary adventure...

309
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:46,031
...that took them all the way back to the stone age.

310
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:49,144
And you would be the ideal Host of the program?

311
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:50,285
That's right.

312
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:51,634
Professor Monroe,

313
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:55,163
as a eye witness as well as a scientist, you would be the most...

314
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:55,993
Yes

315
00:43:56,096 --> 00:43:58,898
But before I make any decisions

316
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:00,974
I'd like to review all the film material.

317
00:44:01,077 --> 00:44:02,634
As of yet we've seen none of it.

318
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:06,162
Professor Monroe, I can assure you...

319
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:08,238
that they know exactly what they want.

320
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:10,002
That maybe...

321
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:11,870
But mean while their all dead, aren't they?

322
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,814
Which is exactly why we have to let the public know the truth.

323
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,577
Will let the people be the judge.

324
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:21,002
Better yet, will let the people who knew them best be the judge.

325
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:23,388
Their parents, their wives...

326
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:26,501
This is a documentry they shot for us...

327
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,577
...about a year and a half ago.

328
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,549
Can I start?
- Yes, please do.

329
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,160
Pretty powerful stuff 

330
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,307
Well just to give you an idea how Allen and the others worked.

331
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,496
Everything that you just saw was important.

332
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:14,185
You mean this was...That was no enemy army...

333
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,936
Allen paid those soldiers to do a bit of acting.

334
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:21,583
You'll have to excuse me now. I'll join you later.

335
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,354
Yes, thank you.

336
00:46:24,293 --> 00:46:26,064
Shall I go ahead?

337
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:28,668
Yes...

338
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:35,962
This is Jack ...

339
00:46:39,193 --> 00:46:40,443
Faye ...

340
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:42,735
Allen...

341
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:47,423
and this is Mark ...

342
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:50,446
They have worked together for years.

343
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,009
They were terrible prima donna

344
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:54,405
I have to admit they were real pros

345
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:57,635
The stuff they shot could really gut punch you.

346
00:46:57,635 --> 00:46:58,885
Yes I can imagine.

347
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:02,221
There ratings were fantastic.

348
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:03,574
Higher than most of the big comics.

349
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,450
And they know how to play a audeince

350
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,597
Allan especially

351
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,785
Look at this bit they shot before leaving.

352
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:11,493
Yes, were coming back anyway...we got Felipe our guide

353
00:47:11,597 --> 00:47:16,599
Come on up here...

354
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,579
Yes there we go ok...

355
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:23,789
This shots dark because the diaphrams

356
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:26,394
...setting on the camera was wrong.

357
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,145
There not hes got it right.

358
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:45,149
Forget it.

359
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:47,442
There's no electricity where were going

360
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:51,609
Nope, this is anything but a well organized

361
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,694
...safari with all the comforts.

362
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:56,195
Weapons...

363
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:57,966
Camera ....

364
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:00,675
medicinal supplies.
That's about it!

365
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,114
Will be covering hundreds of miles on foot.

366
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:07,552
And that's another thing...

367
00:48:07,656 --> 00:48:10,054
Who knows when will have another shower.

368
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:14,534
Of course I don't think Faye will have any problem...

369
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:16,409
remaining the sexiest  script girl in history.

370
00:48:18,806 --> 00:48:21,306
Are you really shooting! Jerk...

371
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:22,557
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

372
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:25,371
Has anyone seen my pants anywhere?

373
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:27,871
What do you want those for?

374
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,267
I put my head, Stupid...

375
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:32,456
I thought ever since Jack took them off two years ago...

376
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:34,124
You do not need them anymore.

377
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:35,686
Right, Mark?

378
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,248
That's right!
You idiot.

379
00:48:38,186 --> 00:48:38,916
Knock it off...

380
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,041
Are you shooting again?

381
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:44,230
You idiot.

382
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:46,939
Crew of clowns.

383
00:48:47,252 --> 00:48:49,127
They had a great sense of the theatrical.

384
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:49,960
Like I said ...

385
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,733
Real proffessionals...

386
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:58,818
What was I saying, Professor?

387
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:03,089
I tried working with Allan a couple times

388
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:04,654
...and I just couldn't handle it.

389
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:08,716
You know he pushed his people to the limit...

390
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,530
Demanding everything including blood.

391
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,405
And talk about paranoia.

392
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:17,886
God have mercy on his soul.
He was one ruthless son of a bitch.

393
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,949
... I feel we have a duty to tell the public the story Mr. Yates.

394
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,204
You know I really appreciate your coming.

395
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,392
You're the first person to come...

396
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:37,580
...and talk to me about Allan and what happened.

397
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,539
What I'd like to know proffessor is

398
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:44,144
What happened to my son?

399
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,019
Tell me?

400
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,562
Faye - no, it was not her real name.

401
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,958
she always wanted to be an actress

402
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:53,522
her real name was Tina.

403
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,189
Excuse me a minute.

404
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,002
Children, look I'm just going to be

405
00:49:58,107 --> 00:50:01,754
...speaking with this man a minute. and then will play ok.

406
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:07,484
As you can tell we're very different in our characters.

407
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,922
but Tina, very energetic.

408
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:12,694
Very hard working...

409
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:16,028
very ambitious,
extremely ambitious.

410
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,904
I use to say to her

411
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:21,551
Do you ever think you'll be at peace with yourself?

412
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:22,905
Anyway ...

413
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:26,240
Now she is...God rest her soul.

414
00:50:26,344 --> 00:50:28,532
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

415
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:31,033
Excuse me, Ms. Anders,

416
00:50:31,241 --> 00:50:32,284
...just two minutes.

417
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,951
How did you feel about Jack?

418
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,660
What's the use. What I'm I suppose to say about Jack?

419
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,223
After two years of marriage...

420
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,619
I was with him for just four months.

421
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:42,911
What are you doing?

422
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:44,579
I'll See ya.

423
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:50,310
He was always on assignments.
India, Asia, Africa.

424
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,458
Ya sure he was good in bed. But, he liked to eat too.

425
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:58,438
No brains though

426
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,729
To easily influenced ...

427
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,585
Alan was his god you know...

428
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:06,252
You know what I mean?

429
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:10,524
You guys think I can get any bread out of this.

430
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,546
Mr. Tomaso

431
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,421
Mr. Tomaso, please ...

432
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,861
I just want to ask you one question about your son.

433
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,110
Ya what do ya wanna ask me?

434
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,341
Look, your son was of special importance to the news world.

435
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:25,320
Can you tell me something about him?

436
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:27,091
My son, my son was no good.

437
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:28,863
He doesn't work he doesn't go to school.

438
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:30,738
Wants to lay around the house all day.

439
00:51:30,738 --> 00:51:33,238
He's no good period! Now that's it....

440
00:51:33,238 --> 00:51:34,907
Now I gotta go back to my job.

441
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:36,365
Don't bother me no more!

442
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,554
But Mr. Tomaso, please, your son was very well known.

443
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,637
By a lot of people...just one question.

444
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:42,096
OK, just one ..

445
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:45,743
About your son what kind of man was he?

446
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,723
My son, my son was a son of a bitch.

447
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:49,077
And he was no good.

448
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:50,640
That's it, my son is dead!

449
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,516
I don't wanna talk about him no more.

450
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,183
Now leave me alone!
Good Bye.

451
00:51:54,287 --> 00:51:56,684
Mr. Tomaso, millions of Americans ...

452
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:58,142
Mr. Tomaso, please ...!

453
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:00,257
Why didn't they print the whole thing?

454
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,432
the negative needed special treatment.

455
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,985
because of the humidity

456
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:06,574
The quality isn't the best, but its pretty good

457
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:09,164
considering the lousy conditions they were shooting in.

458
00:52:09,164 --> 00:52:11,132
Unfortunately two reels were light fault.

459
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:12,685
we had to throw them out.

460
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:14,238
I put a piece of black leder between

461
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:15,585
one sequence and another.

462
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:18,278
Good, that's were will put the interviews with the families.

463
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:20,557
...and the one in which you talk about your search for them.

464
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,007
Go ahead Bill.

465
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:29,048
... This first segment is silent.

466
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:46,344
Evedently they always didn't use the mics.

467
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:47,898
though they were attached right to the camera.

468
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,487
just above the lens, the gun barrel see?

469
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:55,355
... Remember this is a very rough cut.

470
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:56,908
Almost like watching ???

471
00:52:57,012 --> 00:52:59,497
alot of this stuff will be thrown out in the actual editing.

472
00:52:59,602 --> 00:53:02,087
Here we are there should be some sound coming in now.

473
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,537
No, no, not yet.

474
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,780
Here ...

475
00:53:11,408 --> 00:53:12,547
Felipe ...

476
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:46,414
We've been walking for six days in this marvelous air.

477
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:50,246
Today is Saturday the 25th

478
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:55,528
If I were in New York, I'd probably be out shopping.

479
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:14,688
Get the camera.

480
00:54:22,144 --> 00:54:23,284
Damn thing.

481
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,365
Wait, wait, wait ...

482
00:57:53,296 --> 00:57:55,067
How much of the material is without sound?

483
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:56,526
Less than half.

484
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,547
Every so often I laid in some stock music.

485
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,151
...to juice things up...

486
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:06,736
What is it?

487
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,403
The Yacumos passed this way

488
00:58:08,508 --> 00:58:10,278
We not far from the village.

489
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:19,656
Move away!

490
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,531
Jack, get the shot!

491
00:58:21,636 --> 00:58:26,741
This is fucking dangerous.
Shut the fuck up!

492
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:51,955
Look at it...

493
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:56,331
We've been walking through the jungle for days.

494
00:58:56,435 --> 00:58:59,770
With the feeling we're moving in circles.

495
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:03,104
At night we have to sleep in the trees, so we don't get bit by...

496
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,604
...the snakes or spiders.

497
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,669
Felipe, are guide claims we're near the big river.

498
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,335
Where the Yacumos live in the village.

499
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:14,149
Look at my foot!
Damn forest.

500
00:59:19,774 --> 00:59:21,753
Allen do you want some tea?

501
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:27,172
 Ahhh!!! Puta! Puta!

502
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,090
... Cut my leg

503
00:59:31,027 --> 00:59:32,381
.... Cut my leg!

504
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,360
Puta!

505
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,237
Kill the leg

506
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,737
Grab the leg...

507
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:43,009
Hold him down...

508
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:45,614
My God...Jesus Christ

509
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:47,802
Cut my leg

510
00:59:48,947 --> 00:59:51,865
Cut it off! Come on put it on the fire...

511
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,428
Come on, do it.

512
00:59:56,762 --> 00:59:57,387
Are you still shooting? Ya...

513
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,409
Do it now...I'm gettin' all...

514
01:00:00,826 --> 01:00:01,764
Do it!

515
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:49,067
Felipe was a great buddy and a top-notch guy.

516
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,047
Will miss him.

517
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,859
But even more will miss the security he gave us.

518
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,715
We decided to go on.

519
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,277
But we've only got the compass...

520
01:00:59,277 --> 01:01:01,361
...and our insticts to show the way...

521
01:01:06,987 --> 01:01:08,134
Panning to you Allen

522
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:12,093
Faye, give us some earth shattering

523
01:01:12,093 --> 01:01:14,281
You know this is gonna make us famous.

524
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:16,364
You think so?
How famous?

525
01:01:16,782 --> 01:01:19,177
Real famous and real rich.

526
01:01:19,282 --> 01:01:20,324
What you going do with your money?

527
01:01:20,428 --> 01:01:22,095
Gonna by a house...
and a piece a ass...

528
01:01:23,242 --> 01:01:23,971
Do you think this is funny?

529
01:01:24,075 --> 01:01:26,367
Think that's funny Uh?
Ya that's the only way you can get it.

530
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:26,889
Where's Faye?

531
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:29,910
I don't know.
Turn the camera off, will you.

532
01:01:41,788 --> 01:01:43,350
Christ, what's taking you so long?

533
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:47,310
Well, I had to wait in line with the rest of the animals.

534
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:48,769
You're disgusting!

535
01:01:49,184 --> 01:01:51,998
Ha get outta here..
I said get outta here with the camera.

536
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:53,041
Hey, I just want a little peak.

537
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,229
Will you get outta here!

538
01:01:55,437 --> 01:01:58,562
I told you to turn the goddamn thing off.

539
01:01:58,562 --> 01:01:59,291
I'll get you...

540
01:02:08,044 --> 01:02:10,440
Come on push

541
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:20,859
Look there's a gator.

542
01:02:20,964 --> 01:02:22,005
Get out of the water.

543
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,464
No, no, forget about me.

544
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:25,027
Film it, film it...

545
01:02:27,006 --> 01:02:29,298
Come on, get on the raft you guys.

546
01:02:31,592 --> 01:02:32,425
Snake!

547
01:02:36,592 --> 01:02:37,426
Were saved...

548
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,885
Anakondadan

549
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,177
Saved from the jaws of death.

550
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:11,168
Come on...

551
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:30,400
I wonder where there village is?

552
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,760
Just shoot in the air
and follow them...

553
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:35,104
And when they scatter how we gonna get there?

554
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:27,259
No, wait.

555
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:31,754
I know what I'm doing.

556
01:04:31,963 --> 01:04:32,695
Don't you get it?

557
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:35,308
We can never keep up with them.

558
01:04:35,308 --> 01:04:36,981
This way that buck will go slow enough...

559
01:04:37,085 --> 01:04:38,548
...to take us right to the village.

560
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,650
Well, what do you think Proffessor?

561
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,650
It's not the best way of establishing peace with the Yacumo tribe.

562
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:48,056
I'm beginning to understand...

563
01:04:48,162 --> 01:04:49,737
...why they greeted us with such hostility.

564
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:50,786
Do you think this is bad. This is nothing.

565
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:53,305
Allan did much worse.
Just watch.

566
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,201
They could play it rough when they thought they had too.

567
01:05:06,304 --> 01:05:09,415
remeber how they set up some of those excutions.

568
01:06:14,225 --> 01:06:15,054
Faye!

569
01:06:53,526 --> 01:06:56,016
Here we are at the end of the world in human history.

570
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:58,710
Things like this happen all the time in the jungle.

571
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,162
It's survival of the fittest.

572
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:05,866
In the jungle it's the daily violence of the strong overcoming the weak.

573
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:07,939
Jack!

574
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:23,286
Let's do it!

575
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:41,329
Jack a torch.

576
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:50,766
Ready!

577
01:07:51,078 --> 01:07:51,803
OK!

578
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,055
The massacre of the Yacumos by the Yamamamos.

579
01:07:56,988 --> 01:07:59,062
A set-up...all a set-up!

580
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:00,929
Get this fucker.

581
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,899
right

582
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:09,742
That's it.

583
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,792
Keep them inside.

584
01:08:35,874 --> 01:08:37,118
Get in, Get in.

585
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:49,252
Get em' back inside.

586
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:57,547
It's beautiful.

587
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,073
Alan!
Here!

588
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:45,927
Show them how we do it.

589
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,054
Oh, you motherfucker.

590
01:12:46,473 --> 01:12:48,456
Get the fuck outta here.

591
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:49,709
Do you believe this?

592
01:12:49,813 --> 01:12:52,527
You fuckin' turkey.

593
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:57,100
I'm drained.

594
01:12:57,436 --> 01:12:59,316
You must admit it's acceptional footage.

595
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:06,850
I didn't expect such impact and exceptional footage.

596
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:07,891
I don't think exceptional is the right word.

597
01:13:07,995 --> 01:13:10,287
You don't?

598
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:11,745
No

599
01:13:12,682 --> 01:13:15,598
what's exceptional about a primitive tribe like the Yacumos being terrorized...

600
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:19,555
...and forced to do something that don't normally do?

601
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:21,117
Come on Proffessor, 

602
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:22,992
Let's be realistic

603
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:24,658
Who knows anything about the Yacumo civilization?

604
01:13:24,762 --> 01:13:27,783
Today people want sensationalism..

605
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:30,074
The more you rape there senses the happier they are.

606
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:32,990
Oh yes, the typical western thought.

607
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:36,114
Civilized that what Allen thought and that's why he's dead.

608
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:38,197
The Yacumo Indian is a primitive...

609
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:40,696
...and he needs to be respected as such.

610
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,675
did you ever think from the Yacumo point of view...

611
01:13:42,883 --> 01:13:44,654
that we might be the ones that are savages?

612
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,100
Well, I never thought of it that way.

613
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:49,035
But it's an interesting idea...Yes

614
01:13:49,139 --> 01:13:51,747
Let's say things are reversed, right.

615
01:13:51,747 --> 01:13:53,728
...and the Yacumo attacked your house...

616
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:55,709
...defiled everything you held holy.

617
01:13:55,709 --> 01:13:57,586
You know that pig that was killed?

618
01:13:58,004 --> 01:13:59,672
That was food for those people.

619
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:01,654
What if someone came into your house and you're hungry

620
01:14:01,758 --> 01:14:02,696
...and took the little bit of food you had

621
01:14:02,696 --> 01:14:04,468
...in the fridgerator

622
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:06,450
...and threw it down the toilet

623
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,057
would you behave in a civilized way?

624
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,873
Do you like people to make money off your misery?

625
01:14:13,978 --> 01:14:16,181
We have succeded in establishing....

626
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:19,013
shall we say...diplomatic relations with the Yacumas

627
01:14:19,013 --> 01:14:21,635
But, what are we for them?

628
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:27,090
These are people who have never seen a white man before.

629
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:28,873
...or heard the sound of a gun.

630
01:14:28,977 --> 01:14:31,705
We know they are really afraid of our powers.

631
01:14:31,705 --> 01:14:32,964
But for how long?

632
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:35,691
And can we really be sure they don't hate us, like...

633
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:38,313
...most people hate what that don't understand

634
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:51,845
When the old members of the Tribe feel death approach

635
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:55,516
they wander off to a secluded spot.

636
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:58,139
After she dies this old women

637
01:15:00,972 --> 01:15:05,902
This old women will probably end up as lunch for some alligator.

638
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,831
In the jungle nothing goes to waist...nature recycles everything.

639
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,979
You are about to witness an ancient ritual...

640
01:15:14,084 --> 01:15:15,971
Never before seen by civilized man.

641
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:18,384
The Tribe is a primitive social unit.

642
01:15:18,489 --> 01:15:21,321
Bound together for the basic needs of survival.

643
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:29,608
To protect itself, the tribe must eliminate any diseased elements.

644
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:30,867
Now don't go away.

645
01:15:30,972 --> 01:15:32,440
What your about to see...

646
01:15:32,546 --> 01:15:35,797
...may simply be described as social surgery.

647
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,483
Had a long discussion last night about whether

648
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:52,372
...to keep going or turn back?

649
01:16:53,315 --> 01:16:55,099
Wasn't easy to come to a agreement.

650
01:16:56,882 --> 01:16:59,819
Perhaps we shouldn't push are luck.

651
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:03,071
God knows we've been lucky so far.

652
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:07,371
But you know what finally convinced them?

653
01:17:07,477 --> 01:17:09,574
The chance to become famous.

654
01:17:09,678 --> 01:17:11,777
To reach that spot where...time stopped...

655
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:14,294
...3 or 4 thousand years ago.

656
01:17:15,134 --> 01:17:20,379
Yamomamos the Tree People live in constant strife with their...

657
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:23,106
...enemies the Shamatares 

658
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:25,833
See this guy?

659
01:17:27,092 --> 01:17:29,400
This was a Yamamomo warrior...

660
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,659
....killed by the Yacumos.

661
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:38,316
Just to give you an idea, to the Yacumos this is a savage.

662
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,918
I'm not speaking as a scientist but as a man of the street.

663
01:17:46,918 --> 01:17:50,588
This so called documentry footage is offensive...

664
01:17:50,694 --> 01:17:54,785
...it's dishonest and above all it's inhuman!

665
01:17:54,785 --> 01:17:59,084
Yes, yes, of course...we all know what Allen was like

666
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:00,659
He over did it as usual.

667
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:03,386
But what you saw is a rough cut.

668
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:05,799
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. But I...

669
01:18:05,799 --> 01:18:11,253
...But I refuse to have anything to do with this material.

670
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,513
Look! Professor...

671
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:15,450
We are talking about the most sensational documentry to come along...

672
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:16,918
...in years.

673
01:18:17,023 --> 01:18:20,589
...and you want us to just shelf it forget about it...

674
01:18:20,694 --> 01:18:21,743
As if it had never been found?

675
01:18:21,953 --> 01:18:23,316
Is that what you want?

676
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:26,043
Yes.

677
01:18:26,464 --> 01:18:28,667
Yes, That's precisely what I want.

678
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,022
I've seen the rest of the material, you haven't

679
01:18:32,127 --> 01:18:32,652
You haven't seen the stuff your editors...

680
01:18:32,757 --> 01:18:35,589
...didn't have the stomach to put together.

681
01:18:35,589 --> 01:18:38,631
If you have you wouldn't hestitate to agree with me.

682
01:18:53,947 --> 01:18:55,624
John? Go ahead...

683
01:19:06,247 --> 01:19:07,809
Somewhere in the middle of this Green Inferno

684
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,454
...where no civilized man has been before.

685
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,349
The jungle here's different.

686
01:19:16,453 --> 01:19:18,536
It's almost hospitable.

687
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,118
So far we've seen no sign yet of the Tree People.

688
01:19:23,118 --> 01:19:24,680
The Yanomamos...

689
01:19:26,138 --> 01:19:28,117
Whe're beginning to wonder if they really exist.

690
01:19:28,325 --> 01:19:31,033
Or if they're just a legend.

691
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,362
I think we got one...

692
01:19:53,528 --> 01:19:54,465
Look what we found...

693
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:58,631
Some taste you guys have, she stinks...

694
01:19:59,672 --> 01:20:00,714
She's marked. what do you guys think she is? A Yamomamo?

695
01:20:00,818 --> 01:20:02,484
Or  a Shamatare?

696
01:20:02,484 --> 01:20:04,359
Why don't you ask her?

697
01:20:04,463 --> 01:20:05,921
What do you want to do with her?

698
01:20:06,025 --> 01:20:08,004
Take good care of this little monkey.

699
01:20:08,316 --> 01:20:09,566
Judging from the looks of this girl...

700
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:11,857
We found the Yamomamos Tree People.

701
01:20:11,857 --> 01:20:13,627
We're gonna have to be very careful.

702
01:20:13,836 --> 01:20:16,335
Cause these people our known for their cruel

703
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:19,355
Get her! Come on!! Alright...

704
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:22,584
Alright...I got this little monkey

705
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:24,250
You go first.

706
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:29,353
Oh, drop on her...Oh ya

707
01:20:31,228 --> 01:20:33,519
I can't help it

708
01:20:34,144 --> 01:20:36,018
Oh, go ahead alright...

709
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:46,745
Open!

710
01:20:49,765 --> 01:20:52,785
Jack! What do you want to use for? Porno films? You stupid ass!!!

711
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:54,347
That's not a bad idea...How about jungle Joeys'?

712
01:20:57,263 --> 01:20:59,763
Hey, you want me to keep shooting?

713
01:21:03,304 --> 01:21:04,866
Do you want me to keep shooting or what?

714
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,157
That's a stupid question.

715
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:10,177
Hurry up Casanova it's Jack's turn...Jack's next...

716
01:21:14,863 --> 01:21:16,113
OK Jack...Go ahead...

717
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:22,466
Come on ..

718
01:21:33,505 --> 01:21:36,942
We only have three cans of film left, we can't use this...

719
01:21:37,254 --> 01:21:39,754
Why do you wanna waste it like that? 
Shut Up...

720
01:21:41,837 --> 01:21:43,295
Aren't you gonna get some Allen?

721
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:46,731
The only thing he get's off on is his camera!

722
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,147
Kay, Mark!

723
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:54,542
Stop shooting Mark!

724
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:01,832
Stop it Allen!!!

725
01:22:30,055 --> 01:22:31,200
You Bastard!!! God Damn You!!!!

726
01:22:35,991 --> 01:22:38,178
He's changing reels.

727
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,404
Alright...Hold it tight, tight

728
01:22:52,237 --> 01:22:55,257
Oh, Come in for a close up...

729
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:18,794
Watch it Allen I'm shooting.

730
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:22,751
Oh Good...More.

731
01:23:23,376 --> 01:23:27,125
It's unbelievable..

732
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:28,895
It's horrible...

733
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:32,957
I can't understand the reason for such cruelty?

734
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:38,060
Must have something to do with some obscure sexual rite or

735
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:43,684
...with some profound respect these primitives have for virginity.

736
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,971
You rolling Mark? Ya

737
01:24:05,137 --> 01:24:06,387
Look up there on the right.

738
01:24:08,782 --> 01:24:10,657
Wait they're all around us.

739
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,214
Keep rolling...We're gonna get a Oscar for this.

740
01:24:52,939 --> 01:24:54,605
Jaaack!

741
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,749
Jack! Allan, Allan you can't!!!

742
01:25:00,854 --> 01:25:04,082
Look he's had it anyway..He's still alive you bastard!

743
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:07,935
Unless you can watch,,,get the fuck of me...goddamn it!

744
01:25:20,432 --> 01:25:21,786
Keep filming Mark I'll cover you.

745
01:25:21,786 --> 01:25:24,390
Got it right down to the last foot.

746
01:29:06,943 --> 01:29:08,714
We really srewed ourselves this time.

747
01:29:08,818 --> 01:29:11,213
trying to stay there for the last shot.

748
01:29:11,317 --> 01:29:13,088
I don't even no where we are now.

749
01:29:13,088 --> 01:29:14,025
But, I know that...

750
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:16,837
They followed us...

751
01:29:18,295 --> 01:29:20,065
...and we lost everything trying to escape.

752
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:22,044
We're Screwed! We're Trapped!

753
01:29:24,023 --> 01:29:25,689
I'm gonna try an scare em' away with this.

754
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:26,730
I hope it works.

755
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:32,042
Stay by me, Faye!
Don't get ????

756
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:33,500
Stay over here!

757
01:29:33,604 --> 01:29:34,854
You motherfucker!!!

758
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:36,207
Allan...

759
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:41,935
Allen Save Me! Faye!!!

760
01:29:44,435 --> 01:29:46,934
Allan AHHWW!!! Help Me...

761
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:48,705
She's had it Allen...

762
01:29:49,954 --> 01:29:51,308
We've gotta think of ourselves

763
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:54,016
Take the film back home Allen.

764
01:29:54,537 --> 01:29:55,578
Think of the Film.

765
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:56,515
Save the Film.

766
01:34:16,872 --> 01:34:17,800
John

767
01:34:17,914 --> 01:34:22,142
I want this material burned, all of it.

768
01:34:39,472 --> 01:34:45,720
I wonder who the real cannibals are?

769
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,148
