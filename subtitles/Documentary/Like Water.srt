1
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:34,663
Once, man and those in the water
were linked.

2
00:00:34,872 --> 00:00:37,124
They inspired us.

3
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:39,543
They spoke of the future.

4
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:44,464
Man listened and it became real.

5
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,969
But man does not listen very well.

6
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:54,975
Man 's need to own everything
led him deeper into land.

7
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:58,604
The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean...

8
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:01,148
...and the world of men...

9
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,567
...separated.

10
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:08,071
Through the centuries, their world,
and all the inhabitants of it...

11
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,157
...stopped trying.

12
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:14,453
The world of man became more violent.

13
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:20,500
War upon war played out,
as there were no guides to listen to.

14
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:25,881
Now those in the water
are trying again...

15
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,634
...trying to reach us.

16
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:33,764
A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

17
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:36,642
They are brought in the dead of night...

18
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,187
...to where man lives.

19
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,190
They need only be glimpsed...

20
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:47,152
...and the awakening of man
will happen.

21
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:50,697
But their enemies roam the land.

22
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:54,368
There are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe...

23
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:58,455
...but they are sent
at great risk to their lives.

24
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:00,457
Many...

25
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,626
...do not return.

26
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:08,340
Yet still they try...

27
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:11,552
...try to help man.

28
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:18,475
But man may have
forgotten how to listen.

29
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,287
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

30
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:47,087
Well, it's some kind
of a b... B... B... Bug.

31
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:49,256
It's very big.

32
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,050
It's very hairy.

33
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:01,101
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

34
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,603
Tell her it's not a creature.

35
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,981
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

36
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:07,774
You...

37
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:10,527
You might wanna turn away.

38
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,835
Sorry this is taking so long.

39
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,643
It's over. It's over.

40
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,687
It's... It's safe.

41
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:56,823
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

42
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,622
Mr. Farber?

43
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:06,708
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

44
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,086
Mr. Heep!

45
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,426
You are new tenant?

46
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:20,097
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

47
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,725
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

48
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:27,271
She's a student at the university.

49
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:30,190
Young-Soon, you don't know...

50
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:34,111
...who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

51
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,572
No, Mr. Heep.

52
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,950
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

53
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:41,743
You're welcome.

54
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,164
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

55
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:51,378
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

56
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,924
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

57
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:59,595
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

58
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,139
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

59
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,557
No.

60
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,935
- Those bubbles make the water very slick.
- No.

61
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,566
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

62
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,403
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

63
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:21,408
I hear sp... Sp... Sp...
Splashing some nights.

64
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,621
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

65
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:38,217
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

66
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:40,969
I could give you a vein like that.

67
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:44,806
I could make it look just like this. Right?

68
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,768
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

69
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,812
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

70
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,651
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

71
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:04,034
This morning I measured my bicep.

72
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:08,455
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

73
00:06:08,622 --> 00:06:10,207
Look at that.

74
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,668
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

75
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,545
- Hello, Reggie.
- Hey.

76
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:17,172
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

77
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,133
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

78
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,928
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F...

79
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:25,430
Here we go. Come on.

80
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:31,019
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

81
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,480
- Okay.
- All right.

82
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:38,026
Just... People might trip.

83
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:39,236
All right.

84
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:42,364
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

85
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,783
He's working out
only one side of his body.

86
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,703
Did he...? Did he tell you that?

87
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,746
- Be inside within minutes.

88
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,164
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

89
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:55,043
Those soldiers are only now beginning to
wonder how long they'll end up staying.

90
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,173
If this does come to combat, we will not
be in the battle for the sake of the battle.

91
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:00,924
He's been here f... F... Forever.

92
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,510
- Will not be reached any other way.

93
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:09,641
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

94
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:15,856
- He... Not just because he died.
- There's a bunch of people better.

95
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,525
- Name four people better.
- Name one better than Fred.

96
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:23,113
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

97
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,241
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon... Jon Bon Jovi.

98
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:27,576
What? Are you...?

99
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,411
This is you.

100
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,253
There's no smoking inside.

101
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:43,050
And there's no swimming after 7.

102
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:51,016
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

103
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:54,353
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

104
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,522
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

105
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:01,026
- They did.
- Well, you must be very good.

106
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,755
Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.

107
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:25,926
I smell something awful
coming from the upstairs apartment.

108
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:31,348
I think someone may have died
and the body is decomposing.

109
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,893
I know I said this last week, but...

110
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:49,157
Not everyone here
spent Sunday practicing for war.

111
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:53,370
At Sunday church services,
chaplains rallied the troops.

112
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:56,081
For these Marines,
a moment for prayer...

113
00:08:56,248 --> 00:09:01,837
...at a service that many here believe
will be their last before going to war.

114
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:07,176
U.S. Forces predicted today the enemy,
estimated at 3 to 4000...

115
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:09,011
...may be willing...

116
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,103
- a major... A major confrontation.

117
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,025
At the same time, the U.S. Military
will be fighting a propaganda war.

118
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:27,029
If there were a silver bullet,
we would've shot that a long time ago.

119
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:31,468
Hey! I saw you!

120
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:33,762
I saw you!

121
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:41,103
Come out of that pool right now!

122
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,814
Hey!

123
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,986
I'm gonna wait.

124
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:54,366
Hey.

125
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,455
Hey.

126
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:07,212
Come on out, now. It's...

127
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,924
It's... It's not safe.

128
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,221
Come on out. This is not f...

129
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,057
This is not funny.

130
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,274
Please sto...

131
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,387
God.

132
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:05,539
Did you pull me out?

133
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,798
Where are you from?

134
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,259
The Blue World.

135
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,761
Is that an apartment?

136
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,640
Do you feel an awakening?

137
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,268
I'm sorry?

138
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,897
It will feel like pins and needles...

139
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,482
...inside.

140
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,614
It is not you.

141
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:46,872
It's late.

142
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:49,416
You really...

143
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,296
You shouldn't be here.

144
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:59,176
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

145
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:01,053
My name is Story.

146
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,388
I didn't mean for you to tell...

147
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,188
Why am I not stuttering?

148
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:12,814
What?

149
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,074
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

150
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,201
"From the cliffs."

151
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,329
That is what your name means.

152
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,331
Where did you learn that?

153
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,416
From my studies.

154
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:38,715
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

155
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,678
I am scared.

156
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:47,224
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

157
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,269
Why are you scared?

158
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,410
You can wait here for a little bit...

159
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:09,204
...until you feel not so scared.

160
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,210
Are you okay?

161
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,179
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

162
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,783
Hello.

163
00:15:56,877 --> 00:16:02,132
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

164
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,808
Okay.

165
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:14,520
I think you need some fresh air.

166
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,855
I'm just gonna take you outside.

167
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:19,316
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

168
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,860
I'm gonna get you some coffee...

169
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,279
...and then you can wake up.

170
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,866
Then I'll walk you home.

171
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,461
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

172
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:44,049
- Narf.
- What?

173
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,849
Okay. Come on.

174
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,892
Here we go.

175
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,865
Okay.

176
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:29,780
It was sort of h... H... Hairy, but...
But matted, like clumps. You know?

177
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,658
And it was kind of g... Green.

178
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,785
- You say green?
- Yeah.

179
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:38,455
I thought so. Matted is... Is not right.

180
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:43,961
It was f... F... Flat, and...
And thicker than hair.

181
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:49,466
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

182
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:54,930
- And... Is this not helping you at all?
- Forget about its hair for a second.

183
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,934
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

184
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:01,687
- What, was it a Great Dane?
- No, no, no. No, sir.

185
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:05,858
I mean, are there any w... W...
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

186
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,570
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

187
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,450
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

188
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:18,829
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

189
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:21,248
An animal that size,
the one you're describing...

190
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,208
...doesn't walk around and not be seen.

191
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,128
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

192
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:37,681
Cleveland.

193
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,825
Hey.

194
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,370
Got a lot of homework, huh?

195
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:44,039
University gives many pages of reading.

196
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:47,042
What they think, I have no social life?

197
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,045
I got more books for you.

198
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:54,174
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

199
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:59,012
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

200
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,389
I do not remember it.

201
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,517
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

202
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:06,228
A b... B... B...

203
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,565
Bedtime story?

204
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,650
What's the story?

205
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,862
I do not remember.

206
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:19,074
How about your mother?

207
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:33,547
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

208
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:42,181
She wants to know
who told you this word.

209
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:46,935
Oh, j... Just a friend. I don't...
I don't... I don't know her very well.

210
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:53,483
She said that her grandmother...

211
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,781
...used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

212
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:06,580
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

213
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,540
Saw one what?

214
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:16,924
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

215
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:24,014
I s... What...
What happens in the story, please?

216
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,982
No. Mrs...

217
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,742
In the bedtime story...

218
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:49,331
...she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

219
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,507
This person is called the vessel.

220
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:03,762
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

221
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,890
If she's successful in this...

222
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:14,106
...she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle...

223
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:16,692
...and become free.

224
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,320
She won't tell me more.

225
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,408
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

226
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:40,591
Story?

227
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,386
Story?

228
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:49,057
Cleveland.

229
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:58,025
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

230
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:14,416
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

231
00:24:18,462 --> 00:24:21,798
Is somebody supposed to see you?

232
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:27,596
Is...?

233
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:31,975
L...

234
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,316
It is a writer.

235
00:24:45,822 --> 00:24:47,866
Do you know his name?

236
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,332
Do you know what he looks like?

237
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,840
Do you know if it's a...?
A woman or a man?

238
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,472
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

239
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:21,525
Is this person
writing something important?

240
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,367
When do you have to leave?

241
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:34,454
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

242
00:25:34,621 --> 00:25:36,915
I'm gonna help you get home.

243
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,377
Thank you, Cleveland.

244
00:25:44,464 --> 00:25:46,258
I have to go.

245
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:54,308
Hello. L... l...

246
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:57,019
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

247
00:25:57,186 --> 00:26:00,606
Your c... C... Critic work.

248
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:04,526
How's it... How's... How's...
How's it going?

249
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:09,615
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

250
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:12,367
So you... You...
You haven't written anything yet?

251
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,328
Haven't written anything
for some time.

252
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,414
You were right about that one tenant.

253
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,750
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

254
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:23,670
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

255
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,798
You know she wrote a book?

256
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:31,970
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

257
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:34,181
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

258
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,269
Lookie here.

259
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:44,775
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

260
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:50,447
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

261
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:56,912
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

262
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,664
Now, where'd you hear such things?

263
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,379
Maybe I read your book.

264
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:09,341
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

265
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,970
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

266
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:16,723
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

267
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,145
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

268
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:26,567
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

269
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:32,406
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form."

270
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:35,492
You'll figure it out, Dad.

271
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,494
I...

272
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:42,207
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

273
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:44,918
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

274
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:46,753
Incarnate.

275
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:53,719
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

276
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:57,431
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

277
00:27:57,598 --> 00:28:00,726
- So you like words a lot, huh?
- I adore them.

278
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:04,146
Are you... Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

279
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:05,814
A book, maybe?

280
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,191
No, l...

281
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:12,196
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

282
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:16,033
That's some serious reekage, man.

283
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,744
You don't even speak English anymore.

284
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:22,581
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

285
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:25,000
There's no "reekage," man.

286
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:30,631
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

287
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:35,052
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

288
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:38,347
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

289
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:43,852
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

290
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:45,938
Blim-blam.

291
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:48,440
What? Blim-blam?

292
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:50,692
Somebody already said that.

293
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:56,573
Gentlemen, I don't suppose...

294
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,537
...any of you have written
anything lately.

295
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:06,917
An essay or something?

296
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,712
Something important?

297
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,714
No essays here, my man.

298
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,388
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal...

299
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:22,057
...and stop smoking.

300
00:29:29,356 --> 00:29:31,608
Baby's on the half-tip.

301
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:35,279
- Snap!
- Yeah.

302
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:37,865
There you go. There you go.

303
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,241
Mr. Heep.

304
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:42,703
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

305
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,079
Young-Soon.

306
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:47,708
You're not writing anything, are you?

307
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:51,378
A p... P... P... Paper, maybe?

308
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:54,047
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

309
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:59,511
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

310
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:04,266
She told me about a bad guy in story.

311
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:07,769
These creatures are called scrunts.

312
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:11,648
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

313
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:14,484
They can lay completely flat.

314
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:17,362
Their back is covered in grass.

315
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:21,200
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

316
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,661
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

317
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:17,089
Vick. Anna.

318
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:20,759
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

319
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:24,179
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

320
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:27,975
- Slow.
- You look tired, Mr. Heep.

321
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:33,105
How long have you been writing, Vick?

322
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:35,440
Six months.

323
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,902
What? I should finish, right?

324
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:42,281
It just... It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

325
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,324
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

326
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:47,828
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

327
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:52,082
I can fix that light now, if you want.

328
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,336
A cookbook.

329
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:42,549
This has gotten s... S...

330
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,554
Silly.

331
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:54,770
- That's not how you fold.
- Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

332
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:56,188
I fixed the light.

333
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:58,315
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

334
00:32:58,482 --> 00:32:59,900
You're both cooks?

335
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:04,279
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

336
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,329
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

337
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:15,040
I'm sorry. My... My ladder...

338
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,877
...accidentally bumped into your desk.

339
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:22,589
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

340
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,424
It said The Cookbook.

341
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:26,844
I know, it's a bad title, right?

342
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,140
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems...

343
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,518
...and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

344
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:37,688
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

345
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:41,733
That is not how you fold.

346
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,831
Your thoughts are very sad.

347
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,920
Most are of one night.

348
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:07,551
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

349
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:13,390
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

350
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,519
That is when you stopped being happy.

351
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:22,566
You were a doctor.

352
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:27,738
I am very sorry for you.

353
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:32,159
You believe you have no purpose.

354
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,912
You help all that live here.

355
00:34:35,078 --> 00:34:37,956
Anybody can do this job, Story.

356
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:40,417
You have a purpose.

357
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:44,004
All beings have a purpose.

358
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,262
I know who you are.

359
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:57,267
And I think that I've found your vessel.

360
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:00,354
You know what I'm talking about, right?

361
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:05,442
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone...

362
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,903
...or does he just need to see you?

363
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,415
Cover yourself up.

364
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:26,213
Hey.

365
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,966
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

366
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:31,510
- I gave it to you on the stairs.
- Okay.

367
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:35,973
- My sister's all angry at me now.
- Well, I'll check again.

368
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:40,143
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

369
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:44,815
Hi.

370
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:03,041
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

371
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:05,836
Great.

372
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,134
You all right? You look a little...

373
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:18,098
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

374
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:22,603
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

375
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:25,856
Yeah, kind of.

376
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:29,484
Yeah.

377
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,530
Maybe you should go lie down.

378
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,205
Nice meeting you.

379
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:45,292
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

380
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:10,817
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

381
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:15,239
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

382
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:17,032
Is that okay?

383
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,827
Your words are very beautiful.

384
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,414
Your heart is very big.

385
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,178
No one knows about my family here.

386
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:45,185
Please do not bring it up again.

387
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:58,657
Coming.

388
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:04,746
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's... It's been a long day.

389
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,290
Come on.

390
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:12,421
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

391
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:13,797
Don't tell him I told you.

392
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:16,884
L... I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

393
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,722
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

394
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:24,641
Don't tell him I told you.

395
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:29,813
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

396
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,025
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

397
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:36,320
- Don't let it hurt his feelings.
- Right.

398
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,740
It's... It's... It's okay.

399
00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:43,494
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

400
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,248
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

401
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:51,251
There are laws. It will be safe.

402
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:54,004
I'm allowed to leave this night.

403
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:05,724
- How long do you think?
- It is time.

404
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:07,184
You must not watch.

405
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:09,811
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

406
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:12,064
I won't watch.

407
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:15,359
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

408
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:17,194
You keep it.

409
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,579
What happened?

410
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:54,541
Okay. Okay.

411
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:59,296
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

412
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:01,590
How'd you get those scratches?

413
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:04,843
Did the eagle come?

414
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,598
Did something go wrong? Story.

415
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:13,185
Story. Was it that dog again?

416
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:23,237
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

417
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:40,170
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

418
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:44,800
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

419
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,760
She's beautiful.

420
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,179
She's not feeling that well:

421
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:51,181
So she's lying down in my room.

422
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:53,767
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

423
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:57,104
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

424
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,526
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

425
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:04,111
Blim-blam.

426
00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:09,241
Mr. Heep is a player.

427
00:42:16,373 --> 00:42:19,209
- I hope it's all right.
- It's fine.

428
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:21,086
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

429
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:24,047
- Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f... F... F...
- Fine?

430
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:26,842
Thank you.

431
00:42:27,885 --> 00:42:29,511
No, she just needs some rest.

432
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:32,014
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

433
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,684
You started writing again?

434
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:39,229
Yeah.

435
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:42,399
I'll be right back. Okay?

436
00:42:50,824 --> 00:42:55,204
Hello. M... Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

437
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,747
No home.

438
00:42:56,914 --> 00:42:59,666
Great. Unbelievable.

439
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,342
Hey. Hey.

440
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:12,054
Thanks.

441
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:15,599
- Yeah, hello?
- Mr. Heep?

442
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:18,268
- Where are you?
- At a club.

443
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,979
Don 't tell my mother.
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

444
00:43:21,146 --> 00:43:22,439
Okay.

445
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:26,109
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

446
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:30,280
I don 't know.
Put my mother on, I'll ask her.

447
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,117
Mrs... Mrs. Choi. Mrs...

448
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:51,218
- Hey.
- Hey. Thank you.

449
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:55,055
Oh, she... She... She...
She doesn't look happy.

450
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:57,850
She said the story
her grandmother told...

451
00:43:58,058 --> 00:44:01,228
...said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs.

452
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:05,649
But she said
narfs can protect themselves.

453
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:09,570
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

454
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:12,072
They keep it where they live.

455
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,992
Okay, okay.

456
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,331
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

457
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,334
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing...

458
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:28,672
...from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

459
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,424
You're funny, Mr. Heep.

460
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:32,885
- Yeah, I know.
- You really thought about this.

461
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:35,262
Put my mom on.

462
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,703
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

463
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,497
Yes?

464
00:45:01,705 --> 00:45:04,708
She said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night...

465
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:06,710
...because most scrunts are afraid.

466
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:08,629
Afraid of what?

467
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:13,634
Tartutic. They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

468
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,678
Her grandmother said
there are three of them...

469
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:19,973
...but they are called one name:
Tartutic.

470
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:24,394
They live in the trees.
They are said to look like monkeys.

471
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:29,983
No one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived.

472
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:34,238
The legend says
that they were born so evil...

473
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:37,908
...that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

474
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:43,330
The fear of them has kept justice
in The Blue World for centuries.

475
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:45,499
Bye, Mr. Heep.

476
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:53,549
Thanks.

477
00:46:11,149 --> 00:46:14,903
They are given a mud called Kii
that cures them.

478
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,406
They keep it where they live.

479
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:20,005
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

480
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:21,965
She tell me more of the story.

481
00:49:22,132 --> 00:49:24,843
- Why you wet?
- That's... Apartment business.

482
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:31,433
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

483
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:35,229
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

484
00:49:35,395 --> 00:49:38,357
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

485
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:41,109
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

486
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:44,988
A Thousand Narfs is about a rare narf...

487
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:47,533
...who comes once
in a generation of narfs...

488
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:50,702
...who is called the Madam Narf.

489
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:54,373
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

490
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,378
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

491
00:49:59,545 --> 00:50:03,048
She's considered
a queen to her people.

492
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:06,969
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

493
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:10,681
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf...

494
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:13,559
...even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

495
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:17,104
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

496
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,691
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

497
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:24,486
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

498
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:27,698
No one is ever told who they are.

499
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:29,825
I think we are linked.

500
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:32,536
It's more than just a story to me too.

501
00:50:32,703 --> 00:50:35,205
I actually want to believe it.

502
00:50:36,373 --> 00:50:38,083
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

503
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,019
You have saved my life again.

504
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,981
You made that room.

505
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:07,446
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

506
00:51:07,613 --> 00:51:11,074
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

507
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,952
Well, the door needs a little work.

508
00:51:16,413 --> 00:51:20,083
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment...

509
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,794
...that people left around the pool.

510
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:28,967
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

511
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:39,353
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

512
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,231
Why did he break the rules tonight?

513
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:46,401
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone...

514
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:50,447
...very important to everyone.

515
00:52:29,486 --> 00:52:33,198
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

516
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,201
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

517
00:52:36,368 --> 00:52:38,328
I trust you.

518
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,373
I believe you are here to protect me.

519
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,546
Is the Kii working?

520
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,756
Yes, thank you.

521
00:52:50,716 --> 00:52:53,677
If it is true that I am...

522
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:56,180
He will keep coming after me.

523
00:52:56,346 --> 00:52:59,141
I will not be safe until...

524
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:01,643
Until Tartutic comes.

525
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:18,827
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

526
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:21,622
I was the only one who believed her.

527
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:24,249
She's not an apparition, Anna.

528
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:28,337
I don't know who you are...

529
00:53:29,546 --> 00:53:32,007
...but you did something to me.

530
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:36,178
My thoughts.

531
00:53:40,265 --> 00:53:42,768
Everything became clearer.

532
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:48,106
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

533
00:53:48,899 --> 00:53:51,026
I can hear myself.

534
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:56,073
Do you wish to know your future?

535
00:54:01,954 --> 00:54:05,165
A boy in the Midwest of this land...

536
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:09,753
...will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

537
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,131
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

538
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:16,635
He will grow into a great orator.

539
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,180
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land...

540
00:54:20,347 --> 00:54:22,641
...and throughout the world.

541
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:27,729
This boy will become
leader of this country...

542
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:30,774
...and begin a movement
of great change.

543
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:34,570
He will speak of you and your words.

544
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:39,158
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

545
00:54:41,326 --> 00:54:43,996
It will be the seeds of change.

546
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:48,625
The Cookbook?

547
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:59,511
One, two, three.

548
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,380
Oh, jeez.

549
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:49,228
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

550
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,888
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

551
00:56:26,223 --> 00:56:29,560
Are there... Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

552
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:55,252
- How is she?
- The medicine's helping her.

553
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:58,338
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

554
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,550
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

555
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:07,389
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

556
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:11,768
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world...

557
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:16,231
...but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

558
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:20,944
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

559
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:23,280
My mom always wanted to know
what happened...

560
00:57:23,447 --> 00:57:25,657
...but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends."

561
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:30,245
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

562
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:34,458
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes."

563
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:37,169
So I would, and then
she would know certain things...

564
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:40,339
...but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

565
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:45,052
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

566
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:46,762
We're ready.

567
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:52,976
So in this bedtime story...

568
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:56,313
...the narf has come
to a preordained place.

569
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,025
She must leave from the same spot.

570
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:02,945
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back...

571
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:04,655
...is really very important.

572
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:06,824
And here's the good stuff.

573
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,911
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

574
00:58:11,078 --> 00:58:13,622
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn...

575
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:15,958
...to live near the vessel.

576
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:18,669
Now, these humans
don't know who they are...

577
00:58:18,836 --> 00:58:22,047
...and they always
appear in the story earlier.

578
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:25,008
Are there humans with powers
that can help you...

579
00:58:25,175 --> 00:58:26,760
...but don't know who they are?

580
00:58:28,303 --> 00:58:29,346
That's a yes!

581
00:58:31,473 --> 00:58:36,144
They've got weird names:
A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

582
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:37,479
Ask her if that's right.

583
00:58:40,732 --> 00:58:42,860
You want something.

584
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,405
One of them. Vick.

585
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:51,285
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

586
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:55,330
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

587
00:58:57,499 --> 00:58:59,751
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

588
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:04,506
I was told that there's a Symbolist...

589
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:08,051
...an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

590
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:10,554
He will interpret messages...

591
00:59:11,555 --> 00:59:14,349
...from the universe
if problems should arise.

592
00:59:14,516 --> 00:59:17,644
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

593
00:59:18,103 --> 00:59:20,063
That's a no.

594
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,234
And I was told that there is a Guild...

595
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:27,196
...whose many hands
will combine to help.

596
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,281
Does she know who they are?

597
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:31,658
There is a Guild or something.

598
00:59:31,825 --> 00:59:34,620
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

599
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:37,247
That's another no.

600
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:40,250
All right, there's one other.

601
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:44,046
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

602
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,716
It's a human, usually a female...

603
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:49,593
...so full of hope...

604
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,598
...that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

605
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:56,934
Now, that one is called the Healer.

606
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,269
And you can tell
that they're in the story...

607
00:59:59,436 --> 01:00:02,397
...because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

608
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:07,027
- Butterflies.
- The last one's a Healer.

609
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:09,780
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

610
01:00:15,452 --> 01:00:18,622
Reading? A book?

611
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,707
Learning.

612
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:24,711
She thinks it has to be learned.

613
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:27,172
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

614
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:32,010
Only one last time.

615
01:00:32,553 --> 01:00:34,680
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

616
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:36,473
You have to find them.

617
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:45,482
What is it?

618
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:47,860
You know these walls are paper-thin?

619
01:00:48,026 --> 01:00:51,405
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

620
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:53,866
Can you do anything about that?

621
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,536
Of course not.

622
01:00:58,162 --> 01:01:02,291
- What is it you want, anyway?
- Well, I had a question.

623
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:06,461
You're an expert on p... P... Plots, right?

624
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:11,425
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

625
01:01:11,592 --> 01:01:14,970
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

626
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:17,181
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

627
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:21,894
Well, if there was a mystery...

628
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,439
...and a guy had to figure out
who some people were...

629
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:28,859
...like he had to find a symbol guy...

630
01:01:29,026 --> 01:01:32,196
...someone who can
figure out messages...

631
01:01:32,362 --> 01:01:38,285
...and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

632
01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:41,163
How would you figure that out?

633
01:01:42,414 --> 01:01:45,250
The symbol person should be simple.

634
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:49,171
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane...

635
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,048
...but required analysis.

636
01:01:51,215 --> 01:01:54,593
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

637
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,054
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

638
01:01:57,221 --> 01:02:01,308
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

639
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:05,729
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

640
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:11,485
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

641
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:14,154
Sure, Dad.

642
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:17,616
As for the guild...

643
01:02:17,783 --> 01:02:20,911
...Iook for any group of characters
that are always seen together...

644
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:23,956
...and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue...

645
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:26,416
...that seems to regurgitate forever.

646
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:29,962
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

647
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:33,006
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

648
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:34,925
On occasion.

649
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:42,266
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

650
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,644
You talked about that?

651
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:48,772
This is the writer's way
of establishing characters...

652
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:51,817
...who will be important
further in the story.

653
01:02:52,192 --> 01:02:55,320
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

654
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,324
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

655
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:17,801
Story, these young men are the Guild.

656
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:21,013
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

657
01:03:22,347 --> 01:03:25,058
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

658
01:03:26,393 --> 01:03:30,272
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

659
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:34,735
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

660
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:39,281
Story wants to go home and she can't.

661
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,992
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

662
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:45,037
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

663
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:49,625
- Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
- Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

664
01:03:52,544 --> 01:03:56,632
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

665
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,761
He will use an instrument
specific to him...

666
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,804
...to interpret.

667
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:06,183
- Try it, Mr. Dury.
- I don't...

668
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,852
Let's just see what happens.

669
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:12,439
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

670
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:21,990
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential."

671
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:26,870
And it touches...

672
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:31,959
...27 down, which is "scheme."

673
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:34,419
- Essential scheme.
- Yes.

674
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:37,881
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle...

675
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:41,426
...and I thought that was...
Well, I thought that was weird.

676
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,308
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

677
01:04:48,475 --> 01:04:52,062
- Yes.
- It's a six-letter word for "get-together."

678
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:54,106
- "Soiree."
- Soiree.

679
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,901
Soiree could mean "party." How
could a...? How does a party help us?

680
01:04:58,068 --> 01:05:00,863
Well, I guess I thought that, you know...

681
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:06,201
...a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal...

682
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:08,954
...and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

683
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:12,958
- Why is everyone staring at me?
- Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

684
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:16,879
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals...

685
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:20,424
...so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him...

686
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:24,344
...and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

687
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:25,596
Does that sound right?

688
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:28,390
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

689
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,602
- We're just playing here, right?
- No. Wait, wait.

690
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,356
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon...

691
01:05:36,523 --> 01:05:40,319
...will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

692
01:05:40,652 --> 01:05:43,572
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

693
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,866
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

694
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:47,784
Would I be able to watch now?

695
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,956
But there will be...
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

696
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:56,793
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

697
01:05:58,337 --> 01:06:01,465
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

698
01:06:01,632 --> 01:06:05,135
- "Sonorous."
- Sonorous, sonorous.

699
01:06:05,302 --> 01:06:08,263
It could mean music, a band.

700
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,851
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band...

701
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:16,480
...and we who are of the world
stay with her...

702
01:06:16,647 --> 01:06:20,442
...to help her with that thing and...

703
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,361
Until she's taken.

704
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:25,155
He's a prophet.

705
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:28,492
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

706
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:31,370
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

707
01:06:31,537 --> 01:06:34,248
That is why they're the Guild.

708
01:06:34,414 --> 01:06:38,460
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

709
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,088
- Is he serious?
- We're gonna throw a party.

710
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:45,342
- Huge party. We are serious.
- Tell them...

711
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:48,637
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables...

712
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,349
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

713
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:02,067
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

714
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:05,863
I'm nervous too.

715
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,449
You being out there tomorrow night.

716
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:13,120
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

717
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:19,543
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

718
01:07:20,752 --> 01:07:23,088
Get a little practice with him?

719
01:07:23,255 --> 01:07:25,215
Scare him, maybe?

720
01:07:25,382 --> 01:07:27,384
Show him who's boss?

721
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,432
I know you wanna get home.

722
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,818
You will need a mirror.

723
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:48,113
Can you hear me? I'm here.

724
01:07:48,572 --> 01:07:50,866
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

725
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:55,746
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

726
01:07:55,913 --> 01:08:00,792
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

727
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:04,880
Yeah, l... I don 't... I...

728
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:08,008
Wait.

729
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,385
I see him.

730
01:08:13,514 --> 01:08:16,183
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

731
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:19,186
He is a great weapon against him.

732
01:08:19,853 --> 01:08:24,024
You should walk backwards
towards him.

733
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,277
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position...

734
01:08:27,444 --> 01:08:30,030
...turn and face the hidden scrunt.

735
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:36,578
I'm facing him.

736
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:39,665
I am scared.

737
01:08:40,123 --> 01:08:42,918
It is about to get very dangerous.

738
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,003
Okay.

739
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:48,590
I'm ready.

740
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:54,638
You must invoke the ancient words
"Nef Ra Mora."

741
01:08:54,805 --> 01:09:00,102
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

742
01:09:09,194 --> 01:09:11,071
What is happening?

743
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:15,159
He's rising out of the grass.

744
01:09:16,618 --> 01:09:19,955
His legs are bending and coiling...

745
01:09:20,831 --> 01:09:22,583
...underneath him.

746
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:27,045
Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, no.

747
01:09:27,754 --> 01:09:29,214
He's standing in front of me.

748
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:31,091
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

749
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:33,844
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes...

750
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:37,639
...it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

751
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:41,018
What is the J.G. Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

752
01:09:41,185 --> 01:09:42,686
I'm not sure.

753
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:44,980
- Look into his eyes.
- I am.

754
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,733
- Is he moving away?
- No.

755
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,027
The Guardian can control his mind.

756
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:53,071
The J.G. Scrunt will not
be able to attack.

757
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:58,035
- Okay.
- You must look into his eyes.

758
01:09:58,202 --> 01:09:59,953
I think something's wrong.

759
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,206
He's stepping forward.

760
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,416
He's stepping forward?

761
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,585
Something's wrong!

762
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:11,548
Cleveland, run!

763
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:20,807
What is it you are doing?

764
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:24,144
Hey there.

765
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:31,026
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F... F... F... Farber?

766
01:10:31,485 --> 01:10:32,986
No.

767
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:43,747
So how was the m... Movie?

768
01:10:43,914 --> 01:10:45,582
- Sucked.
- Oh, what a... What a shame.

769
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:49,419
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

770
01:10:49,586 --> 01:10:51,171
Who does that?

771
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:52,589
And a typical romance...

772
01:10:52,756 --> 01:10:56,969
...where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

773
01:10:57,678 --> 01:11:01,765
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

774
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:04,518
Well, maybe...

775
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:09,148
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

776
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:13,110
No. It's not.

777
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,529
Are you okay?

778
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:20,409
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

779
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,703
They're masters of hiding.

780
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:26,790
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

781
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:30,002
If a tenant hadn't walked by...

782
01:11:30,169 --> 01:11:32,796
...I'd have been eaten alive.

783
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,176
I had no powers over him.

784
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:39,761
You are not the Guardian.

785
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,724
I do not understand.

786
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,524
I cannot protect you.

787
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,777
Where are the Tartutic?

788
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:58,322
Why isn't he being punished?

789
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,617
Where is the justice?

790
01:12:20,427 --> 01:12:22,888
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

791
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:28,852
I've been busy.

792
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,569
You... You coming to the party tonight?

793
01:12:37,945 --> 01:12:39,780
I have to study.

794
01:12:39,947 --> 01:12:41,782
Bye, Mr. Heep.

795
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,625
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p... Party?

796
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:57,339
You coming?

797
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,383
- A picture here
of the enemy they're...

798
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,885
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

799
01:13:02,052 --> 01:13:04,179
- What?
- Man.

800
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,184
Yes.

801
01:13:09,643 --> 01:13:11,436
That's not the answer I expected.

802
01:13:11,603 --> 01:13:15,232
Why'd you a... Ask me that?

803
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,776
I know about your family.

804
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,238
I looked you up
when you started working here.

805
01:13:21,989 --> 01:13:24,283
I know someone killed them.

806
01:13:24,449 --> 01:13:28,954
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

807
01:13:30,497 --> 01:13:32,040
I know.

808
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,626
You don't wanna become like me.

809
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:39,798
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

810
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:43,051
There's something strange going on
around this building.

811
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,095
Don't think I haven't noticed.

812
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:53,979
It is finished?

813
01:13:57,107 --> 01:13:59,651
You can see things in the future?

814
01:13:59,818 --> 01:14:01,820
Some things.

815
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:04,781
I have a question to ask you.

816
01:14:05,616 --> 01:14:08,911
I will do my best to answer it.

817
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,288
You'll tell me the truth, right?

818
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:14,249
Yes.

819
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:18,837
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen...

820
01:14:19,004 --> 01:14:22,633
...without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

821
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:24,927
I wrote this thing.

822
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,764
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction...

823
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:32,267
...before it anchors
in the consciousness.

824
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:36,605
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

825
01:14:38,398 --> 01:14:41,401
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me...

826
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:45,072
...this leader who's just a boy.

827
01:14:45,656 --> 01:14:50,202
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

828
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:55,499
There's a lot of things in The Cookbook
people won't like to hear.

829
01:14:58,001 --> 01:15:03,298
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

830
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,635
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

831
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:10,764
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

832
01:15:11,682 --> 01:15:13,976
And why didn't he meet me?"

833
01:15:17,187 --> 01:15:19,731
And I thought of how it could happen.

834
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:25,154
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

835
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:29,741
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

836
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,869
Yes.

837
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:36,039
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

838
01:15:36,206 --> 01:15:38,417
It is not true.

839
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,336
You are all connected.

840
01:15:41,879 --> 01:15:45,549
One act can one day affect all.

841
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:54,141
What are you guys whispering about?

842
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:57,352
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

843
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,606
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

844
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:03,901
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy...

845
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:05,736
...that's gonna marry you.

846
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:09,072
Very funny, Herb.

847
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,752
Okay.

848
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:25,839
Don't tell my sister.

849
01:16:56,954 --> 01:17:00,833
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

850
01:17:02,793 --> 01:17:05,254
I wanted to thank you.

851
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:10,759
I was completely surprised by all of this.

852
01:17:11,218 --> 01:17:15,305
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

853
01:17:16,723 --> 01:17:19,726
But this is beyond my expectations.

854
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:24,231
I'm 13B.

855
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:28,318
- Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
- Oh, yeah. Good for you.

856
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,948
I know of your future, Cleveland.

857
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,534
Do you wanna hear it?

858
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:37,161
No.

859
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,500
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

860
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:47,045
It is only what I have been told
by others.

861
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:52,843
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path...

862
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,387
...that the universe will give us signs.

863
01:17:56,221 --> 01:17:58,473
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

864
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,019
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

865
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:07,649
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

866
01:18:11,028 --> 01:18:13,864
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

867
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:19,119
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

868
01:18:19,286 --> 01:18:21,705
I don't know how to lead.

869
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:27,461
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

870
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:31,507
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

871
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:37,262
There's a storm coming.

872
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:45,062
- I am scared.
- It's okay to be scared.

873
01:18:45,395 --> 01:18:47,981
I do not have courage.

874
01:18:48,649 --> 01:18:50,776
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

875
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:53,278
You do what you think is right.

876
01:18:53,445 --> 01:18:55,906
You are very brave.

877
01:18:56,782 --> 01:19:00,202
You were always meant to lead, Story.

878
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,123
Cleveland...

879
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,169
...the Great Eatlon is coming.

880
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,202
Okay.

881
01:20:26,872 --> 01:20:29,166
I'm glad you read my journal.

882
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:34,004
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

883
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:11,124
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

884
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:15,462
Do not leave this spot.

885
01:21:18,131 --> 01:21:20,300
- Yo, come on.
- Hey.

886
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:31,103
Find a mirror.

887
01:22:25,115 --> 01:22:28,327
Why hasn't the m... Music started?

888
01:22:28,494 --> 01:22:31,955
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

889
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,584
You used up the battery.

890
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:37,628
Wave to him.

891
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,556
They told her that the universe
would line up...

892
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:53,644
...and reveal that we're
on the right p... Path.

893
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:56,230
Why isn't this working?

894
01:23:24,007 --> 01:23:25,592
Okay.

895
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:42,359
Sometimes animals just look dead.

896
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:51,201
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

897
01:24:21,231 --> 01:24:24,193
It is not time for you to go.

898
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:31,033
It is not time for you to go.

899
01:24:38,582 --> 01:24:41,502
Isn't this supposed to work?

900
01:24:45,923 --> 01:24:49,384
Fourteen across.

901
01:24:51,428 --> 01:24:53,055
No. No.

902
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,812
I don't know.

903
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:03,148
I don't know.

904
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:11,114
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

905
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:15,619
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

906
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:19,623
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

907
01:25:20,207 --> 01:25:23,460
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

908
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:29,091
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

909
01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:34,471
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

910
01:25:34,638 --> 01:25:37,641
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

911
01:25:41,145 --> 01:25:43,105
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

912
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:44,857
Look at what happened at the party.

913
01:25:45,023 --> 01:25:47,442
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

914
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,238
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

915
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:58,495
He was so sure.

916
01:25:58,662 --> 01:26:00,080
What?

917
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:02,207
I...

918
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:05,878
...asked someone.

919
01:26:06,044 --> 01:26:08,297
He acted like he knew.

920
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,424
What kind of person
would be so arrogant...

921
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:13,343
...to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

922
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,596
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

923
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:24,480
Hello?

924
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:35,199
Is the bathroom on this level working?

925
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:39,828
A dog inside the building.

926
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:42,956
Go. Shoo!

927
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,047
Why, you're not a dog at all.

928
01:26:53,759 --> 01:26:55,427
My God.

929
01:26:56,053 --> 01:26:59,139
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

930
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:04,102
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast...

931
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:07,940
...will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

932
01:27:08,106 --> 01:27:12,277
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity...

933
01:27:12,444 --> 01:27:15,656
...killing or death,
such as in a family film...

934
01:27:15,823 --> 01:27:19,743
...the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter...

935
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,287
...and be referenced again
later in the story...

936
01:27:22,454 --> 01:27:25,624
...having learned valuable lessons.

937
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,085
He may even be given
a humorous moment...

938
01:27:28,252 --> 01:27:31,296
...to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

939
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:36,510
This is where I turn to run.

940
01:27:36,677 --> 01:27:39,096
You will leap for me.

941
01:27:39,263 --> 01:27:41,265
I will shut the door.

942
01:27:41,431 --> 01:27:45,936
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

943
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:51,024
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

944
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:54,695
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

945
01:27:54,862 --> 01:27:56,321
This has gotta be about faith.

946
01:27:56,488 --> 01:27:59,533
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

947
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,661
- We need to be told what to do.
- We need to find the Interpreter.

948
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:05,372
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

949
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:08,959
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

950
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:11,962
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

951
01:28:12,129 --> 01:28:14,131
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

952
01:28:14,298 --> 01:28:16,466
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

953
01:28:16,633 --> 01:28:20,137
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

954
01:28:22,306 --> 01:28:23,849
My God.

955
01:28:25,976 --> 01:28:27,436
I do.

956
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,731
There is a message.

957
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,819
There is a ceremony to be done.

958
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:38,280
You're doing great, Joey.

959
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,745
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

960
01:28:44,912 --> 01:28:47,748
Joey, who is the Guild?

961
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:53,504
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

962
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:56,215
Sisters? The Guild is women?

963
01:28:57,508 --> 01:29:00,511
They will touch together
with their hearts as one...

964
01:29:00,677 --> 01:29:03,138
...to bring strength to the moment.

965
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:05,140
Nice, Joey.

966
01:29:07,684 --> 01:29:10,521
You will need a man
who has no secrets...

967
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:14,483
...and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

968
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:20,697
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

969
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:52,855
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

970
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:58,902
I need to speak with your
f... F... F... F... Five daughters.

971
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:07,578
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

972
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:16,128
Sweetheart?

973
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:20,174
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

974
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,259
He's got terrible breath.

975
01:30:22,426 --> 01:30:24,970
Don't tell him I told you.

976
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,322
- Huge explosions
right in the very heart of the capital.

977
01:30:43,489 --> 01:30:48,744
Several explosions, I felt at least four
very close to the center of the city.

978
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,814
I think we have everybody.

979
01:32:01,692 --> 01:32:05,737
A man who has no secrets...

980
01:32:05,904 --> 01:32:11,368
...and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

981
01:32:11,535 --> 01:32:15,706
They will be w... W... Witnesses.

982
01:32:15,873 --> 01:32:20,252
Will the Guild please come forward?

983
01:32:24,882 --> 01:32:26,466
Yeah.

984
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:29,678
And you make seven.

985
01:32:30,387 --> 01:32:32,389
Seven sisters.

986
01:32:34,892 --> 01:32:36,810
Come, come.

987
01:32:39,146 --> 01:32:40,647
Yeah.

988
01:32:41,398 --> 01:32:43,692
Everything's right now.

989
01:32:48,447 --> 01:32:50,699
Come back to us now.

990
01:32:51,825 --> 01:32:55,996
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

991
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,129
I can't believe it.

992
01:33:04,296 --> 01:33:08,133
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

993
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,927
She needs to get to a hospital.

994
01:33:10,093 --> 01:33:14,306
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

995
01:33:14,473 --> 01:33:17,267
I wanted to believe more than most.

996
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:20,270
I wanna be like a child again.

997
01:33:20,771 --> 01:33:23,774
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us...

998
01:33:23,941 --> 01:33:25,651
...but at some point we have to stop.

999
01:33:25,818 --> 01:33:30,989
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1000
01:33:32,074 --> 01:33:34,117
I read it wrong.

1001
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:40,791
It was my first time.

1002
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,961
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters...

1003
01:33:44,127 --> 01:33:46,463
...to bring strength to the moment."

1004
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:50,843
I looked at it again. It says "he."

1005
01:33:51,009 --> 01:33:56,807
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment."

1006
01:33:56,974 --> 01:34:00,269
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1007
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:02,646
It said the Healer could be a man.

1008
01:34:02,813 --> 01:34:05,357
But l... But l...
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1009
01:34:05,524 --> 01:34:06,650
Butterflies?

1010
01:34:06,817 --> 01:34:10,279
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1011
01:34:10,445 --> 01:34:12,906
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1012
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:16,535
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1013
01:34:18,996 --> 01:34:20,414
I did?

1014
01:34:27,087 --> 01:34:28,922
Wait, no.

1015
01:34:29,089 --> 01:34:30,883
You must try.

1016
01:34:31,049 --> 01:34:34,261
- There's no time.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.

1017
01:34:34,428 --> 01:34:36,013
Shut up...

1018
01:34:37,014 --> 01:34:38,557
...and try.

1019
01:35:19,723 --> 01:35:22,976
Say something to bring out your energy.

1020
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,983
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1021
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:37,783
I should have been there.

1022
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:40,285
I am always gonna regret...

1023
01:35:42,412 --> 01:35:44,915
...just not being there.

1024
01:35:50,587 --> 01:35:53,090
I'll miss your faces.

1025
01:35:55,926 --> 01:35:58,595
Oh, they remind me of God.

1026
01:36:04,768 --> 01:36:07,688
I'm so lost without you guys.

1027
01:36:13,277 --> 01:36:18,824
I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1028
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,578
And I think you would've liked her.

1029
01:36:25,455 --> 01:36:27,666
I think she might be...

1030
01:36:29,418 --> 01:36:31,420
...an angel...

1031
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:36,300
...because she has to go home.

1032
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:43,348
I love you all.

1033
01:36:44,892 --> 01:36:47,561
I love you all so much.

1034
01:37:33,357 --> 01:37:36,485
Thank you for all you have done.

1035
01:37:47,955 --> 01:37:51,291
Your sister will have seven children.

1036
01:37:51,458 --> 01:37:53,669
You will see the first two.

1037
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:13,058
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

1038
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,852
Reggie!

1039
01:40:15,018 --> 01:40:17,312
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1040
01:40:17,479 --> 01:40:19,898
Keep looking in his eyes!

1041
01:42:06,088 --> 01:42:08,799
Thank you for saving my life.
