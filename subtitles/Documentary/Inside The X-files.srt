1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,200
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Pay strict attention to what l say

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,700
because l choose my words carefully
and l never repeat myself.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
l've told you my name. That's the ''who''.

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,000
The ''where'' could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,000
DALTON: But there's a vast difference

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,600
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,800
The ''what'' is easy.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,200
Recently l planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
That's also the ''when''.

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,700
As for the ''why,''
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,400
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,900
Because l can.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,600
Which leaves us only with the ''how''.

15
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,800
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
lies the rub.

17
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,900
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,000
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
-Okay?
-All right, okay.

20
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,100
He's crazy.

21
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,300
-Now? On 51st? 50...
-CHAlM: Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,300
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,300
HAMMOND: What do l have to...

24
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,400
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
l'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Whatever. lt's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

26
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

27
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
l want to snap this guy's neck,
l swear to God.

28
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
NANCY: So what?

29
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,900
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,800
They could've been to me.
lt's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,300
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

32
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
(NANCY CHUCKLES)

33
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Okay. This is funny.

34
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,200
l got this guy in front of me
that thinks l don't see him looking at me.

35
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Fantastic. God damn it.

36
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,300
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

37
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

38
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

39
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah. Fine.

40
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,100
l don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

41
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,500
-Sorry.
-All right?

42
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
-Yeah, you got it.
-Thank you.

Excuse me. Sir?

-''Not now.''
-Listen. Listen.

They want to lock me up.

to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

93
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,900
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

-or gets caught stealing a car?

and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

-Can't you get rid of him?
-l could, couldn't l?

sleeping in the next room,

we wouldn't have this problem.''

Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

-And what's wrong with that?
-A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

He claims he's got some hostages in there.

Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can l do for you?

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,100
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

165
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,400
Oh, my.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,800
-Has anybody been hurt?
-l don't think so, but there are hostages.

167
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
Oh, how awful.

168
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
-Which branch is it?

Thank you, Katherine.

l'm sorry, Mr. Case.

172
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Oh, dear God.

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

174
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,300
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

175
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,500
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

176
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

177
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

178
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
The door was locked.
l tried to take a look inside

179
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,100
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a .357 in my face,

180
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,800
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,600
-See any other gunmen?
-No, sir. l couldn't see anything at all.

182
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
-You hear anything inside?
-No, sir,

183
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,400
but with that .357 sticking in my face,
l can't really be sure. l'm sorry.

184
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Okay.

185
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,700
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

186
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,200
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

187
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
-Yeah, once.
-Really?

188
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,100
Yeah, by a 1 2-year-old.

189
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,600
-What was that like?
-Not one of my better days.

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,900
l bet. All right, well, look.

191
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,500
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

192
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
lf you don't mind,
l'd rather hang around a while,

193
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,400
at least until we make contact.

194
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,700
That's what l like to hear, Sergeant.

195
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,300
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

the bank has been robbed.

Yeah, it was. lt was.

So, what do we got?

262
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,900
l got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

263
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,600
and a bank, and about a million spectators,

-so l'm kind of busy.
-l understand.

265
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is l deal with Mr. Grossman.

266
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,500
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,600
No, it's not okay, Captain.

Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

269

so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

270
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

of this crime scene, okay?

278
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,100

with a detailed briefing?

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
-Okay.
-We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

280
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000

all right? Okay?

-All right.
-Good to see you, Captain.

282
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,900
Shouldn't we be in there?

283
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

284
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

285
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,400
he'll only dump on us.

286
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
lf the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. l've seen him work.

Your call, Keith.

Can you get that for me?
l guess it is, isn't it?

289
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,300
That's the one thing l learned
from Grossman,

290
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,600
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

291
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,100
-How do you mean?
-Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

292
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

293
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,700
-Told you, you could handle this.
-Yeah.

294
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,100

on the food chain to show up and say,

-Now!

-They sent me out here!
-Now!

309
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
-He said stay away!
-Cuff him.

310
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,800
lf you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

-All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

-There's four of them in there!
-Come on.

-Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,900
Was it a time when l thought
l might not see my family again? Yeah.

319
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,700
Yeah, l thought about it.
l mean, at first, l wasn't...

320
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,200
lt was too much to think about at that point.

but after a while l...

Yeah.

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,800

What do you think?

Miss White, l want you to rest assured

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,300
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

And no business with your uncle?

335
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,100
ln truth, l have very little
to do with him these days.

336
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,700
l'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
ls that right?

337
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,200
-You are extremely well informed.
-l have to be. Yes?

l have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

We'll need to end this here.

-He said his name, just like that?

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,100
lt wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

-All right. Put him through.

l'll come right to the point.

358
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,600
l have a small problem
which requires someone

359
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,100
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

360
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Are you such a person
or have l been misinformed?

-l'll be downstairs.
-Thank you.

364
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,900
They had a kind of genius plan

365
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
for throwing us out of whack

366
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,000
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

367
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
They were... They were very

368
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,700
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

369
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,700
All l know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

370
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,000
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

371
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,300
And they called you what?

372
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

373
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,400
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

374
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

375
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,100
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

376
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,000
-You know a lot about guns.
-No.

377
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,000
-l don't know anything about guns, except...
-But you know they had an AK-47.

378
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
-Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
-Everybody?

379
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,100
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

380
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,800
-You ever rob a bank before?
-Are you kidding?

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Me rob a bank? No.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
-Never stole a dollar?
-Never.

383
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
-Never?
-Not ever.

384
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,300
-You know what?
-That one time. That one time, that one time.

385
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,900
l stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

386
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,200
She was Polish.

387
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,000
l used to go up to her and say,
''Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. ''

388
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,100
One day, l opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

389
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,700
l took it.

390
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,200
That was the only thing l ever took.

391
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,800
Look, Detective, l didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

392
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,000
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

393
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,800
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

394
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,400
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

395
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,900
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

396
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,300
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

397
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,300
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

398
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,700
There's a video system in the bank.

399
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,800
We're working on getting a download

400
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,200
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

401
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,700
We got the block locked up.
l got men in the windows.

402
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,400
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

403
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,900
What about the phones?

404
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,800
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

405
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,600
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

406
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,900
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

407
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,200
but so far nothing.

408
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,200
-91 1?
-lt's up on the screen.

409
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,300
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

410
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,100
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

411
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,500
Yeah.

412
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Yeah, l'm not calling them yet.

413
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Beg your pardon?

414
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what l mean?

415
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,500
l'm not gonna call him
and ask what l can do for him.

416
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,300
Let's see what he does.

417
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,900
Your call.

418
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how l work?

419
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,600
Please. That would be nice.

420
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

421
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,200
That's fine.

422
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,800
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

423
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
that handle these kinds of things.

424
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,400
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

425
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,400
Their people call me.

426
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,500
So, immediately, l know
that there's something in that box

427
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,000
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

428
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,400
No problem with me.

429
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,600
You tell me l don't need to know
what's in that box and l don't need to know.

430
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,600
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

431
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,600
and l find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

432
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,500
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

433
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,500
-Have you finished?
-Yes.

434
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
What's inside that box, young lady,

435
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,600
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

436
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,800
lt's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

437
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,900
Except you.

438
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,500
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

439
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,400
so l can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

440
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,300
-Of course.
-All right.

441
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,100
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

442
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
l don't.

443
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,300
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

444
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,800
l'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

445
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,000
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

446
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,900
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier l'll be.

447
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,600
-ls that specific enough for you?
-No.

448
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,200
The contents of that box

449
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,500
are of great value to me.

450
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So long as they remain my secret.

451
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
And if they're exposed?

452
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,900
l'll face some difficult questions.

453
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,300
-So, it stays locked or it disappears.
-Precisely.

454
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,700
-Can you make that happen?
-Yes.

455
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,100
l hope so.
l have to say, l can't help but be skeptical.

456
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,100
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

457
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

458
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,100
Steve?

459
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,300
lt's time for Steve-O.

460
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,000
l came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

461
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,600
Guess what l found?

462
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,000
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

463
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Yeah.

464
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,100
Probably stolen.

465
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,600
Have them run it and check it for prints.

466
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,100
-Everybody on?
-Yep, l'm there.

467
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,900
(TELEPHONE RlNGlNG)

468
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,300
-Sure you got the right number?
-Absolutely.

469
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,300
Okay. Nothing yet.

470
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,400
We got video.

471
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Let's have it.

472
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,500
FRAZlER: What happened to that camera
right there?

473
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,900
ROURKE: Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

474
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,500
FRAZlER: Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

475
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,800
lt's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

476
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,500
lt's weird, isn't it?
lt's like nobody else sees it.

477
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,400
-You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
-lt could be infrared.

478
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,600
-What's that?
-lnfrared bulb.

479
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,600
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

480
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,700
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

481
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,100
FRAZlER: Right, right, right, right.

482
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,000
ROURKE: He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

483
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
So, for approximately two minutes,

484
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,800
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

485
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,000
MlTCHELL: Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

486
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,700
lt was just a few minutes.

487
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,900
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

488
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,200
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

489
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,300
And then l just remember one of them

490
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,100
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

491
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,100
-The video cameras?
-I don't know.

492
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,200
Anything else you want to share with us?

493
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
No, just...

494
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,300
-You sure?
-Yeah, l...

495
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,400
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

496
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,500
l'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

497
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,100
-You okay?
-Thank you.

498
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Okay.

499
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,300
-lt was pretty awful.
-Was it bad?

500
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,400
l mean, they made us strip.

501
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,600
They made us take off our clothes.

502
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,900
l don't understand why they had to do that.

503
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,500
l really just thought...

504
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,000
l thought l was gonna be killed.

505
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Well.

506
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
-All right, my dear.
-Okay.

507
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
-l can go?
-No.

508
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,200
-No?
-No, you got to stay.

509
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,700
-You got to stay.
-No, you can go.

510
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,000
No, stay. No, go.

511
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,700
Did you rob the bank?

512
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
-You did.
-Did you rob the bank?

513
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,500
-No.
-You sure?

514
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,300
-BERK: There's movement at the front door.
-Let's go.

515
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,700
HERNANDEZ: Put down the fucking weapon!
VlKRAM: Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

516
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
HERNANDEZ: Don't move! Don't move!

517
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,100
COP: He's got a device on him there.

518
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,400
l said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

519
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,200
l said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

520
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,700
COP: Hands are tied!
HERNANDEZ: Hands are tied.

521
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,000
-Jesus, pat him down.
-All right.

522
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,000
-VlKRAM: l'm one of the hostages!
-Careful.

523
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,400
HERNANDEZ: Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

524
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,900
SNlPER 1 : l can't see him from where l'm at.

525
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,700
SNlPER 2: l can see him. l got a clear shot.
HERNANDEZ: Any weapons?

526
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,300
-Who are you?
-Vikram Walia. l work in the bank.

527
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,600
Okay. Vikram? ls this a bomb?

528
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,900
-Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
-What? No. l'm a Sikh!

529
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
-ls that a bomb?
-No.

530
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,400
-Answer me, Vikram. ls this a bomb?
-No.

531
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,800
-Are you booby-trapped?
-No, fuck, no.

532
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
Okay, Vikram, l need you to relax.

533
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,100
-Jesus, give me a hand.
-l don't know.

534
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
SNlPER 1 : Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

535
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
-Team, take him down.
-Mike, now, get him.

536
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

537
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,100
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

538
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,700
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

539
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,200
Come on, shut up. Relax.

540
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,100
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

541
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,900
-You can't fucking rip my turban.
-Shut up, already.

542
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,100
-What the fuck?
-Come on, move it.

543
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,100
Get your fucking hands off me!

544
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,300
And the 1 1 :00 and 1 2:00...

545
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,400
And don't forget about your 1 :00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

546
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,900
-Oh, Madge. What a day...
-Your Honor.

547
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,700
Madeleine! How are you?

548
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,300
l'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

549
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,600
-Sure. Madge, are we through here?
-Yes, Mr. Mayor.

550
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,800
This way, Miss White.

551
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,600
l always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

552
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,700
Who are we saving this week?

553
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
Well, l'm doing a round of support

554
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,400
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

555
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,600
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

556
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,600
lf you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

557
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,500
lt would be my pleasure.
ls there anything else l can do to...

558
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,700
-What the fuck do you want?
-A favor.

559
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,600
-No shit. Which kind?
-The last one l'll ever ask of you.

560
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
That's the kind l had in mind.

561
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,000
You know about this hostage situation.

562
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,300
On my way. What's it to do with you?

563
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
All right, well, l need to keep an eye on it.

564
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,600
So, l want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

565
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,700
to extend me every courtesy.

566
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,900
You're out of your fucking mind.

567
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,100
lf it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

568
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
-lt's impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.

569
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,900
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

570
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,200
l may have to give out a few.

571
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

572
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,700
You're a magnificent cunt.

573
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Thank you.

574
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,400
It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.

575
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,800
It's unclear how many hostages are inside

576
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,300
and how many robbers
police are dealing with.

577
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,600
Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,

578
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,700
but has turned into this hostage situation.

579
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,500
Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard

580
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,300
and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.

581
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,600
Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest

582
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,600
and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.

583
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,600
That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.

584
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,400
Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.

585
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,400
VlKRAM: ''Protect and serve'' my ass.
Where's my turban?

586
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,000
l'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

587
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
lt's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. l'm a Sikh.

588
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
MlTCHELL: Okay, we'll find your turban.

589
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,000
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

590
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Now, no, l don't think you heard that.

591
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,400
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

592
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,400
-l didn't hear that.
-l heard what l heard.

593
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
l'll give you all the information you want.

594
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,600
l don't need this. l need my turban.
lt's part of my religion.

595
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
-We'll get you your turban.
-We'll find it for you.

596
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,200
No, no, no. Not ''get me.''
l want my turban now.

597
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,000
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

598
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
lt's a dangerous situation.

599
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,700
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

600
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,200
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

601
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
You can write a formal complaint.

602
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,200
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

603
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

604
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,000
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

605
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,700
l could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,

l make First Grade when l make First Grade.

911
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,300
You want to speed that up,
l'm not gonna talk you out of it.

912
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,800
Then there's also the matter of $1 40,000
that seems to have walked away

913
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,800
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

914
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,100
Oh, l see.

915
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,300
Well, l had nothing to do with that.

916
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,100
HERNANDEZ: Yeah, Collins, we got snipers
in the windows here.

917
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,800
We got guys in the building next door.
Guys up on the roof.

918
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
We're trying to get the blueprints
for the bank

919
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,800
so we can figure out the ventilator shaft.
Maybe we can come down.

920
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,500
DALTON: Well?
FRAZlER: ls this the President of Albania?

921
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,800
-Speaking.
-Pretty funny.

922
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,000
-You shouldn't eavesdrop on people.
-Well, you better get used to it, pal.

923
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,100
There's not gonna be much privacy
where you're going.

924
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,400
You're damn right.

925
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
This time next week,
l'll be sucking down pina coladas

926
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,500
in a hot tub with six girls
named Amber and Tiffany.

927
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,800
More like taking a shower with two guys
named Jamal and Jesus,

928
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,600
if you know what l mean.
And here's the bad news,

929
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,700
that thing you're sucking on,
it's not a pina colada.

930
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,700
-Maybe you like that kind of thing, huh?
-You really want to piss me off.

931
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,600
All right, here's where we stand.

932
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,300
l don't need
your fucking status report, Serpico.

933
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,000

934
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,500
-Sure, sure. l just meant...
-Here's where things stand.

935
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,400
You're getting me what l asked you for.

936
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,400
You'll have it ready in the time l gave you

937
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,700
or you'll sit by and you'll watch me do
just what l said l would do. Clear?

938
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,700
Very clear.
l'm trying to get you what you want.

939
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,200
But you got to understand this.

940
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,500
You know, it's not like the City of New York
has 7 47 s waiting around for days like today.

941
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,900
l understand that if you don't get
my plane ready,

942
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,100
-then you might as well send a hearse.
-Please.

943
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,900
Let's focus on how we can both
get what we want, all right?

944
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,400
Hey! You're not listening.

945
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,800
You get me what l want, l won't kill anyone.

946
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,400
All right. l'm on it. l'm on it.

947
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,500
Let's just try to keep everybody calm, okay?

948
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,400
-Don't l sound calm to you?

-Damerjian.

-Damerjian. ls that Albanian?
-Just call me Kenneth.

952
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,000
-Kenneth?
-ls that Albanian or...

953
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,600
lt's Armenian.

954
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,800
What's the difference?

955
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,600
Detective, l was born in Queens.

956
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,700
l've never been to Armenia, Albania.
l went surfing in Australia once.

957
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,500
Can l have a glass of water?

958
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,900
-Are you thirsty?
-My throat's parched.

959
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,600
-l'm not nervous.
-Your throat's parched?

960
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,400
-My throat's parched.
-His throat is parched.

961
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,400
-l just want a glass of water.
-Oh, shit!

962
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,500
When you start telling us
what really happened...

963
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,400
-l just want a glass of water.
-His throat is parched.

964
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,200
-Here. You want some coffee?
-No, that's all right.

965
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,500
-l don't drink that stuff.
-No, go ahead.

966
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,800
Did you know they were robbing the bank?

967
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,900
l didn't know they were robbing the bank
until they pulled a gun in my face.

968
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,500
ls that why you held the door open
for them?

How do you know they robbed the bank?

970
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,200
Because they pulled a gun in my face...

971
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,600
That doesn't mean they were
robbing the bank.

972
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,300
Did they take money?
Did you see them take money?

973
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,900
l was in a bank and l was locked up
for who knows how long.

974
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,800
-Okay.
-Tied up in a room. l saw you see me.

975
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,300
You saw me see you?

976
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,700
-ls that what you just said?
-Yeah.

977
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,100
l was locked up in the room.
You saw me gagged when you came in.

978
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,800
Listen, l can't work miracles over here.
l'm gonna need more time.

979
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,600
Well, perhaps if you'd use the time
that l gave you more efficiently,

980
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,400
you wouldn't be having this problem.

981
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,900
-What do you want me to say?
-That my plane is ready.

982
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,300
Okay, listen.

983
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,100
l promise you, as God is my witness,
l'm working on it as hard as l can.

984
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,000
lt's just gonna take a few more hours.

985
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,600
Why should l give you any more time?

986
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,000
Well, it's simple. You give me more time,
you get what you want.

987
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
You don't give me the time,
you don't get what you want.

988
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,100
You got nothing to lose.

989
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,700
Meanwhile, we'll send in some more food.

990
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,500
l got a question for you.
You get it right, l give you more time.

991
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,100
-And?
-You know what happens if you don't.

Which weighs more?

993
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,100
All the trains that pass through
Grand Central Station in a year,

994
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,800
or the trees cut down to print
all US currency in circulation?

995
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,000
Here's a hint. lt's a trick question.

-Yeah, that's right.

-So no trees were cut down.

1001

-Are you sure?
-Yeah. 100%.

01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,700
lt's all right. We got a couple
of the hostages out. Thanks a lot.

1057
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,100
-No, no. How you doing?
-l'm doing okay. l'm doing all right.

1058
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,900
Oh, I saw the Mayor on TV. He said
you're doing a great job. I saw you, too.

1059
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,700
-You saw me on TV?
-Yeah.

1060
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,300
-How'd l look?
-You looked good, baby. Real good.

1061
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,000
-All right, listen. l got to go.
-All right. Hey.

1062
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,000
-Keep your head down.
-All right, l will. Love you.

1063
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,900
Come on.

1064
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,300
So, are we clear about the ground rules?

1065
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,800
-There's no need to worry, Detective.
-l get paid to worry, okay?

1066
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,600
l just need you to look me in the eye

1067
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,100
and make me believe that you understand
everything we talked about.

1068
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,000
-l understand.
-Okay.

1069
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,100
Someone here wants to talk to you.

1070
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,100
-Hello?
-Who is this?

1071
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,200
Let's not get into any names.

1072
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,700
-What matters is what l can offer you.
-And what's that?

1073
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,200
Well, if l can be assured
that certain interests are protected,

1074
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,500
l might be able to help you get
what you came for.

1075
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,900
l doubt that.

1076
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,000
Tell me about these interests
that you are trying to protect.

1077
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,700
Why don't you let me worry about that?

1078
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,300
Now, what is it you were hoping to get out
of all this?

1079
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,500
-Rich, of course.
-Of course.

1080
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,000
But you may have bitten off
more than you can chew.

1081
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,000
-How?
-l can't discuss that on the phone.

1082
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,300
-You work for the bank?
-No.

1083
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,600
And you're not a cop.

1084
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,400
That's right.

1085
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,500
Come on in.

1086
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,300
You got 10 minutes. No more.

1087
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,000
lf you're not out
before the lights come back on,

1088
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,700
you can stay inside until this thing is over.

1089
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,300
-You don't need to threaten me.
-That's not a threat, lady, but this is.

1090
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,400
l know this game is a mile over my head,
but l'm telling you, if you fuck me over...

1091
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,700
l got where l am by collecting friends,
not enemies.

1092
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,300
Trust me, okay?

1093
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,600
You're on your own.

1094
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,300
DALTON: What makes you think
l need help?

1095
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,200
MADELElNE: Well,
the hundred people outside, for starters.

1096
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,700
DALTON: lt's not a problem.

1097
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,100
MADELElNE: And they're fueling
your jet right now as we speak.

1098
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,500
Come on. You're not that stupid.

1099
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,300
Here's what l'm thinking.

1100
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,100
lf you give up now,
l can ensure that you'll serve the minimum.

1101
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,400
l'm thinking three years,
four years at the most.

1102
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,600
You can arrange that?

1103
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,600
Well, you haven't hurt anyone
or stolen anything,

1104
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,900
so yes, as a matter of fact, l can.

1105
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,000
-lt's not good enough.
-Well, l wasn't finished.

1106
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,600
When you get out, you'll have $2 million.

1107
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,100
Will l? How?

1108
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,400
We'll put it someplace safe and it'll be
waiting for you when you get out.

1109
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,700
Thanks.

1110
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,000
But no, thanks.

1111
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,300
Oh, come on. l made you such a sweet offer.

1112
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,800
l really don't think you have much
in the way of alternatives.

1113
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,700
Why don't you talk to me about these
interests that you're in here to protect?

1114
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,600
-l'm afraid l can't.
-l can.

1115
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,300
Let me tell you a story.

1116
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,900
During World War ll, there was an American
working for a bank in Switzerland.

1117
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,900
DALTON: Now, I don't need to tell you
that this period in history

1118
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,900
was rife with opportunity
for people of low morals.

1119
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,000
People like this man.

1120
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,700
He used his position with the Nazis
to enrich himself while all around him

1121
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,400
people were being stripped
of everything they owned.

1122
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,800
Then he used his blood money
to start a bank.

1123
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,100
Now,

1124
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,500
does this sound like
it might be the man you work for?

1125
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,000
Or am l just whistling Dixie out of my ass?

1126
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,000
-l believe we understand each other.
-Good.

1127
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,800
So, what the hell can you do for me

1128
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,500
since l clearly know more than you do,
and l've planned this to perfection?

1129
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,700
Believe me, if l need to,
l can change your entire program.

1130
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So, the sooner
that you stop being my problem

1131
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,500
and you start becoming my solution,
the better off you'll be.

1132
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,100
-What is it you want?
-Two minutes.

1133
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:35,000
The safety deposit box room.
l just need to go to one box.

1134
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,900
Looking for this?

1135
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,000
This could be very embarrassing
to your employer.

1136
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,900
He should have destroyed this
a long time ago.

1137
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,000
He didn't, so now it's mine.

1138
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,400
Now, if the day ever comes
where l have to stand before a judge

1139
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,400
and account for what l did here,

1140
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,800
you and your boss
will do whatever it takes to help me.

1141
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,800
You get out of here with that envelope,

1142
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,600
and we'll pay you a lot of money.

1143
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,300
l'll keep that in mind.

1144
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,200
You're not gonna tell me how you're
planning to get out of here, are you?

1145
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,200
l'm gonna walk right out the front door.
Anything else?

1146
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,300
-How did you know about all this?
-Doesn't matter.

1147
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,800
Fact is, all lies, all evil deeds, they stink.

1148
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,500
You can cover them up for a while,
but they don't go away.

1149
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,000
-Murder will out?
-Precisely.

1150
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,200
Well, l still don't get what you're
doing here.

1151
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Really?

1152
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,100
DALTON: Good.

1153
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,700
So, we spoke.

1154
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,400
Oh, no. You're gonna have to give me
more than that.

1155
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,200
-Let me have this window, fellows.
-Yes, sir.

1156
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,100
l told him that, well,
since he hadn't killed anyone,

1157
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,100
it wasn't too late to surrender
and get off with a lighter sentence.

1158
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,300
And?

1159
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,900
And that was basically it.

1160
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,300
You know, l don't ordinarily get offended

1161
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,500
the first time somebody treats me
like an idiot, but you are pushing it.

1162
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,300
Now, l know you did not go in there
to tell this guy something he already knew.

1163
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,700
Talk to me.

1164
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,400
Look, Detective.

1165
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,800
Our arrangement doesn't include me
giving you a detailed explanation.

1166
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,700
l say it does, okay?

1167
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,500
Okay, you don't own me.

1168
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:13,800
This check-cashing thing, this coke bust,
l can face that on my own.

1169
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,300
l know what l did and what l didn't do.

1170
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,900
-Talk to me.
-Off the record?

1171
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,400
''Off the...'' Everything about you
is off the record. Just talk to me.

1172
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,400
-Well, l gave him an incentive.
-Okay.

1173
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,700
-Did he go for it?
-No. But l'd say he's considering it.

1174
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,800
He's smart, isn't he?

1175
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,700
-He thinks he is.
-Yeah.

1176
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,800
One of your types, like the lvy League type?

1177
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,900
-Clearly well educated.
-That's what l'm talking about.

1178
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,100
That's exactly what l'm talking about.

1179
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,100
You talk like him, so think like him.
What do you think he's gonna do?

1180
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,500
-Well, he's not gonna kill anyone.
-How do you know?

1181
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,800
-Because he's not a murderer.
-How do you know?

1182
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,500
l got news for you.
Most of the guys up in Sing Sing

1183
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,400
weren't murderers
until they killed somebody.

1184
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,600
You never know what a person will do
until you push him into a corner.

1185
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,000
But it doesn't seem
like you've pushed him into a corner.

1186
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,500
lt doesn't, does it?
Seems more like he chose the corner.

1187
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,500
You're right.

1188
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,000
So, you through?

1189
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,300
-l guess. Are you saying l'm dismissed?
-Yes, l am.

1190
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,500
You got a card, in case l need to call you?

1191
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,500
Please don't take this personally, but no.

1192
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,300
l don't think you can afford me.

1193
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,800
Well, don't take this personally, Miss White.
Kiss my black ass, okay?

1194
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,600
Careful, Detective Frazier.
My bite's much worse than my bark.

1195
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,800
-So, how old are you, Brian?
-Eight and three-quarters.

1196
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,400
Eight and three-quarters. Big boy.

1197
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
-Were you scared in there?
-No.

1198
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,500
-No? Not at all, huh?
-Nope. l'm from Brooklyn.

1199
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,300
You're from Brooklyn, huh? l understand.

1200
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,100
-Guns don't scare me.
-They don't scare you?

1201
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,500
-Brave, too, huh?
-Yeah.

1202

this thing is a mess.

They thought this one out, soup to nuts.

1630

So, lay it out for me.

1631
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,800
We photograph everybody
that came out of the bank.

1632
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,700
We sit them down, we question them,
we show them the photos.

1633
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,100
Most of them can't point to anybody
that's guilty of anything.

1634
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:28,400
We ask them if they could recognize
anybody who was not one of the bad guys.

1635
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:31,200
Even if we considered someone
as a possible suspect,

1636
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,000
there's one or two or three other people
that would rule them out.

01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,600
lt's like the thing never happened.

1638
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,300
-What about prints?
-Everywhere. So what?

1639
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:42,700
-All it shows is that these people were there.
-Alibis?

1640
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,200
Just about everyone.

1641
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,200
Even if their alibi was weak,

1642
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,300
a hostage would identify them
as being one of the good guys.

1643
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,000
There we are, back to square one.

1644
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,100
Priors?

1645
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,500
We got one employee who had
some juvie stuff. One customer had...

1646
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,900
Excuse me.

1647
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,300
One customer had an out-of-state warrant
for child support.

1648
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,100
Another one had a couple of priors,
G.L.A. mostly.

1649
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,000
Again, same problem.
Plus, he was a fucking idiot.

1650
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,100
-Bank cameras?
-Useless.

1651
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,600
l'm telling you,
they thought of everything. Almost.

1652
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,000
-Sounded like everything to me.
-But this.

1653
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,300
We haven't found that .357
or the perp that was holding it.

1654
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,200

1655
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,500
-Bury it.
-Bury it?

1656
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,000
What the fuck do you expect me to say?

1657
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,400
Captain, this thing stinks to high hell.
l mean, somebody did something here.

1658
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,100
You said it yourself.

1659
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,800
You got no robbery. No suspects.

1660

Nobody's breathing down my neck
to come up with answers.

1661
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:42,200
l'm not gonna breathe down yours. Bury it.

1662
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,600
l wasn't expecting this.

l'll find you guys more cases to solve.

Okay.

1665

Oh, here's something
that you probably did expect.

1666

-They found that missing Madrugada money.
-No shit.

1667
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,600
Yes, you want to know where it was?

1668

-ln my bank account?
-No.

-My summer house in Sag Harbor?
-No.

1670

-My wallet?
-No.

Michael Corleone style.

1677

do you renounce Satan?''

1678

-Safety deposit box number 392.

1681
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:47,300

-l got a job to do, Miss White.

1690
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,900

more important than your career?

-We didn't have any arrangement.

and you press here to play.

1695

MADELElNE: (OVER RECORDER) There's
also the matter of the $140,000

1696
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,100
that seems to have walked away

1697
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,800
from the Madrugada check-cashing bust.

1698
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,300
FRAZlER: I didn't have anything
to do with that, so...

1699
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,400
MAYOR: We'd like to be
in your corner on that.

1700
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:49,300
In exchange for what? I mean, what,
do you want me to do something unethical?

1701
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,400
I mean, no disrespect to the both of youse

1702
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,500
but I don't need you
to be in my corner, Mr. Mayor.

1703
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,000
Look, I'm innocent.

1704
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,800
MADELElNE: Innocent or guilty,
you're still going down.

1705
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:02,500
MAYOR: Give Miss White whatever
she needs, or your career is over.

1706
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,300
Done.

1707
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:05,900
Kaput.

1708
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,300
So? You gave me what l wanted.

1709
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,400
Your career is blossoming
and all is right with the world.

1710
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,100
What was Case hiding?

1711
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:21,600
You know, there's a famous saying
by the Baron de Rothschild.

1712
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,600
''When there's blood on the streets,
buy property.''

1713
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,200
l think Mr. Case
really took that sentiment to heart.

1714
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,000
But he is no different
than half the Fortune 500.

1715
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,300
Let it go, Detective.

1716
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,400
You're a good cop.

1717
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,900
This city needs you.

1718
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:15,400
-Lady! Lady, you're in the wrong place.
-l have an appointment.

1719
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,300
Arthur.

1720
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,700
-Good morning.
-Miss White.

1721
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,800
Have a seat.

1722
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:35,500
Thank you, Vincent. That's all for now.
Thank you.

(CASE CLEARlNG THROAT)

1724
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,300
Well. What did he say?

1725
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:44,400
Well, Detective Frazier
turned out to be quite sharp.

1726
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,700
But l just fast-tracked his career a little
and he's under control.

1727
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:50,700
l hope so. Tell me about the envelope.

1728
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,300
Where is it now?

1729
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,300
Well, the gang leader
is going to hang on to it,

1730
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,500
as an insurance policy
to keep you from seeking revenge.

1731
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:01,900
Clearly, he has a very low opinion of you.

1732
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,400
And what might that be?

1733
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,600
Well, let's see.
ln a nutshell, that you got rich,

1734
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
doing business with the Nazis
during the Holocaust.

1735
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:14,400
Yes.

1736
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,600
lt was 60 years ago.
l was young and ambitious.

1737
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:22,100
l saw a short path to success and l took it.

1738
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:25,300
l sold my soul.

1739
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:30,000
And l've been trying to buy it back
ever since.

1740
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:34,500
But you and this mystery man,
you have an understanding?

1741
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,500
l think so. And he managed
to get out of there with that envelope.

1742
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:42,900
lf someday
he comes back to blackmail you, well,

1743
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:46,500
you'll pay him. And you'll get it back.

1744
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,900
-So, l guess that's it.
-l suppose so.

1745
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:51,900
-Bullshit.
-l beg your pardon?

1746
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,700
He didn't go through all that just to stick
your envelope under his mattress.

1747
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:58,700
Look, they left money untouched, Arthur.

1748
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,800
So?

1749
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:04,300
So, he had to have walked out of there
with something else.

1750
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,800
The bank says
that there was nothing missing.

1751
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,500
So, there had to have been
something in that box

1752
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:13,200
that was worth more to him
than your envelope.

1753
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,200
You don't have to tell me.

1754
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,700
There's only one thing it could be anyway.

1755
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,200
Diamonds.

1756
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,000
And then there's the ring.

1757
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,100
Cartier ring.

1758
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,700
lt belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.

1759
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,700
Wealthy family of French Jews.

1760
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,600
And when the war came along,
the ring and everything else they owned

1761
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,400
was confiscated and they were shipped off
to concentration camps. None survived.

1762
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,200
We were friends.

1763
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,900
l could have helped them.

1764
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:57,400
But the Nazis paid too well.

1765

Can l trust that you will keep
what you've learned

here today confidential?

Despite whatever you may think?

1768
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,500
Yes, Arthur.

1769
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,500
Well, l'd love to tell you
what a monster you are,

01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,800
but l have to help bin Laden's nephew
buy a co-op on Park Avenue.

01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,900
My name is Dalton Russell.

1775
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,300
Pay strict attention to what l say

1776
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,900
because l choose my words carefully
and l never repeat myself.

1777
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,700
I've told you my name. That's the ''who''.

1778
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:10,400
The ''where'' could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

1779
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,700
But there is a vast difference

1780
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:16,100
between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.

1781

The ''what'' is easy.

Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

1783
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,200
That's also the ''when''.

1784
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:33,500
As for the ''why'',
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

1785
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,100
it's exceedingly simple.

1786
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,000
Because I can.

1787
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,200
Which leaves us only with the ''how. ''

1788
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:45,100
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

1789

01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,400
Just like he planned.

1806
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,000
l got a court order here
to open a safe deposit box.

1807
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,100
Number 392.

1808
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:27,400
(STEVE-O SlGHlNG)

1809
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:31,000
STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.

1810
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,200
Where is it?

1811
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,400
l left it in there.

1812
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,200
This way, Detectives.

1813
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,900
Why did you do that? You left the ring.

1814
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,200
Trust me.

1815
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,800
l left it in good hands.

1816
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,300
DALTON: I'm no martyr.

1817
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,700
I did it for the money.

1818
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,900
But it's not worth much
if you can't face yourself in the mirror.

1819
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,500
Respect is the ultimate currency.

1820
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,200
I was stealing from a man
who traded his away for a few dollars.

1821
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,700
And then he tried to wash away his guilt.

1822
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:18,800
Drown it in a lifetime of good deeds
and a sea of respectability.

1823
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:21,800
-Let me get that.
-Let me.

1824
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,300
It almost worked, too.

1825
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,500
Okay.

1826
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,000
But inevitably,

1827
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,100
the further you run from your sins,

1828
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,800
the more exhausted you are
when they catch up to you.

1829
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,300
And they do.

1830
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,800
Son of a bitch.

1831
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,100
Certain.

1832
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,700
It will not fail.

1833
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,200
FRAZlER: What do you think that's worth?

1834
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:53,100
(CHUCKLlNG) lf you got to ask, man,
you can't afford it.

1835
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,500
Thank goodness my girlfriend ain't here.

1836
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,500
''Follow the ring''?

1837
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:16,400
-Detective Frazier.
-Mr. Case.

1838
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,700
-How are you?
-l am great.

1839
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,300
Nobody got killed at the bank.
Everybody's happy. My kind of day.

1840
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,500
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

1841
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,300
-Detective Mitchell.
-Mr. Case.

1842
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,300
-Be seated, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

1843
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,700
-Can l offer you anything?
-No.

1844
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,400
l must say

1845
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,200
l was most impressed

1846
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,300
by the way you handled that business.

1847
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,700
Thank you, Mr. Case.

1848
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,700
Whenever l hear the term
''New York's Finest''

1849
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,500
you're who l think of.

1850
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:46,800
You keep the rest of us safe
and make it look easy.

1851
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:51,500
-Pardon me.
-Well, what's so amusing?

1852
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,400
When you say ''the rest of us,'' Mr. Case,
l mean, you got to look around.

1853
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:58,500
''The rest of us'' is a category
that you haven't qualified for in a long time.

1854
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,300
Touche, Detective.
l won't deny it. l've done well.

1855
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,600
Yes, you have. But l'm very confused.

1856
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,500
You see, l got a case

1857
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,100
where armed robbers
laid siege to your bank.

1858
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:10,500
lt is your bank, right?

1859
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:12,500
Well, l'm Chairman of the Board of Directors.

1860
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,300
Then ita-zita-vene-gazoo.

1861
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,300
The robbers disappear. Poof.

1862
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:18,000
And they don't take a nickel, right?

1863
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,400
-You're asking me?
-Yes, l'm asking you.

1864
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,700
l mean, it's your bank. You own it.
l'm asking you.

1865
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,700
lt's a tiny part of our organization.

1866
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,900
No robbers. No real victims.
No loot missing.

1867
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
lt's got to be the first time
in law-enforcement history.

1868
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,300
l never heard of it before.

1869
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,400
So, you got to ask yourself, ''What the fuck
happened?'' Don't you, Mr. Case?

1870
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,100
l'm not quite sure l like your tone, Officer.

1871
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,500
You don't like my tone?
Then give me a straight answer.

1872
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:41,400
lt's the founding bank of your empire.
You built it. lt's your baby.

1873
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Give me a straight answer.
What do you think happened?

1874
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:47,200
-l have no idea.
-Oh, come on, now. Come on.

1875
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,800
l'll tell you what l think happened.

1876
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:51,000
l think you sent that woman in there
to patch things up.

1877
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,600
Miss White. l think you paid her.
What was she doing in there?

1878
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,200
Look, this is absurd.

1879
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:57,200
Are you implying that
l had anything to do with it?

1880
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,900
392.

1881
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:02,000
Safe deposit box 392.
What's the story on that?

1882
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:04,400
-l have no idea what you're...
-Don't lie to me, Mr. Case.

1883
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:07,000
-l don't lie.
-l looked at all the records.

1884
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:10,600
All the bank records
for safe deposit boxes at your bank.

1885
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,400
At first glance, everything looked fine,

1886
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,600
but there was one safe deposit box
that had no records.

1887
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,700
l mean, going all the way back to 1948.

1888
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,900
So l started thinking.
Who would have the answer to this riddle?

1889
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,800
Probably the man who forgot to mention

1890
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,200
that he built the bank
in the first place in 1948.

1891
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:29,000
lt doesn't add up, Mr. Case.
lt does not add up.

1892
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:34,300
l'm afraid l can't be
of any further use to you, Detective.

1893
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:38,100
lt's something really bad, isn't it?

1894
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:43,300
Mr. Frazier, l have spent
my whole life serving humanity.

1895
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
You can ask anyone who knows me.

1896
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:51,200
They'll vouch for me,
and for the things that l've done.

1897
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,300
You think they'll vouch for you
after l find out the truth about this ring?

1898
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,800
l don't think so.

1899
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:03,500
Oh, by the way, that thing you said
about us being New York's finest?

1900
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:06,200
l want you to know,
we really appreciate that.

1901
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,300
How gracious.

1902
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,600
Let's go. We're gonna follow that ring.

1903
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,200
-Hey, Keith, let me see your shoe.
-What?

1904
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,800
-Let me see your shoe.
-Why?

1905
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:27,000
'Cause l have never seen anybody
put their foot that far up a guy's ass.

1906
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,600
Yeah, l guess l did, didn't l?

1907
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:34,300
Oh, man. You cut him an ass
the length of the Lincoln Tunnel.

1908
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,700
We're gonna need a traffic cop on that shit.

1909
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:46,900
Good afternoon, sir.

1910
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,800
-Do you have a reservation?
-Looking for the Mayor.

1911
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,900
-May l have your hat, please?
-No, you cannot. Get your own.

1912
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,500
MADELElNE: They're looking to invest
$4 billion over the next four years.

1913
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:54,800
And that's all in place.

1914
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,700
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Mayor,
but there's an old American saying,

1915
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,600
''When there's blood on the streets,
somebody's got to go to jail.''

1916
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:05,300
Edwin, could you please excuse us
for a minute?

1917
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,100
MAYOR: What's this about, Detective?

1918
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,500
l believe Detective Frazier
is looking for some closure?

1919
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,200
That's a good word. Closure.

1920
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,900
Case closed, you know what l mean?

1921
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:19,300
This is the number

1922
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,300
of the War Crimes lssues office
in Washington, D.C.

1923
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,700
How'd you like to be on the front page
of the New York Times?

1924
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:28,900
That'd be great.

1925
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,200
Make sure they spell my name right, though.
That's Frazier with a ''z''.

1926
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,900
You can keep the pen.

1927
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,200
You made copies?

1928
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,000
Please.

1929
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,700
We got to keep the real criminals
off the streets, Your Honor.

1930
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,900
All right, well, thanks for lunch.

1931
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:53,900
War crimes, huh?

1932
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,900
What have you got me into this time?

1933
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,400
(SNORlNG SOFTLY)

1934
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:17,600
Mama?

1935
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:25,000
-Did you bring Big Willie?
-And the twins.

1936
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,000
Slow down, girl.

1937
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,400
l'll get my gun off
before l get my gun off, okay?

1938
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,800
Pow, pow.

1939
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,400
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

1940
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,800
FRAZlER: Why don't you
just walk out the door?

1941
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,000
DALTON: I will.

1942
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:34,100
I'm gonna walk out of that door
when I'm good and ready.

1943
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,500
Son of a bitch.

1944
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,800
Come on, honey.
The handcuffs are getting cold.

1945
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:35,300
THE END
