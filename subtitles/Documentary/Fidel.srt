1
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:43,257
Excuse me.

2
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:46,786
Want take a ride in
Batista's old Cadillac?

3
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:52,165
No, really, really. Let me help you.
Where are you going?

4
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:56,161
That book's not gonna help you.
Come on, l'll take you. No problem.

5
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:00,901
You're gonna love this ride.

6
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,367
You like seafood?

7
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:07,081
I could take you to Hemingway's
favorite watering hole:

8
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,384
La Floridita.

9
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:11,814
That 's where he used
to drink his 'mojitos'.

10
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,514
It 's the best lobster in all of
Havana. Really. Delicious.

11
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:19,751
They have oysters, turtle.

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,564
Did you hear that when
our great 'El Pappa Fidel'...

13
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,562
Hold on one second.

14
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,835
Our leader, was presented with
a Galapagos turtle...

15
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:32,506
he asked,
'How long does it live?'

16
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:34,705
'Four hundred years'.

17
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,038
So Fidel hands it back.
'Four hundred years?!

18
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,804
That 's the trouble with pets.

19
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:43,178
You get attached to them
and then they die on you.'

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,254
He never dies.

21
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:16,483
- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, teacher.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,988
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

23
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,352
You know that we live in Cuba.

24
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,151
In what city?

25
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,955
Havana, Cuba.

26
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:32,293
Havana...

27
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:37,303
Cuba. And what is
today's date?

28
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,969
February, 15th.

29
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:43,402
And Tracy, what year?

30
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,470
Two thousand and one.

31
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:49,475
Yes, two thousand and one.

32
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,112
All right. Now take out
your books, please.

33
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:56,415
Today we're going to study
the life of Jose Marti.

34
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,560
You cannot call yourself
a Cuban, any of you...

35
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:03,424
until you know the story
of Jose Marti.

36
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:07,830
Jose Marti died fighting for
the freedom of Cuba.

37
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:19,391
- L'll drive.
- Yes, commander.

38
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,599
I love you too. Bye.

39
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,744
Watch this.

40
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,080
Come up.

41
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,279
Come on.

42
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:08,932
Fidel! Raul! The sailors are
pissing on Jose Marti's statue!

43
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:10,805
Come on!

44
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:16,350
Stewey! Look at me!

45
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:22,113
Matt, come on up here!

46
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:25,484
Arturo!

47
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:27,725
Get that one up here.

48
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,693
No! Yeah, me!
Take my picture!

49
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:34,228
Hold on, hold on! It 's coming.
Get the picture, go!

50
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:41,902
Justice! Justice!

51
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,605
Justice! Justice!

52
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:48,578
Justice! Justice!

53
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,115
Please! Please!

54
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:03,457
You have my personal apologies
for the inexcusable behavior...

55
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,567
of a half-dozen of our boys, who
had a few too many rum and cokes.

56
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,636
- We don't want your apologies!
- Give us the sailors who did it!

57
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:17,806
I assure you we do not take lightly
the nearly sacred importance...

58
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:21,743
to your country
of the memory of...

59
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,550
- What 's his name?
- Jose Marti.

60
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,323
Marti. Marti.
Jose Marti.

61
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,958
Please...

62
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,025
Please, remember the many years of
friendship between our countries...

63
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:46,299
and the help we gave you in winning
your independence from Spain.

64
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:04,186
Let me tell you about our country.

65
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:08,091
0ur history. The truth!

66
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,666
1898...

67
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:19,200
after thirty year of fighting
for our freedom...

68
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:22,302
after Jose Marti...

69
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,037
Jose Marti?! Can you say
his name now, Ambassador?

70
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:37,721
After Jose Marti and fifty thousand
of my people...

71
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:42,590
of your people, who'd given their
lives to be freed from Spain...

72
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,992
do you know what happened
then, Ambassador?

73
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:50,569
Your president, Roosevelt...
Yes, we do not forget his name!

74
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:58,504
He stole our independence
from us.

75
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:04,116
More history for you.
Who came out of our war...

76
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:07,652
with an empire from the
Philippines to Puerto Rico?

77
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,187
Shall we tell him?

78
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:11,722
You! You!

79
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,661
- Who is that?
- No idea, sir.

80
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,799
And who for the last 50 years
have seized our land and...

81
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:24,233
stolen our sugar, and turned us
into people who have nothing...

82
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:29,035
...because it belongs to you?
- You! You!

83
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:32,809
- You! You!
- 0ut! 0ut!

84
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,516
0ut! 0ut!

85
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:42,178
0ut! 0ut!

86
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:51,660
Come on.

87
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,961
You cannot stay here.

88
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,168
Rafael!

89
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:12,475
- I have to find my brother!
- So you're Mirta?

90
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,420
- Rafael!
- Are you all right?

91
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:19,058
She's fine.

92
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,257
My brother is staying for dinner.

93
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,660
- Hey.
- Hi.

94
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:41,204
Just in time.

95
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,469
<i>The tlme Is now elght o'clock and</i>

00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:19,070
to the construction of his private
pleasure palace in Guatemala.

104
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,043
Three million pesos...

105
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:25,117
<i>that we, people of Cuba,</i>
<i>so desperately need.</i>

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,492
to the mothers of
the children of Cuba!

111

113
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:55,648
Next Sunday, Eddy brings
the whole house down.

114
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,713
- Lf they don't kill him first.
- Just let them try.

115
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,014
Just let them try.

116
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:05,985
Where did we put
the other flyers we had?

117
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,219
We're going to create
a human wall around him.

118
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,299
Here, Eddy!

119
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:15,935
Eddy?!

120
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:19,129
I don't have the evidence.
It was promised me for tonight.

121
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,808
- From whom?
- Some Prio's men led me to believe...

122
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:24,569
they wanted Arango
brought to justice.

123
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,772
I thought I could trust them, but they
crossed me. They have set me up.

124
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,451
- Cancel the broadcast.
- How can I?

125
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,587
- I cannot.
- What are you going to say?

126
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,087
Eddy, listen to me.
What are you going to say?

127
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,726
This is radio CMQ.
The time is now 8 o'clock...

128
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,230
and we have the pleasure of
bringing to your homes once again...

129
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:50,233
the voice of the 0rtodoxo Party...

130
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:53,839
Senator Doctor Eduardo Chibas.

131
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:59,169
Despite the constant
depredations of Batista...

132
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,109
of Carlos Prio...

133
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:05,445
the true sensibility of the Cuban
people has not been dulled.

134
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:09,152
Because of our
geographical situation...

135
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,684
<i>and the rlch magnitude of our soll,</i>
<i>and above all...</i>

136
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:15,328
What 's he doing? Why isn't he
coming our with the proof?

137
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,087
He will.

138
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:19,163
He's not even talking about it.

139
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,835
<i>...her destlny wlll come true!</i>

140
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,333
We have had our historical destiny...

141
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:29,999
<i>frustrated because of</i>
<i>the corruptlon of our rulers.</i>

142
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:35,081
Ruler after ruler, year after year!

143
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:40,653
We must never again be ruled by this
government, corrupted to the bone!

144
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,346
Nor must we vote for Batista!

145
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,985
<i>We apologlze forthe Interruptlon...</i>

<i>go over its allotted tlme.</i>

149
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:58,336
What 's going on?
Why did you switch him off?

150
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,869
...and then gave the rest
to the Yankees!

151
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:06,711
He's off the air and he doesn't
know they cut him off.

152
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:12,276
People of Cuba, arise!
People of Cuba, in the name...

153
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:16,115
of economic independence,
political liberty...

154
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:20,158
and social justice, wake up!
Wake up!

155
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,352
Wake up!

156
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:25,555
This is my last...

00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,700
knock at your door.

158
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:29,935
Jesus!

159
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,968
We have to take him now!

160
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:40,108
Move! Move!

161
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:46,309
I was in the radio studio.
I helped to bring him in.

162
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,682
L'm a lawyer. I have been
campaigning for him.

163
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:57,159
Yes, l've heard of you.
Natalia Revuelta Fernandez.

164
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,492
Can you tell Dr. Fernandez
that his wife is here, please?

165
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,532
Yes, madam.

166
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:06,165
- Your husband is in there?
- He is a heart specialist.

167
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:09,342
And Eddy is a very good
friend of ours.

168
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,671
Whatever happens now,
Agramonte will take over.

169
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:18,442
L've heard very good things about
your work for the 0rtodoxo Party.

170
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:23,389
Perhaps you'll give me your address
and l'll send an invitation to dinner.

171
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:25,559
Yes, thank you.

172
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:32,094
L'm sorry to say that the injures of
Dr. Eduardo Chibas are too severe.

173
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:34,028
He's not going to survive.

174
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:37,534
I cannot give you any more
information at this moment. L'm sorry.

175
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,933
You can come in and see him now.

176
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:44,673
I am sure we will meet again.

177
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:47,609
- My address.
- Yes, thank you.

178
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:53,149
<i>...a promlse to the people of Cuba.</i>

179
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:56,983
<i>So he took the only honorable way</i>
<i>out. The shootlng of Eddy Chlbas...</i>

180
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:00,456
<i>was not sulclde.</i>
<i>Thls was murder!</i>

181
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:04,097
<i>That was Fldel Castro, memberof</i>
<i>the Chlbas campalgn team...</i>

182
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:07,495
<i>speaklng from Inslde</i>
<i>the hospital tonlght.</i>

183
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,938
We have no hospital
to take our children.

184
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,937
Doctors will not even come here.

185
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:18,869
The most important thing now
for you to do...

186
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:24,876
for all of you now, is to vote.

187
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,519
With your vote...

188
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,952
I promise, and promise again, that
if you elect me to represent you...

189
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,887
l'll build hospitals and
bring doctors to you.

190
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:38,723
Too many presidents have promised
clean water, hospitals, doctors.

191
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:44,735
But they kept it all for themselves.
What of our freedom and our land?

192
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:48,466
It 's only their freedom
and their land.

193
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:52,203
Eddy Chibas was going to
give Cuba back to us.

194
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:55,974
But the man who carries the
fallen torch of Eddy Chibas...

195
00:18:56,183 --> 00:19:01,621
who carries with him the hopes for
the future, is Roberto Agramonte.

196
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:17,568
Mirta, Agramonte is 16 points
ahead of the Prio Party.

197
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:22,132
16 points!
0ne week left!

198
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:25,073
And Batista is so far behind...

199
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,942
that he might as well go back to
his gangster friends in Miami.

200
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,189
Agramonte is going to be
the next president.

201
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,624
Carlos Prio...

202
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,733
has fled the island.

203
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:55,838
But, until we have cleansed
our beloved country...

204
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,740
of the corruption and crime
that are his legacy...

205
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:05,046
free and honest elections
cannot possibly take place.

206
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:09,283
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

207
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,759
- L've been trying to phone you!
- The phone is not working.

208
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,894
- Haven't you heard the radio?
- Heard what?

209
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:16,585
- There's been a coup.
- A coup?

210
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:20,733
Batista. We have to get out of here.
The police are in the street now.

211
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,768
Stay here with Fidelito.
You will be all right.

212
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,233
- Where are my shoes?
- Here, here.

213
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:31,736
Batista won't hurt you if you tell
him you're from Diaz-Balart Family.

214
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,847
- You have to say that, all right?
- Here, here.

215
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:37,878
Be careful.

216
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,315
There they go.

217
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,753
- See you.
- See you.

218
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,197
- Fidel Castro?!
- He is not here.

219
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,799
He did not come home last night.

220
00:21:10,551 --> 00:21:12,542
L'm Mirta Diaz-Balart.

221
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:20,825
- Have you talked to Mirta?
- L'm gonna see her today.

222
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:25,258
- You shouldn't be taking those risks.
- Yes.

223
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:30,494
You know your brother-in-law
is working for Batista?

224
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:34,463
Rafael?

225
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,667
He's in charge of
his youth organization.

226
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:44,778
Nothing will ever change here
without a revolution.

227
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,944
- You should join the Communist Party.
- Communist?

228
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:53,718
They're not interested in revolution.
They run away from action!

229
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:57,454
The only way to get rid of Batista,
and the only way to change things...

230
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,997
is to create a revolutionary army.

231
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,863
And I don't mean a few guys throwing
grenades at the government buildings.

232
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:06,505
I mean an army.

233
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:09,904
It 's the only way to stop the coups
and the corruption forever.

234
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:12,871
How else do we change things?

235
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:18,482
I need you. I need you
to do this with me.

236
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:20,844
What do you think?

237
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:23,489
Sir! Excuse me, sir.

238
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,855
My name is Abel.
Abel Santamaria.

239
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:33,193
I want to meet you since you jumped
on the car at the American Embassy.

240
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,804
There is a group of us.

241
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:43,738
Twenty of us...

242
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:48,176
planning to bring down Batista.
Will you meet with us?

243
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,108
What do you mean bring down?

244
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,746
By any means we can.

245
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,050
Good.

246
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:02,018
Good.

247
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:07,700
I believe that now is the time
we can do it.

248
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:11,064
But revolution means...

249
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:15,207
that we have to be prepared
to sacrifice everything.

250
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:21,575
Every one of us has to give up
his own private dreams and desires.

251
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:25,650
From this moment on
our only dream and desire...

252
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:31,189
is the liberation of Cuba.
Nothing else matters to us.

253
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:37,922
How old are you?
26? 28?

254
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,530
- 22.
- My God! 22!

255
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:49,542
Maybe you wonder if you will marry,
who will you marry...

256
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,678
or what it feels like
to be a mother.

257
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:58,144
Tonight you have to tear
all that out of your heart.

258
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,188
Pedro...

259
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:10,762
you want to grow old and see a long
line of sons and grandsons prosper?

260
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:13,330
Tonight, if you are with us...

261
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:20,366
the only legacy you'll leave, it's
the new Cuba we are going to create.

262
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:25,005
Is it worth the sacrifice
of our private dreams?

263
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:30,515
That is what each of us
have to decide right now.

264
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,186
In 30 seconds.

265
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:38,985
So?

266
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:41,252
Is everybody together?

267
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:45,328
Yes!

268
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:54,029
Fidel Castro.

269
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:56,334
So you finally needed me.

270
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,406
Good.

271
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:06,650
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

272
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,321
My husband's at work.

273
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:20,599
Can you get pamphlets
and flyers published?

274
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:24,066
Yes, I have good contacts
with printers, of course.

275
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,737
And if the pamphlets called for
an armed insurrection?

276
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:38,310
- Is that the direction you're going?
- It 's the only direction.

277
00:25:41,722 --> 00:25:44,885
So, if I gave you some
of my writings, can you...

278
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,083
0f course!

279
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:50,589
Thank you.

280
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:53,563
And you think you can
bring Batista down?

281
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:56,994
How?

282
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:02,705
I don't know...

283
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,002
yet.

284
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,442
You're taking a big risk if you're
going to call for armed insurrection.

285
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:12,251
If you do not take risks...

286
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,117
then nothing happens.

287
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:17,119
No.

288
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:45,651
Relax the shoulders, Faustino.

289
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,256
So we've got a communist
with us now!

290
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:59,454
That 's good!
You're just in time.

291
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,224
- How are you?
- Fine.

292
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:08,000
All right. Look. Where will Batista
expect an attack on his army?

293
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,173
- Camp Columbia, absolutely.
- Always Havana.

294
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,746
So we go to Santiago, here.

295
00:27:15,949 --> 00:27:18,941
- Moncada.
- The barracks?

296
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:22,986
We attack the barracks at dawn,
the twenty-sixth of July.

297
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:26,350
Just in the middle of
Santiago Carnival.

298
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:33,694
I don't have much time.
L'm leaving for Santiago in an hour.

299
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,098
- Santiago? Why Santiago?
- To take the Moncada barracks.

300
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:40,102
My God.

301
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:43,470
- Is it possible?
- 0f course. We've everything planned.

302
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:47,078
The Manifesto.
Raul Gomez Garcia has written it.

303
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,838
Wonderful.

304
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:54,180
We attack the barracks at dawn.
You're the only person who knows it.

305
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:58,316
As soon as we are inside and
the fort is secure, we'll call you.

306
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:01,926
Then you release this manifesto to
the radio stations, newspapers...

307
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:04,587
- To everyone, of course.
- 0f course.

308
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,698
- Why Moncada?
- It has the armory...

309
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:13,100
and everything else we need. We can
protect the revolution from there...

310
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,968
and then it will sweep the country.

311
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,684
Everything is planned for
an attack at 5:15.

312
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:31,119
In 3 hours and 12 minutes.

313
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:35,519
This moment now is the start
of the beginning...

314
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:40,530
of the freedom of Cuba. And it 's
your destiny to be a part of it.

315
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:45,135
Today our movement will triumph.
Today and forever...

316
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:48,796
we will be setting an example
for the people of Cuba.

317
00:28:49,376 --> 00:28:53,039
And from this day,
they'll pick up our banner...

318
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,578
and they'll move forward
to victory with us.

319
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,048
Get down!

320
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,981
Quiet!

321
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:09,159
Don't be afraid!
We are not going to hurt you.

322
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:33,417
Jesus!

323
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:36,520
Clear the gate.
The general is coming.

324
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:38,020
General?

325
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:40,284
Right now?

326
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:45,294
L'll do it.

327
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:49,566
How are you?

328
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,112
The armory's up there.

329
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,409
Go! Go! Go!

330
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,465
Armory!

331
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:35,376
Ready to shoot!

332
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,327
Fidel!

333
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:56,865
Go! Go!

334
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:06,670
Cease fire!

335
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,952
- Where are they?
- They left, went down the backstairs!

336
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:51,817
- Nobody went down that way.
- Will you please take your men out?

337
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:54,084
There are very sick people here.

338
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,897
She's lying.

339
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:04,230
This man is one of the leaders.

340
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,033
0ut of the bed.
0ut of the bed!

341
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:11,233
- No, you can't. He's very sick.
- 0ut of the bed!

342
00:32:30,964 --> 00:32:36,527
You tell the officers in the barracks
they can do whatever they want...

343
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:38,704
with those prisoners.

344
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:45,835
Hurry! Move!

345
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:31,922
Haydee Santamaria?

346
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:37,792
I have something of
your brother's here.

347
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:53,108
Nineteen of my boys
died this morning.

348
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:58,073
They would be alive
at this moment...

349
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,014
had it not been for your brother.

350
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,755
L'll tell them to stop
torturing your brother...

351
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,891
if you tell me who else...

352
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:13,224
led this attack.

353
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,175
So?

354
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:28,607
Do you want us to take out
the other eye?

355
00:34:31,217 --> 00:34:36,655
If you took out his eye and
he did not tell you anything...

356
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,826
do you think l'll tell you
anything now?

357
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:48,497
Then you have just
killed your brother.

358
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:12,784
Do you think it 's possible that they
have made it out of the hospital?

359
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:25,266
<i>Fortunately, our brave forces under</i>
<i>the courageous General Chavlano...</i>

360
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:28,236
<i>fought off the cowardly assault</i>
<i>whlch we suspect was backed...</i>

361
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:31,035
<i>by forelgn or communlst plotters.</i>

362
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:35,408
<i>Thls was a ruthless and unprovoked</i>
<i>attack on ouryoung soldlers.</i>

363
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:39,676
<i>We do not know If any of the</i>
<i>murderous rebels came out allve.</i>

364
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:06,674
Come out!
You are totally surrounded.

365
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:46,145
Were you in Santiago de Cuba
on the 26th of July?

366
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:48,547
Yes, I was.

367
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:51,653
Did you take part in the attack?

368
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,654
Yes, I did.

369
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,865
So you admit then that you sought
to bring about an uprising...

370
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,126
against the constitutional
powers of the State?

371
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:07,795
In what country is the
Honorable Prosecutor living?

372
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:11,704
The dictatorship that oppresses our
nation is not a constitutional power.

373
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,573
Your Honor, please ask the defendant
to restrict his replies...

374
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,544
to a direct answer to the question.

375
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:19,650
L'm answering the question
in the only way I can.

376
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:23,083
The legitimate constitution is that
which emanates directly...

377
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,280
from a sovereign people.

378
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:30,519
The half million farm workers
who live in absolute poverty...

379
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,167
the 400,000 people, whose retirement
funds have been embezzled...

380
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:39,805
by Batista's officials,
the children who die...

381
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:43,533
Do you ask him for how long
he has been unemployed?

382
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:46,735
Do you ask him how many
children he has?

383
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:50,279
Which days of the week he had food
to eat and which days he didn't?

384
00:37:50,483 --> 00:37:53,714
...those who steal because
they are hungry.

385
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,357
But none of the men who steal
millions from the government...

386
00:37:58,558 --> 00:38:02,358
has ever spent
one single night in jail.

387
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,390
I quote from a document precious
to the freedom...

388
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,592
of the United States of America...

389
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:18,101
'We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

390
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:22,008
That all men are created equal.

391
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:25,540
That they are all endowed
by their Creator...

392
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:28,880
with certain inalienable rights.

393
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:33,522
That among these are life...

394
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:35,193
liberty...

395
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:37,363
and the pursuit of happiness.

396
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,925
That, whenever
any form of government...

397
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,158
becomes destructive
to these ends...

398
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:46,498
it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it...

399
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:49,869
and to create a new government.'

400
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:57,141
I don't fear prison.

401
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,979
Neither do I fear
those who have tortured...

402
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:05,317
and killed 70 of my comrades.

403
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,385
Condemn me.

404
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,961
It does not matter.

405
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:14,929
History will absolve me.

406
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:19,002
Fidel Castro, I sentence you
to fifteen years in prison.

407
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,036
Fifteen years?

408
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,435
Fifteen months, at the most.

409
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,045
<i>'Everyday, I feel my bellef...</i>

413
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:53,563

<i>the freedom of all of us.'</i>

416
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:04,879
Twenty-six of July,
Batista killed our comrades.

417
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:10,855
<i>'Batlsta's blggest mlstake Is to</i>

- Every month we are...
- Batista? What is he doing here?

420
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,866
- Batista son-of-a-bitch!

And she's leaving the country
at the end of the week.

436

Where is she going?

437
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:17,211
United States.

No, she is not!

My son brought up in the U. S?
She can go where the hell she wants.

Never in our history, has Cuba
been more economically healthy...

454
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:29,150
We should have killed him,
not captured him.

455
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:32,186
- Now we are stuck with him.
- The longer we keep him in prison...

456
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,222
the more popular he becomes.

457
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:38,693
If we drive him into exile, the CIA
will be able to help us control him...

458
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:41,627
and make sure
he never comes back.

Look here, Fidel!

00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:06,883
We will continue the struggle for
the freedom of the people of Cuba.

463
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,858
The war against poverty and
despotism will continue.

The lives of many of our dear
friends have been sacrificed...

00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:19,200
and must never be forgotten!

466
00:44:19,672 --> 00:44:21,697
Every man here in front of you...

467
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:26,071
is prepared to lay down his life
for the freedom of Cuba!

468
00:44:26,278 --> 00:44:29,111
And today I announce...

469
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:33,250
the founding of the
'Movement of Twenty-Six of July'...

470
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:37,047
dedicated to the men
whose blood was shed...

471
00:44:37,256 --> 00:44:39,986
at the heroic assault on
The Moncada.

472
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:42,558
This is just the beginning!

473
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:52,168
- Batista has plans to assassinate me.
- I expect he has.

474
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:55,498
Raul has gone to Mexico.

475
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:58,333
And you are going too.

476
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:01,871
Yes, but I will be back.

477
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:05,574
I will train an army there.

478
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:11,383
- He should never have released you.
- It does not matter what he does.

479
00:45:12,024 --> 00:45:15,482
He will lose, sooner or later.

480
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:20,223
Mexico is where
we prepare for victory.

481
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:22,765
Would you like me
to come with you?

482
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:27,029
- 0f course.
- You haven't asked.

483
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:31,771
0f course I would. Can you?
I didn't think that you...

484
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:34,639
That 's it. Come with me,
next week.

485
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:37,175
I cannot.

486
00:45:37,383 --> 00:45:39,851
- Why?
- L'm pregnant.

487
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:42,552
And it 's your child.

488
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,468
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

489
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:11,339
Maria is actually married to this
wonderful guy, Avelino.

490
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,780
He's a wrestler.
He's very good.

491
00:46:13,986 --> 00:46:18,252
He has a friend who's also a
wrestler. His name is Vanegas Arroyo.

492
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:22,018
He's a wonderful man. He's sitting
right over there. He'd help us train.

493
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:25,857
But he's also a printer. Said that
he'd print for us anything we need.

494
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:28,431
- Good.
- Right now we have this cheap room...

495
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:32,070
at the downtown motel,
but it 's nice and it's clean.

496
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:36,435
- We can use it as long as we want.
- It 's the biggest screw-up in history.

497
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:39,270
Look at Batista.
He's the worst man for Cuba...

498
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:43,471
he's the dictator. In my country,
Argentina, it 's almost the same.

499
00:46:43,682 --> 00:46:47,140
It 's so everywhere in Latin America.
The worst rise to the top always.

500
00:46:47,486 --> 00:46:51,582
Because every dictator has one
thing in common: You, the Yankees.

501
00:46:51,924 --> 00:46:56,452
Everything you do is done for
the profits of your companies.

502
00:46:56,662 --> 00:47:00,063
- That 's why the Soviet Union is...
- Raul thinks the Soviet Union...

503
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:05,067
will be the savior of Latin America.
We have to create our own destiny.

504
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:08,399
Not alone, but together.
Everywhere in Latin America...

505
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:13,738
Guatemala, Venezuela,
Argentina, Chile, Cuba...

506
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:16,414
- Do you know Neruda?
- No.

507
00:47:16,615 --> 00:47:20,642
'At the sound of the trumpet
everything was ready on Earth.

508
00:47:20,853 --> 00:47:23,253
And Jehovah divided the world...

509
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:28,126
to Coca-Cola Incorporated,
Anaconda, Ford Motors.

510
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:32,726
But the juiciest slice of all was
kept for the United Fruit Company.'

511
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,193
- Who wrote it?
- Pablo Neruda.

512
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:41,130
- Why haven't I heard that before?
- Everything where we come from...

513
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,776
...is owned by United Fruit Company.
- I love that poem.

514
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:47,810
- My name is Fidel Castro.
- Ernesto Guevara.

515
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:50,140
Che! We just call him Che.

516
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:51,577
Welcome to Mexico.

517
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:54,850
I am here for one reason only.

518
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:59,821
To form a revolutionary army, to
train it and make it so disciplined...

519
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:01,925
that it cannot be defeated.

520
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:05,628
By the end of the next year,
l'll return to Cuba with my army...

521
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:08,322
l'll overthrow Batista's regime...

522
00:48:08,534 --> 00:48:11,731
and announce the new revolutionary
government of Cuba.

523
00:48:11,937 --> 00:48:14,132
That is what will happen.

524
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,900
I told you he was shy
and lacked confidence.

525
00:48:17,776 --> 00:48:22,941
Every Cuban should know what we're
doing and support us. Every Cuban.

526
00:48:23,148 --> 00:48:28,245
But I liked what you said before. Not
just Cubans, but every Latin American.

527
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:30,718
My revolution first, then yours.

528
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:32,788
0f course.

529
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:39,889
We'll land in 0riente, in an area
between Niquero, on the west coast...

530
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:44,297
and Pilon, on the south coast. There,
there are beaches along the coastline.

531
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:47,836
I have everything planned.
The tidal charts, the terrain.

532
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,498
The group on land coordinating
our arrival led by Celia Sanchez.

533
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:55,473
As soon as we are ashore, I take
my army to the Sierra Maestra...

534
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:57,808
where we engage guerrilla warfare.

535
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:02,014
All we need now is food,
money, clothes.

536
00:49:02,221 --> 00:49:03,381
- Boats.
- Boats.

537
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:05,750
And a few boats!
And then, we will win.

538
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:09,052
0f course we will win.
It 's inevitable!

539
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,697
It looks like it 's been
underwater for thirty years.

540
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,871
It sunk in a hurricane
in fifty-three.

541
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:26,502
- Is this the best you can get?
- The best I can get for your money.

542
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:30,471
How long will it take
to get it seaworthy?

543
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:34,813
- Two months.
- Can that be seaworthy for open sea?

544
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,218
- How many people can it hold?
- You're taking it along the coast...

545
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:42,153
25 would be safe enough.

546
00:49:42,861 --> 00:49:46,422
- We need a boat for a hundred.
- We're not gonna get anything bigger.

547
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:50,431
Two months is too long. It has
to be ready by the twenty-fifth.

548
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:53,531
L'll see what I can do.

549
00:49:54,373 --> 00:49:58,742
<i>We'll have ten safe houses,</i>
<i>ten men to each house.</i>

550
00:49:59,144 --> 00:50:01,942
<i>Dlsclpllne wlll be ruthless.</i>

551
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:06,345
<i>No alcohol, no phone calls,</i>
<i>no vlsitors.</i>

552
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,245
I guess l'm sleeping on the floor.

553
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,692
<i>Alberto Bayo wlll</i>
<i>to all the world...</i>

554
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,761
<i>be a professorvlsitlng you</i>
<i>to glve you Engllsh lessons.</i>

555
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:23,367
<i>When In fact, he'll be tralnlng you</i>
<i>In guerrllla warfare.</i>

556
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:26,795
<i>He tralned the brlgades</i>
<i>In the Spanlsh ClvllWar.</i>

557
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:29,840
Go!

558
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:32,642
And go!

559
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:36,345
Get in position. And go!

560
00:50:37,983 --> 00:50:41,441
Come on!
Higher! Higher! Higher!

561
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:14,252
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

562
00:51:14,453 --> 00:51:16,444
- I can't.
- You have to keep going. Get up!

563
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:19,055
- These marches are too long!
- Come on, get up!

564
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:21,590
Get off of me! L'm warning you!

565
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:32,260
If you don't get up right now, you'll
be arrested for insubordination...

566
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:35,269
and court martialed.

567
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,605
No.

568
00:51:42,448 --> 00:51:45,349
Everybody, back to camp!

569
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,913
Discipline is everything.

570
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:54,515
The revolution cannot triumph
without absolute discipline.

571
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:57,217
We must show an example
to the others.

572
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:02,059
- Bayo teaches this all the time!
- Yes, I do.

573
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:09,402
- Lf Che can march with asthma...
- It 's not good politics to shoot him!

574
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,203
Politics?

575
00:52:14,346 --> 00:52:17,509
We have to shoot him.
If we show the others that...

576
00:52:17,716 --> 00:52:23,279
we are weak in our determination,
then we'll fail for sure.

577
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:25,855
0f course there has
to be discipline.

578
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:29,289
That is why everyday
I force it into their brains...

579
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:32,555
and why his actions
cannot be tolerated.

580
00:52:32,764 --> 00:52:36,666
But you'll have another bigger
problem if you shoot him.

581
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:41,499
- What if the police finds the body?
- L'm an honest man...

582
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:45,039
Then we make sure that
they don't find the body!

583
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:49,874
You can't be sure. The suspicion
of murder will be enough.

584
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:53,415
...and, before I die, I want...
- I say we execute him.

585
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:56,588
A revolutionary brigade cannot
survive with such people within it.

586
00:52:56,822 --> 00:53:01,156
- So you agree we should execute him?
- 0r he might turn against us.

587
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:05,886
And the revolution and our lives
may be lost. There's much to lose.

588
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,895
So I say yes.

589
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:12,231
L'll work 20 hours a day.

590
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:17,169
L'll do every chore in the camp.

591
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:22,343
L'll do the work of all the soldiers,
so that they are free to train.

592
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:24,311
But please...

593
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:27,816
I beg of you...

594
00:53:28,086 --> 00:53:31,783
let me fight for
the freedom of Cuba.

595
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:39,353
You are lucky to be alive.
I would have shot you myself.

596
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:46,600
But maybe now, you'll have
the chance to prove yourself.

597
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,402
Thank you, Fidel.

598
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,504
Thank you.

599
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,821
We cannot take any more men, Fidel.
That 's 82, including us.

600
00:54:07,025 --> 00:54:09,391
That 's already far,
far too many.

601
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:13,929
I cannot sail with this boat if you
put even one more man onboard.

602
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:18,893
Stop there!

603
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:52,494
We'll arrive at the Colorada beach,
near Belic, in five days.

604
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:55,537
At dawn, on November thirtieth.

605
00:54:56,308 --> 00:54:58,833
An armed unit of the underground...

606
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:02,036
led by Celia Sanchez
will meet us at the landing point...

607
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:04,977
and guide us into the mountains.

608
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:09,614
Long live the Revolution!

609
00:55:09,821 --> 00:55:11,584
Yes!

610
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,160
Celia?

611
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:30,073
They left.

612
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:39,279
All the safe houses are empty.
He has left Mexico.

613
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:43,320
- Have you informed the Air Force?
- Yes.

614
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:49,552
Also reinforce
the Santiago garrison...

615
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:52,127
and have them put on alert.

616
00:55:54,366 --> 00:55:55,628
Good.

617
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:57,995
I think that should be enough.

618
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,045
- We are sinking!
- Start bailing out.

619
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:19,951
Use anything you can
find down there!

620
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:28,890
- Take this.
- Faster!

621
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:35,770
Hurry!

622
00:56:52,457 --> 00:56:56,689
They have probably seen Batista's
planes patrolling off the coastline.

623
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:20,076
What has happened to you?

624
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,711
These bandages?

625
00:57:23,922 --> 00:57:25,321
L've had them for years.

626
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,281
For what?

627
00:57:30,095 --> 00:57:32,120
My bones.

628
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,821
My bones are too weak.

629
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,433
It 's a deformity
from my childhood.

630
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:42,868
That 's why I couldn't go on marching
in the mountains. It hurt too much.

631
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:47,038
Why didn't you tell us?

632
00:57:47,312 --> 00:57:51,305
Because you wouldn't let me on the
boat if you knew I wasn't fit enough.

633
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:01,084
0ur position is wrong.

634
00:58:01,293 --> 00:58:04,558
If those buoys are right,
we are not heading for the beach.

635
00:58:06,198 --> 00:58:08,530
So where are we heading?

636
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:13,030
I don't know.

637
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:30,287
Let 's call it off.

638
00:58:31,356 --> 00:58:33,017
Come on.

639
00:58:53,778 --> 00:58:55,507
What was that?

640
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,271
This is it.
We have landed.

641
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:02,446
Landed? This is a shipwreck.

642
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:06,021
Carry only your personal weapons.

643
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:09,919
Everything else must be left here.

644
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:14,188
All right.

645
01:01:03,174 --> 01:01:04,573
To the cane fields!

646
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,755
Let 's move to the cane fields!

647
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:28,426
To the cane fields
to regroup there!

648
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:08,769
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

649
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:12,934
The forces of the Cuban people...

650
01:02:13,144 --> 01:02:15,806
under the command of
General Pedro Avila...

651
01:02:16,247 --> 01:02:20,183
have today annihilated
the expeditionary force...

652
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:23,912
of the so-called
'Twenty-Six of July Movement'...

653
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:28,081
<i>alongwith its chlef,</i>
<i>Fldel Castro,3O years old.</i>

654
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,223
<i>Many of the bodles of the other</i>
<i>rebels have also been found...</i>

655
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,025
<i>Includlng that of</i>
<i>Fldel Castro's brother, Raul.</i>

656
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:39,762
<i>Thelr bodles wlll now</i>
<i>be returned to Havana.</i>

657
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:50,712
It 's still 20 miles to the mountains.
We can rest here...

658
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:55,011
until nightfall. When we get to
the mountains, we will be safe.

659
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,379
The revolution will be safe.

660
01:02:58,089 --> 01:03:00,455
We are going to win!

661
01:03:07,732 --> 01:03:11,429
<i>Batlsta Is lylng. I saw the attack</i>
<i>from the mountalns.</i>

662
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:13,604
<i>I know that some of them got</i>
<i>away to the cane flelds.</i>

663
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:18,138
- Fidel?
- He's not one of the men I saw shot.

664
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:22,777
- Is everybody searching for them?
- Everyone.

665
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:26,283
But Batista's soldiers
are all over the hills.

666
01:03:26,484 --> 01:03:29,317
It 's a question of
who finds them first.

667
01:03:31,723 --> 01:03:34,021
My name is Alejandro.

668
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:36,552
Do you have any food I can buy?

669
01:03:40,632 --> 01:03:42,429
Fidel?

670
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:45,926
My son is Guillermo Garcia...

671
01:03:47,038 --> 01:03:51,304
under the command
of Celia Sanchez.

672
01:03:58,516 --> 01:04:02,543
We have been all looking for you,
and praying that you have survived.

673
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:06,352
Carrying food with us,
hoping to find you.

674
01:04:06,658 --> 01:04:09,491
Go! Tell Guillermo
that Fidel Castro is here.

675
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:12,385
Come.

676
01:04:12,597 --> 01:04:15,532
He's in the mountains
searching for you.

677
01:04:15,733 --> 01:04:17,701
How many are you?

678
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:21,602
Three.

679
01:04:35,587 --> 01:04:37,521
Guillermo Garcia.

680
01:04:41,693 --> 01:04:44,719
Universo. Faustino.

681
01:04:46,064 --> 01:04:48,032
Guillermo.

682
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:50,461
What 's for dinner?

683
01:04:50,902 --> 01:04:52,927
Calixto!

684
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:54,903
Candido!

685
01:04:58,576 --> 01:05:00,771
- Commander.
- Big boy!

686
01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:06,780
People support you because there's no
way out for us without the revolution.

687
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:11,622
We have no doctors, no schools,
no medicine, no rights. Nothing.

688
01:05:21,366 --> 01:05:25,666
All these men are willing
to join your army.

689
01:05:30,441 --> 01:05:34,138
Thank you.
Thank you all.

690
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:14,509
- Good to see you.
- You're good?

691
01:06:22,694 --> 01:06:24,855
How many rifles do you have?

692
01:06:25,997 --> 01:06:27,658
Didn't I tell you?

693
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:31,328
His first words.

694
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,299
Five.

695
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,370
We have two.

696
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:39,065
Now we will win the war!

697
01:06:40,878 --> 01:06:43,244
Long live the revolution!
Long live Fidel!

698
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:48,846
We need to mount an attack.

699
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,618
We need a victory.

700
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,986
0therwise, who will believe
we are an army?

701
01:06:57,862 --> 01:07:00,092
Most important of all...

702
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:03,758
we need to show the people
what we are fighting for.

703
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:10,797
Are there any land overseers
in this area? Do you know them?

704
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:13,000
I know their names.

705
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:14,871
Everyone does.

706
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,274
There are three of them who
have terrorized us for years.

707
01:07:19,484 --> 01:07:21,782
We should execute them.

708
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:28,418
Then the people will believe we are
fighting for them, not for ourselves.

709
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:33,096
Chucho 0sorio is one of
the land overseers.

710
01:07:33,297 --> 01:07:35,060
<i>The worst of the three.</i>

711
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:40,397
<i>He may not look llke it, but he has</i>
<i>terrorlzed every peasant In thls area.</i>

712
01:07:40,605 --> 01:07:42,732
<i>Stolen from them,</i>
<i>beaten them...</i>

713
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,567
<i>and kllled.</i>

714
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:51,109
<i>Frlday afternoon, he drlnks with the</i>
<i>soldlers In the barracks at La Plata.</i>

715
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:05,226
Stop there!

716
01:08:06,097 --> 01:08:08,088
Colonel Gomez,
from the Royal Guard.

717
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:11,167
- Colonel? Yes, sir.
- We're looking for...

718
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:13,337
the leader of the rebel army.

719
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:15,733
- Fidel Castro.
- Castro?

720
01:08:16,207 --> 01:08:19,506
- Have you heard anything?
- No, not him. He's dead.

721
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:21,875
Dead? Where?

722
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,072
That 's when I meet him.
0thers I have found, yes.

723
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:29,151
- Who have you found?
- Who have I found?

724
01:08:29,353 --> 01:08:32,618
- The rebels you've found, name them.
- Yes, well...

725
01:08:32,824 --> 01:08:37,386
...one actually. 0ne I have found!
- L'm Colonel Gomez, Royal Guard.

726
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:41,087
- Tell me his name now.
- I remember his name...

727
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,699
No, I don't.
I don't know his name.

728
01:08:44,902 --> 01:08:48,394
- But we took his head off.
- All right.

729
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:54,136
- Get off your mule. Tie his hands.
- What?

730
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:02,650
Listen! Listen!

731
01:09:02,954 --> 01:09:04,945
You are going to stay here.

732
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:08,920
And when you're sober, you're going
to tell us the layout of the barracks.

733
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:14,429
Where they sleep, where they eat,
where they keep watch. Everything.

734
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:18,762
And maybe, perhaps when
you're sober, you'll remember...

735
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:21,632
what you just said
to Fidel Castro!

736
01:09:52,003 --> 01:09:54,665
- Take everything out!
- Hands up!

737
01:10:03,614 --> 01:10:05,275
Stop firing!

738
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,781
Hold your fire!

739
01:11:17,555 --> 01:11:20,285
What are we going
to do with them?

740
01:11:24,028 --> 01:11:25,859
Let them go.

741
01:11:26,631 --> 01:11:29,623
- Why don't we kill them?
- Why? They are not our enemies.

742
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:33,133
Let them go.
Che, give them your medicine bag.

743
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:36,329
- Let them go look after their injured.
- No. We need those medicines.

744
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,168
Not now, we don't.
We have no casualties.

745
01:11:39,377 --> 01:11:42,039
Give them the medicine and let
them go. That 's how we're doing it.

746
01:11:42,246 --> 01:11:45,909
- Fidel, you can't...
- That 's the way we're doing it.

747
01:11:48,152 --> 01:11:51,053
- You are free to go.
- Thank you.

748
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:58,827
Now tell them to kill him.
Then we can go.

749
01:12:06,804 --> 01:12:08,032
Shoot him.

750
01:12:14,152 --> 01:12:17,019
Norma, this is Alejandro.
Do you copy? 0ver.

751
01:12:17,556 --> 01:12:21,788
That 's an army truck.
Heading for the garrison of Bayamo.

752
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:24,056
Shoot the driver.

753
01:12:25,964 --> 01:12:27,363
- Good.
<i>- Alejandro, thls Is Norma.</i>

754
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:30,260
Fidel, we made contact
with Celia.

755
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:35,000
- This is Alejandro hearing you. 0ver.
<i>- How are you?</i>

756
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:40,167
<i>It's wonderful to hearyourvolce. We</i>
<i>are excited to make contact with you.</i>

757
01:12:40,378 --> 01:12:45,748
- At last l've the chance to thank you.
<i>- We're so pleased that you are allve.</i>

758
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:50,354
<i>I've a message to flnd you a reporter.</i>
<i>What klnd of reporter? Over.</i>

759
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:53,991
I want everybody in Cuba
to know l'm not dead.

760
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:57,059
That our army is secure in the
mountains. More than secure.

761
01:12:57,262 --> 01:13:01,096
Invincible. So can you
organize the reporter?

762
01:13:01,299 --> 01:13:04,632
Who is the most famous reporter
in the United States? 0ver.

763
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:09,439
<i>The best foryou Is Herbert Matthews.</i>
<i>He's with the 'New York Tlmes'.</i>

764
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:12,371
<i>He covered the</i>
<i>Spanlsh ClvllWar. Over.</i>

765
01:13:12,844 --> 01:13:15,335
Are you a journalist, Mr. Matthews?

766
01:13:15,614 --> 01:13:17,377
L'm a business man.

767
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:20,983
L'm taking a look at the sugar
refinery l'm thinking of buying.

768
01:13:21,186 --> 01:13:25,953
No journalists are allowed east of
Santa Clara. Step out of the vehicle.

769
01:13:26,658 --> 01:13:28,387
Stay there.

770
01:13:31,163 --> 01:13:34,257
We are from the Matanza
Sugar Association.

771
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:38,163
When this American gentleman
goes back to New York to report...

772
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:42,670
that the political climate in Cuba is
unhealthy for foreign investment...

773
01:13:42,874 --> 01:13:47,004
l'll make sure your superiors find out
that was you who taught him that.

774
01:13:47,212 --> 01:13:51,546
Now, please let me get passed before
I report these matters to Havana.

775
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,909
And this gentleman from the New York
Times, are we keeping him waiting?

776
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:21,772
Yes.

777
01:14:23,114 --> 01:14:26,948
Good.
Keep him waiting a little longer.

778
01:14:27,152 --> 01:14:29,620
Make it more exciting for him.

779
01:14:36,828 --> 01:14:39,991
Go to Matthews.
Tell him to come for the night.

780
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:44,532
Invent a raid from Batista's forces
which we have successfully repelled.

781
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:50,374
- And give him some shooting tonight.
- Lf you give him too many stories...

782
01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:53,840
...he's not gonna write it down...
- None of it is untrue.

783
01:14:54,045 --> 01:14:56,570
It 's just not true yet.

784
01:14:58,016 --> 01:15:02,976
Let him write, we have the mastery
of the Sierra Maestra.

785
01:15:23,675 --> 01:15:25,370
- Mister Matthews?
- Yes.

786
01:15:25,777 --> 01:15:27,745
Universo Sanchez.

787
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:30,972
- The commandant is arriving.
- Thank you.

788
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:49,860
Welcome to the Sierra Maestra.

789
01:15:50,268 --> 01:15:52,862
- L'm sorry you had to wait.
- Not at all.

790
01:15:55,974 --> 01:15:59,569
Today the revolution
is in the mountains...

791
01:15:59,778 --> 01:16:03,475
tomorrow it will be in the cities.
When the people of Havana...

792
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:07,118
and Santiago learn that
we have defeated Batista here...

793
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:10,117
they'll know that we will
defeat him everywhere.

794
01:16:10,322 --> 01:16:12,984
You truly believe you can
defeat him here?

795
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:16,786
0f course. 0f course
we will defeat him here.

796
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:20,624
It was announced, it was
the day I flew into Havana...

797
01:16:20,832 --> 01:16:24,996
that Batista had taken delivery
of sixteen B-26 bombers.

798
01:16:25,203 --> 01:16:27,467
Yes, from your country.

799
01:16:27,672 --> 01:16:30,004
- The forces available to him...
- We're expecting...

800
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:34,235
a massive aerial attack
against us at any moment.

801
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,649
As you can see, it 's impossible for
them to find us in these mountains.

802
01:16:40,852 --> 01:16:45,289
The only way that they can logisticaly
defeat us is from the ground.

803
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,516
But how can they do this
if they don't know the ground?

804
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:51,696
And we know every inch of it.

805
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:56,164
We shall come down
from these mountains...

806
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:59,599
as a new revolutionary
government of Cuba.

807
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,103
And...

808
01:17:10,248 --> 01:17:12,011
good.

809
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:51,696
And we know every inch of it.

810
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:56,164
We shall come down
from these mountains...

811
01:16:56,368 --> 01:16:59,599
as a new revolutionary
government of Cuba.

812
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:09,103
And...

813
01:17:10,248 --> 01:17:12,011
good.

814
01:17:12,717 --> 01:17:13,979
I take it.

815
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:26,356
Good.

816
01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:29,163
0ne more.

817
01:17:37,876 --> 01:17:38,934
Excellent.

818
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,241
Good.

819
01:17:46,317 --> 01:17:50,276
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Matthews, he's ready.

820
01:17:57,362 --> 01:17:59,523
So you are Celia Sanchez.

821
01:18:05,236 --> 01:18:08,637
Your organization
is very efficient.

822
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,038
- You don't seem to be betrayed.
- We have a very loyal unit.

823
01:18:13,244 --> 01:18:16,680
Good. There are only 18 of us here.
0ne betrayal...

824
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:20,214
then one attack from Batista,
and we are finished.

825
01:18:20,852 --> 01:18:23,946
- We need to recruit.
- We're already training soldiers...

826
01:18:24,155 --> 01:18:27,556
in the cities in 0riente.
They'll be ready to join you soon.

827
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:32,628
As for weapons and ammunition,
Faustino will get supplies in Havana.

828
01:18:32,831 --> 01:18:35,026
What else do you need?

829
01:18:36,234 --> 01:18:37,963
Cigars.

830
01:18:42,574 --> 01:18:46,032
The movement must never
listen to the communists.

831
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:50,577
The revolution is here.
The heart is here.

832
01:18:50,782 --> 01:18:53,114
No, it is not.

833
01:18:53,318 --> 01:18:54,876
Not yet.

834
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,856
You have to make it here.
That is what l'm telling you.

835
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:07,826
How can you have a perspective of
what goes on beyond the mountains?

836
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,963
It 's impossible.

837
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:14,665
What you need is someone
you can trust...

838
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,701
who can be here and who can
travel through the cities.

839
01:19:19,477 --> 01:19:22,037
Someone who can
keep you in touch.

840
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:25,739
You eyes and your ears
in the cities.

841
01:19:26,684 --> 01:19:31,280
Then your judgements and planning
will be right there as well as here.

842
01:19:32,056 --> 01:19:35,321
And then the heart of the
revolution will be here.

843
01:19:39,397 --> 01:19:43,390
<i>'Fldel Castro, the rebel leader</i>
<i>of Cuba's youth...</i>

844
01:19:43,601 --> 01:19:47,002
<i>Is allve and flghtlng hard</i>
<i>and successfully...</i>

845
01:19:47,205 --> 01:19:50,936
<i>In the rugged, almost lmpenetrable</i>
<i>fastness of the Slerra Maestra.'</i>

846
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:58,214
<i>'Presldent Batlsta has the cream</i>
<i>of hls army around the area.'</i>

847
01:19:58,883 --> 01:20:02,819
'Thousands of men and women
are heart and soul with Fidel Castro.

848
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:06,718
Throughout Cuba, unemployment
is high, corruption is rife.

849
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:09,393
Castro and his
Twenty-Six of July Movement...

850
01:20:09,594 --> 01:20:11,994
is the flaming symbol of
the opposition to the regime.'

851
01:20:12,197 --> 01:20:16,258
'It is a revolutionary movement
that calls itself socialistic...

852
01:20:16,467 --> 01:20:20,233
offering a new deal to Cuba:
Radical, democratic...

853
01:20:20,438 --> 01:20:23,407
...and therefore, anticommunist.'
- Unbelievable.

854
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:26,873
'The personality of the man
is overpowering.'

855
01:20:27,078 --> 01:20:28,875
Comrade!

856
01:20:31,082 --> 01:20:34,074
'It was easy to see that his men
adored him and also to see...

857
01:20:34,285 --> 01:20:38,813
why he has got the imagination of
the youth of Cuba all over the island.

858
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:41,856
He was an educated,
dedicated fanatic...

859
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:47,396
a man of ideals, of courage and of
remarkable qualities of leadership.'

860
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:55,305
'He has the mastery of
the Sierra Maestra.'

861
01:20:58,142 --> 01:21:00,906
'He has the mastery
of the Sierra Maestra.'

862
01:21:50,028 --> 01:21:51,655
Another.

863
01:21:51,996 --> 01:21:53,657
Here!

864
01:21:55,066 --> 01:21:57,694
Look! Look!

865
01:21:59,804 --> 01:22:03,137
Dance! Dance!
Come dance.

866
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:16,344
The ammunition.

867
01:22:35,206 --> 01:22:37,538
It 's very simple!
We need anti-aircraft weapons!

868
01:22:37,742 --> 01:22:39,972
Where do we get
anti-aircraft weapons?

869
01:22:40,178 --> 01:22:42,908
The president of Costa Rica
offered us guns. We can go to him.

870
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:46,982
- How do we get their weapons here?
- I have a friend.

871
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:51,954
<i>He's a memberof our movement.</i>
<i>He has done a lot of work for us.</i>

872
01:22:52,156 --> 01:22:55,523
<i>He's a rlce planter and has a pllot</i>
<i>llcense, so he could fly the arms...</i>

873
01:22:55,727 --> 01:22:58,059
<i>Into hls farm.</i>
<i>I know he wlll</i> do...

874
01:22:58,262 --> 01:23:01,197
<i>as he wlll do anythlng</i>
<i>forthe movement.</i>

875
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:03,758
<i>Hls name Is Huber Matos.</i>

876
01:23:06,037 --> 01:23:09,564
When Celia came to me with the news
that you had attacked the Moncada...

877
01:23:09,774 --> 01:23:13,608
I heard your name for the
first time. And I said to her...

878
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:19,078
'Today democracy was reborn in
Cuba. And its name is Fidel Castro.'

879
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:23,248
Today its name is Huber Matos.

880
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:46,967
And the voice of Fidel Castro
coming to you...

881
01:23:47,178 --> 01:23:50,011
from the heart of
the Sierra Maestra...

882
01:23:50,214 --> 01:23:54,548
in the first free territory
of the Americas.

883
01:23:58,456 --> 01:24:03,587
<i>We are an army that</i>
<i>wlll not be defeated.</i>

884
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:07,397
<i>From thls moment,</i>
<i>the country...</i>

885
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:13,460
should consider itself in total war
against the dictatorship.

886
01:24:14,172 --> 01:24:17,573
The entire nation is determined...

887
01:24:17,775 --> 01:24:19,766
to be free...

888
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:21,945
or to perish!

889
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:26,144
To counterattack, Raul,
you'll take 65 men...

890
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,113
and defend Sierra Cristal.

891
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,915
Camilo, you will take 50 men, and
attack Batista here, at Bayamo.

892
01:24:33,424 --> 01:24:37,724
Huber, you'll command troops
protecting the head-quarters.

893
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:41,296
Che, you'll take charge
of the central zone.

894
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:46,898
0ne small victory after one
small victory, again and again...

895
01:24:47,104 --> 01:24:50,096
<i>and they wlll not have</i>

<i>we wlll flght to the death.</i>

897
01:24:54,312 --> 01:24:55,836
Surrender!

898
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:05,982
We're the Cuban people! You are the
dictatorship! You could be on our side.

899
01:25:06,424 --> 01:25:10,827
You think you deserve to live?
You! Do you deserve to live?

900
01:25:12,697 --> 01:25:18,101
A thousand soldiers have died
attacking the liberators of Cuba.

901
01:25:18,302 --> 01:25:23,239
<i>How many more llves must be lost</i>
<i>before Batlsta surrenders...</i>

902
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:25,341

903
01:25:25,877 --> 01:25:28,778
<i>Must he lose</i>

904
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:33,445
before he submits to the inevitable
victory of the revolution?

905
01:25:47,331 --> 01:25:49,765
Hold your fire.
Nobody move!

906
01:25:58,843 --> 01:26:00,037
They don't listen.

907
01:26:03,814 --> 01:26:08,342
<i>Today, troops led by</i>

01:27:03,608 --> 01:27:07,374
now have the support of the
land owners, businessmen...

921
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:10,172
and industrialists of 0riente.

922
01:27:10,381 --> 01:27:13,817
This is the voice of
Radio Rebelde...

923
01:27:14,018 --> 01:27:17,749
and the victorious army
of the revolution.

924
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:26,196
0ur proposal is for a junta
led by General Cantillo...

925
01:27:26,397 --> 01:27:31,835
to whom you'll formerly hand over the
government before your departure.

926
01:27:32,236 --> 01:27:37,230
The junta will receive every military
and financial assistance from the CIA.

927
01:27:37,441 --> 01:27:42,071
That will at least save us
and Cuba from Castro.

928
01:27:42,546 --> 01:27:46,312
To the United States backed
junta of General Cantillo...

929
01:27:46,517 --> 01:27:51,386
the revolutionary forces of Cuba
order you to surrender.

930
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:55,189
If there is no surrender
by six o'clock today...

931
01:27:55,393 --> 01:27:58,988
this evening,
you will be attacked.

932
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:03,294
Revolution, yes!
Military coup, no!

933
01:28:03,567 --> 01:28:08,971
In our view, a military coup
is now unsustainable.

934
01:28:09,206 --> 01:28:12,607
We can no longer give you
our support.

935
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:16,109
Either publicly or clandestinely.

936
01:28:28,592 --> 01:28:30,856
Batista has left the country!

937
01:29:09,133 --> 01:29:11,363
Long live Cuba!

938
01:29:22,546 --> 01:29:27,108
Freed Cuba!
Freed Cuba!

939
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:03,075
Fidel! Fidel!

940
01:30:28,646 --> 01:30:30,204
How are you?

941
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:32,846
- How are you?
- Fine!

942
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:36,645
I need you to stay here.
To secure Santiago.

943
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:40,187
- Are you flying to Havana?
- I will march there!

944
01:30:43,727 --> 01:30:47,128
The war is not over!

945
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:50,758
The war has not even begun.

946
01:30:55,539 --> 01:31:00,670
<i>Now we launch our greatest</i>
<i>offenslve agalnst corruptlon...</i>

947
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:06,983
illiteracy, disease, hunger,
exploitation, injustice!

948
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:12,185
This is a revolution for schools,
for teachers...

949
01:31:12,389 --> 01:31:15,449
for hospitals, for doctors!

950
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:19,459
This is a revolution for the people!

951
01:31:21,599 --> 01:31:24,591
Fidel! Fidel!

952
01:31:32,343 --> 01:31:36,905
Neither capitalism, nor socialism!

953
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:40,345
But revolutionary humanism!

954
01:31:40,818 --> 01:31:45,915
A revolution as Cuban
as the palms...

955
01:31:46,223 --> 01:31:51,889
not a red revolution.
But an olive green revolution.

956
01:31:54,431 --> 01:32:00,233
A democratic revolution
of the poor and for the poor.

957
01:32:03,507 --> 01:32:06,999
Fidel! Fidel!

958
01:32:48,919 --> 01:32:51,752
Cuba freed forever!

959
01:33:02,132 --> 01:33:05,397
Freed Cuba!
Long live Fidel!

960
01:33:05,769 --> 01:33:08,203
The country or death!

961
01:33:35,366 --> 01:33:41,236
Any chance a hungry soldier could
get a steak and some grilled onions?

962
01:33:48,278 --> 01:33:50,109
This is good.

963
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:55,184
This is very, very good!

964
01:33:55,853 --> 01:33:57,878
- He liked?
- Yes.

965
01:33:58,088 --> 01:33:59,851
Thank you.

966
01:34:02,459 --> 01:34:03,892
So...

967
01:34:05,295 --> 01:34:07,229
what can we do first?

968
01:34:08,665 --> 01:34:12,658
Do you think we should
cut your rents in half?

969
01:34:15,372 --> 01:34:17,101
What else?

970
01:34:17,307 --> 01:34:20,504
Tell me.
What do you want from me?

971
01:34:22,179 --> 01:34:23,908
Well...

972
01:34:27,518 --> 01:34:29,418
How are you?

973
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,887
- You can't sit there.
- That 's where Che is sitting.

974
01:34:46,103 --> 01:34:49,163
- Could we get some coffee?
- The coffee is coming.

975
01:34:58,715 --> 01:35:00,876
All right, let 's sit down.

976
01:35:02,486 --> 01:35:05,353
First law of the new revolutionary
government of Cuba:

977
01:35:05,556 --> 01:35:09,458
Every Cuban male must wear a beard.
Do we need to take a vote?

978
01:35:20,304 --> 01:35:22,932
Look, telegrams.
All from foreign companies.

979
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:27,736
Wanting to know if their investments
and contracts are safe.

980
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:31,941
They will have to wait.

981
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:36,381
Because in this revolution,
we'll always go to the people first.

982
01:35:36,587 --> 01:35:38,987
That is our first law.

983
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:44,589
And we'll tell them what we're
intending to do and we'll ask them...

984
01:35:44,895 --> 01:35:47,125
'Is this what you want?'

985
01:35:47,865 --> 01:35:52,928
A true people's democracy. That is
how Cuba is to be governed now.

986
01:35:55,105 --> 01:35:58,336
We have a meeting this afternoon with
the directors of the National Bank.

987
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:01,010
They want to know
who they'll be meeting.

988
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:05,677
- Who is a good economist?
- Che!

989
01:36:05,883 --> 01:36:09,876
- Give it to Che.
- I don't know anything about banking.

990
01:36:10,087 --> 01:36:14,023
L'm sorry. I thought you said
who is a good communist.

991
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:17,519
If we can't give them a good
economist, we give a good communist.

992
01:36:17,728 --> 01:36:19,286
Absolutely.
Che, you do it.

993
01:36:19,496 --> 01:36:24,365
Introduce yourself as the new
president of the National Bank.

994
01:36:26,403 --> 01:36:29,998
You certainly look a good
president of the National Bank.

995
01:36:32,943 --> 01:36:34,467
People of Cuba...

996
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:41,140
as from today, the rents from your
landlords will be cut in half.

997
01:36:41,351 --> 01:36:44,218
Under the Law of
Agrarian Reform...

998
01:36:44,988 --> 01:36:47,855
no land owner will ever
again evict you...

999
01:36:48,058 --> 01:36:50,925
from the land you have worked
with your own hands.

1000
01:36:52,129 --> 01:36:57,567
<i>No longerwlll the exploiters</i>
<i>and forelgners In ourcountry...</i>

1001
01:36:57,768 --> 01:37:00,931
<i>Ilve of the sweat and sufferlng</i>
<i>of the people.</i>

1002
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:08,571
<i>We'll bulld 1O thousand classrooms,</i>
<i>and we'll traln 1O thousand teachers.</i>

1003
01:37:08,879 --> 01:37:13,816

<i>could not read orwrite.</i>

1004
01:37:14,384 --> 01:37:18,821
<i>Under Fldel Castro,</i>

1005
01:37:22,059 --> 01:37:24,994
<i>We wlll traln</i>

1006
01:37:25,195 --> 01:37:30,428
<i>Free medlcal care wlll be a

1007
01:37:31,134 --> 01:37:34,831
<i>Students In the city wlll teach</i>

1008

<i>And In the flelds, an army of urban</i>

<i>Mexlco In coffee productlon.</i>

1011
01:37:50,087 --> 01:37:52,112
What about elections?

1012
01:37:55,092 --> 01:37:57,219
What about elections?

1013
01:38:01,031 --> 01:38:05,764
- What about elections, Huber?
- That 's the question l'm being asked.

1014
01:38:06,603 --> 01:38:09,071
Why are you bringing
this up now?

1015
01:38:10,907 --> 01:38:13,273
Because we promised
to return democracy to Cuba...

1016
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:15,945
when we were fighting
in the Sierra.

1017
01:38:18,782 --> 01:38:23,048
We are here in government
because we promised...

1018
01:38:23,253 --> 01:38:27,314
to build the people hospitals and
schools, because we promised...

1019
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:31,888
to give the land back to them.
And that is what we are doing now.

1020
01:38:32,896 --> 01:38:35,956
We must keep that promise
to the people first.

1021
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:39,802
What is more democratic
than that?

1022
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:42,995
- The revolution first!
- But we also promised elections.

1023
01:38:43,206 --> 01:38:47,905
We'll keep our promise. We'll always
keep our promises to the people.

1024
01:38:48,111 --> 01:38:50,341
- Next item?
- We have the names of men...

1025
01:38:50,547 --> 01:38:54,176
responsible for carrying out Batista's
political murders. What will we do?

1026
01:38:54,384 --> 01:38:57,319
We'll set up tribunals and
put them on trial immediately.

1027
01:38:57,521 --> 01:38:59,512
And we execute them.

1028
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:02,181
Anyone who resists us.

1029
01:39:02,926 --> 01:39:06,589
Again, this is the first task of the
revolution, to keep the revolution.

1030
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,722
If we don't get rid of our opponents,
they'll come back and kill us.

1031
01:39:09,933 --> 01:39:12,834
- Che is right.
- So we must kill them first.

1032
01:39:14,171 --> 01:39:16,571
It 's the only course of action.

1033
01:39:22,212 --> 01:39:26,148
I have a question for you,
people of Cuba...

1034
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:32,150
should I be commander in chief
of the armed forces?

1035
01:39:33,523 --> 01:39:39,689
Should the armed forces be the armed
forces for and of the revolution?

1036
01:39:41,398 --> 01:39:44,856
Should we put those who are
against the revolution...

1037
01:39:45,068 --> 01:39:47,866
on trial for their lives?

1038
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:54,472
Raise your hand if you agree that
Batista's murdering henchmen...

1039
01:39:54,678 --> 01:39:57,613
must be executed!

1040
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:04,915
The jury of one million
has voted.

1041
01:40:19,736 --> 01:40:22,296
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

1042
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:25,737
- Welcome.
- Nice to see you.

1043
01:40:26,343 --> 01:40:28,277
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1044
01:40:28,478 --> 01:40:31,106
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

1045
01:40:33,784 --> 01:40:38,084
We are the government and
we still have to meet illegally.

1046
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:48,128
This meeting is absolutely
off the record.

1047
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:50,856
Any mention of it to anyone
outside this room...

1048
01:40:51,067 --> 01:40:53,297
will have serious consequences.

1049
01:40:54,104 --> 01:40:56,072
You all understand this?

1050
01:40:57,407 --> 01:40:59,272
Good.

1051
01:41:00,343 --> 01:41:03,801
Because I invited you here
as our comrades.

1052
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:07,177
As comrades of the revolution.

1053
01:41:07,384 --> 01:41:09,750
The question that l'm asking is...

1054
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:13,389
how do we now transform Cuba...

1055
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:16,650
into a marxist-leninist society?

1056
01:41:18,862 --> 01:41:20,853
That is my question.

1057
01:41:22,098 --> 01:41:27,058
And that is our task in the years
ahead. That is the future of Cuba.

1058
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:30,569
Which will secure the revolution
for generations to come.

1059
01:41:31,608 --> 01:41:36,545
Nationalization of all industry.
The creation of State farms...

1060
01:41:36,746 --> 01:41:40,273
and the abolition of
the private enterprise.

1061
01:41:40,984 --> 01:41:45,421
Your task is to turn policy
into practice.

1062
01:41:47,624 --> 01:41:51,219
But let me make it very clear
for you now...

1063
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:54,823
if you,
as the Communist Party...

1064
01:41:55,031 --> 01:41:57,966
wish to play a roll
in the future of Cuba...

1065
01:41:58,468 --> 01:42:03,132
the new communist state
will be under my control.

1066
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,134
We will not reform under you...

1067
01:42:06,343 --> 01:42:09,471
but you will reform under me.

1068
01:42:09,913 --> 01:42:12,939
<i>Cuba marchlng trlumphantly on.</i>

1069
01:42:13,149 --> 01:42:14,514
<i>One bllllon dollars...</i>

1070
01:42:14,718 --> 01:42:18,916
<i>of Yankee owned property has</i>
<i>now been returned to the people.</i>

1071
01:42:19,422 --> 01:42:23,916
<i>The program of natlonallzatlon</i>
<i>Is almost complete.</i>

1072
01:42:24,661 --> 01:42:29,257
<i>Our beloved Fldel has announced</i>
<i>that all oll reflnerles...</i>

1073
01:42:29,466 --> 01:42:32,162
<i>wlll be ceased by the</i>
<i>Revolutlonary Councll...</i>

1074
01:42:32,369 --> 01:42:34,894
<i>and put Into publlc ownershlp.</i>

1075
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:40,099
<i>With our sugar plantatlons,</i>
<i>our mllls, our farms...</i>

1076
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:44,337
<i>our mlnes, our utllitles,</i>
<i>our factorles...</i>

1077
01:42:45,282 --> 01:42:49,776
<i>and now, our reflnerles</i>
<i>In the control of the revolutlon...</i>

1078
01:42:49,986 --> 01:42:52,819
<i>Cuba's destlny</i>
<i>Is In ourown hands!</i>

1079
01:42:53,023 --> 01:42:57,187
This is the outline of the classes
of the revolutionary instructions.

1080
01:42:57,427 --> 01:42:59,725
0nly the recruits have to attend.

1081
01:43:02,198 --> 01:43:04,223
'Party construction.

1082
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,800
Ideological struggle.

1083
01:43:07,003 --> 01:43:09,301
Scientific Marxism.

1084
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:11,564
And atheism.'

1085
01:43:14,678 --> 01:43:16,407
This is Stalin.

1086
01:43:17,347 --> 01:43:20,316
I cannot teach my recruits
all this.

1087
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:28,318
I have to do something.
Say something.

1088
01:43:32,429 --> 01:43:34,829
What is the worse that can happen?

1089
01:43:40,103 --> 01:43:42,196
I will have to resign.

1090
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:47,701
And then what?

1091
01:43:56,086 --> 01:43:59,419
I will be cutting sugarcane
for the rest of my life.

1092
01:44:02,225 --> 01:44:05,524
<i>I do not want to become</i>
<i>an obstacle to the revolutlon.</i>

1093
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:12,197
<i>But I belleve that If I'm forced to</i>
<i>choose between followlng Into llne...</i>

1094
01:44:19,676 --> 01:44:23,578
<i>orwithdrawlng for my rulers governor</i>
<i>of the provlnce of Camaguey...</i>

1095
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:28,376
<i>not to do harm, the most honorable</i>
<i>and revolutlonary actlon for</i> me...

1096
01:44:28,585 --> 01:44:30,246
<i>Is to leave.</i>

1097
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:35,621
<i>I know I have the support of</i>
<i>my offlcers In writlng thls to you.</i>

1098
01:44:36,259 --> 01:44:39,626
<i>It seems rlght for me</i>
<i>to polnt out...</i>

1099
01:44:39,829 --> 01:44:43,697
<i>that greater men become smaller</i>
<i>when they start to be unjust.</i>

1100
01:44:44,834 --> 01:44:48,770
<i>Please, ln the name of</i>
<i>our fallen comrades...</i>

1101
01:44:48,972 --> 01:44:52,874
<i>In the name of our people, Fldel,</i>
<i>do not bury the revolutlon.</i>

1102
01:44:54,077 --> 01:44:57,410
<i>Iwrite you not as</i>
<i>major Huber Matos.</i>

1103
01:44:57,614 --> 01:45:00,310
<i>But as your long tlme frlend.</i>

1104
01:45:06,322 --> 01:45:08,256
What is he plotting?

1105
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:13,029
- A rebellion against us?
- He doesn't say that in the letter.

1106
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:18,565
If there is an officer rebellion in
Camaguey, that 's just what the CIA...

1107
01:45:18,768 --> 01:45:23,296
All he's saying is he's wanting
to resign. To go quietly.

1108
01:45:23,506 --> 01:45:27,943
Resignation itself
is a betrayal of the revolution.

1109
01:45:28,144 --> 01:45:31,045
He worked tirelessly for me
when you were in Mexico.

1110
01:45:31,247 --> 01:45:33,374
And all through the Sierra.

1111
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:37,784
He couldn't have done more for the
revolution. He's been the most loyal.

1112
01:45:38,054 --> 01:45:40,454
But he is not loyal now!

1113
01:45:46,429 --> 01:45:47,987
Call Camilo.

1114
01:45:48,198 --> 01:45:52,828
Tell him to go to Camaguey
to take command of the forces there.

1115
01:45:55,338 --> 01:45:58,398
And put Huber Matos
under arrest.

1116
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,311
Go and get your mother.

1117
01:46:06,449 --> 01:46:08,576
- Brother.
- Camilo.

1118
01:46:10,086 --> 01:46:11,678
Come on in.

1119
01:46:13,056 --> 01:46:14,648
This way.

1120
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:26,831
Apart from my orders to arrest you,
15 of your officers must be arrested.

1121
01:46:28,638 --> 01:46:30,970
My officers? Why?

1122
01:46:31,674 --> 01:46:33,904
Because they have also resigned.

1123
01:46:35,245 --> 01:46:38,874
Resigning is not an offense for
which people should be arrested.

1124
01:46:39,616 --> 01:46:41,584
Don't you think that?

1125
01:46:42,919 --> 01:46:45,149
Camilo, don't you?

1126
01:46:46,089 --> 01:46:52,187
There's a lot counter-revolutionary
activity going on in the country.

1127
01:46:52,395 --> 01:46:55,626
- A lot of plotting against...
- He's just resigning, Camilo.

1128
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:57,527
That 's all he's doing.

1129
01:46:59,335 --> 01:47:03,499
As far as I know, there isn't
even a plan for a trial.

1130
01:47:03,706 --> 01:47:05,833
A trial for resigning?

1131
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,368
I hope not.

1132
01:47:09,212 --> 01:47:12,579
- Then why are you arresting him?
- Fidel's orders.

1133
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:16,980
- Any type of criticism...
- It was a private letter to a friend.

1134
01:47:18,855 --> 01:47:20,686
A comrade.

1135
01:47:21,257 --> 01:47:24,090
I have no intention
in publishing this letter.

1136
01:47:25,728 --> 01:47:27,389
And neither should he.

1137
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,062
'You rose up magnificently...

1138
01:47:33,269 --> 01:47:36,670
and fought in the name of
reason and justice.

1139
01:47:37,507 --> 01:47:40,999
But now I fear,
that if you take this path...

1140
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:44,237
you will be destroying
your own work.

1141
01:47:45,148 --> 01:47:48,640
You will be burying
the revolution.'

1142
01:47:54,591 --> 01:47:57,151
We have a clear and absolute
policy on acts of betrayal.

1143
01:47:57,727 --> 01:48:01,424
We cannot kill him as if he was
one of Batista's executioners!

1144
01:48:01,631 --> 01:48:04,464
Why don't we just let him
resign and go quietly?

1145
01:48:04,667 --> 01:48:08,228
- He betrayed Fidel and the revolution.
- I dare he won't go quietly!

1146
01:48:08,438 --> 01:48:11,134
He'll go to Miami,
then what will he do?!

1147
01:48:11,374 --> 01:48:13,968
The CIA will give him and his family
whatever he wants...

1148
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:17,112
and he'll return, this time
with more arms against us.

1149
01:48:17,313 --> 01:48:22,910
Don't be stupid! No revolution has
succeeded without absolute discipline.

1150
01:48:25,588 --> 01:48:27,715
What do you think, Celia?

1151
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:31,791
He's been a friend of yours for years,
you introduced him to the revolution.

1152
01:48:32,462 --> 01:48:34,862
He's a sincere and honest man.

1153
01:48:35,064 --> 01:48:38,056
- That is not relevant.
- However, Raul...

1154
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:43,399
Che is right. Any dissent
of the revolution is a threat.

1155
01:48:46,109 --> 01:48:48,703
But we all know Huber Matos.

1156
01:48:48,912 --> 01:48:51,437
He would have given
his life for you, Fidel.

1157
01:48:51,648 --> 01:48:53,843
You must remember when
there was just three of us.

1158
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:56,041
Before the Moncada,
before anything...

1159
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:02,157
you said, 'The revolution
will not devour its children'.

1160
01:49:02,926 --> 01:49:06,418
Now what are we doing?
Are we any different from Batista?

1161
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:10,224
Either Matos is a traitor or Fidel's
a liar. Are you calling Fidel a liar?

1162
01:49:10,633 --> 01:49:16,037
Marti taught us, 'The first duty of
each man is to think for himself'.

1163
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:21,233
Are we against Marti as well? Huber
has the right to think for himself.

1164
01:49:21,644 --> 01:49:25,444
We're all followers of Marti.
We ought to disagree with that?

1165
01:49:29,285 --> 01:49:31,583
The duty of
a true revolutionary...

1166
01:49:31,788 --> 01:49:35,554
is first of all
be loyal to the revolution.

1167
01:49:35,758 --> 01:49:41,594
If Huber renounces the revolution,
he may let in the forces to destroy it.

1168
01:49:41,965 --> 01:49:46,402
If the revolution dies before
its first birthday...

1169
01:49:46,602 --> 01:49:50,663
what did your brother
give his life for?

1170
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:53,672
Che is right.

1171
01:50:03,686 --> 01:50:06,246
While we are building hospitals...

1172
01:50:06,456 --> 01:50:10,358
<i>and tralnlng doctors,</i>
<i>so that every person In Cuba...</i>

1173
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,223
<i>wlll have the best</i>
<i>medlcal care In the world...</i>

1174
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:20,326
<i>Major Huber Matos and 15 offlcers</i>
<i>under hls command...</i>

1175
01:50:20,536 --> 01:50:23,630
<i>were consplrlng agalnst us.</i>

1176
01:50:25,408 --> 01:50:30,402
<i>We cannot tolerate consplrators</i>
<i>agalnst the revolutlon.</i>

1177
01:50:30,713 --> 01:50:35,707
We cannot tolerate conspirators
against the revolution.

1178
01:50:36,519 --> 01:50:41,320
Traitors of Cuba, destroying
the morale of the Army!

1179
01:50:41,524 --> 01:50:46,484
Threatening all our programs
for schools and hospitals.

1180
01:50:47,163 --> 01:50:50,394
So I ask you, people of Cuba!

1181
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,660
Defenders of the revolution.

1182
01:50:54,637 --> 01:50:59,631
I come back to you,
to ask you the question...

1183
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:05,309
what shall we do with those
who betray the revolution?

1184
01:51:05,848 --> 01:51:08,408
Should we put them to death?

1185
01:51:15,625 --> 01:51:18,150
We will defend the revolution!

1186
01:51:18,361 --> 01:51:21,228
We will defend the revolution!

1187
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:26,391
At all costs, we will
defend the revolution!

1188
01:51:30,907 --> 01:51:33,501
Now you can show magnanimity.

1189
01:51:38,014 --> 01:51:41,506
If you save his life,
people will love you for that too.

1190
01:51:43,519 --> 01:51:45,350
If we kill him...

1191
01:51:47,924 --> 01:51:51,951
no matter how secretly we bury him,
somebody will find the grave...

1192
01:51:53,296 --> 01:51:57,733
then light candles there, and
make it a shrine to his memory.

1193
01:52:05,775 --> 01:52:08,767
Don't make martyrs
for another revolution.

1194
01:52:15,585 --> 01:52:18,554
I consider myself
neither a traitor...

1195
01:52:19,722 --> 01:52:21,917
nor a deserter.

1196
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:24,650
My conscience is clear.

1197
01:52:26,963 --> 01:52:29,591
If this court should
find me guilty...

1198
01:52:30,867 --> 01:52:35,566
I shall accept its decision,
even though I might be shot.

1199
01:52:36,339 --> 01:52:38,739
I would...

1200
01:52:38,941 --> 01:52:42,377
consider it one more service...

1201
01:52:42,578 --> 01:52:44,569
for the revolution.

1202
01:52:51,988 --> 01:52:53,580
This court...

1203
01:52:53,789 --> 01:52:55,484
finds the accused...

1204
01:52:56,058 --> 01:53:00,654
guilty of high crimes of
treason and conspiracy...

1205
01:53:01,564 --> 01:53:04,658
and sentences him to 20 years.

1206
01:53:41,103 --> 01:53:44,800
<i>It has been</i>
<i>a very dlfflcult tlme...</i>

1207
01:53:45,007 --> 01:53:47,498
<i>for all of us.</i>
<i>Foryou...</i>

1208
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:50,873
<i>and for me, personally.</i>
<i>But...</i>

1209
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:54,447
<i>from thls bitter and</i>
<i>dlfflcult ordeal...</i>

1210
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:57,551
<i>the revolutlon</i>
<i>has emerged vlctorlously.</i>

1211
01:54:02,058 --> 01:54:06,688
<i>In every vlllage, ln every street,</i>
<i>In every city...</i>

1212
01:54:06,896 --> 01:54:11,162
<i>we wlll create committees</i>
<i>forthe defense of the revolutlon!</i>

1213
01:54:13,035 --> 01:54:17,301
<i>There wlll be no place</i>

1214
01:54:17,506 --> 01:54:19,440
<i>to hlde In Cuba!</i>

1215
01:54:58,414 --> 01:55:01,406
Why should life in Cuba be
any different for writers...

1216
01:55:01,617 --> 01:55:04,450
artists, movie directors
and poets...

1217
01:55:04,654 --> 01:55:08,852
than it is for soldiers, bus drivers,
waiters and miners?

1218
01:55:10,192 --> 01:55:15,027
What use is an article about
American beatniks to the revolution?

1219
01:55:18,534 --> 01:55:20,331
That was the last publication.

1220
01:55:20,536 --> 01:55:24,597
Artists, from now on, will have
the freedom to create art...

1221
01:55:24,807 --> 01:55:29,210
for the masses. Everyone sacrifices
themselves for the revolution.

1222
01:55:29,412 --> 01:55:32,142
There's a journalist here
from Moscow wants to see you.

1223
01:55:32,348 --> 01:55:34,782
Not another one!
We've just dismissed 50!

1224
01:55:34,984 --> 01:55:38,579
This is not just any journalist.
He's very close to Kruchev.

1225
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:42,149
A gift from the people
from the Soviet Union.

1226
01:55:42,358 --> 01:55:43,950
Thank you.

1227
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:54,927
And also, from Premier Kruchev...

1228
01:55:56,005 --> 01:56:00,169
who has personally watched
the direction of your revolution...

1229
01:56:00,376 --> 01:56:02,776
with great interest
and admiration.

1230
01:56:02,978 --> 01:56:07,574
I have instructions of
Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan...

1231
01:56:07,783 --> 01:56:10,775
to discuss with you
the possibility of presenting...

1232
01:56:10,986 --> 01:56:13,978
a Soviet trade fair in Havana.

1233
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:17,182
Maybe we should try
the vodka and caviar first.

1234
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:24,631
Yes, I think it will be
very interesting for us.

1235
01:56:24,834 --> 01:56:28,031
As the first step perhaps,
for diplomatic relations.

1236
01:56:28,237 --> 01:56:30,899
Let us first agree
to the trade fair.

1237
01:56:31,107 --> 01:56:34,474
To introduce a new policy,
first you go to the people.

1238
01:56:35,244 --> 01:56:38,543
Explain it to them,
and then seek their approval.

1239
01:56:39,215 --> 01:56:41,945
That sounds like
a very good policy.

1240
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:43,675
Lenin.

1241
01:56:45,788 --> 01:56:47,278
0f course.

1242
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:56,989
This is good.

1243
01:56:57,233 --> 01:56:59,360
This is very, very good.

1244
01:57:05,574 --> 01:57:09,476
Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!
Cuba, yes! Yankees, no!

1245
01:57:10,613 --> 01:57:15,676
We must expect the savage blow of
the imperialist fury at every moment.

1246
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:23,349
We face an invasion of the parasites
who left our beloved country.

1247
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:28,023
An invasion paid for
by a country...

1248
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:31,290
that insists on its own
sovereign rights...

1249
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:36,164
and will take their arms against us,
because we insist on ours.

1250
01:57:42,445 --> 01:57:46,882
This will not, and cannot
be tolerated.

1251
01:57:49,385 --> 01:57:54,618
We will defend this revolution
of the humble...

1252
01:57:54,824 --> 01:58:00,353
by the humble and for the humble,
to the last drop of our blood!

1253
01:58:01,197 --> 01:58:03,927
We shall be victorious!

1254
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:06,260
The country or death!

1255
01:58:09,705 --> 01:58:13,106
Cuba, yes!
Yankees, no!

1256
01:58:16,612 --> 01:58:19,740
<i>...we used agalnst them weren't very</i>
<i>effectlve, therefore we were not...</i>

1257
01:58:19,949 --> 01:58:23,544

<i>malntaln alr supremacy on the beach.</i>

1258
01:58:23,752 --> 01:58:25,743
<i>The operatlon was a fallure...</i>

1259
01:58:25,955 --> 01:58:28,389
<i>and the responslbllity</i>
<i>rests with the White House.</i>

1260
01:58:36,098 --> 01:58:38,430
I have just spoken to Kruchev.

1261
01:58:39,134 --> 01:58:44,265
The Soviets have information that
the Yankees plan a direct invasion.

1262
01:58:46,108 --> 01:58:49,737
We discussed strengthening
our armed forces...

1263
01:58:49,945 --> 01:58:54,348
Soviet military advisers
and weaponry in Cuba.

1264
01:58:55,317 --> 01:58:57,342
So, what 's he offering?

1265
01:58:57,553 --> 01:59:00,420
Strategic nuclear weapons.

1266
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:12,958
<i>Withln the past week, unmlstakable</i>
<i>evldence has establlshed the fact...</i>

1267
01:59:13,369 --> 01:59:16,634

1269
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:22,272
<i>We'll not be prematurely</i>
<i>or unnecessarlly...</i>

1270
01:59:22,478 --> 01:59:25,777
<i>rlsk the course of</i>

1271

1272
01:59:29,818 --> 01:59:34,312
<i>But neitherwlllwe shrlnk from that</i>
<i>rlsk at any tlme it must be faced.</i>

1273
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:39,027
Whatever Kennedy says, whatever
he decides for his country...

1274
01:59:39,228 --> 01:59:42,220
we do not stand down from the
principle that we have the right to...

1275
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:48,336
determine what we do in our country.
Whatever Kennedy says or does.

1276
01:59:50,873 --> 01:59:54,639
I will sit down with this guy and
talk about anything he wants.

1277
01:59:54,843 --> 01:59:56,743
He seems like a nice guy.

1278
01:59:56,946 --> 02:00:00,438
I think we can work things out
with this president.

1279
02:00:00,649 --> 02:00:04,745
But we will not be told what
we can do in our own territory.

1280
02:00:04,954 --> 02:00:07,388
We've just picked this announcement
Kruchev has made in Moscow.

1281
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:10,388
'In order to save the world
from nuclear catastrophe...

1282
02:00:10,593 --> 02:00:14,154
we have given an order to dismantle
the arms in Cuban territory...

1283
02:00:14,363 --> 02:00:16,854
and to return them
to the Soviet Union.'

1284
02:00:19,301 --> 02:00:20,928
Kruchev?!

1285
02:00:22,271 --> 02:00:25,331
- It has to be US propaganda!
- No, I had it personally.

1286
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:28,977
Get him on the phone immediately!
Why wasn't I informed by Kruchev?

1287
02:00:29,178 --> 02:00:32,147
- What time was this broadcast?
- Eight o'clock, Moscow time.

1288
02:00:32,348 --> 02:00:35,010
I had no communication with
Moscow for the last 3 days.

1289
02:00:35,217 --> 02:00:39,449
They're our allies. It was an
agreement between me and Kruchev!

1290
02:00:40,823 --> 02:00:45,590
Here is the rest of the announcement,
'In return we accept the US promise...

1291
02:00:45,794 --> 02:00:49,855
that they will never again attack
the sovereign territory of Cuba...

1292
02:00:50,065 --> 02:00:53,899
or sponsor any attack on the
sovereign territory of Cuba.'

1293
02:00:55,504 --> 02:00:58,701
- That has to be a victory for us!
- How can it be a victory...

1294
02:00:58,907 --> 02:01:02,138
when we were not even part of the
negotiations? Turn on the television!

1295
02:01:02,344 --> 02:01:05,745
- Proves the Soviets stand behind us!
- By standing down to Kennedy?

1296
02:01:05,948 --> 02:01:09,645
It only proves the Soviets will not
risk to attack imperialism anywhere.

1297
02:01:09,852 --> 02:01:14,721
And I wasn't even consulted.
These weapons are on our territory.

1298
02:01:14,923 --> 02:01:17,687
And they are deciding themselves
if they keep them here...

1299
02:01:17,893 --> 02:01:20,384
or take them away
without talking to me?!

1300
02:01:20,596 --> 02:01:24,054
This is only a victory
for the United States, Fidel.

1301
02:01:43,852 --> 02:01:46,650
Kruchev will now want
to make amends.

1302
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:50,750
We can take advantage
of that, Fidel.

1303
02:01:52,127 --> 02:01:55,221
We can get the industrial
plants we need.

1304
02:01:55,431 --> 02:01:59,595
We can get the loans we need,
we can get the conventional weapons.

1305
02:02:02,805 --> 02:02:05,433
We can make it with the Soviets,
so that we never again...

1306
02:02:05,641 --> 02:02:08,075
have to rely on
the Yankee dollar.

1307
02:02:10,446 --> 02:02:13,279
Why is sugar cane production
down again?

1308
02:02:13,482 --> 02:02:16,315
We have had so many volunteers
working in the fields.

1309
02:02:16,985 --> 02:02:19,146
We have all been in the fields.

1310
02:02:19,521 --> 02:02:21,716
- There have been problems.
- What problems?

1311
02:02:21,924 --> 02:02:26,418
- The transition from private to state.
- Why? Why should there be problems?

1312
02:02:26,762 --> 02:02:30,323
They're all getting the same money.
Why work harder than the next man?

1313
02:02:30,866 --> 02:02:32,766
Who is saying that?

1314
02:02:32,968 --> 02:02:35,402
- That 's what they are telling us.
- Who?

1315
02:02:35,604 --> 02:02:37,435
- The workers in the field.
- Give me names!

1316
02:02:37,639 --> 02:02:39,607
- I cannot give you names.
- Are you saying...

1317
02:02:40,042 --> 02:02:42,135
that we will not
sustain the revolution...

1318
02:02:42,344 --> 02:02:44,710
if the people have
no material gain from it?

1319
02:02:44,913 --> 02:02:47,746
Their ideology is not being taught
correctly. They have to develop...

1320
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:51,044
...a communist consciousness.
- They've been taught it.

1321
02:02:51,253 --> 02:02:54,154
But the Cuban likes to
look at the skies and dream.

1322
02:02:54,623 --> 02:02:58,684
- No Cuban I know.
- Why is milk production down?

1323
02:02:58,894 --> 02:03:02,261
That 's because we told everyone to
concentrate in sugar production.

1324
02:03:02,631 --> 02:03:07,125
- And everything else has gone down.
- So it is my fault...

1325
02:03:07,336 --> 02:03:11,033
for asking the people to put all
their efforts in the cane fields?

1326
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:14,368
In my view we're not planning
the economy properly.

1327
02:03:14,576 --> 02:03:17,511
Something goes wrong here
and we all run to fix it.

1328
02:03:17,846 --> 02:03:21,577
Something else goes wrong there
and we all run to fix it there.

1329
02:03:21,784 --> 02:03:25,049
We are not using foresight and
developing long-term strategies.

1330
02:03:25,254 --> 02:03:27,313
What about coffee production?

1331
02:03:27,523 --> 02:03:30,959
- The land was not suitable for it.
- Who says that?

1332
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:33,321
I brought in experts
to advise us and help...

1333
02:03:33,529 --> 02:03:36,191
We don't need advisors!

1334
02:03:36,398 --> 02:03:38,525
To tell me l'm wrong?!

1335
02:03:38,734 --> 02:03:40,326
The economy is failing...

1336
02:03:40,536 --> 02:03:44,563
because we are not inspiring the
people to work for the revolution.

1337
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:48,701
All of Cuba has to be
a guerilla army now!

1338
02:03:48,911 --> 02:03:52,608
They have to understand
that work for the revolution...

1339
02:03:52,815 --> 02:03:55,340
is a moral imperative.

1340
02:03:55,651 --> 02:04:01,317
Then, the harvest will be up.
Then, everything will grow.

1341
02:04:02,391 --> 02:04:07,328
You and your agricultural
committee are dismissed.

1342
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:11,766
- But you are using...
- 0ur dialogue is over!

1343
02:04:25,647 --> 02:04:28,275
Maybe we can ask
the Soviets for a loan.

1344
02:04:28,483 --> 02:04:31,748
No, no. The Soviets
are part of the problem.

1345
02:04:31,954 --> 02:04:34,718
Their machinery doesn't work,
their spare parts never arrive...

1346
02:04:34,923 --> 02:04:38,120
and you're developing a mentality of
waiting for them to provide for us.

1347
02:04:38,327 --> 02:04:40,727
Cuba has to break free
from all imperialism.

1348
02:04:40,929 --> 02:04:43,124
- Russian as well as Yankee.
- How can we break away...

1349
02:04:43,332 --> 02:04:46,324
from the Soviets when we do
all of our trading with them?

1350
02:04:46,535 --> 02:04:49,561
The answer is to put more
volunteers in the fields...

1351
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:53,571
plant more coffee seeds,
and develop better cows.

1352
02:04:53,775 --> 02:04:56,869
And we must not allow
counter-revolutionary ideology...

1353
02:04:57,079 --> 02:05:00,310
to infiltrate the planning
of the economy.

1354
02:05:00,649 --> 02:05:04,107
Arrest him for betraying
the revolution.

1355
02:05:04,853 --> 02:05:09,017
His ideology is destructive to
the people he is here to serve.

1356
02:05:16,798 --> 02:05:20,495
The history of imperialism
has been the history...

1357
02:05:20,869 --> 02:05:24,498
of the exploitation of trade
between the poorer, African...

1358
02:05:24,706 --> 02:05:26,970
<i>Aslan and Latln Amerlcan natlons...</i>

1359
02:05:27,175 --> 02:05:29,040
<i>and the lmperlallsts.</i>

1360
02:05:29,244 --> 02:05:34,113
<i>Soclallsm exlsts to put an end</i>
<i>to that exploitatlon.</i>

1361
02:05:34,316 --> 02:05:37,513
<i>By uslng our poorcountrles</i>
<i>as a source of cheap labor...</i>

1362
02:05:38,053 --> 02:05:43,252
<i>the masters of the Kremlln have</i>
<i>become accompllces of lmperlallsm!</i>

1363
02:05:45,093 --> 02:05:49,325
Why is this Argentine idiot making
statements on behalf of our country?

1364
02:05:49,665 --> 02:05:53,965
What are you going to do? He'll ruin
our relationship with the Russians.

1365
02:05:54,803 --> 02:05:58,102
Then who will we sell our sugar to?
We'll have no money, no economy...

1366
02:05:58,307 --> 02:06:01,606
and once again the Yankees
will be out to destroy us.

1367
02:06:06,381 --> 02:06:08,076
Yes.

1368
02:06:10,919 --> 02:06:14,013
- Alexeiev.
- He can go to hell.

1369
02:06:14,957 --> 02:06:18,723
He won't be able to answer the
phone now. Just make a note for me.

1370
02:06:18,927 --> 02:06:21,418
Che has our total support.

1371
02:06:23,398 --> 02:06:25,389
Well, he doesn't have mine.

1372
02:06:30,138 --> 02:06:33,039
The Soviets are furious with us.

1373
02:06:34,242 --> 02:06:38,372
- But wasn't I telling the truth?
- Telling the truth is not politics.

1374
02:06:45,287 --> 02:06:47,949
You do not tell your
wife everything...

1375
02:06:49,257 --> 02:06:52,522
you do not tell your
children everything...

1376
02:06:54,062 --> 02:06:58,396
you do not tell your
friends everything.

1377
02:06:59,234 --> 02:07:03,034
And you do not tell your
allies everything.

1378
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:07,233
L'm resigning from the
government, Fidel.

1379
02:07:09,311 --> 02:07:13,543
If the Soviets are furious with me,
then you must get rid of me.

1380
02:07:14,816 --> 02:07:17,785
You know what my answer
to that would be.

1381
02:07:19,187 --> 02:07:21,815
But still, l'm resigning
from the government.

1382
02:07:22,657 --> 02:07:25,057
And l'm resigning my citizenship.

1383
02:07:28,263 --> 02:07:32,791
L've made my decision long ago.
There's nothing left for me to do here.

1384
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:38,870
Revolution is fomenting
in Peru, Guatemala...

1385
02:07:39,074 --> 02:07:43,101
in Argentina.
In Africa, in Congo, Angola.

1386
02:07:45,113 --> 02:07:47,240
In Latin America...

1387
02:07:47,449 --> 02:07:50,213
we need our independence.

1388
02:07:52,754 --> 02:07:55,314
And it won't be won
with the Russians.

1389
02:07:55,524 --> 02:07:59,221
It will be won by fighting for
socialism ourselves. So l'm...

1390
02:07:59,895 --> 02:08:02,090
l'm going back to the mountains.

1391
02:08:03,231 --> 02:08:05,165
Back to fighting.

1392
02:08:09,071 --> 02:08:11,938
We want to start the war...

1393
02:08:12,941 --> 02:08:16,206
in any country, any country
in Latin America.

1394
02:08:17,312 --> 02:08:20,975
If I trained the guerilla force here
just as you did in Mexico...

1395
02:08:21,817 --> 02:08:24,513
and took them up to the mountains
and create the guerilla war...

1396
02:08:24,886 --> 02:08:29,346
then this war will inevitably spread
out to the neighboring countries...

1397
02:08:30,392 --> 02:08:33,884
creating the revolutionary conditions
in those countries as well.

1398
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,998
This will bring down the Yankees...

1399
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:41,397
and they would never,
Fidel, never...

1400
02:08:41,603 --> 02:08:45,095
be able to contain several guerilla
movements in neighboring countries.

1401
02:08:46,975 --> 02:08:50,172
It will become worse
than Vietnam for them.

1402
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:54,380
Just one spark...

1403
02:08:55,484 --> 02:08:57,509
in one guerilla movement...

1404
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,454
in one mountain range...

1405
02:09:01,456 --> 02:09:03,617
and the whole thing just...

1406
02:09:05,894 --> 02:09:08,124
If anyone knows it can be done...

1407
02:09:13,702 --> 02:09:15,192
Where?

1408
02:09:16,538 --> 02:09:18,529
Where would you go?

1409
02:09:19,608 --> 02:09:21,508
To Bolivia.

1410
02:09:24,012 --> 02:09:26,276
You could go to Bolivia.

1411
02:09:27,949 --> 02:09:31,407
From Bolivia,
you could go to Peru.

1412
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,717
To Chile...

1413
02:09:34,823 --> 02:09:36,916
to Argentina.

1414
02:09:38,793 --> 02:09:42,285
First my revolution.
Then yours.

1415
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,801
L'll talk with the communists in
Bolivia. With my friend, Mario Monje.

1416
02:09:50,005 --> 02:09:54,567
We'll lay the groundwork for you.
You pick the best fighting men.

1417
02:09:54,776 --> 02:09:56,971
And train them here.

1418
02:09:57,179 --> 02:10:00,478
I will give you everything
you need.

1419
02:10:23,772 --> 02:10:26,104
We'll just have to
fight our way out.

1420
02:11:00,275 --> 02:11:02,266
- Let 's go to the city?
- Sure.

1421
02:11:16,858 --> 02:11:19,122
No good to Cuba...

1422
02:11:19,327 --> 02:11:21,227
no good to us...

1423
02:11:22,964 --> 02:11:25,660
and worst of all for you...

1424
02:11:26,568 --> 02:11:29,401
no good to the Soviets.

1425
02:11:31,306 --> 02:11:34,275
There is a training book
at the CIA...

1426
02:11:34,476 --> 02:11:37,411
that we use to track down
guerilla units.

1427
02:11:37,612 --> 02:11:39,739
It 's your book.

1428
02:11:41,249 --> 02:11:43,945
'A guerilla movement
cannot be successful...

1429
02:11:44,152 --> 02:11:46,677
without the support
of the peasants.'

1430
02:11:47,622 --> 02:11:49,419
Good advice.

1431
02:11:54,896 --> 02:11:58,263
And you had the support
of nobody.

1432
02:12:20,322 --> 02:12:22,347
Come on.

1433
02:12:22,557 --> 02:12:24,388
Shoot me.

1434
02:12:27,228 --> 02:12:29,526
You are only going to kill a man.

1435
02:12:52,287 --> 02:12:54,551
Turn the head, please.

1436
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:01,057
Excuse me.

1437
02:13:17,812 --> 02:13:21,248
Ramiro says the CIA
had him killed.

1438
02:13:23,151 --> 02:13:25,312
Ramiro would be right.

1439
02:13:26,454 --> 02:13:28,513
But I told him...

1440
02:13:29,924 --> 02:13:32,586
I told him he would be safe.

1441
02:13:35,096 --> 02:13:36,825
I told him...

1442
02:13:37,565 --> 02:13:40,796
I would lay the
groundwork for him.

1443
02:13:51,413 --> 02:13:53,574
He trusted me to do that.

1444
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:07,657
It was the Bolivian Communist Party
who let him down, not you.

1445
02:14:12,867 --> 02:14:16,030
It was they who abandoned
their support for him.

1446
02:14:18,173 --> 02:14:21,006
Che would not have trusted them.

1447
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,340
But he trusted me.

1448
02:14:25,647 --> 02:14:29,481
He trusted me to get that right.

1449
02:15:04,752 --> 02:15:09,189
- Comrade Fidel, how are you?
- How are you? All right?

1450
02:15:09,457 --> 02:15:11,618
How are you? My comrade.

1451
02:15:11,826 --> 02:15:14,693
Two hours and 40 minutes.

1452
02:15:16,564 --> 02:15:18,896
55 minutes.

1453
02:15:19,634 --> 02:15:22,467
0ne hour and 20 minutes.

1454
02:15:22,737 --> 02:15:26,639
Four hours and 55 minutes
standing in line...

1455
02:15:26,841 --> 02:15:28,365
and that 's all
I could find to buy.

1456
02:15:31,045 --> 02:15:33,343
This will soon stop.

1457
02:15:33,548 --> 02:15:38,576
- Soon we'll have enough food...
- No steak and no onions.

1458
02:15:38,786 --> 02:15:42,415
To pay the education of your
grandchildren, to pay doctors...

1459
02:15:42,624 --> 02:15:45,923
I know, I know!
Sacrifices have to be made.

1460
02:15:46,127 --> 02:15:48,925
Fidel, don't you remember me?

1461
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:50,930
I remember you.

1462
02:15:51,132 --> 02:15:53,692
- Don't you remember me?
- Yes, I remember you.

1463
02:15:53,902 --> 02:15:57,770
In the kitchen of Havana Libre.
The best meal of my life!

1464
02:15:58,006 --> 02:15:59,701
The best meal of my life...

1465
02:15:59,908 --> 02:16:03,071
3 o'clock in the morning,
when we entered Havana!

1466
02:16:03,278 --> 02:16:07,146
Every night since then
I have prayed for the revolution.

1467
02:16:07,348 --> 02:16:09,145
For 10 years, every night.

1468
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:13,218
And every morning I wake up
and things are worse.

1469
02:16:13,821 --> 02:16:16,915
My grandson works on the docks.

1470
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:21,994
Today they loaded
the whole boat...

1471
02:16:22,196 --> 02:16:26,064
with can milk for Vietnam.

1472
02:16:26,968 --> 02:16:32,133
We don't want our money spent on
revolutions in Africa and in Asia.

1473
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:36,436
We need the food now, here.
Don't interrupt me when l'm talking.

1474
02:16:37,178 --> 02:16:41,512
Ten years ago you asked us
what you could do for us.

1475
02:16:43,518 --> 02:16:48,114
Well... you can listen to us now.

1476
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:51,950
We want to be free to trade
among ourselves...

1477
02:16:52,927 --> 02:16:58,490
and to be able to complain about
the good-for-nothing party managers.

1478
02:16:59,334 --> 02:17:04,067
- Without being thrown into prison.
- But you are free to complain.

1479
02:17:04,272 --> 02:17:07,537
What am I gonna do now?
Arrest you?

1480
02:17:11,412 --> 02:17:13,744
And am I not listening to you now?

1481
02:17:16,317 --> 02:17:17,716
Celia.

1482
02:17:18,319 --> 02:17:24,053
The problem is that we are not
working together, as a people.

1483
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:31,362
What we need to do is work more for
the revolution and not for ourselves.

1484
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,992
What we need is more sacrifices.

1485
02:17:40,742 --> 02:17:46,806
We promised that we'd have milk for
everyone by the end of this year.

1486
02:17:47,115 --> 02:17:51,745
- These results are worse than ever.
- Why don't the cows produce enough?

1487
02:17:52,353 --> 02:17:56,050
Because the crossbreeding program
has not given the result we hoped for.

1488
02:17:56,257 --> 02:18:00,023
Nothing to do with it.
I set this program up myself.

1489
02:18:00,428 --> 02:18:04,421
And this cow is the best
milk producer in the world.

1490
02:18:06,701 --> 02:18:09,932
In theory, yes.
But because of the climate...

1491
02:18:10,138 --> 02:18:13,039
- Are you blaming the cow?
- No. 0f course not.

1492
02:18:13,241 --> 02:18:16,301
It 's a wonderful program you have
devised for us. What l'm trying to...

1493
02:18:16,511 --> 02:18:18,502
There is nothing wrong
with the cow!

1494
02:18:20,882 --> 02:18:22,213
<i>Our revolutlon...</i>

1495
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:25,949
is not a revolution of the bourgeoisie!

1496
02:18:26,154 --> 02:18:29,590
0ur revolution is
a revolution of communists.

1497
02:18:30,191 --> 02:18:34,525
Nobody shed his blood here
fighting against the tyranny...

1498
02:18:34,729 --> 02:18:37,994
fighting against the imperialists,
against bandits and bankers...

1499
02:18:38,199 --> 02:18:41,896
in order to study the right of
somebody to make 50 pesos...

Thank you.

02:19:21,342 --> 02:19:23,469
How is she?

1509
02:19:23,911 --> 02:19:27,278
This may be the last time
you will see her.

1510
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:35,220
You have been...

1511
02:19:40,228 --> 02:19:42,719
very wonderful to me.

1512
02:19:53,107 --> 02:19:55,302
I want you to listen to me.

1513
02:19:59,981 --> 02:20:03,815
You must not interrupt me.

1514
02:20:05,319 --> 02:20:07,810
You must listen to me...

1515
02:20:09,724 --> 02:20:12,420
when I tell you...

1516
02:20:15,730 --> 02:20:18,631
that you are losing touch
with the people.

1517
02:20:19,534 --> 02:20:23,300
It 's not that they have
stopped loving you.

1518
02:20:25,406 --> 02:20:28,773
It is the nature of power.

1519
02:20:31,312 --> 02:20:34,770
Being in power for so long...

1520
02:20:38,553 --> 02:20:41,215
you are losing touch
with people's dreams...

1521
02:20:41,422 --> 02:20:44,323
what they want in life.

1522
02:20:47,929 --> 02:20:50,329
They have doctors...

1523
02:20:50,798 --> 02:20:54,097
they have schools...

1524
02:20:54,535 --> 02:20:58,266
and for that they will
always be grateful.

1525
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:08,343
But you are not giving them
what they want now.

1526
02:21:11,786 --> 02:21:13,777
Do not...

1527
02:21:13,921 --> 02:21:17,379
make them wait for you to die.

1528
02:21:20,561 --> 02:21:24,998
Do not make them
look upon you...

1529
02:21:25,833 --> 02:21:28,233
as their dictator.

1530
02:21:32,173 --> 02:21:35,074
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

1531
02:21:36,244 --> 02:21:38,610
I will never...

1532
02:21:38,813 --> 02:21:42,749
never lose touch with the people.

1533
02:21:45,853 --> 02:21:48,686
I promise you.

1534
02:22:30,831 --> 02:22:35,530

1542
02:23:05,232 --> 02:23:07,257
<i>These are the Straits of Florlda.</i>

1543
02:23:07,468 --> 02:23:11,461
<i>About 1OO mlles of shark-lnfested</i>

1544

<i>That would mean so farthls year...</i>

1546
02:23:18,746 --> 02:23:22,341
<i>4OO Cubans could have dled</i>
<i>In the treacherous waters.</i>

1547
02:23:38,933 --> 02:23:43,336
For 40 years, we have been the
target of your assassination plots.

1548
02:23:43,537 --> 02:23:47,166
Your mercenary invasions,
your military attacks...

1549
02:23:47,375 --> 02:23:51,106
insurrections planned
and paid for by your CIA.

1550
02:23:51,779 --> 02:23:56,807
For 40 years you have declared
economic and political war on us.

1551
02:23:57,018 --> 02:24:01,114
You have done everything to
destroy us by undemocratic means.

1552
02:24:01,322 --> 02:24:05,349
Because you say
we are undemocratic.

1553
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:07,754
Forty years.

1554
02:24:07,962 --> 02:24:12,126
And you are still refusing to
accept your neighbor's decision...

1555
02:24:12,333 --> 02:24:15,791
to live in his own house
as he wishes.

1556
02:24:16,003 --> 02:24:17,994
Is that democracy?

1557
02:24:18,205 --> 02:24:21,834
To punish every country
that disagrees with you?

1558
02:24:23,144 --> 02:24:26,443
Before 1959, you had
one policy for Cuba:

1559
02:24:26,647 --> 02:24:28,945
That we must be exploited.

1560
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:32,881
After 1959, you had
one policy for Cuba:

1561
02:24:33,087 --> 02:24:35,851
That we must be destroyed.

1562
02:24:36,057 --> 02:24:38,389
Is that democracy?

1563
02:24:39,593 --> 02:24:45,259
We are proud that we have survived
all your attempts to destroy us.

1564
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:50,667
So do you think we will
give up the revolution now?

1565
02:24:50,971 --> 02:24:53,906
Do you think I will sell out
the revolution...

1566
02:24:54,108 --> 02:24:59,410
for which men and women
have sacrificed their lives?

1567
02:24:59,613 --> 02:25:04,812
Just because your companies
demand the right to sell...

1568
02:25:05,019 --> 02:25:08,477
what they like, how they like
and where they like?

1569
02:25:08,689 --> 02:25:12,625
And then expect your military
to support the companies?!

1570
02:25:12,827 --> 02:25:17,526
And your CIA to assassinate
those who protest against them?!

1571
02:25:18,632 --> 02:25:22,898
Do you think I will sell out
the revolution for that?

1572
02:25:24,905 --> 02:25:28,602
I will never betray the revolution.

1573
02:25:28,809 --> 02:25:32,836
Even if I was told that
<i>98%</i> of the people in Cuba...

1574
02:25:33,047 --> 02:25:36,608
no longer believed
in the revolution...

1575
02:25:36,817 --> 02:25:39,513
I would continue to fight it.

1576
02:25:39,954 --> 02:25:46,518
Even if I was told that I was
the only one who believed...

1577
02:25:46,727 --> 02:25:49,195
I would carry on.

1578
02:25:51,765 --> 02:25:56,327
I would be the sole revolutionary.

1579
