1
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,547
I die for the revolution.

2
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,837
No Chinese woman has yet
shed blood for the revolution.

3
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,002
I shall be the first...

4
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,344
... although the world doesn't know
much about the revolution...

5
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,211
I leave behind my husband
and children.

6
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,301
My death...

7
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,503
... is my contribution
to the revolution.

8
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,505
It will build an indestructible
home for all people...

9
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,709
... a peaceful and calm world
for all children.

10
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,713
These long-enslaved
masses are numb.

11
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,587
They know not peace nor calm.

12
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,134
These two children...

13
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,421
... will soon lose their mother.

14
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,711
I die for all children.

15
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,511
I die for the revolution.

16
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,133
I'm not afraid,
nor do I care about death.

17
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,925
I rejoice at my martyrdom.

18
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,594
At this moment...

19
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,926
... I cry with blissful tears.

20
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,465
Put the donation boxes
in prominent spots.

21
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,672
Go over to the door.

22
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,834
Be vigilant.

23
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,796
Yes.

24
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,630
Let Mr. Sun rest more.

25
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:28,384
Don't disturb him.

26
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,293
Yes.

27
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,385
Juemin.

28
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:19,384
Who's that?

29
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:20,258
Who?

30
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,213
Look.

31
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,551
What?

32
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,126
Go, quick.

33
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,085
Get up, there's a woman here.

34
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,251
Don't bother, just go.

35
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,296
Keqiang.

36
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:06,338
Time to get up.

37
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,092
Get up.

38
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,010
Let me sleep three more minutes.

39
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,126
Alright.

40
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,339
Get up.

41
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,046
Two minutes.

42
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,088
Fine.

43
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,175
Two minutes.

44
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,418
One more minute.

45
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,009
I'll get up.

46
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,593
I should go to Guangzhou
for the uprising.

47
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,717
What?

48
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,960
You forgot the committee's
decision last night?

49
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,585
Keqiang, listen.

50
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,467
I won't.

51
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,752
I must throw myself into battle.

52
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,547
Then last night's meeting
was a waste.

53
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,260
Why can't we talk it
through again?

54
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,669
There's nothing to discuss.

55
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,669
Huang Xing leads
the Guangzhou uprising.

56
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,760
Sun Wen handles
fundraising overseas.

57
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,385
We voted.

58
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,629
Promise.

59
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,134
Promise.

60
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,631
These are donations
from abroad.

61
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,589
Overseas Chinese helped us.

62
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,840
I promised them.

63
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,044
I cannot fail them.

64
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,093
I must carry out my pledge.

65
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,051
It's not a personal promise...

66
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,960
... but Tongmenghui's promise.

67
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,672
They wrote these letters.

68
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,334
Who's this woman?

69
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,335
Zonghan.

70
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,009
Xu Zonghan.

71
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,131
Tongmenghui member
from my village.

72
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:06,884
I'm Huang Xing.

73
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,548
Zonghan coordinates underground
organizations in Guangzhou.

74
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,627
You two pretend
to be husband and wife.

75
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,176
It's a good cover.

76
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,460
No, it's not appropriate.

77
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,922
Why not?

78
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,676
I'm a woman and I don't care.

79
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,880
What are you afraid of?

80
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,127
It's easy to die in battle...

81
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,589
... but hard to motivate
the living.

82
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,252
You have the difficult task.

83
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:37,090
The Guangzhou uprising
will finish off the Qing Dynasty.

84
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,380
Take this pocket watch.

85
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,084
On the day of the uprising...

86
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,176
... we'll monitor time together.

87
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:05,918
Go!

88
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:06,754
Charge!

89
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,629
Quick.

90
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,172
Quick.

91
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,965
Destroy this wall!

92
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,046
Yes.

93
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,839
You rebel!

94
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,294
You dare revolt?

95
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,585
You revolutionary!

96
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,459
You dare revolt?

97
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,925
You...

98
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,255
You...

99
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,672
Where's Zhang Mingqi?

100
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:45,543
I don't know.

101
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,217
Quick!

102
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,717
And my wife.

103
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,380
Quick!

104
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,335
Comrades taking part in
the uprising know me better.

105
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,296
It's easier for me to coordinate...

106
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,630
Nonsense.

107
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,919
I can wield my pen and scalpel,
why not a gun?

108
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,381
Remember, you're still a wanted
man by the Qing court...

109
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,797
... you can't risk it.

110
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,756
If you return to China
to lead the uprising...

111
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,755
... you're being irresponsible.

112
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:31,925
Yu Peilun.

113
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,293
Yu Peilun.

114
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,005
Yu Peilun.

115
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,134
Here.

116
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,505
We couldn't contact
the other groups.

117
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,043
Zhang Mingqi ran away.

118
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,425
Keqiang said...

119
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,922
... if the uprising fails...

120
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,550
... you must inform
Sun Wen immediately.

121
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,425
What else did he say?

122
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,467
He said if he's not
back by dusk...

123
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,339
... you must leave
Guangzhou at once.

124
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:53,543
Quick.

125
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,127
Back off!
All of you!

126
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,135
Listen to my command!

127
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,293
Attack from the sides!

128
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,380
- Yes!
- Hand grenades!

129
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:19,925
- Yes.
- Follow me.

130
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,635
Charge!

131
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,214
Keqiang!

132
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:36,509
Your hand.

133
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,125
Keqiang.

134
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,835
Don't mind me, charge!

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,671
Yes.

136
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:40,675
Charge!

137
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,051
Go away!

138
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,547
Run!

139
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,709
- What are you doing?
- Run!

140
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,717
Let go!

141
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,175
Let me go!

142
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,752
Yu Peilun!

143
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:45,925
Gentlemen...

144
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,835
... our fundraiser today...

145
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,628
... was originally organized
for the Guangzhou uprising.

146
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,714
But just now...

147
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,797
... I received news.

148
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,085
Fighting in Guangzhou
has ceased.

149
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,965
The uprising has failed.

150
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,500
The telegram states,
the uprising failed...

151
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,173
... many of our core
members are dead.

152
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,252
You've never met them.

153
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:24,127
These young people
who died were talented...

154
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,343
... some came
from rich families...

155
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,919
... some have just
gotten married.

156
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,719
They were willing
to sacrifice themselves...

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,627
... whatever the cost.

158
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,294
They sacrificed their lives
for the cause...

159
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,044
... because they have faith.

160
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,547
What do your lies
have to do with us?

161
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:43,884
Good question.

162
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,794
Most of you gathered here
are overseas Chinese.

163
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:52,420
You know well our faces
mark us as Chinese...

164
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,297
... and we've suffered untold
discrimination and bullying.

165
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,173
We've endured unfair treatment.

166
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,177
All because the country
of our people...

167
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,464
... has long been
corrupt and weak...

168
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,255
... writhing in pain!

169
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,841
Our Chinese compatriots...

170
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,209
... face adversity...

171
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,626
... our land taken by others.

172
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,172
Our revolution...

173
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,840
... ensures people
can pursue happiness...

174
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,044
... that our race
will regain dignity.

175
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,957
The Chinese revolutionary
movement is blessed...

176
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,257
... by support from
overseas Chinese.

177
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,800
For many years...

178
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,710
... I strongly believe this.

179
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,052
Overseas Chinese are the
mother of the revolution.

180
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,675
Gentlemen...

181
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,464
... your children...

182
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:44,419
... have died for you.

183
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,214
Fang Shengdong.

184
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:50,464
Lin Shishuang.

185
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,464
Yu Peilun.

186
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,467
Chen Gengxin.

187
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,334
Lin Juemin.

188
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,011
This young man
will soon be a father.

189
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:33,959
What's this?

190
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,505
US$300,000.

191
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,468
Donation from Zhigongtang.

192
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,675
I won't hide this from you,
Yat-sen.

193
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,795
We sold our ancestral house.

194
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,880
Yat-sen...

195
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,419
... we're overseas Chinese...

196
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,960
... we have to settle down
here eventually.

197
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,173
The Qing Dynasty
is no longer our home.

198
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,172
Without a home...

199
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,214
... why keep an ancestral house?

200
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,418
Take it.

201
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,339
If the revolution fails...

202
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,718
... you'll owe us for generations.

203
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:42,339
Another one!

204
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,800
Yat-sen...

205
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,634
... your pocket watch
can block bullets...

206
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,044
... but not cannon shells.

207
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:26,754
Fire!

208
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,089
Empress Dowager...

209
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,797
... I heard Sun Wen has
long escaped abroad.

210
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:00,544
He hasn't returned
for more than a decade.

211
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,835
We might want to arrest him,
but it's going to be hard.

212
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:08,676
Didn't we alert our envoys
and foreign governments...

213
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,715
... about Sun, telling them they
should monitor his movements?

214
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:15,511
But Sun gives public
lectures everywhere...

215
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,002
... raising funds,
organizing rebels...

216
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,794
... trafficking arms,
plotting uprisings.

217
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,876
Minister Xu,
perhaps you overstated.

218
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,590
He hasn't appeared
before our eyes.

219
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,877
He's only mortal,
not the Monkey King.

220
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,965
What power can he wield?

221
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,878
Sun's done enough
to rock the boat.

222
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,799
These years, unrest seethes
everywhere.

223
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,835
Rebellions follow one
after another.

224
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,503
Sun's been misleading
others with his lies...

225
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,177
... so many follow his path.

226
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,965
What a troublemaker.

227
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,670
As if he doesn't make
enough trouble.

228
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,086
The Qing Dynasty will not
fall because of him.

229
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,877
If he dares enter
the Forbidden City...

230
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,585
... our Manchurian imperial
army will kill him.

231
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,467
Yes...

232
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,502
... let's just eradicate
Sun Wen and his cohorts.

233
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,673
We'll destroy them
once and for all.

234
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,255
Stop carrying on like this!

235
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,881
... or whatever other solution...

236
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,085
... I only have this to say.

237
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,218
Please, all of you...

238
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,587
... let us have some peace.

239
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,293
Recently...

240
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:31,011
... the mortgage of our railways
against the Four Nations Bank loan...

241
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,672
... has led to riots.

242
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,506
What's the use of your rifles?

243
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,297
Tell them...

244
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,960
... if they revolt...

245
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,377
... they'll all die in vain.

246
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,669
Lin Juemin.

247
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,510
You're educated...

248
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,460
... you come from a good family.

249
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,334
Why did you join the rebels?

250
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,793
Zhang Mingqi...

251
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,468
... why do you hide
in darkness?

252
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,547
What are you afraid of?

253
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,418
What am I afraid of?

254
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,800
You're afraid of my youth.

255
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,467
I have chosen death...

256
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:23,294
... but I'm still young.

257
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,130
You might live...

258
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,505
... but you are old.

259
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,089
Have you read
the study of evolution?

260
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,089
Survival of the fittest.

261
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,547
Have you considered...

262
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,427
... the leading nations in the world
were all borne of revolution?

263
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,926
China must also
have a revolution.

264
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,634
Affairs of the nation
are not your concern.

265
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,044
Sun Wen said...

266
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:54,418
... China is weak.

267
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,210
There's no way out.

268
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,335
The royal family, aristocrats and
officials all follow their old ways.

269
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,501
But what of the people?

270
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,381
They barely survive,
ignorant of the world.

271
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,960
China is no match for other
countries, it's a dire situation.

272
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,544
Young man, the Qing court
has a hard time too.

273
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,089
The court?

274
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,886
The court gave Hong Kong
to England...

275
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,714
... and Taiwan to Japan.

276
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,084
That's the good work
of the Qing court.

277
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,797
What's the use of keeping it?

278
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,584
I'm interrogating you...

279
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,294
... yet you turn around
to question me?

280
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,256
Because you have no grounds
to sentence me.

281
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,296
Lin Juemin...

282
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,301
... I had wanted
to exercise clemency.

283
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,129
There's no need.

284
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
My comrades and I
fought together...

285
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,050
... we'll die together.

286
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,259
I can't be an exception.

287
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,669
If you die...

288
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,468
... you'll be left with nothing.

289
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,294
The Qing court wants my life...

290
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,502
... I'll destroy the dynasty
at its heart.

291
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,876
Hello, Your Royal Highness...

292
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,628
... this is a car
used by British royalty.

293
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,254
As a member of Chinese royalty,
let me try.

294
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,296
Please.

295
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,594
You've come because
of the Sichuan railways?

296
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,761
The loan agreements
between our countries...

297
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,254
... and the mortgage of your
railways cannot be written off.

298
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,839
That's the trouble.

299
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,464
I knew it.

300
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,253
The mortgage of the Sichuan
and Guangdong railways...

301
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,339
... against your loan will lead
to trouble down the road.

302
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,801
If you forcibly take the railways,
it'll be a catastrophe.

303
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:06,175
Can't we find a solution,
my dear lord?

304
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,085
Look at this invention.

305
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,919
It's an iron machine.

306
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:15,965
It can move forward
and backward, left and right...

307
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,501
... whatever you wish.

308
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:18,293
My lord...

309
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,717
... please enjoy this humble gift...

310
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,461
... and steer it in
the right direction.

311
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:23,884
Mr. Ambassador...

312
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,002
... we've already sent troops
from Wuchang...

313
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,132
... to suppress the Sichuan riots.

314
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,001
Don't you worry.

315
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,390
Your Royal Highness,
you're a great strategist.

316
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,636
You're the one
holding the steering wheel.

317
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,843
You have money...

318
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,672
... you have navel fleets...

319
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,299
... you've always been better
businessmen than us.

320
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,510
In 50 years...

321
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,877
... the car you gave me...

322
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,968
... will be scrap metal.

323
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,635
But my little gift to you
will be priceless.

324
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,213
Thank you.

325
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,126
Open the door, Huang Keqiang.

326
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,752
Quick, open the door,
Huang Keqiang

327
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,326
I know you're inside.

328
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,221
Open up.

329
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:14,009
Huang Keqiang.

330
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,001
Huang Keqiang,
open the door.

331
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,426
Open the door for me.

332
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,261
What are you doing.
Huang Keqiang?

333
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,714
Put it down.

334
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,835
Give me the blade.

335
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,546
Let me go.

336
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,255
What are you doing?

337
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,299
What are you doing?

338
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,672
You can't die!

339
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:59,179
I know you saw
all of them being killed.

340
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:04,301
I know we failed.

341
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,090
I didn't want to die, Zonghan.

342
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,419
I want to keep this hand...

343
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,759
... to wield the gun.

344
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,589
Help me chop it off.

345
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,589
- No. No!
- So we failed...

346
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,876
... we've failed before!

347
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:22,588
No.

348
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:42,543
Children...

349
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,635
... do you know
what the telegram says?

350
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:45,964
No.

351
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,377
Huang Keqiang is alive.

352
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,002
Fate has been kind.

353
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,589
Who's he?

354
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:52,793
Huang Keqiang...

355
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:55,044
... is a strong and
determined man...

356
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,835
... a man who won't die.

357
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,923
We don't know him.

358
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,048
But do you know Homer Lea?

359
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,334
Yes.

360
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,467
Take me to him, please.

361
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,626
Yes.

362
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:06,918
Where's Homer Lea?

363
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,302
There.

364
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,425
Homer Lea.

365
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,835
Homer.

366
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,751
Homer!

367
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,677
- Homer!
- Hey, I'm here.

368
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,338
Mr. Lea...

369
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,171
... tell me.

370
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,878
Why are you so interested
in Chinese revolution?

371
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,380
Nowadays...

372
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,668
... a Chinese revolution...

373
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,052
... is the only thing that can
make exciting history.

374
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,380
Exciting?

375
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:46,546
That's not what
our revolution is about.

376
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,672
Why a revolution?

377
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,460
I was once a doctor.

378
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,592
I used to save a lot of lives
with my scalpel.

379
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,089
But sadly...

380
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,881
... in my country,
life is so miserable...

381
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,961
... it might be worse than death.

382
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,634
I always wonder...

383
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,719
... why my compatriots have to
endure their lives with no dignity.

384
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:17,335
They survive like animals
with very basic needs...

385
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,962
... suffering the oppression
from the ruling class...

386
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,835
... and foreign powers.

387
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,917
Now...

388
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,714
... I cannot accept it...

389
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,460
... I will not accept it.

390
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,218
I want to change.

391
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,002
I want a revolution!

392
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,338
Come...

393
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,092
... I'll show you.

394
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:43,006
Recently, in Sichuan...

395
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:47,092
... the central part of China, where
people have launched a movement...

396
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,726
... of protecting railway projects...

397
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:52,126
... against the hopelessly
corrupted Qing government.

398
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,508
It is said that
the Qing government...

399
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:59,008
... has to mobilize the army
from Hubei province to Sichuan.

400
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,134
What they don't know...

401
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,234
... is many officers who stayed
behind in the army of...

402
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,717
... Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu...

403
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,130
... are active members
of Tongmenghui...

404
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,330
... the Restoration League.

405
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,751
I have a feeling...

406
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,169
... that in the south
of Yangtze River...

407
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,209
... an even bigger movement...
will take hold.

408
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,051
I want to join your revolution.

409
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,005
That's fine.

410
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,835
I would like to invite you...

411
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,504
... to join the Chinese revolution
as a military advisor...

412
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,792
... but I'm afraid I cannot afford you
and pay the attention you deserve.

413
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:35,629
This...

414
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,422
... this is not about money.

415
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,880
It's about you, Sun.

416
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:43,258
You must be China's
first president.

417
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:49,759
I promise.

418
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:03,918
Peng Chufan!

419
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,802
Liu Fuji!
Yang Hongsheng!

420
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,127
The three of them
plotted mutiny!

421
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,297
Heaven's punishment
is upon them.

422
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:15,884
We execute them today
as a warning to all.

423
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,669
Governor, we found the name list.
What should we do?

424
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:24,626
What else can we do?

425
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:28,130
Starting tonight,
kill everyone on the list.

426
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:29,635
No one will be spared!

427
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,385
All of you,
ask your own conscience.

428
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,339
The Qing court supports
and protects you...

429
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:49,711
... yet you plot to rebel,
following such thugs as Sun Wen.

430
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:54,676
Isn't that the behavior of
unfilial sons, killing their parents?

431
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,293
Stop, you two.

432
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,677
What are your names?

433
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,130
Xiong Bingkun of the 8th regiment,
8th engineering battalion.

434
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,714
Jin Zheolong of the 8th regiment,
8th engineering battalion.

435
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:13,592
Lie low.

436
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,672
This is a crisis.

437
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,584
Don't be hot-tempered.

438
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,501
Yes.

439
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,717
What is this?

440
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,880
A mutiny?

441
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,084
Not sleeping?

442
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,214
What do you want?

443
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,297
What?

444
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,209
This is a mutiny.

445
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,217
Tao Qisheng!

446
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,584
Brother...

447
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:39,925
... put down your rifle.

448
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,425
I'm leading a mutiny.

449
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,676
How many more will you kill?

450
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,380
You're lucky that
I'm aiming at you.

451
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,885
Brother, this is not a joke.

452
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,877
If we don't do it now,
then when?

453
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:53,959
Help!

454
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,172
Tell Zhang Zhenwu to bring
two of his battalions.

455
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,926
Aim all artillery at the
Governor's mansion.

456
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,919
When Xiong Bingkun lights
the torch, fire at the mansion.

457
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,754
Yes.

458
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,676
Charge!

459
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:35,839
Hand grenades!

460
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:42,168
Go!

461
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,376
Jin Zhaolong!

462
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,460
Jin Zhaolong!
Xiong Bingkun!

463
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,169
Lead two platoons.

464
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,630
Order everyone
to bring gas canisters.

465
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:02,839
Rush in to fuel the fire.

466
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,047
Light the target.

467
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:04,796
Yes!

468
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,501
- Quick!
- Quick!

469
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:08,918
Quick!

470
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,335
Quick.

471
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,168
Ready!

472
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,005
Target is the
Governor's mansion!

473
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,093
Load!

474
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,010
Done!

475
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,502
Fire!

476
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,210
Load!

477
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,342
Fire!

478
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,380
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.

479
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:49,418
Good morning.

480
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:50,629
Here.

481
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:51,834
Oh, yes.

482
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,501
Oh, Dr. Sun.

483
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,251
Yes?

484
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,583
It seems like there's something
in today's paper about China.

485
00:35:58,917 --> 00:35:59,634
Thank you.

486
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,252
Do you need some help,
Dr. Sun?

487
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,252
Can I give you some water?

488
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,252
I'm alright.

489
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:56,588
Yat-sen.

490
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,710
Hey, what's going on in here?

491
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,009
What are you guys doing?

492
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,669
Come on.

493
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,427
Yat-sen.
The revolution has succeeded.

494
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,294
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- Sorry.

495
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,422
On October 10...

496
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,717
... the revolutionary army
took over Wuchang.

497
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,468
Governor Rui Cheng
fled overnight.

498
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,923
Wuchang revolutionaries
telegraphed the entire country...

499
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,381
... asking them to join in the
rebellion. The world's in shock.

500
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,084
Yat-sen...

501
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:19,339
... you should return
to China immediately.

502
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,797
I'll reserve a boat ticket for you.

503
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,002
It takes 20 days
across the Pacific...

504
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:23,302
... then you'll reach Shanghai.

505
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:25,714
It happened in Wuchang.

506
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,585
It happened in Wuchang.

507
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,627
Send a telegram
to Keqiang in Hong Kong...

508
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,794
... so he travels to Wuchang
to lead the revolution.

509
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:34,550
Yes!

510
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:37,959
Sun...

511
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,126
... I'm ready.

512
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:40,794
I'll go to China with you.

513
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,626
No, no, no.

514
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,710
I'll go to Europe first.

515
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,336
Huang Xing is much better
than me to handle this in China.

516
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,126
Why?

517
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,501
The unrest in China
will be closely linked...

518
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:56,005
... to the Four Nations Bank
loan to the Qing court.

519
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,590
The court's out of money now.

520
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,710
But if they get the loan,
they can thwart the revolution.

521
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,505
Reserve tickets for Europe.

522
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:10,001
Zonghan, don't bother
making dinner.

523
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,129
We're running out of time.

524
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,714
Put it down.

525
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,047
Why are you so anxious?

526
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,926
You don't need it.

527
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,919
The battle in Wuchang
will be intense.

528
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,085
I'm concerned for your safety.

529
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,923
What about your own safety?

530
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:43,504
Don't worry...

531
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:44,668
... I won't die.

532
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:46,964
Fate will be kind to me.

533
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,130
I should go now.

534
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,092
Leave.

535
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,630
What happened?

536
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,794
Only yesterday Rui Cheng
reported to us...

537
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,919
... that the rebel leaders
were killed.

538
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,255
A day passed and...

539
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,964
The New Army had it easy.

540
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,296
Clearly...

541
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,512
... the Wuchang regiments were
sent to Sichuan to stop the unrest.

542
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:34,136
The city was leave unguarded.

543
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,294
Tell me something
I don't already know.

544
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:37,969
The Qing court has ruled
for more than 200 years.

545
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,969
We've ridden through
many storms.

546
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,210
It's only a small flame,
we'll extinguish it.

547
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:46,502
Who should we send
to extinguish this flame?

548
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:48,504
Empress Dowager...

549
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:50,217
... I humbly believe...

550
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,340
I recommend Yin Chang,
head of the Imperial Army.

551
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,673
This is his duty.

552
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:00,543
Xu Shichang.

553
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,418
Yes.

554
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,425
Just now...

555
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,092
... what were you saying?

556
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,427
Yuan Shikai can fulfill this task.

557
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,169
Better to appoint Yin Chang.

558
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,835
This is family affair.
It's better to send over a Manchu.

559
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,468
- Hand it over.
- Yes.

560
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,217
Empress Dowager...

561
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,169
... I would like
to submit a request.

562
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,634
Say it, Royal Prince.

563
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,170
Food and supplies
precede an army.

564
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:29,792
There's this old saying...

565
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,756
Be precise...

566
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,715
- ... don't just quote the classics.
- In my opinion...

567
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,340
... we should finalize the loan
from the Four Nations Bank...

568
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,093
... we'll have less
to worry about later.

569
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,131
Haven't we discussed
this for months?

570
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,884
Why hasn't this been done?

571
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:49,045
The Four Nations Bank felt
we've been indecisive...

572
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,714
... about mortgaging our railways.

573
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,386
There's been criticism outside.

574
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,177
People say that we're giving
away our sovereignty.

575
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:01,592
If we're not rulers here,
is this even a country?

576
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:06,968
General Li, for the sake
of the times, please decide.

577
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,051
I've treated you well.

578
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,090
Why are you making
it so difficult for me?

579
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:12,964
We ask that you lead the
Military Government.

580
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,502
We're not making it difficult!

581
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,043
Drop your gun!

582
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:18,714
Ask him to drop his gun.

583
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,543
Put it down!

584
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,881
General Li,
you've treated us well.

585
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:36,094
We wish you'd lead
the Military Government.

586
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:37,919
You have great talents
among the revolutionary ranks.

587
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,342
Why don't you ask Sun Wen
to be your leader?

588
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,342
Li Yuanhong!

589
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:43,261
The revolutionary party
will select our leaders.

590
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,717
At present...

591
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:47,255
... Sun Wen is still abroad and
Huang Keqiang is on his way here.

592
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,752
That's why we offer you this.

593
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,796
Li Yuanhong...

594
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:50,925
... do you understand
your predicament?

595
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,505
I can give up my position
in the Qing court...

596
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,798
... but I don't want to become
a revolutionary official either.

597
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,084
I only want to return home.

598
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,881
You have no idea
of the real situation.

599
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,256
Though Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao
have gone into hiding...

600
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,502
... if the court's troops
were to counterattack...

601
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,671
... they can destroy
Wuchang in a second.

602
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:16,792
Come back!

603
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:17,800
Stop!

604
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,464
- Come back!
- Go!

605
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:20,293
Stop!

606
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:22,967
Go!

607
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:34,675
Lie down!

608
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,465
Yin Chang's firing at us
from a German battleship!

609
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,129
General Li, are you alright?

610
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,676
What damned battle is this?

611
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,926
I'll die because of you.

612
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,505
Remove the ammunition, quick!

613
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:44,839
Then we'll die together.

614
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,593
We'll count you
as a revolutionary martyr.

615
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,340
Li Yuanhong,
General of the Mixed Brigade!

616
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:53,003
I'm Military Governor
Li Yuanhong!

617
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:56,176
If you want to live,
return to your stations!

618
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,877
Attention!

619
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:01,918
Yes!

620
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:05,501
Target: Battleship Chuyu!

621
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,508
Distance: 2400 feet!

622
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,833
Load!

623
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,843
Prepare for rapid firing,
first round.

624
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,841
Rapid firing, first round.

625
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,718
Fire!

626
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:26,169
Distance: 2350 feet!

627
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,755
25 degrees to the right!

628
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,043
Load!

629
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,585
Fire all three cannons!

630
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,967
Fire!

631
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:40,419
Cease fire!

632
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:42,589
Why did we stop?

633
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:46,377
Since I'm the Military Governor,
I make all the decisions.

634
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:47,634
Why did they stop?

635
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:50,755
They ran out of ammunition?

636
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:51,543
Doesn't look like it.

637
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:54,006
Should we fire back
to test them?

638
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,084
What for?

639
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,002
Better keep our lives.
Run.

640
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:58,043
Run.

641
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,714
Even if we annihilate
Yin Chang, so what?

642
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:07,880
He's of no consequence.

643
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,090
The real battle is ahead of us.

644
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:11,588
Yes.

645
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:13,464
You want to cut my queue?

646
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,421
Fine.

647
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:15,463
Come.

648
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:24,090
Since you revolutionaries have
bestowed such honour on me...

649
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,593
... I'll be presumptuous
and break the law.

650
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:40,419
Father.

651
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:47,009
Good news.

652
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,048
You scared away my fish.

653
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,460
You're coming out of seclusion.

654
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,968
You can't hold your horses,
can you?

655
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,672
General, Huafu is here.

656
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:28,293
Huafu.

657
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:33,382
Let's show the revolutionaries
and those in the Forbidden City...

658
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,672
... our great Beiyang Army
and our great power.

659
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:38,376
Yes.

660
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,343
Attention, artillery!

661
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,218
Target ahead!

662
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,260
25 degrees to the right!

663
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,717
Distance at 500 feet!

664
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:47,335
Load!

665
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,922
Ready!

666
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,171
Fire!

667
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,217
Alcohol!

668
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,334
Keqiang.

669
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,877
Where should we go?

670
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,551
Wherever there's heavy gunfire.

671
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:18,425
Make way!

672
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:19,796
Make way!

673
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:26,084
Commander!

674
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,047
Avoid gunfire!

675
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:41,630
Avoid gunfire!

676
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:43,169
Hide in the trench!

677
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:44,259
Hide in the trench!

678
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,672
Hide in the trench!

679
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,340
Don't run!

680
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,210
Go back!

681
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,127
Don't run!
Retrieve the gun!

682
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,881
Remember,
a live soldier is useless...

683
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:19,545
... without his weapon.

684
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,967
Tell me, Huafu.
Tell me.

685
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,175
General.

686
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:31,134
We've taken Hankou.

687
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,299
Your order to attack
scorch Hankou.

688
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,509
With Hankou, it now
gives us access to Wu...

689
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,548
What's your next step?

690
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:41,879
Morale is high.

691
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,544
We attack Wuchang right away.

692
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:46,342
Great.
We take Hankou first...

693
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,675
... then attack Beijing.

694
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:48,800
We'll conquer the world.

695
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,005
Sit down, have some food.

696
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:51,043
This is a Heaven-sent
opportunity.

697
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,334
Sit down!

698
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,217
Keding...

699
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:22,715
... you're not far from death.

700
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,843
Let's wait on Wuchang.

701
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,593
After the rabbit is killed...

702
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,380
... the hunting dog
will be cooked.

703
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:42,510
Enemy positions have advanced.

704
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,001
Once they cover
their firing range...

705
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,214
... the infantry will attack.

706
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,590
The key to combat
is to avoid gunfire.

707
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,421
Yes!

708
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:50,668
Idiot!

709
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,092
Trying to run away?
I'll kill you!

710
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,172
Drop your gun!

711
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,465
He's Huang Xing,
our Commander.

712
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:58,546
Salute!

713
00:50:59,083 --> 00:50:59,959
I command you all.

714
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,634
From now on,
follow my orders!

715
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:02,384
Yes!

716
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,465
Always be prepared
to enter the frontlines.

717
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,209
Yes!

718
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,093
We torched Hankou well...

719
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,752
... it was a great offense.

720
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,627
But now...

721
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,630
... we won't follow up.

722
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,673
If the revolutionaries
can be easily defeated...

723
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,760
... the country still belongs
to the Qing court.

724
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,551
If the Qing court is also weak...

725
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,756
... the revolutionaries
could seize power.

726
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:39,594
Somehow...

727
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:43,215
... we must be get a share of it.

728
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:46,756
Here's my condition
to the Qing court.

729
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,295
I take full power over the
army and its supplies.

730
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:50,550
Now...

731
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:54,511
... Empress Dowager Longyu
and the princes must know...

732
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,795
... that they must get the loan
from the Four Nations Bank...

733
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,381
... in order to continue
this battle.

734
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,835
As for the revolutionaries...

735
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,968
Should we contact Li Yuanhong
and test the waters?

736
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,544
But he's not a revolutionary.

737
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,218
In the long run...

738
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:17,962
... we should find someone
we can connect with...

739
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,923
... Sun Wen and Huang Xing.

740
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,001
Report.

741
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,550
Wang Jingwei is here.

742
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:30,043
Please.

743
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,544
Isn't Wang supposed to be
in Beijing, in prison?

744
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,423
Zaifeng released him.

745
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:39,834
You were locked up for a year.

746
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,843
You've suffered.

747
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:45,135
Times have changed,
don't mention it any more.

748
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:48,841
I admire you the most
among the revolutionaries.

749
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,093
I was just telling Keding...

750
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:54,253
... we should swear
as blood brothers.

751
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:56,714
Zhaoming...

752
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,543
... tell me.

753
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,928
What do you
revolutionaries want?

754
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,960
We want to establish a republic.

755
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,796
Republic?

756
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,003
But why?

757
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:13,385
Feudalism has kept China
back for far too long.

758
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,425
As long as there's an Emperor...

759
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,585
... we cannot rid ourselves
of the old system.

760
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,085
The revolution must
depose the Emperor...

761
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:20,543
... and the imperial system.

762
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:21,960
That's all theory.

763
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:23,547
We have to put it in practice.

764
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,593
When the republic is established,
who will lead it?

765
00:53:28,167 --> 00:53:29,714
A leader of the republic
is elected by all citizens.

766
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:38,879
Brother Zhaoming...

767
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:42,710
... the General pondered seriously
before inviting you from Beijing.

768
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,422
He'd like your help.

769
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,043
You're the one who knows
the revolutionaries well.

770
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,672
Zhaoming...

771
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:53,174
... is Sun Wen still abroad?

772
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:18,634
Gentlemen.

773
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,876
Gentlemen!

774
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,334
You know who I am
and why I'm here.

775
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,547
It seems to me...

776
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,878
... that you have decided that
you're against the revolution.

777
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,335
Am I right?

778
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:30,425
Go.

779
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,751
If that's the case...

780
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:39,131
... the Qing government
will take this loan...

781
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:43,005
... buy guns and shoot through
the hearts of revolutionaries.

782
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,878
Your money will support
the corrupt Qing government...

783
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,551
... in exchange for what?

784
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:48,675
Railway?

785
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,967
Our railway.

786
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:50,796
Sir.

787
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:51,754
Sir...

788
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,794
... please keep your voice down.

789
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,586
You're deciding the future
of my country here.

790
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:57,959
Being a Chinese...

791
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,877
... I have the right to know
what's going on here.

792
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:02,420
We've already informed
your government...

793
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,210
... regarding our decision.

794
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,049
What's happening?
You must tell me that.

795
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:09,927
Let me remind you
that we're in Europe.

796
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:11,776
I'm sure you're a man
of the world...

797
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:13,876
... but you really should
behave like a gentleman.

798
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:15,965
Do you understand what's
happening in China now?

799
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:17,175
Mr. Sun Wen.

800
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:20,544
He won't answer you.

801
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,001
They are bankers...

802
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,922
... they only care
about their money...

803
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,676
... not other people's fate.

804
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,130
Mr. Hillier...

805
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,843
... do you know who he is?

806
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:30,793
No.

807
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,966
He's the man who will
decide the future of China.

808
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,171
You are?

809
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,175
Tang Manrou.

810
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,175
Wretch!

811
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,051
Your father is the Chinese
Imperial Ambassador...

812
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,835
... and you spoke for Sun Wen?

813
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,335
Do you know who he is?

814
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,717
Who is he?

815
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,677
He's a traitor
of the Qing Dynasty!

816
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,298
He's a wanted criminal!

817
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,760
He's a revolutionary.

818
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,709
Don't you know?

819
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:05,634
Tang Manrou.

820
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,798
Precisely because I know
who he is...

821
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,252
... that's why I helped him.

822
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,751
Mr. Hillier.

823
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:30,755
Hillier.

824
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,002
I must go before
this person arrives.

825
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,047
We cannot be present
in the same place.

826
00:56:35,542 --> 00:56:36,885
Why leave, Minister Tang?

827
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:39,302
I beg you,
you still haven't done us...

828
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,506
... the honour of
accepting our invitation.

829
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,881
You really mustn't leave.

830
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,591
Please.
Don't leave.

831
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:50,089
Ladies and gentlemen...

832
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,052
... I'm well aware that
I've come here uninvited.

833
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:54,425
However...

834
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:58,000
... as the leader of the Chinese
revolution, I only ask you...

835
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,423
... please reconsider
the 6 million pounds...

836
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,176
... your loan to
the Qing government.

837
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:03,129
Sun Wen...

838
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:04,919
... you're a subject
of the Qing Dynasty...

839
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,922
... yet you show no respect
for your country.

840
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,802
How can you claim any respect
regarding our country?

841
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,007
You've lost it all
a long time ago.

842
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,548
I represent the whole
Chinese people...

843
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:20,053
... and speak in the name as
leader of the Chinese revolution.

844
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:20,925
Dr. Sun...

845
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,631
... we will not break such an
important business contract.

846
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:24,588
Mr. Thompson...

847
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,172
... this is not a business contract,
it's a political deal.

848
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:31,636
If this contract is signed,
what's at stake here...

849
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,301
... is Chinese sovereignty.

850
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,126
Mr. Sun...

851
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,886
... our German banks
only care about business...

852
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:40,087
... we don't care
about domestic politics.

853
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,173
My dearest German delegates...

854
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:46,133
... every time the Qing
government fires a gun at us...

855
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,340
... your money
presses the trigger.

856
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:51,917
The Qing government will buy
weapons with your loan, nothing else.

857
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:53,551
Perhaps you've misunderstood.

858
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,017
According to my understanding...

859
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:56,917
... this loan is intended
to help rebuild the railways.

860
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:58,300
Mr. Sun...

861
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:01,297
... our minister in Peking,
Sir John Newell Jordan...

862
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:02,801
... said the same thing
about the loan.

863
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,005
Dear Sir Buchanan...

864
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:06,761
... I believe when
Mr. Jordan realizes...

865
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,504
... that the money is used to
destroy the Chinese revolution...

866
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:11,918
... he will change his mind.

867
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:12,959
Sun Wen!

868
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,380
This is my second warning.

869
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:16,172
Do not defame
the Qing Dynasty here.

870
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,334
Defame?

871
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,046
Minister Tang...

872
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:20,635
... you underestimate us.

873
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,127
We want to depose
you and the court.

874
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,671
Gentlemen...

875
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,801
... we all know that
to give good money...

876
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,755
... to a bad client
is a fatal mistake.

877
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:33,257
The Qing government is like
a patient diagnosed with cancer.

878
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,426
Your loan is like sugar pills...

879
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:39,343
... it'll only make him feel better,
but the fate is sealed.

880
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,882
It seems that you are quite pessimistic
about the future in China.

881
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,547
No, I'm not.

882
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,047
On the contrary...

883
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,504
... my vision of the new China
is very positive.

884
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:52,042
I see huge miles covered with
plenty of natural resources.

885
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,711
I see thousands of banks
providing new capital.

886
00:58:54,917 --> 00:58:56,147
I see a mountain of railways...

887
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:58,547
... connecting all the
modern communities.

888
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:00,050
Gentlemen...

889
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:02,214
... you are bankers.

890
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:05,136
You should know how
to invest your money wisely.

891
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,798
Would you rather
invest your money...

892
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:11,546
... into a dying government
or the emerging one?

893
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,135
Mr. Sun Yat-sen...

894
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,711
... I know you are the leader
of this revolution...

895
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,548
... and I respect your revolution.

896
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:21,793
However, we cannot invest money
against the interests of our own nation.

897
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,217
You may know
that I'm a surgeon.

898
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:28,926
As a doctor, my duty
is to save my patient's life.

899
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,255
One day...

900
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,797
... I find my country
is suffering from cancer.

901
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:35,880
Mr. Hillier...

902
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:40,670
... the situation of China
is like this roast lamb.

903
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:45,676
It's unlikely our people
would enjoy freedom...

904
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:49,425
... equality and fraternity.

905
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:50,796
Yes...

906
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:54,214
... that is to say,
this is China.

907
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,761
And all of you want a piece.

908
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,092
Germany...

909
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,376
... here's your piece...

910
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,756
... the Shandong peninsula.

911
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:07,419
Good location, isn't it?

912
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,548
What's all this?

913
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,630
Sir Buchanan...

914
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:11,714
... your piece...

915
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,344
... left rather small on this plate...

916
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:16,009
... only Hong Kong.

917
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:20,760
And you know very well,
this is a gate to reach China.

918
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,799
Mr. Thompson, let me cut out
this special piece for you...

919
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,465
... in memory of all
those Chinese lives...

920
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,723
... that were lost
carving out your mountain...

921
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:32,923
... for the transcontinental railway.

922
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:38,884
Where they sleep, buried,
the bones of Chinese labourers.

923
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,920
It's a pity, that all those countries
not here today.

924
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,001
Russia...

925
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:45,919
... Japan and Portugal.

926
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:48,302
They want Pescadores,
Liaodong Peninsula...

927
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,459
... and Macau.

928
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:51,668
Gentlemen...

929
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:56,671
... this is the last time you can
gather to feast on China.

930
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,384
I really hope...

931
01:00:58,542 --> 01:00:59,964
... I made my point clear.

932
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:02,963
Mr. Tang...

933
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,718
... please wait a moment.

934
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,334
Go home.

935
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:08,209
Please.

936
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,002
Please stay.

937
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,217
Stay.

938
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:20,963
Here.

939
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,673
Can you tell me
what does revolution mean?

940
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:26,384
Like a doctor
who heals patients...

941
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,377
... a revolution saves
an entire people.

942
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,009
Mr. Sun...

943
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,760
... I heard girls in China...

944
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,715
... have to bind their feet
from a young age.

945
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:36,009
Is it painful?

946
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:38,798
Yes, it's painful.

947
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,964
But, it will be gone very soon.

948
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,794
I see.
Thank you.

949
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,384
Must people lose their lives
in revolution?

950
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:53,343
The final goal of revolution
isn't death, but to change fate.

951
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:56,427
Young people sacrificed
themselves for the revolution...

952
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,591
... so those living
can lead better lives.

953
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,755
Extend firing range!

954
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:46,922
Come!

955
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,794
It's overheated!
It won't fire!

956
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:51,043
Piss on it!

957
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:20,419
Lie down!

958
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:22,751
Lie down!

959
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,510
Nurse!

960
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:37,634
Little Hubei,
gather hand grenades.

961
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:44,546
Give them to me!

962
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,967
- Give them to me!
- No!

963
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:47,009
Let go.

964
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:49,044
- Commander!
- Let go!

965
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,004
Don't pull me back!

966
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,634
Don't pull me back!

967
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,085
Let go!

968
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:56,543
Go!

969
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:57,964
Little Hubei!

970
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:04,755
Ammunition handler.

971
01:06:09,917 --> 01:06:12,636
Charge!

972
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,547
General, Huafu is here.

973
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,925
General, we've taken Hanyang.

974
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,420
Should we continue fighting?

975
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:27,048
There's no need for us
to be in such a rush.

976
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,718
We nave to let
the Qing court understand...

977
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,551
... if they don't pay up...

978
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:32,965
... we won't move.

979
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:38,834
Your words mean...

980
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,380
Can't you read?

981
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,592
Read it yourself.

982
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,672
Fight slowly...

983
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,210
... wait and see?

984
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,465
- But morale is high.
- I must return to Beijing...

985
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:51,761
... and see what
the Empress Dowager says.

986
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,676
Let me tell you
my bottom line.

987
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:59,844
If the court doesn't
give me enough money...

988
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,256
... I won't fight.

989
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:06,007
I'd thought it'd be easy
to defeat them...

990
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:10,669
... but Sun's rebels are resilient.

991
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:15,126
I also lack ammunition
and supplies.

992
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,043
Empress Dowager...

993
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:21,468
... I was forced to cease
the battle of Wuchang.

994
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:22,501
Yuan Shikai.

995
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:23,589
Yes, Empress Dowager.

996
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,047
How much do you need?

997
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:28,797
Tell me.

998
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,924
If I have 12 million
taels of gold...

999
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,381
... I can finish off the revolutionaries
within a few months.

1000
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,256
If we have no money for battle,
we only have one choice.

1001
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:48,836
To make peace
with the revolutionaries.

1002
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,047
You dare?

1003
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,423
Making peace means
we acknowledge them.

1004
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:57,923
My Beiyang Army is on its
last round of ammunition.

1005
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,926
I'll never agree to
your making peace.

1006
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,881
If you really care
about the Qing court...

1007
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,629
... do something useful,
donate your riches.

1008
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:09,461
Why don't you donate your
own money to the cause?

1009
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:11,377
Yuan Shikai.

1010
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,923
Empress Dowager,
as I had reported earlier...

1011
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:21,171
... we must have enough money
to support the army.

1012
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:24,261
Yuan Shikai is indeed
hard pressed.

1013
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:45,131
You love to argue all the time..

1014
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,711
... pretending to be
loyal ministers.

1015
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,672
Now in times of crisis...

1016
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,637
... you've all become selfish.

1017
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,669
The dynasty is destined to fall.

1018
01:09:58,958 --> 01:09:59,675
Your servant...

1019
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,801
... will give up all
of his possessions.

1020
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:03,760
This is a time of crisis,
I will lead...

1021
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,965
... my entire family
to protect the country.

1022
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,759
Your servant
doesn't want a coffin...

1023
01:10:07,917 --> 01:10:09,760
... nor does he care
about his ancestral grave.

1024
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,461
If money can help
destroy the rebels...

1025
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:17,794
... then I'll leave everything
and return to my home village.

1026
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:21,671
The Four Nations Bank has
been persuaded by Sun.

1027
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,093
I'm afraid we won't receive
a cent of this loan.

1028
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:29,501
I know.

1029
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,801
Heaven will punish
Sun Wen for this.

1030
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:35,800
Empress Dowager...

1031
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,839
... even though we run out of
money, food and ammunition...

1032
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:44,135
... we still have for centuries
our loyal subjects.

1033
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,843
I only have this to say.

1034
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,002
I will die for the Qing Dynasty.

1035
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,919
Sun Wen, your interference
with the Four Nations Bank loan...

1036
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:07,211
... has generated controversy
in China.

1037
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,590
This is the Prince Regent's
order to assassinate you.

1038
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,794
This one looks more like
a portrait of the deceased.

1039
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:24,048
I don't agree with you,
but I respect your courage.

1040
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:25,668
I won't kill you.

1041
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,460
I want to persuade you.

1042
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:35,128
Sun Wen, we are both
past middle age.

1043
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:36,509
Confucius said...

1044
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:38,843
... at 50, I knew my destiny.

1045
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:40,959
He also said...

1046
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:42,550
... at 40, I am not deluded.

1047
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,965
I've never wavered
from my beliefs.

1048
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,676
I know why you won't kill me.

1049
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:50,877
You're a father.

1050
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,128
... will eventually
destroy your children.

1051
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:01,465
We all want a strong and bright
China for our children.

1052
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,251
Go.

1053
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,047
I don't want to see you again.

1054
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,009
Mr. Jordan...

1055
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,504
... you're the first guest
in my new house.

1056
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,673
Now that you've moved to Beijing,
we can see each other more often.

1057
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:15,504
Yes.

1058
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:17,920
I don't intend to leave
the city this time.

1059
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:22,010
How's the situation
in the South?

1060
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,004
Difficult.

1061
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:26,959
Sun Wen and Huang Xing are
southern barbarians with big appetites.

1062
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:31,676
You could have conquered
Wuchang but you stopped.

1063
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,880
We all know the Qing Dynasty
has run out of money.

1064
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:36,259
The end is near.

1065
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,169
You want to profit
from the power balance...

1066
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,711
... between the Qing court
and the revolutionary army.

1067
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,256
So now you want peace.

1068
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:45,885
So what do you think...

1069
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,628
... of this balance between
my left and right hands?

1070
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:51,051
Truth be told,
I'm very impressed.

1071
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,209
But the revolutionaries
won't talk to me.

1072
01:13:57,917 --> 01:14:01,751
Now I understand. You hope
we could extend a hand.

1073
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:05,334
You...

1074
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,874
We'll pave the way for you
to negotiate peace...

1075
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:13,874
... with the revolutionaries.

1076
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:16,802
It's not good for anyone
if fighting continues.

1077
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:19,386
What's most important now
is holding onto power.

1078
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,800
Real power.

1079
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,544
We are looking
for a collaborator...

1080
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,712
... to protect the interests
of Britain in China.

1081
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:29,506
Well, you've found him.

1082
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,050
Military Governor,
let me explain.

1083
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,923
I sent Keqiang to Shanghai...

1084
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:38,007
... because of the overall strategy
of the revolutionary movement.

1085
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,050
I don't understand.

1086
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,297
The Wuchang uprising
attracted the world's attention.

1087
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:42,589
Isn't that also part of
the overall strategy?

1088
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,718
Since we can attack Nanjing,
why can't we defend Wuchang'?

1089
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,627
In Wuchang, we're at a stalemate
with the Beiyang Army.

1090
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,256
Our trainee soliders
have suffered heavy casualties.

1091
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:53,339
In Nanjing,
the enemy is weak.

1092
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,298
Our plan is to attack Nanjing,
than retake Wuchang.

1093
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,334
That's our overall strategy.

1094
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,547
This is the decision made
by the Tongmenghui.

1095
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:00,585
I must abide by it.

1096
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,799
Fine.
Whatever you say.

1097
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,881
But I won't go to Shanghai.

1098
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:07,759
Please understand...

1099
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,795
... it hasn't been easy to
forge our paths together.

1100
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,459
My home is here.

1101
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,501
My power base is here.

1102
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:14,589
Military Governor Li...

1103
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:19,135
... it appears we won't
be sharing the same path.

1104
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,546
Don't move.

1105
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:26,134
Don't move.

1106
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:27,463
Lie down.

1107
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:29,384
Listen...

1108
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:30,808
... if you want to live
for the revolution...

1109
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,459
... we must amputate your leg.
Do you hear me?

1110
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:44,050
Alcohol.

1111
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,584
It's fine.

1112
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:49,842
Ready?

1113
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,002
- Be brave.
- We begin now.

1114
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,176
Listen to me.

1115
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:07,251
Listen to me.

1116
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:14,755
Stop.

1117
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,501
Stop!

1118
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,467
Come.

1119
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:26,834
Take him away.

1120
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,167
You've said it before.

1121
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,585
So we failed.

1122
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,881
Haven't we failed before?

1123
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:07,510
I'm talking to you.

1124
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,005
Useless.

1125
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:42,627
Mr. Sun, I've just received
your telegraph.

1126
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:43,759
Okay.

1127
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,129
Here you are.

1128
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:46,484
Thank you.

1129
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:49,839
Mr. Sun...

1130
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:52,920
... I must inform you right away.

1131
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:56,466
The Four Nations Bank
decided to hold off...

1132
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,298
... on the loan
to the Qing government.

1133
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,051
You once told me...

1134
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:07,963
... that revolution is life,
not only living, but fate.

1135
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,210
I don't understand revolution...

1136
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:14,962
... but I've struggled
and fought, I was angry.

1137
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,548
I also knew...

1138
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:22,503
... I'd end up as sacrifice
along with my father.

1139
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:26,961
I wish your revolution...

1140
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,171
... no...

1141
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,127
... wish our revolution...

1142
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,301
... every success.

1143
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,259
Yat-sen!

1144
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:46,589
Yat-sen!

1145
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,342
Keqiang!

1146
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,421
Where are you?

1147
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:51,459
Keqiang...

1148
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,501
... I'm here.

1149
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:53,418
Can you hear me?

1150
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:54,459
I can.

1151
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:55,509
Where are you?

1152
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,085
Huang Keqiang!

1153
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,501
Yat-sen!

1154
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:04,418
I'm starboard.

1155
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,005
Me too.

1156
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:41,543
Keqiang.

1157
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:46,714
At the welcome ceremony,
you have to put on...

1158
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,460
... the revolutionary
army uniform.

1159
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:49,376
Yes.

1160
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,044
Yat-sen.

1161
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,877
Binglin, come with me.

1162
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:57,717
Not in first class?

1163
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,001
- No.
- Second class?

1164
01:19:59,167 --> 01:19:59,967
No.

1165
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:01,418
Yat-sen.

1166
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,593
It saved my life once.

1167
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,501
Keqiang...

1168
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:07,717
... your hand.

1169
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:09,918
Guangzhou uprising.

1170
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,089
Doesn't matter.

1171
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,923
Yat-sen.

1172
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:18,959
Mr. Sun.

1173
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,129
Dunchu.

1174
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,842
You're here.

1175
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,594
Yat-sen, we searched
all the way to the beam.

1176
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:25,963
You're all here.

1177
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:27,918
A hug.

1178
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,251
Let's go.

1179
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,090
Yat-sen, we waited
so long for your return.

1180
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:35,669
Shiping, you haven't aged a bit.

1181
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,501
Mr. Sun...

1182
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,047
... after your ship
departed from Europe...

1183
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:55,050
... on your journey back...

1184
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,676
... what thoughts came over you?

1185
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,051
After 16 years of tribulations...

1186
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,710
... I've returned
to my motherland.

1187
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:01,459
Mr. Sun...

1188
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:03,468
... we hear you've returned
with huge donations...

1189
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:04,376
... is that true?

1190
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:05,709
I don't have any money.

1191
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,877
All I brought back
is the revolutionary spirit.

1192
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,335
What is the ultimate
goal of the revolution?

1193
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:11,709
The goals of the revolution
are simple.

1194
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,842
We overthrow imperial rule
and save our people.

1195
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:14,709
Mr. Sun...

1196
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,834
... what did you tell
those bankers in Europe?

1197
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,922
I told them...

1198
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,584
... it's the Chinese people
who will steer the fate of China...

1199
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,465
... not foreigners
or Manchu royalty.

1200
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,422
Mr. Sun, the north and south
are now negotiating peace.

1201
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,755
What is your opinion?

1202
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,209
My opinion is this.

1203
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:32,840
We haven't reached our revolutionary
goal, we won't negotiate.

1204
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,834
Tie up them.

1205
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:51,880
Our position is that unless
the Emperor abdicates...

1206
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:53,919
... there'll be no
peace agreement.

1207
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:57,093
Our position is that the
monarchical system cannot change.

1208
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:11,002
This is a family dinner.
Shaochuan, you're part of the family.

1209
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,672
Come, try this.

1210
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,343
A specialty from home.

1211
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,044
Lotus root with glutinous rice.

1212
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,505
Come, sit.

1213
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:32,093
To thank you.

1214
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:34,836
You put in so much effort
in the negotiations.

1215
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:36,009
You've worked so hard.

1216
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:39,634
Please tell me
what's on your mind.

1217
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:42,922
You're the only one among us
who understands Sun Wen.

1218
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:45,877
I want to know more
about Sun Wen.

1219
01:23:46,125 --> 01:23:48,503
What type of a man is he?

1220
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:53,882
Zhang Shizhao said,
China will rise because of Sun.

1221
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,131
He's the person
who will revive the country.

1222
01:23:59,417 --> 01:24:01,670
Miyazaki considers Sun...

1223
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:03,551
... a hero who will save China.

1224
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,719
Kang Youwei
claimed Sun is illiterate.

1225
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:10,545
Wu Zhihui says that Sun
is a hardworking scholar.

1226
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:14,085
Some say he's like Robin Hood,
an outlaw.

1227
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,551
Some say he's a real scholar...

1228
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:19,678
... an itinerant doctor
holding a scalpel.

1229
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:25,385
Others call him
a good-for-nothing liar.

1230
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,672
There are many versions.

1231
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:30,338
Shaochuan...

1232
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,427
... he has so many followers.

1233
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,003
How does he do it?

1234
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,173
I did hear this
from many people.

1235
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,340
That Sun is selfless.

1236
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:12,339
A selfless person?

1237
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,469
Where in the world
can we find one?

1238
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:18,343
It's been 2000 years,
we can't wait any longer...

1239
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,717
- ... for China's first republic.
- Representatives from...

1240
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:20,917
... the 17 provinces
have decided...

1241
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:22,047
... not to elect a President,
but to elect a Grand Marshal.

1242
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,131
Mr. Sun, please sign.

1243
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,173
A Grand Marshal
cannot be head of state.

1244
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,880
We must elect a President.

1245
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:28,921
On the Presidential election...

1246
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,710
... should we wait to hear
from Yuan Shikai?

1247
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,135
If he can really hasten
the Emperor's abdication...

1248
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,335
The negotiating parties
already made a pact.

1249
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,218
Whoever first deposes the Qing
government will become President.

1250
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:39,968
Yuan Shikai hasn't deposed
the Qing court.

1251
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,217
We didn't break our promise.

1252
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:42,589
It you insist on
a Presidential election...

1253
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,343
... people will use that
as an excuse to resume fighting.

1254
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,251
So what?

1255
01:25:45,417 --> 01:25:47,385
We fought and look what
we've achieved today.

1256
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,088
Keqiang.

1257
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,378
If we resume fighting, what
are our chances of winning?

1258
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,468
We have no money...

1259
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:53,880
... morale is low...

1260
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:55,923
... we have no sure
chance of winning.

1261
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:57,425
How can we fight?

1262
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:58,296
This is impractical.

1263
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,801
When the revolutionary
army had nothing...

1264
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:01,255
... we were willing
to sacrifice our lives.

1265
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,842
Now we have half a country...

1266
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,967
... what are we afraid of?

1267
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,448
The international community
expressed support for Yuan Shikai.

1268
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,140
Overseas Chinese all hope
we could set up government...

1269
01:26:08,141 --> 01:26:09,834
... as soon as possible
and elect a President.

1270
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:13,090
To be safe,
I think we should wait.

1271
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:15,218
If Yuan doesn't depose the
Emperor for another 100 years...

1272
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:16,718
... do we still wait?

1273
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:19,427
Let's put pressure
on him now.

1274
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:20,960
If Yuan makes
the Emperor abdicate...

1275
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,547
... do we have to keep
our promise?

1276
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:24,672
Even if Yuan makes
the Emperor abdicate...

1277
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:26,510
... he isn't qualified
to be President.

1278
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:27,668
Not true.

1279
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:31,676
If Yuan keeps his promise,
he can become President.

1280
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:34,465
If you've promised him anyway,
why bother holding an election?

1281
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,001
Good question.

1282
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:40,965
It's worth it.

1283
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,922
First...

1284
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:46,135
... we have to establish
the concept of a republic.

1285
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:49,210
It's just like building a road
in the wilderness...

1286
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,753
... so the revolution
can continue its path.

1287
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,795
In future in China,
no one can turn back.

1288
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:58,921
Lie down!

1289
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:02,134
Against the wall!

1290
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:03,714
All of you!

1291
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,593
Against the wall!

1292
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:08,626
Against the wall!

1293
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,084
He's the assassin.

1294
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:18,425
Release him.

1295
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:22,801
Who sent you here?

1296
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:25,880
Sun Wen is a sinner.

1297
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,344
He's corrupt!

1298
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:29,885
He's sullied the Qing dynasty!

1299
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:31,760
He's immoral!

1300
01:27:32,792 --> 01:27:34,009
He misleads the people.

1301
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,801
He's beyond pardon!

1302
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,173
Everyone can kill him!

1303
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:42,169
It's no use interrogating him.

1304
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,798
We live in entirely
different worlds.

1305
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:45,876
Understood.

1306
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:47,800
Two days ago...

1307
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,215
... on December 27...

1308
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,380
... provincial representatives
voted and approved...

1309
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:59,337
... the Provisional Government
Organizational Draft.

1310
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:03,553
They also approved
the Presidential system...

1311
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:06,547
... as well as the nomination
of candidates.

1312
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,798
Elections will take place today,
December 29...

1313
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,260
... for the position
of Provisional President.

1314
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:20,545
I declare each
of the 17 provinces...

1315
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,127
... though some with more
representatives than others...

1316
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,176
... is only given one vote.

1317
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:29,087
A candidate receiving more
the two-thirds of the votes...

1318
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,381
... will become
Provisional President.

1319
01:28:32,542 --> 01:28:33,839
Those in favor,
raise their hands.

1320
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:38,044
This is the Presidential ballot.

1321
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,211
Your decision is crucial.

1322
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,881
We hope you will not
disappoint your people...

1323
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:47,090
... in your choice.

1324
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:51,418
Please fill in your ballot.

1325
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:17,793
Homer.

1326
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:20,509
Sun.

1327
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:23,090
What are you doing here?

1328
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:26,421
The Presidential election
is ongoing in the council hall.

1329
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:28,214
I'm one of the candidates.

1330
01:29:29,917 --> 01:29:32,760
History, you're making history.

1331
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:34,627
I'm witnessing history.

1332
01:29:35,292 --> 01:29:37,386
I'm standing right beside history.

1333
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:38,634
For thousands of years...

1334
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:42,383
... in Chinese history,
we the people...

1335
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,218
... never received the opportunity...

1336
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,127
... to elect the head
of government.

1337
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:47,796
Never.

1338
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:49,296
That...

1339
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:51,169
... is what we've been
fighting for.

1340
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,128
Our people have been fighting
ongoing for so long.

1341
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,835
And now we finally done it.

1342
01:29:59,167 --> 01:29:59,793
Homer...

1343
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,468
... when did you get here?

1344
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,798
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

1345
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:07,093
Now, as head of the Assembly...

1346
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,467
I must be there.

1347
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:10,419
I declare the results.

1348
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:12,218
Out of a total of 17 votes...

1349
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:14,051
... Sun Wen received 16.

1350
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,424
The Provisional President
of the Republic of China is...

1351
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,175
... Sun Wen.

1352
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,467
Dr. Sun...

1353
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:21,626
... I heard your name.

1354
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:26,007
I told you you'd be
China's first President.

1355
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,510
Tang Shaoyi...

1356
01:30:48,292 --> 01:30:51,262
... didn't you say he's selfless?

1357
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:53,753
What an slap in the face!

1358
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:01,879
General.

1359
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,547
Go.

1360
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,092
Order.

1361
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:14,085
Feng Guozhang
and Duan Qirui..

1362
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,218
... to issue a joint telegram
against the republic.

1363
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:20,427
Tang Shaoyi is sympathetic to the
republic, unable to fulfill his duties...

1364
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,798
... he's dismissed as representative
to the negotiations.

1365
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:23,754
Yes.

1366
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:25,834
Send a telegram
to Wu Tingfang.

1367
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,219
I recognize neither the Nanjing
Provisional Government...

1368
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:30,419
... nor its so-called
President Sun Wen.

1369
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:40,048
... Zhang Xun has amassed
his troops around Suzhou.

1370
01:31:40,458 --> 01:31:41,050
Also...

1371
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,585
... some Qing soldiers
have been sighted...

1372
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,593
... near Qinhuai River
this afternoon.

1373
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,251
Mr. President, we advise delaying
the inauguration ceremony.

1374
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:49,968
Yes, better to be cautious.

1375
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:53,885
Today is New Year's Day
of 1912...

1376
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,585
... everything is renewed.

1377
01:31:57,292 --> 01:31:58,760
The Provisional President
of the Republic of China...

1378
01:31:58,917 --> 01:32:00,260
... must be sworn in today.

1379
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:02,168
Fine.

1380
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,835
I'll take care of all
security details...

1381
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,502
... for the Provisional President.

1382
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:08,126
Photo session.

1383
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,627
Please, look here, here.

1384
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:22,051
I pledge to overthrow
the Qing dynasty...

1385
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,218
... strengthen the
Republic of China...

1386
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:26,256
... foster better
livelihoods for all.

1387
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,335
These I promise to the people.

1388
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:29,880
I will follow them.

1389
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,293
I will serve the country
with faith.

1390
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:32,964
I will serve all people.

1391
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,343
Until the hegemony of the
Qing dynasty is overthrown...

1392
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,922
... and the country
has no strife...

1393
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:38,880
... when China will stand tall
in the world...

1394
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,426
... recognized among nations.

1395
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:41,754
At that time...

1396
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:44,295
... I will resign from the position
of Provisional President.

1397
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,756
This is my pledge
to all citizens of China.

1398
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,251
Just now...

1399
01:33:04,667 --> 01:33:07,216
... I pledged myself as the
Provisional President.

1400
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:09,884
Now, I have a few words to add.

1401
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:11,092
Today...

1402
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,676
... the Republic of China
is established...

1403
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:17,378
... but the feudal court still stands.

1404
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:22,506
Unless feudalism is uprooted,
our revolution isn't complete.

1405
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,509
I await the day...

1406
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:32,168
... I'll relinquish my position
to the person...

1407
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:34,089
... who carries through the
abdication of the Qing Emperor.

1408
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,843
What's going on?

1409
01:33:44,542 --> 01:33:47,136
I'd said it before, we shouldn't
rush to elect a President.

1410
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:50,011
The Beiyang Army has been
mobilized, war will erupt very soon.

1411
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,592
I heard Yuan Shikai has
even engaged assassins.

1412
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,967
Who's afraid of assassins?

1413
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:57,502
Mr. Sun, may I suggest,
in view of the situation...

1414
01:33:57,667 --> 01:33:58,793
... please ponder this seriously.

1415
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,551
If Yuan Shikai doesn't
depose the Qing court...

1416
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,051
... President Sun
will not step down.

1417
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:06,302
Does Mr. Sun want to indulge
in the position of President?

1418
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:11,051
Wang Zhaoming,
Sun Wen isn't that type.

1419
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,797
Since he's so selfless,
what's the harm of my asking?

1420
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:15,175
It's all about trust...

1421
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:16,296
... belief...

1422
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,592
... and faith...

1423
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:18,584
... without any doubt.

1424
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:21,627
I'm only afraid of an all-out battle
between the North and South.

1425
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:23,169
Who'd be responsible for that?

1426
01:34:23,333 --> 01:34:24,880
If our revolution is
stolen by someone else...

1427
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,547
... who'd be responsible for that?

1428
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,129
Huang Keqiang, you...

1429
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:28,713
Zhaoming.

1430
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,218
Stop arguing, please.

1431
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,922
I protect you
in front of everyone...

1432
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:35,840
... but we must be frank
behind closed doors.

1433
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:38,385
You don't have
to close any doors.

1434
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,217
Just say it, Keqiang.

1435
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:44,252
We cannot accede to any
of Yuan Shikai's demands.

1436
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,001
But he has the power.

1437
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:51,381
He can quickly
depose the Qing court.

1438
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:53,676
To establish our republic...

1439
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,676
... we need not only battles
but also politics.

1440
01:34:55,917 --> 01:34:58,293
This is revolution, not giving
a crown to someone else.

1441
01:34:59,083 --> 01:34:59,879
Sun Wen...

1442
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:02,423
... the revolution doesn't
belong to any single person.

1443
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:04,501
Keqiang...

1444
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:06,209
... what do you mean?

1445
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:07,171
You don't understand.

1446
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,334
I don't?

1447
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,672
You're accusing me of not
understanding politics.

1448
01:35:11,417 --> 01:35:12,293
But I know Yuan Shikai.

1449
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:13,300
Keqiang.

1450
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,761
You've never seen
how he killed young men.

1451
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,801
I'm worried...

1452
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:21,676
... he might become
an enemy of the republic.

1453
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:24,710
He might even restore
autocratic rule.

1454
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:38,052
It's my ninth wife's birthday.

1455
01:35:39,792 --> 01:35:42,420
Westerners celebrate
birthdays with cakes.

1456
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:43,964
But we don't.

1457
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,343
We eat peaches.

1458
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:48,761
Look how festive they ere.

1459
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:52,584
It hurts.

1460
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,172
Please let go.

1461
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,876
It hurts.

1462
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:56,793
Where's Weiting?

1463
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:58,168
I need to talk to him.

1464
01:35:58,708 --> 01:35:59,834
What happened?

1465
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:00,918
Weiting...

1466
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,422
... let's step aside.

1467
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:04,756
What are you afraid of?

1468
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,464
So what if I want to revolt?

1469
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:07,709
So what?

1470
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:14,052
It's high time
we race against Sun Wen.

1471
01:36:14,333 --> 01:36:15,833
Look at them.

1472
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:19,544
Electing a president and
setting up a government.

1473
01:36:20,292 --> 01:36:24,011
The best peaches on the tree
are picked clean by others.

1474
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:28,005
I'll kill you!

1475
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:29,842
You're a madman.

1476
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,092
Stop him!
Stop him!

1477
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:32,919
Sputtering madness!

1478
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:35,878
Help!

1479
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:37,089
Please stop him!

1480
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:38,755
Weiting.

1481
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:40,009
Calm down.

1482
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:51,760
Why did you hit him so hard?

1483
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:55,469
At this moment, I can't
afford even one mistake.

1484
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,626
You're right.

1485
01:36:58,042 --> 01:36:58,964
It's simple.

1486
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:01,755
I'm sitting on a bed of nails.

1487
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:07,131
If I don't force the court,
the situation is dire.

1488
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:09,756
The revolutionaries
control half the country.

1489
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:12,636
I can't oppose them
much longer.

1490
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:17,963
But if the Emperor
abdicates because of me...

1491
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,878
... I'll be blamed
for generations to come.

1492
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:24,175
This is indeed a tricky situation.

1493
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:28,336
The crux of the matter is,
I want to become President.

1494
01:37:51,933 --> 01:37:53,436
This is our room.

1495
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:03,465
When I arrived,
I was full of resentment.

1496
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:05,842
But now that I've seen you...

1497
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,426
... I'm no longer angry.

1498
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:23,958
Now, our baby is inside me.

1499
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:39,963
Keqiang...

1500
01:38:40,958 --> 01:38:42,585
... this painting
will soon be finished.

1501
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:49,259
But I can't decide
where to hang it.

1502
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:54,214
I want to propose...

1503
01:38:54,917 --> 01:38:56,760
... Wu Tingfang to issue
a public statement.

1504
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:59,919
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
the ceasefire will end.

1505
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:01,339
Whoever tarries...

1506
01:39:01,542 --> 01:39:02,714
... whoever resists...

1507
01:39:03,042 --> 01:39:04,510
... will be punished by all.

1508
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:05,880
If the truce cannot
be maintained...

1509
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:07,339
... we'll declare war again.

1510
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:10,794
If we resume war,
I'll lead troops to the North.

1511
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:14,130
Keqiang, you were right.

1512
01:39:14,333 --> 01:39:15,505
I've thought long and hard.

1513
01:39:16,042 --> 01:39:18,841
We have to establish
provisional laws.

1514
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:22,960
It's unimportant
who serves a single term.

1515
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,422
What we must establish...

1516
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:25,926
... is a system.

1517
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:30,298
To restrain not
only Yuan Shikai...

1518
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:34,340
... but anyone who ever dreams
of becoming an emperor.

1519
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:35,918
Painter...

1520
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,047
... please use bright red
for the flag with 18 stars.

1521
01:39:38,208 --> 01:39:38,925
Yes.

1522
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:46,589
Comradres, I hear you are
disputing my resignation...

1523
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:52,506
... but it takes more than a day
to rid 2000 years of feudal hegemony.

1524
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:56,044
I do hope you will not
just focus on one official title...

1525
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,423
... but create a truly relevant...

1526
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,631
... legally protected
revolutionary system.

1527
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,002
The world is immense. Those
who follow the righteous path thrive.

1528
01:40:03,292 --> 01:40:05,090
Those who do not
become extinct.

1529
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:07,173
I hold fast to the revolution...

1530
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,127
... knowing it will bear fruit.

1531
01:40:09,667 --> 01:40:10,919
After such a long journey...

1532
01:40:11,292 --> 01:40:12,760
... we will reach
our revolutionary goal.

1533
01:40:12,917 --> 01:40:16,251
What does Sun Wen want?

1534
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:19,084
What telegram?

1535
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:22,636
What declaration?
What war?

1536
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:31,798
Mr. Jordan is right.

1537
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:34,427
It is most important
to hold onto power.

1538
01:40:39,292 --> 01:40:42,341
The President's chair
isn't comfortable.

1539
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,922
Even if it's full of pins...

1540
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,798
... I still want to sit on it.

1541
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:51,883
The British Ambassador
told me...

1542
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:56,508
... that winter, like today...

1543
01:40:57,292 --> 01:41:00,466
... the winds were chilly.

1544
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:02,798
It was snowing.

1545
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:09,924
It was around Spring Festival,
but the entire city was desolate.

1546
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:13,045
The atmosphere almost tragic.

1547
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,459
The guillotine was placed...

1548
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:17,840
... in the middle
of the public square.

1549
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:23,011
Icicles of blood
still hanging on the blade.

1550
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,294
Louis XVI...

1551
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:28,468
... was bound and taken there.

1552
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,591
He was cold,
without even a coat.

1553
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,673
He was shivering.

1554
01:41:35,542 --> 01:41:40,674
Everyone brought their family
to witness this great occasion.

1555
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:45,174
When the hour came...

1556
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:47,085
... the executioner put the
King's head on the block...

1557
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,173
... the blade was released...

1558
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:51,294
... there was ice on his face.

1559
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:52,755
Listen...

1560
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:56,050
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

1561
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:56,925
Go on.

1562
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:58,255
Listen.

1563
01:41:59,542 --> 01:42:00,839
The whoosh of the blade.

1564
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:04,336
The whoosh of the blade.
Then?

1565
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,877
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

1566
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:08,210
Then it's the end.

1567
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,671
The end?

1568
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:14,176
That quick?

1569
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,217
Yuan Shikai...

1570
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:19,675
... you're fooling us.

1571
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:21,294
You're making this up.

1572
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:24,219
You've made up this story
from the West for us.

1573
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:26,628
I reappointed you against
my better conscience...

1574
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:28,961
... yet you do this to me?

1575
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:31,676
Royal Prince,
appease your anger.

1576
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:35,212
Did the French also
celebrate Spring Festival?

1577
01:42:36,542 --> 01:42:37,919
Royal Prince, calm down.

1578
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,092
Royal Prince.

1579
01:42:47,792 --> 01:42:49,135
I've received news that...

1580
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:51,927
... Sun Wen insists on a republic.
They will not compromise.

1581
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,421
Empress Dowager...

1582
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:55,756
... I tell you the story of
the French Revolution...

1583
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:59,587
... because I don't want
you and the princes...

1584
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,127
... to share the same fate.

1585
01:43:01,333 --> 01:43:05,585
I'm loyal to you.
Heaven can attest to it.

1586
01:43:10,042 --> 01:43:10,838
Yuan Shikai...

1587
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,004
... come over here.

1588
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:27,919
Come over!

1589
01:43:42,292 --> 01:43:43,259
Empress Dowager...

1590
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,423
... I'm at your command.

1591
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:57,835
If that day comes...

1592
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:02,884
... you mustn't let us
face the guillotine...

1593
01:44:04,875 --> 01:44:07,344
... or let us starve.

1594
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:09,093
Certainly.

1595
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:13,834
Go back.

1596
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,201
The South is eager
to resume battle...

1597
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:16,955
... Empress Dowager,
please ponder this.

1598
01:44:20,417 --> 01:44:21,213
I know.

1599
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,127
I take my leave.

1600
01:44:40,333 --> 01:44:42,427
- Prince Regent.
- Here.

1601
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:44,422
Yuan Shikai has
broken his promise...

1602
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:45,800
... he's banded with the rebels.

1603
01:44:46,167 --> 01:44:47,168
I do regret this.

1604
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,295
I dismiss him as Prime Minister.

1605
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,968
Things have developed thus.

1606
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:58,675
It won't help.

1607
01:45:13,208 --> 01:45:16,007
They're still dragging their feet,
prolonging their dynasty?

1608
01:45:16,292 --> 01:45:17,418
They are acting against
the people's wishes.

1609
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:18,709
How they overreach themselves.

1610
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,385
They're becoming enemies
of all people!

1611
01:45:20,667 --> 01:45:22,260
What a pipe dream...

1612
01:45:22,417 --> 01:45:24,761
... thinking they can still hang on!

1613
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:27,550
What happened?

1614
01:45:28,042 --> 01:45:28,884
Mr. Sun.

1615
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:34,043
What is it?

1616
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,718
Send a telegram.

1617
01:45:36,917 --> 01:45:38,294
Make it public.

1618
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:43,295
Our Revolutionary Party's
patience is running out.

1619
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,049
Don't these feudalists
have any shame?

1620
01:45:48,292 --> 01:45:49,509
Reporting to the
Empress Dowager...

1621
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,177
... our Ambassador to Russia and
others have sent telegrams to you...

1622
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:54,884
... hoping that you treasure
the Chinese people...

1623
01:45:54,885 --> 01:45:56,584
... rather than insisting
on one man's position.

1624
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:00,671
There are mutinies in the
Northeast, Xinjiang and Tibet.

1625
01:46:01,167 --> 01:46:04,341
43 generals, including
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui...

1626
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,172
... have signed a petition
in support of the republic.

1627
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:08,711
Tell me something
I don't already know.

1628
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:13,584
Empress Dowager.

1629
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,429
We have served you
and the royal court.

1630
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:17,129
We do not support
the idea of a republic.

1631
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:19,794
Please do not falter
in your position.

1632
01:46:19,958 --> 01:46:21,426
Why would I falter?

1633
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,586
It's all Yuan Shikai's doing.

1634
01:46:25,792 --> 01:46:27,419
Yuan had betrayed
Emperor Guangxu...

1635
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:28,797
... now he betrays
Emperor Xuantong.

1636
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:30,710
He's a real traitor!

1637
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:31,967
His family has received
such grace from the court...

1638
01:46:32,025 --> 01:46:33,447
... yet he's such an unfilial cur.

1639
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:34,880
He has the ambition of Wang Mang
in becoming Emperor.

1640
01:46:35,042 --> 01:46:38,673
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
he can't make his deal with the rebels.

1641
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:41,094
I'd told you before,
he's not to be trusted.

1642
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:44,218
As long as Aisin Gioro is here,
the Qing Dynasty will not fall.

1643
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:45,968
Ancestors in Heaven...

1644
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:49,877
... now other countries bully us...

1645
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,672
... the revolutionaries run wild...

1646
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:54,335
... our ministers are corrupt...

1647
01:46:54,583 --> 01:46:57,926
... they sell whatever they can
for their own gains.

1648
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:00,380
There's nothing left now.

1649
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,840
We have failed you.

1650
01:47:04,917 --> 01:47:07,510
At least Sun Wen is clement.

1651
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:08,759
He doesn't invade the Palace...

1652
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,460
... there are no guillotines.

1653
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:13,260
We want a bloodless
revolution.

1654
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,752
No more sacrifices...

1655
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:17,051
... or needless killings.

1656
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,627
Abdicate!

1657
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:50,425
Friends, greetings.

1658
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:53,753
This is a historical day.

1659
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:55,255
Let's begin.

1660
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:58,005
- Mr. President, this way.
- Come.

1661
01:47:58,458 --> 01:48:00,841
Have a angled pose.
How is it?

1662
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,894
Mr. President,
please lift up your hat.

1663
01:48:02,895 --> 01:48:03,594
All right.

1664
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,343
Let's change a pose.

1665
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:07,089
Mr. President, this way.

1666
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:09,131
Mr. President,
you look so young.

1667
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:11,755
Such glib words.

1668
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:15,176
When you cut my queue...

1669
01:48:15,542 --> 01:48:18,000
... don't hurry, take your time.

1670
01:48:18,167 --> 01:48:19,589
Move slowly.

1671
01:48:19,917 --> 01:48:22,841
This is a historical moment,
do you understand?

1672
01:48:23,292 --> 01:48:23,963
Yes.

1673
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:28,011
You talk about revolution
and republic all the time.

1674
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,670
A revolutionary has to
have a revolutionary look.

1675
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:34,842
Let me show you today

1676
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:46,755
Ambassadors...

1677
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:51,333
... today I meet you as the
Provisional President...

1678
01:48:52,042 --> 01:48:53,339
... for the first time.

1679
01:48:58,708 --> 01:48:59,880
It's also the last time.

1680
01:49:02,583 --> 01:49:03,926
I can't believe this.

1681
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:06,135
Before I leave
the Presidency...

1682
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:09,086
... I hope you will request
your respective governments...

1683
01:49:09,625 --> 01:49:11,878
... to recognize our new country.

1684
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:13,834
To you...

1685
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:15,134
... and to the entire world...

1686
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:16,459
... this is truly significant.

1687
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:17,501
Mr. President...

1688
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:20,216
... how do you plan to treat
the Qing royal family?

1689
01:49:20,875 --> 01:49:22,798
They'll also become citizens
of the republic.

1690
01:49:25,333 --> 01:49:26,630
The Revolutionary Party
has decided...

1691
01:49:26,792 --> 01:49:28,965
... to pay the royal family
4 million taels of silver.

1692
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:30,714
Is that how you treat
your citizens?

1693
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:32,877
Money cannot
be a measure here.

1694
01:49:33,792 --> 01:49:35,886
Not all revolutions
need guillotines.

1695
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:37,714
What do you say,
Mr. Ambassador?

1696
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:40,131
I agree.

1697
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,002
When I was in England...

1698
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,218
... I once met one of your
parliament members, Mr. Hillier.

1699
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,217
I told him...

1700
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:48,802
... when China is freed...

1701
01:49:49,542 --> 01:49:50,919
... I'd invite him as my guest.

1702
01:49:52,292 --> 01:49:54,215
I'll use Chinese liquor...

1703
01:49:54,667 --> 01:49:55,668
... Revolutionary liquor,
to toast you all.

1704
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,717
Come.

1705
01:49:58,542 --> 01:49:59,213
Cheers.

1706
01:49:59,667 --> 01:50:01,294
Mingbao, Xinwenbao
and other newspapers...

1707
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,923
... have published articles questioning
your decision to step down.

1708
01:50:04,458 --> 01:50:05,459
I read them.

1709
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:07,043
We're in financial trouble.

1710
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:10,052
We can't find funds for restitutions
to the martyrs' families.

1711
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:12,839
We must find some money
no matter how.

1712
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,343
People's representatives
want to meet you.

1713
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:17,876
Please set up a time.

1714
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:19,584
Oh, yes.

1715
01:50:19,875 --> 01:50:21,001
Homer Lea is determined...

1716
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:22,635
... to resign from his post
as Military Advisor.

1717
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,001
What's his reason?

1718
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:26,420
He said he won't work
with Yuan Shikai.

1719
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,342
Tell him...

1720
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,672
... he's helping China,
not just a person.

1721
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:39,010
This is a letter from Juemin.

1722
01:50:39,667 --> 01:50:41,419
Mr. Sun has been
keeping it for you.

1723
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:43,005
He asks that I give it to you.

1724
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:51,921
A few days ago, members of
the Tongmenghui came to see me.

1725
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:53,965
They are planning a new grave.

1726
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,298
They asked that I prepare
a funerary outfit.

1727
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:01,797
I went to the shop.

1728
01:51:03,125 --> 01:51:04,843
When he was alive...

1729
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,380
... Juemin and I always made
decisions together.

1730
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,300
So I asked...

1731
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:17,794
... "Juemin, which one
shall we choose?"

1732
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:31,297
Only then did I know...

1733
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:36,006
... he's really no longer with me.

1734
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,001
Zhongxin...

1735
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:56,090
... this is a letter
from your father.

1736
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,334
Look.

1737
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,343
"This letter to my wife...

1738
01:52:11,958 --> 01:52:14,336
... shouldn't be kept
only in this household."

1739
01:52:16,208 --> 01:52:20,385
"Keep it,
let others know about it."

1740
01:52:48,167 --> 01:52:50,592
Yesterday, the Qing Emperor
abdicated...

1741
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,628
... ending two millennia
of monarchy.

1742
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:56,044
Countless revolutionaries
have given up their lives...

1743
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:58,173
... for our new republic.

1744
01:53:00,458 --> 01:53:03,927
Today, February 13, 1912...

1745
01:53:04,417 --> 01:53:06,419
... 26th day of the 12th moon
of the Xinhai Year...

1746
01:53:07,233 --> 01:53:09,005
... I'm fulfilling my promise...

1747
01:53:09,292 --> 01:53:11,420
... to resign from the post
of President.

1748
01:53:13,417 --> 01:53:15,119
We strive for the success
of the revolution...

1749
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:16,885
... but do not covet recognition.

1750
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:22,086
We are all of the same minds
to realize the goal of revolution.

1751
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:24,126
This goal is to establish...

1752
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:26,836
... an independent country
for the Chinese people.

1753
01:53:27,208 --> 01:53:29,711
We build a Chinese Republic
where land is divided among all.

1754
01:53:30,292 --> 01:53:33,375
Nationalism, democracy,
livelihood.

1755
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:36,586
These are what
we strive to attain...

1756
01:53:36,875 --> 01:53:38,252
... The Three Principles.

1757
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:47,630
Today you ask me...

1758
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,968
... what does revolution mean?

1759
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:53,378
Perhaps people will ask the
same question a century later.

1760
01:53:54,208 --> 01:53:58,042
Qiu Jin, our Tongmenghui member
who was killed in Shaoxing, said...

1761
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,969
... "Revolution will provide
all children...

1762
01:54:01,292 --> 01:54:04,262
... a peaceful and gentle world."

1763
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,925
Lin Juemin, one of the martyrs of
Huanghuagang, wrote this to his wife...

1764
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:15,505
... "Revolution seeks eternal
happiness for everyone in the world.

1765
01:54:17,958 --> 01:54:19,210
I believe...

1766
01:54:19,792 --> 01:54:22,215
... the revolution enables
a republican system...

1767
01:54:22,375 --> 01:54:24,343
... to reach the people.

1768
01:54:25,042 --> 01:54:27,465
People will understand
we'll fight whoever...

1769
01:54:27,625 --> 01:54:29,377
... dares support the monarchy.

1770
01:54:29,875 --> 01:54:36,212
Revolution enables factories,
banks, railroads, mines...

1771
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:39,666
... owned by the Chinese
to benefit the people.

1772
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,879
Revolution enables our Chinese
race to become strong...

1773
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:46,632
... no longer bullied by others.

1774
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:49,295
We will no longer
be anyone's slaves.

1775
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,214
Revolution can take place
anywhere, anytime...

1776
01:54:55,375 --> 01:54:57,048
... in any heart...

1777
01:54:57,542 --> 01:54:58,589
... forever...

1778
01:54:59,083 --> 01:55:00,255
... forever...

1779
01:55:00,958 --> 01:55:02,631
... no longer afraid
of foreign powers...

1780
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:04,835
... ridding the country of
feudalism and royalty.

1781
01:55:05,208 --> 01:55:07,176
No one will be impoverished...

1782
01:55:07,458 --> 01:55:10,758
... and the Chinese people
can stand tall in the East.

1783
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:14,128
This is the meaning
of revolution.
