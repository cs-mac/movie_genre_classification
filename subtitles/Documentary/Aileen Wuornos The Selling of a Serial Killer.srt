1
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,328
-<i> Well, I've never seen</i>
<i> anything like that.</i>

2
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,863
-<i> Yeah.</i>

3
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,732
-<i> Something tore him up.</i>

4
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,403
- <i> Oh!</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

5
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,422
-What's your prognosis, John?

6
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,861
-Well, he's dead for sure.

7
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,908
-Somebody's been
killed downtown

8
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,376
they said it was Jeb jolly.

9
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,877
-The mechanic?
-'Hmm.'

10
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,579
-<i> that's terrible.</i>

11
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,848
-I mean, you guys are
the ones that are worried

12
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,850
about going out of business.

13
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,521
That's two bodies in a week,
that's money in the bank.

14
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,723
-Don't even joke
like that, John.

15
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,059
You okay here?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,966
-It stinks really bad.
-<i> She.</i>

17
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,534
-She stinks really bad.

18
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,070
-She does smell for a woman.

19
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,905
Wish someone
had found her sooner.

20
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,106
Leg.

21
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,410
Turn your head.

22
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:35,414
Oh, Ron's getting lazier.
He didn't even clean her.

23
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,450
He just declared natural causes
and shipped her over.

24
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,785
Other leg.

25
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,202
<i> Aneurysm hooks.</i>

26
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,976
How's school?

27
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,211
-<i> I mean, you know,</i>
<i> aunt Margaret it's</i>

28
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,280
<i> it's the first week,</i>
<i> nothing much really happens.</i>

29
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,527
-Make any new friends?
-<i> It's funny, actually.</i>

30
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,596
All those kids
that I've gone to school with

31
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,565
since kindergarten..

32
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,302
<i> ...they all left,</i>
<i> so...They're all new kids</i>

33
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,337
and they all wanted
to be friends with me.

34
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,409
And it was pretty sweet.

35
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,491
Who are you?

36
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,329

51
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,970
-Mrs. cleaver,
take a seat please.

52
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,214
John, adolescence
can be a difficult time.

53
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,750
It's normal to be
interested in the world

54
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,419
and all of its problems.

55
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:04,089
<i> Normal to be drawn</i>
<i> to death and murder.</i>

56
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,859
<i> But unfortunately you can go</i>
<i> too far down that road.</i>

57
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,462
Too far away from..

58
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,265
Well, normal thoughts.

59
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,370
-What do you say, John?

60
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,110
-I'm interested in
how many times you felt

61
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,412
it was necessary
to say the word "normal."

62
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,883
-<i> It's not like there's a whole</i>
<i> lot to say about Einstein.</i>

63
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,319
I mean, he discovered
e equals mc square

64
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,388
and nuclear bombs but that's it.

65
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,623
I'm lucky I got
half a page at all.

66
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,058
-And you missed
two points for length

67
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,394
you missed another two
for spelling.

68
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,662
I mean, you managed
to spell Einstein

69
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,696
a different way every time.

70
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,131
-That's creativity.

71
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,834
-No, that's remarkable.
That's amazing.

72
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,371
-Hoo! Say, you guys, uh

73
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,540
<i> you guys catch that smell?</i>

74
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,509
Smells of something dead.

75
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,344
Something rotting.

76
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,257
Freak.

77
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,299
-So, what psycho
did you write about?

78
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,336
-Dennis rader,
uh, the, uh, btk killer.

79
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,739
That's how he signed all of his
letters to the media

80
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,108
as "bind, torture, kill."

81
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,043
-How many people did he kill?

82
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,413
-Maybe 10, they're not,
not sure but could be more.

83
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,515
-<i> Only 10?</i>

84
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,916
<i> The guy you wrote</i>
<i> about last year</i>

85
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,618
was way better at it.

86
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,819
-<i> Jeffrey dahmer.</i>

87
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,853
He was a cannibal and he kept

88
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,089
severed heads in his freezer.

89
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,624
-<i> I remember your pictures now.</i>

90
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,492
They gave me nightmares.

91
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,560
-Nightmares are nothin' man.

92
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,662
Those pictures gave me
a therapist.

93
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,088
-Oh, what up?

94
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,990
<i> That black cloud</i>
<i> above ya's growing.</i>

95
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,861
-I broke one of my rules.

96
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,130
-Stalking anybody?
-No.

97
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,165
-What else?

98
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,135
-Have you heard about
the MacDonald triad?

99
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,305
-Three traits shared by 95
percent of all serial killers

100
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:36,341
bedwetting, pyromania,
animal cruelty.

101
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,810
<i> You do admit I have all three.</i>

102
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,814
-What really gets me is..

103
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,483
...you know, a -- animal cruelty
predicts violent behavior..

104
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,620
...but until I read that
i -- I didn't think

105
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,289
it was wrong...You know.

106
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,091
-What else?

107
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,494
-Well, if I -- I -- I..

108
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,531
If I'm thinking about
hurting a person then..

109
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,400
...you know, I'll just
give them a compliment.

110
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,870
If somebody's really bugging me
to the point where..

111
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,139
...when I think about
killing them then..

112
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,274
...I'll just, I'll just smile

113
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,509
and I'll say
something nice...You know?

114
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,482
Is that hot chocolate?
-Uh-huh.

115
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,451
-I'm good.

116
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,954
-John, you have
a -- a lot of predictors

117
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,557
for serial killer behavior but

118
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,492
<i> predictors are just that,</i>
<i> they predict</i>

119
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,028
<i> what might happen,</i>
<i> not what will happen.</i>

120

<i> You're in control</i>

123
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,747
-Yeah, Mr. crowley?
-Come here.

124
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,684
What do you know
about smartphones?

125
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,386
-Uh, I don't know.

126
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,354
What do you, what do you need?

127
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,857
-I want to send
my wife a kiss.

128
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,258
-You want to send her a kiss?

129
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,926
-<i> You're supposed to be able</i>
<i> to take photos</i>

-Well, so, it's that button.
-Uh-huh.

133
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,168
-And then..

134
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,636
...you can use this one
to take the picture, so..

135
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,505
-Oh, oh..
-Here you go.

136
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,211
Okay.

137
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,312
And there you go.

138
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,649
-Good lord,

139
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,784
that's for sure.

140

-Brooke?
Come on down, dinner's ready.

141
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,931
-Relax, he's dead.
He's going nowhere fast.

-Is that Jeb jolly?

143
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,604

Are you?

148
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,549
-<i> I'm not the one</i>

<i> You heard from dad?</i>

00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,819
-No.

151

You?

152
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,622
-Rarely.

153
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,590
I ask him for money sometimes.

154
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,660
-John?
-Yeah?

155
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,962
-Dr. neblin told me.
-What?

156
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,632
-That you think you're going
to kill somebody.

157
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,636
-That's funny,
'cause that's not what I said.

158
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,572
What I said was that,
i follow very strict rules

00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,041
to keep me from doing
anything wrong.

160
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,377
Seems like
you'd be happy about that.

161
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,511
-Happy..

162
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,747
...is not a son
who has to follow rules

163
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,582
to keep himself from
killing people

164
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,584
happy is not a psychologist

165
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,387
telling me my son
is a sociopath.

166
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,590
-He actually said that?
That's kinda cool.

167
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,258
-Antisocial--

168
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,259
-hate to dump this on you

169
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,928
this time of night, April.

170
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,262
It's a hell of a thing.

171
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,332
-I think the damage
is done, mom.

172
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,634
-What dive
are you heading to tonight?

173
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,436
-Somewhere with more
living people then here

174
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,772
that's for sure. Have fun.

175
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,399
-<i> Oh, for the love of Mike.</i>

176
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,768
- <i> I call organs.</i>
<i>- Fine.</i>

177
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,984
-Dang it, Ron.
-<i> What?</i>

178
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,486
-Well, we're missing a kidney.

179
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,821
I've gone through
the bag twice.

180
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,890
You think Ron would manage
to send us all the organs

181
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,524
for crying out loud.

182
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,728
-Well..

183
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,630
What if the person
who killed him took it?

184
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,398
-That's..
-<i> It's totally possible.</i>

185
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,900
Look at that.

186
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,167
-<i> It'll be on the forms.</i>

187
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,270
-<i> I don't think so.</i>
<i> Oh, wait, here.</i>

188
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,906
"Left kidney removed
via incisions to

189
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,341
renal artery, veins and ureter."

190
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,943
-So he had it removed?

191
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,647
-No, there's no record
of that, it's just not there.

192
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,723
-<i> This is Ted rath,</i>
<i> live at the scene</i>

193
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,825
where the ambulance has
just left and as you can see

194
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,595
the police and a crowd
are gathering here in Clayton

195
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,730
a normally peaceful town,
where a killer has struck

196
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,699
possibly for the second time

197
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,702
<i> leaving a dead body and</i>
<i> a terrified town in his wake.</i>

198
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,505
-Stupid, stupid,
the last thing this town needs

199
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,574
is panic about a mass murderer.

200
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,843
-I think the last thing
we need are the killings.

201
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,645
-Now details are sketchy
at this time

202
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,248
what I have been able to
ascertain is there was a small

203
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,583
<i> pool of oil</i>
<i> or some black sludge found</i>

204
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,719
<i> near the body of local farmer,</i>
<i> Dave byrd.</i>

205
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:55,987
<i> We will, of course,</i>
<i> be giving you details</i>

206
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,288
<i> as they become available.</i>

207
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,524
<i> This is a 5 live</i>
<i> news exclusive.</i>

208
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,360
<i> Death stalks</i>
<i> America's heartland.</i>

209
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,998
-Okay, so the first question
of psychological profiling is

210
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,833
what's the killer doing
he doesn't absolutely

211
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,401
have to be doing?

212
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,770
-Dude, I think
it's a werewolf.

213
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,939
-It's not a werewolf.

214
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,641
-Dude, did you see the news?

215
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,610
It has the intelligence of man
with the ferocity of a beast.

216
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,145
What is that supposed to be?
-It's not a werewolf.

217
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,647
Werewolves aren't real.

218
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,515
The stories of them
probably started

219
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,250
from serial killers, you know.

220
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,420
Vampire's too. It's just men
who hunt and kill other men.

221
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,924
So assuming a basic goal
of trying to kill somebody.

222
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,592
All you really need to do
is shoot them, right?

223
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,893
-Yeah.

224
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,129
-So what's he doing
that he doesn't have to do?

225
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,798
-Well, he's s -- stabbing him,
rippin' into him.

226
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,067
-Exactly, yeah, that's the,
that's the first thing,
you know.

227
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,869
He approaches 'em in person.

228
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,105
Probably means he wants to be
close to the victims. What else?

229
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,974
-He attacked during the night,
in the dark.

230
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:53,011
-I think that's probably
just something he had to do.

231
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,713
-Doesn't that count
for your list?

232
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,316
-I mean, it's,
it's not a unique trait.

233
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,785
Nobody who kills somebody else
wants to be seen.

234
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,388
-Just put it on your list,
i mean..

235
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,623
...not everything in this
has to be your idea.

236
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,636
Ted Bundy..

237
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,171
...the one that they, uh..

238
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,440
...they coined
the term serial killer for.

239
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,845
He said that
after you killed somebody..

240
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,415
You know, if you had
enough time with them.

241
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,750
They could be whoever
you wanted them to be.

242
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,155
- <i> You're weird man.</i>

243
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,201
-I hate Halloween.
It's absurd, you know.

244
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,236
This is the,
this is the night when

245
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,639
evil spirits are supposed
to walk the earth.

246
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,409
You know, druids burning kids
in wicker baskets, you know.

247
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,311
-My position is vulnerable
out here, boys

248
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,413
<i> let's stay alert</i>
<i> and keep moving.</i>

249
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,148
-Can't you just tell him
to go away?

250
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,783
-Nah, leave him alone.

251
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,653
He's convinced the killer
is gonna come out and get us.

252
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,855
Plus, it makes him happy.
Right, dad?

253
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,057
-<i> Let's just hurry up</i>
<i> and get the hell outta here.</i>

254
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,160
-<i> Dad, you said we could</i>
<i> stay out till 9:30.</i>

255
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,116
-<i> Trick or treat?</i>

256
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,185
-You boy's shouldn't be
out this late.

257
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,122
-Yeah. It's not safe
with a killer out there.

258
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,957
-That's what I'm saying.

259
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,792
-<i> You boys be careful.</i>

260
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,066
-Are you it?

261
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,202
-Am I what?

262
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,505
-The clown from "it,"
that Stephen king book.

263
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,542
-No.

264
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,377
I was thinking about
dressing up as my mother

265
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,580
but I was worried
what my therapist would say.

266
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,482
-You gonna juggle
for us, freak?

267
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,622
-That's a really
clever costume.

268
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,191
<i> You know, it looks great.</i>

269
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,725
It's really inventive and the

270
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,228
the bullet hole
looks...Really authentic.

271
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,799
-You know this is a party
for normal people? Right?

272
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,234
So why don't you go home

273
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,736
to your undertaking
slut of a mother.

274
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,371
Alright?

275
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,275
What are you smiling about?

276
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,679
-I've been clinically
diagnosed with sociopathy, rob.

277
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,147
To me, you're an object.

278
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,049
You know, you're a,
you're a thing.

279
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,785
You're about as important to me
as a cardboard box.

280
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:24,155
And the -- the thing about
cardboard boxes..

281
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,523
..Is that..

282
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,792
You know they're totally boring
on the outside, right?

283
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:31,062
But...Sometimes,
if you cut 'em open

284
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,298
there'll be something
interesting inside.

285
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
You know, and so,
while you're saying

286
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,835
all these boring things to me

287
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,870
I'm thinking about
what it'd be like

288
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,572
to cut you open.

289
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,178
But I -- I don't wanna,
i don't wanna be that person.

290
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,946
And so, I have a rule

291
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,816
that anytime
somebody says something to me

292
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,819
where I -- I think about,
you know, cuttin' 'em.

293
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,390
I -- I -- I just smile
and I say something nice.

294
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,125
So that's why I say to you

295
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,862
rob Anders of 232,
carnation street.

296
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,199
You are a really great guy.

297
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,338
-You're a freak.

298
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,118
-You're not a freak.

299
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,073
-<i> John.</i>

300
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,512
What is this?

301
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,084
-It's..

302
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,153
-John..

303
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:38,122
...wash up and get out.

304
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,824
-Mom, it's -- it's not..
-I should be stronger
with you.

305
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,826
This is my fault.
-Mom, there -- there should be
something missing.

306
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,929
-Go, John.
-There should be an organ
missing to fit the profile.

307
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,709
-Go!

308
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,983
This door will be locked
in future!

309
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,623
-Who told you?

310
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,159
-He told a school counselor,
who told me.

311
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,295
Lucky for you, she didn't tell
principal Layton.

312
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,899
<i> Apparently you gave him</i>
<i> nightmares, John.</i>

313
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,602
-Rob Anders is a bully.

314
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,504
-<i> Doesn't mean you can threaten</i>
<i> to kill him.</i>

315
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,805
-I, I didn't.

316
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,708
-And then there's
what happened in the mortuary.

317
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,209
What is it?

318
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,111
<i> What set you off?</i>

319
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,982
-It all just feels so close.

320
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,719
This is, this is nowhere.

321
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,220
It isn't supposed to happen here

322
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,589
it's supposed to be
somewhere else, you know.

323
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,461
-Okay. Let me ask you this.

324
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,164
<i> Who were you talking to just</i>
<i> before rob Anders upset you?</i>

325
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,133
-Oh, it was just some girl.

326
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,235
-<i> She have a name?</i>

327
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,704
-<i> Her, her name is Brooke.</i>

328
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,107
-Cute?

329
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,476
-Little young for you, doctor.

330
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,848
-Yes. Barrow's goldeneye.
Come here.

331
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,083
Have a look at this.

332
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,354
Here.

333
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,356
Straight over there.
Have a look.

334
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,960
<i> Do you see it?</i>

335
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,629
-Oh..

336
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,132
Yeah. A duck.

337
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,034
-That's a very rare duck.

338
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,735
<i> So don't go killin' it.</i>

339
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,640
<i> I haven't seen one</i>
<i> in over 5 years.</i>

340
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,510
<i> Actually you can see the eyes,</i>
<i> they're very beautiful</i>

341
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,645
<i> more Amber really than gold.</i>

342
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,049
<i> It catches the light,</i>
<i> no matter where they are.</i>
<i> Exceptional.</i>

343
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,418
-<i> Hey, you fishing?</i>
-Huh?

344
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,820
-Are you goin' fishing?

345
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,122
-Ice fishing.

346
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,391
-<i> Do you need a hand</i>
<i> with that stuff there?</i>

347
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,061
<i> Let me just...Take that</i>
<i> off your hands.</i>

348
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,397
<i> Yeah, I used to go fishing</i>
<i> all the time up north.</i>

349
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,732
- <i> Oh, is that right?</i>
<i>- Yeah, my uncle has a cabin..</i>

350
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,434
-Oh, good.
-Oh, yeah.

351
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,903
Yeah, you mind if I come along?

352
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,572
-Uh, well..

353
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,611
-How far off you going?

354
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,681
-Well, far enough.

355
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,783
<i> You're gonna need a -- a hat</i>
<i> out there though, right?</i>

356
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,128
-Uh..

357
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,056
...i bought you a hat.

358
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,591
-<i> Here.</i>

359
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,968
<i> We're not gonna tell your mom</i>
<i> about this, okay?</i>

360
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,704
Right now she is simultaneously
trying to stuff a Turkey

361
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,506
and wipe away tears.

362
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,907
-She's crying?

363
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,642
-Uh-huh.

364
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,611
Mother of all blow ups
yesterday with Lauren

365
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,348
who's now not coming
to Thanksgiving dinner tonight.

366
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,750
That leaves you and me, sport.

367
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,218
<i> Go and wash.</i>

368
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,655
I need you to come out of your
head for a couple hours, okay?

369
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,123
Give her a hand..

370
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,626
...make her realize she still
has one loving child left.

371
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,694
Or at least pretend.

372
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,607
-Urgh!

373
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:18,882
-Oh, I had to stop by Ron's
for that file he forgot

374
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,151
<i> and he, uh, he told me a joke.</i>

375
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,187
<i> You wanna hear it?</i>
-Sure.

376
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,889
-<i> What's small and grey</i>
<i> and screws in the walls?</i>

377
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,225
-I don't know..

378
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,271
<i> John, can you</i>

379
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,440

00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,744
-Uh..

382
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,813
Yeah, sure.

383
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,360
-<i> Keep it up you loser.</i>

384
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,962
-<i> Hi, John.</i>

385
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,365
-Uh, vanilla.
-Vanilla?

386
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,234
-Uh, yeah, vanilla.

387
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,835
-Vanilla, like, ice cream?

388
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,805
-Um, you know,
I'm not, I'm not really sure.

389
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,907
Mom just said we needed some.

390
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,508
-Here you go, John.

391
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,612
It's for cooking.

392
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,886
-<i> This is Ted rath</i>
<i> with an update</i>

<i> on the Clayton</i>
<i> killer situation.</i>

394
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,155
<i> Now this reporter</i>
<i> has discovered there is</i>

<i> an Emmet t. Openshaw</i>

396
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,093
an Arizona man who disappeared
from his home

397
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,995
42 years ago.

398
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,664
<i> He was 30 at the time.</i>
<i> Police found signs</i>
<i> of struggle</i>

<i> but there was no body</i>
<i> found at the scene.</i>

400
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,534
<i> Now the reason</i>
<i> this crime connects</i>

401
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,969
<i> to what's happening here</i>
<i> in Clayton county</i>

402

I could shovel
your steps for you.

406
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,375
Good morning, Kay.

407

It snowed so

408
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,713
I could shovel your drive
if you like, uh..

409
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,752
Good morning, Mrs. crowley.

very nice. Thank you.

Hot chocolate, your favorite.

...takes the kidney..

426
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,492

-<i> John?</i>

-I can't believe
you followed me.

453
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,336
-I can't believe you were
having dinner with my therapist.

454
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,071
-Don't be silly, John.

455
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,174
Grant and I meet sometimes
to discuss your progress

456
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:33,743
a progress I am failing
to appreciate right now.

457
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,945
-Did I interrupt a date?

458
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,514
Is that even ethical?

459
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,482
-It's, it's just
the first right up ahead.

460

Thanks, April.

461

Actually John's doing okay.

462
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,920
-He is?
-I am?

463
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,356
-Sure, tonight for example you
were concerned for your mother

464
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,291
with a killer in town.

465
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,193
-You really believe
that I followed mom

466
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,761
because I was worried for her?

467
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,363
-You may be lacking
in empathy, John

468
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,066
but you should recognize a life
line when it's thrown at you.

469
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,618
-Hi, John.

470
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,656
Hi, John!

471
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,861
-Hey.

472
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,563
-Extra work?

473
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,832
-Oh, it's,
it's just a project.

474
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,937
-Serial killers...Fairies..

475
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,641
...witchcraft...Folktales.

476
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,378
That's an
interesting combination.

477
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,615
Need any help?

478
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,984
-No, I'm, I'm fine.

479
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,554
-Okay.

480
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,943
-<i> Pretty good job,</i>
<i> if I do say so myself.</i>

481
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,947
<i> Hey, Tommy, you look</i>
<i> downright dangerous.</i>

482
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,517
-Thanks. Goodnight, Greg.
-<i> Alright.</i>

483
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,254
<i> Okay, bill.</i>
<i> You're up next.</i>

484
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,955
<i> Let's go.</i>

485
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,693
Oh, boy.

486
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,962
Too much dancing
the other night, huh?

487
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,134
Yeah, well,
we'll...Get you looking

488
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,270
real good for the next time
out, okay?

489
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,640
You need a crane there?

490
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,978
So.. Boy, it's been
a while, hasn't it?

491
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,914
You -- you -- you want
something fancy today?

492
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,715
-Let's do the...Usual.

493
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,884
-The usual?
Alright. Hang tight.

494
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,887
These things have to be
done delicately.

495
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,290
Oh, Jesus.

496
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,158
Uh, hang on a second,
I'll -- I'll get a..

497
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,326
I gotta get another
scissors here.

498
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,462
I'll be right back, alright.

499
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,096
Won't be a moment.

500
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,710
-Fuck.

501
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,970
-<i> Police department.</i>

502
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,684
-Well, I guess we better
take a look around.

503
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,953
-Oh, no, uh..

504
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,922
They didn't come through here.

505
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,623
-<i> Tom, check this out.</i>

506
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,625
<i> There's something in here.</i>

507
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,220
-Uh..

508
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,125
<i> Yes, my dear.</i>

509
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,660
<i> Flour?</i>

510
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,064
Uh, whole.. Whole grain?

511
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,232
Oh, good.

512
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,303
Yes, I'll, uh..

513
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,938
I love you too.

514
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,423
-<i> This is Ted rath coming to</i>
<i> you live from Clayton county</i>

515
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:55,958
where as you can see
tempers are flaring dangerously.

516
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,194
We are at the home
of local barber Greg Olson.

517
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,029
Olson was the owner
of the premises

518
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,098
where the two policemen were
found dead earlier this week

519
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,566
sparking this outrage.

520
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,801
Let's see if we can get a word
from one of these

521
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,370
concerned citizens.
Excuse me, sir, sir, sir!

522
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,871
What to do you hope
to accomplish with this?

523
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,874
-Uh, well, as you can see,
people are angry

524
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,143
and -- and -- and things
are getting out of hand.

525
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,344
-What is your name, sir?

526
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,981
-Um, Roger Bowen,
uh, this is my son, Max.

527
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,850
This is his bat.
He left it at school.

528
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:22,719
Uh, listen,
people are upset and, uh

529
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,987
<i> we should really..</i>
<i> Calm down, everybody!</i>

530
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:27,256
<i> This is no way</i>
<i> to handle this situation.</i>

531
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,181
-Thank you all for coming.

532
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:07,216
I think everybody here
is concerned

533
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,784
about the safety of our streets.

534
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:11,387
We have got to stick together.

535
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,290
There is a killer in our town.

536
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,394
I look at all these faces
and I..

537
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,330
I don't want to lose
a single one of you.

538
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,266
<i> Beverly made some bars,</i>
<i> and some coffee.</i>

539
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,268
It's on the table.
Help yourself, folks.

540
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,738
And...Take care of each other.

541
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,045
<i> Help yourself.</i>

542
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:37,847
-How's bill?

543
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,782
-Oh, I'm worried about him.

544
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,617
He's not feeling well.

545
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,120
And he's so, oh,
down in the dumps.

546
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:45,655
Uh, he can get that way.

547
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:47,490
It's a winter thing.

548
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:50,059
But he hasn't been
out of the house in over a week.

549
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,594
-He hasn't been out at all?

550
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,829
-Oh, hi, John. No.

551
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,731
It's almost like he's afraid.

552
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,566
<i> I think he's worried</i>
<i> about slipping on the ice</i>

553
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,268
<i> or something.</i>

554
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,571
<i> John? Why don't you</i>
<i> go see him? He'd like that.</i>

555
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,708
-Hi, John.

556
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,576
-Hey, Brooke.

557
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,613
-You want some juice
or hot chocolate?

558
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,014
-His stomach is bothering him.

559
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:14,650
Do you think I could get him
to go to the doctor?

560
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,686
-Or you could try this one.

561
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:18,788
Mixture of rat poisoning
and metal filings.

562
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,857
-Oh, thank you.

563
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:44,780
-<i> Good to see you there.</i>

564
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,327
"On what wings dare he aspire?"

565
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,397
-What?

566
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,966
-"What the hand..

567
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:06,035
...dare seize the fire?"

568
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,674
Just a poem.

569
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,412
"Tyger, tyger burning bright

570
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:18,981
"in the forests of the night

571
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,519
"what immortal hand or eye

572
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,089
could frame thy
fearful symmetry?"

573
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,898
The poet..

574
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,835
...is asking the tiger

575
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:43,172
who made him and how.

576
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,313
William Blake.

577
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,884
He wrote two poems like that.

578
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,555
"The lamb" and "the tyger."

579
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,493
One who was made
of sweetness and love

580
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:06,896
and one was forged

581
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:10,099
from terror and death.

582
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:15,271
"When the stars
threw down their Spears

583
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:18,007
"and watered heaven
with their tears.

584
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,812
"Did he smile his work to see?

585
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,583
Did he who made
the lamb make thee?"

586
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,860
-Hi, Mr. crowley.

587
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:50,166
Hi, how are you?

588
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,334
How are you?

589
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,104
How's your leg?

590
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:57,106
Can I kill you?

591
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,912
-<i> And how is school?</i>

592
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:05,381
-It's fine.

593
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:06,448
Everybody's afraid

594
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,951
but...That's pretty normal.

595
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:11,654
-And are you afraid?
-No.

596
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,525
Fear is a really weird thing.

597
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,460
You know, people are,
people are afraid of things

598
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:21,430
but they're never afraid
of their own actions.

599
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,936
Well, it's -- it's like
that woman right there.

600
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:30,673
<i> You know, she,</i>
<i> she could be afraid</i>
<i> of getting hit by a car.</i>

601
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,775
But she isn't afraid of crossing
the street, you know?

602
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,277
<i> She's done it before.</i>
<i> It should be pretty easy.</i>

603
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:38,314
She just waits until
she can't see any cars

604
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:41,317
and cross out
carefully onto the ice.

605
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,485
She's gonna do everything
she can to keep herself safe.

606
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,957
<i> And there, there she goes.</i>

607
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:01,203
She's fine.
She made it.

608
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,435
-He refuses
to go to the doctor.

609
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,771
-Oh, stop it woman.

610
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,506
I'll be alright.

611
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,015
Alright.

612
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:48,150
Lower the seat and the cover.

613
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,457
Oh.

614
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,893
Oh.

615
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,429
<i> Well, that's better.</i>

616
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:05,567
You've been a big help
to me and Kay this winter, John.

617
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,640
Seems like a dying thing.

618
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,810
<i> Neighbors helping neighbors.</i>

619
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,515
-<i> Alright, I've got you.</i>
<i> I've got you.</i>

620
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,426
-Oh. Ah.

621
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,164
I worry about her, John.

622
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,068
I can't leave her here alone.

623
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,905
I can't face that.

624
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,770
- <i> Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>- Merry Christmas.</i>

625
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:15,871
<i> Anything else in the car?</i>

626
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,272
-<i> Ah, just the salad</i>

627
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,274
but Lauren's bringing that up.

628
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,177
-She's really here?

629
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,780
How'd you do it?

630
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,448
<i> I invited her,</i>
<i> like, five times</i>

631
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,816
<i> couldn't get a yes out of her.</i>

632
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,918
-We had a really
good talk last night.

633
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,120
And I think
her boyfriend dumped her.

634
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,588
-Oh.

635
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,856
Quick, we're not set for four

636
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,491
run down and get another chair
for the table

637
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:37,326
and I will set another plate.

638
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:39,294
Margaret, you're wonderful.

639
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,397
-I know.
What would you do without me?

640
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,499
<i> John?</i>

641
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,834
<i> Chair, downstairs,</i>
<i> bring up now.</i>

642
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,576
-Hey, John.

643
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,412
Hey, is she in a good mood?

644
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:59,114
-She's probably slaughtering
a goat in your honor.

645
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:00,582
-We'll see
how long that lasts.

646
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,718
Stick close, okay?
I might need backup.

647
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,549
-Very useful, John.
-Mm-hmm.

648
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,918
-Guess it makes
a change from soap.

649
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,035
-You are gonna be so cool.

650
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,537
-Yeah.

651
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,038
-Okay.

652
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,840
Here, open these, both of you.

653
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,308
From your dad.

654
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,111
-You, first.

655
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,718
<i> Out loud.</i>
<i>- Shh. Just let him read it.</i>

656
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,186
-It's okay.

657
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,357
"Hey, tiger,
merry Christmas.

658
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,025
"You're gonna love
this mp3 player.

659
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,994
"Filled it up with all
of our favorite music

660
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,463
"the stuff we used
to sing together.

661
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,633
"It's like having a dad
in your pocket.

662
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,002
"See you around.

663
00:59:00,004 --> 00:59:01,470
Sam cleaver."

664
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,408
-Do you even remember
those old tunes?

665
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,144
-Sam used to play them
to John in the car.

666
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:11,346
You'd always be
singing together.

667
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:12,347
-Shit.

668
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,922
-Damn it, Sam.

669
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:25,394
-It's empty.
-I'm sorry.

670
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:28,597
He can't even buy your love
without screwing it up.

671
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,566
-<i> Hey, John, it's no big deal.</i>

672
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,501
He got me a DVD
of some kid show

673
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,169
apparently, we used
to watch it together.

674
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,538
I've no recollection of it.

675
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,674
-So, what?

676
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,909
It just means
he's a dick to you too.

677
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:41,910
-Let's have dessert.

678
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,046
<i> I -- two different pies.</i>

679
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:45,948
<i> Whipped cream..</i>

680
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,731
-<i> Hello?</i>

681
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,467
<i> Who's there?</i>

682
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,669
-I sent you the note.

683
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:45,807
Shit.

684
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,759
-<i> Leave me alone.</i>

685
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,227
<i> You know so much about me</i>

686
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,896
<i> then you know what I'll do</i>
<i> when I find you.</i>

687
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:09,398
-Shit.

688
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,807
-<i> I said--</i>
-does that hurt?

689
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,010
You cut off your own leg.

690
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,278
You -- you pulled out your lungs

691
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,080
I just wanna know if it hurts.

692
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,482
Nothing you do makes sense.

693
01:01:27,484 --> 01:01:29,484
You -- you -- you
hide some bodies

694
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:32,421
you -- you don't hide others,
you're not consistent.

695
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:34,690
I -- I -- I just wanna know
does it hurt?

696
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,024
-<i> It hurts..</i>

697
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,526
<i> ...like hell.</i>

698
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:39,528
<i> It hurts every time.</i>

699
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,533
-Do you have to,
do you have to wait?

700
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,935
Like, eh, do you have to wait

701
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,270
for something
to -- to break down?

702
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:49,271
What about Emmett?

703
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,006
Uh, e -- e -- Emmett openshaw

704
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,708
in -- in Arizona?

705
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,043
Where, what did you,
what did you steal from him?

706
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,382
-<i> I stole his life.</i>

707
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,017
<i> He would have had</i>
<i> a long one I think.</i>

708
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,720
<i> As long as his at least.</i>

709
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,989
<i> He would have</i>
<i> gotten married and had kids.</i>

710
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,161
<i> You still don't know, do you?</i>

711
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,401
<i> Hang on.</i>

712
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,075
<i> I've taken more lives</i>
<i> than you can ever guess.</i>

713
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,713
<i> But the mechanic was</i>
<i> the first one I didn't keep.</i>

714
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,516
-What was that?

715
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,986
-<i> What was what?</i>

716
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,988
-<i> What was that noise?</i>

717
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,244
-Hey, John.

718
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,297
So, what have you been up to?

719
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:58,099
I barely seen you
since the holidays.

720
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,535
What does a young psychotic

721
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,904
John Wayne cleaver
do in his spare time?

722
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,216
Hello? Earth to John.

723
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,751
Wanna tell me
what the craps going on, man?

724
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:17,953
-<i> Uh.</i>

725
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,825
-Uh.

726
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,796
It's nothing, um..

727
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,598
I just..

728
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,533
I need to do
normal stuff right now.

729
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,034
Umm.

730
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,036
Do you wanna play the game?

731
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,472
-Why are you here, John?

732
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,307
On Christmas night,
when I haven't seen you

733
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,576
in not one week,
but two weeks?

734
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,547
-<i> I'm -- I'm just</i>
<i> kinda losing it.</i>

735
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,148
- <i> Losing what?</i>
<i>- I'm losing it.</i>

736
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,818
I'm -- I'm -- I'm breaking
all my rules.

737
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,152
-<i> What rules?</i>

738
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,956
-I have rules
to keep me normal

739
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,391
<i> and to keep</i>
<i> everybody else safe.</i>

740
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,294
One -- one of my rules is that
i need to hang out with you

741
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,496
because we do normal stuff.

742
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:04,032
<i> Um, and I -- I need that.</i>

743
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,470
-So, we've been friends
for three years

744
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:10,805
'cause you think
it makes your normal?

745
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,147
-Eh, yeah.

746
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,844
Get off of him!

747
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,150
He's not yours.

748
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,037
-John.

749
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,050
John?

750
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,319
Don't you think we should talk?

751
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,128
-Talk about what?

752
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,896
-I know this is difficult.

753
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,932
I -- I can't imagine
what you must be going through

754
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:27,802
but, you -- you've barely
said a word to me in days.

755
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,637
-I've barely said a word
to you since fourth grade.

756
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:31,139
-Then maybe we should start.

757
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:33,608
-Dr. neblin --
-Dr. neblin needs to shut up.

758
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,943
-<i> He -- he's just</i>
<i> trying to help you.</i>

759
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:38,113
We, we all just wanna do
what's best for you.

760
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:41,216
Just tell me
what you're feeling.

761
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:45,453
-What don't you get?

762
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,156
I don't feel anything.

763
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,892
Okay? I don't -- I don't give
a shit that Max's dad is dead!

764
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:52,827
I don't give a shit
that you could be next!

765
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,834
-John, I'm so sorry.

766
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,471
-John, please.
-Stop!

767
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,774
-I just wanna --
-no, shut up, shut up!

768
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,776
You shut up!

769
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,399
-John.

770
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,603
John, I won't come in.
I just wanna say something.

771
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,111
Last night was..

772
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,916
<i> But we're still</i>
<i> together, right?</i>

773
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:51,286
<i> I mean, we're still a family.</i>

774
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:54,222
<i> Because it's all we got.</i>

775
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,793
I thought you helping
as embalm was bad for you

776
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,663
but I think now
maybe I was wrong.

777
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,465
I don't know.

778
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:07,569
All I do know is

779
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:10,271
you've gotten worse
since I stopped you

780
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,274
and yet that was where
i felt closest to you

781
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,611
so...If that's what it takes

782
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:18,479
<i> for us to stay together</i>

783
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,481
<i> then that's what we do.</i>

784
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,587
-<i> Let's say that</i>
<i> you're the kind of person</i>

785
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:28,856
<i> who, uh, you know, you leave</i>
<i> when things get bad.</i>

786
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,124
You've done it a lot.

787
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:32,760
Uh, you make a life,
you always get into trouble

788
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,062
and then you always run away.

789
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,263
<i> Now, things are bad.</i>

790
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:36,331
<i> They're worse than</i>
<i> they've ever been</i>

791
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,666
but you don't leave, you stay.

792
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:40,168
Why would you do that?

793
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,503
-<i> You're talking</i>
<i> about risk and reward.</i>

794
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:43,905
Stay and bare the hardship

795
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,207
or escape with the cost
of losing something.

796
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,043
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

797
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,279
-No, I just want your opinion.
What would make you stay?

798
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,716
-Am I a sociopath?

799
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:57,185
-It's not me.
-I never said it was.

800
01:10:57,187 --> 01:10:58,953
But I need to know
because I need to understand

801
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:01,656
if I'm answering from an
emotional point of view or not.

802
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:03,891
-What's the difference?
-<i> It's everything.</i>

803
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,893
You say I can up and leave
but I have to ask myself

804
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:07,462
what it is I'm leaving.

805
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:10,164
<i> What emotional connection</i>
<i> is being broken.</i>

806
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,501
<i> Now, if I'm a sociopath</i>
<i> then it might not bother me</i>

807
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:15,503
<i> but if I'm not..</i>

808
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,740
-Love.
-Love, yes.

809
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,209
An emotional connection
like love.

810
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,279
-Okay. Thank you.

811
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,547
-Wait, wait, John,
hold on, hold on.

812
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,551
Alright, look, call me

813
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:33,154
if there's anything
you need day or night.

814
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,589
-Yeah, okay.

815
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,828
<i> Can I look at that one?</i>

816
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,872
What's the, what's the range
on something like that?

817
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,242
-I don't know,
like, 2 to 3 miles.

818
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,745
-Okay.

819
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,781
How much can I get for that?

820
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,152
-I don't know,
like, 20 to 30 bucks.

821
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:10,024
-Hi, Mrs. c.
-Oh, hello, John.

822
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:12,226
-<i> I can help you with that.</i>
-Thanks.

823
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,530
-So, uh, how's bill?

824
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:18,700
-<i> Oh, not so well, John.</i>

825
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,669
It's his heart.

826
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,671
Just his age, John.

827
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,740
Everything is catchin' up
with him.

828
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,044
-Pills, pills.

829
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:33,281
My whole existence
has become pills.

830
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,018
Damn this body of mine, damn.

831
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,873
-<i> No!</i>
-Stop it.

832
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,541
Shh. Shh.

833
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:24,211
Stop it!
Just stop, stop!

834
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,584
Shh! Shh!

835
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,554
-<i> Hello.</i>

836
01:17:06,556 --> 01:17:08,556
-I've -- I've done it.

837
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:10,424
It's too late.

838
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,094
-<i> John, where are you?</i>

839
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:16,631
-I'm -- I'm on the edge and..

840
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,433
<i> ...I'm over it</i>
<i> and I'm falling.</i>

841
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,502
-<i> Listen to me, John.</i>
-I didn't wanna do it.

842
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,973
-<i> Listen to me, listen.</i>

843
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,510
-It's too late.
-<i> No, John, it's not too late.</i>

844
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:32,113
<i> You're in control.</i>
<i> Are you listening?</i>

845
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,616
-Yes.

846
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:37,385
-<i> Now, listen.</i>

847
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:39,186
<i> You're not a killer,</i>
<i> you're a good person, John</i>

848
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,989
<i> whatever you've done</i>
<i> we can get through it.</i>

849
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,458
<i> We can make it right again.</i>
<i> Are you still listening?</i>

850
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,729
-Thank you. I need to go.

851
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:50,598
-<i> No, John, don't hang up.</i>
<i> Tell me where you are.</i>

852
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,867
-No. Thank you for your help.

853
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,679
-Mary Jean, put that back!
-Oh!

854
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,002
<i> Come back.</i>

855
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,174
Come back and die
with your own heart.

856
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,078
Look at your phone!

857
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,913
<i> Look at your phone!</i>

858
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,082
You're not gonna kill anybody.

859
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,699
You can't have his heart.

860
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,776
-Photoshop?
-Yeah.

861
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:37,578
-Sweet.

862
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,728
-<i> We are gathered here today</i>

863
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,630
<i> to celebrate the life</i>

864
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,065
<i> and mourn the passing</i>

865
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:00,834
<i> of Roger Bowen.</i>

866
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:02,669
It is fitting
that we do so here

867
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:04,405
surrounded by all those

868
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:07,074
who loved and admired him.

869
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:10,377
Great evil has befallen our town

870
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:14,148
and many families
are in mourning today.

871
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,750
<i> Roger was a husband</i>

872
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,086
<i> and a father.</i>

873
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:21,822
<i> He was a friend to all.</i>

874
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:24,958
<i> He was a pillar</i>
<i> of our community.</i>

875
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,428
<i> He was a pillar of his church.</i>

876
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,531
<i> And he was a pillar</i>
<i> in his own household.</i>

877
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:32,032
But before you think
I'm building

878
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:34,935
some kind of Greek temple
with all them pillars

879
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:37,137
<i> Roger's about as</i>
<i> down to earth a guy</i>

880
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:39,106
<i> as you'd ever wanna know.</i>

881
01:24:39,108 --> 01:24:42,309
<i> Steadfast, honest,</i>
<i> hardworking.</i>

882
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:45,546
<i> The kind of man who's</i>
<i> character embodies the values</i>

883
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:48,248
<i> that a community is all about.</i>

884
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:20,013
-You attacked my wife.

885
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:26,687
-You murdered my therapist.

886
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:33,227
-That's what he was doing
out there

887
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:35,529
at that hour

888
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,065
on a street

889
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:40,501
carrying about
in his nightgown

890
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:42,803
out looking for some kid.

891
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,141
I couldn't help him.

892
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:53,313
Where is it?

893
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:57,084
-How long do you think
you've got?

894
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,921
-Long enough to find another.

895
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,624
-Not here.

896
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,294
Not in front of everybody.

897
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:10,497
-You don't know
the things I've done

898
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,667
or that I will do.

899
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,602
-Don't forget to take
the book of condolence

900
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:17,738
to the cemetery, John.

901
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,608
-<i> The family is so grateful</i>

902
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:23,911
<i> for all your</i>
<i> wonderful cards and flowers</i>

903
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:27,614
<i> and, and some of you</i>
<i> have asked about donations.</i>

904
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:31,118
But the family would prefer
any donations to be made

905
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,287
in Roger's name

906
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:36,323
to the organ donor foundation.

907
01:26:36,325 --> 01:26:39,493
<i> Following his kidney</i>

909
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:34,281
-<i> John? You coming?</i>

910
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:37,784
-Ah, no, I'm gonna stay behind
and start cleaning stuff up.

911
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:39,519
-Okay, you go with mom.

912
01:27:39,521 --> 01:27:41,855
-Mom already left
in the hearse with Margaret.

913
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,360
-No, she's taking her own car.
She just went upstairs.

914
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:06,046
-Mom?

915
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:10,751
Mom?

916
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:54,461
-Where have you hidden it?

917
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,597
-It's him, not it.

918
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,768
-I need that heart.

919
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,105
Or any heart.

920
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,815
-Okay?

921
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,551
<i> You love her?</i>

922
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:21,088
-Why do you think
i stayed human all these years?

923
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,127
-You love her?

924
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:39,139
Do you think
i wouldn't do it, John?

925
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,275
<i> After all I've done?</i>

926
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,415
Where is that body?

927
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,054
Where?

928
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,994
-It's in the freezer.

929
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:17,377
-John?

930
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:19,846
What is this?

931
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,182
-It's the one that's been
killing everybody.

932
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:23,817
-<i> He attacked me.</i>

933
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,020
Is he dead?
-<i> Mom.</i>

934
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,288
Not he, it.

935
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,956
-We need to call the police.
-<i> No!</i>

936
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,124
<i> Mom, listen. Listen to me.</i>

937
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:33,660
You can't do that.
Mom, I tried.

938
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:35,662
He killed them.

939
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:40,534
Mom. Please, help me.

940
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:55,449
Scissors.

941
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:44,097
Turn it on.

942
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,032
-John.

943
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,203
It hurts.

944
01:34:13,281 --> 01:34:15,181
John..

945
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,942
Look after Kay for me.

948

-<i> While police are waiting</i>

949
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:18,371

<i> bill crowley, age 79</i>

953
01:36:25,847 --> 01:36:27,447

954

955

956
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,021
<i> with information</i>

957
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,860
-Tell me about him.

958
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:42,829
-About bill?

959
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:48,968
I met bill,
we were both in our 30s.

960
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,039
And in those days,
in this town, being 30

961
01:36:53,041 --> 01:36:56,009
and single
made me an old maid.

962
01:36:57,144 --> 01:37:00,013
He reminded me
a bit of my grandfather

963
01:37:00,015 --> 01:37:02,048
the way he always wore a hat.

964
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,852
He had this lust for life.
I..

965
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:08,855
I set my sights on him after
the first couple of weeks.

966
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:13,893
<i> One Sunday, we were having</i>
<i> dinner at my parents' house</i>

967
01:37:13,895 --> 01:37:17,463
with all my brothers
and sisters and

968
01:37:17,465 --> 01:37:19,666
all their families and..

969
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:23,670
Bill got up and left the table.

970
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,075
I followed him out
and found him in the kitchen..

971
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:33,213
...crying.

972
01:37:33,215 --> 01:37:37,016
He said, "i never got it
before now, Kay."

973
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:40,053
And he told me..

974
01:37:40,055 --> 01:37:41,888
...he loved me..

975
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:47,060
...more than anything
in heaven or hell.

976
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:54,300
He was very romantic
with his words.

977
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:59,305
<i> In his last days,</i>
<i> he was more..</i>

978
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:01,708
<i> ...sickness than health.</i>

979
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:04,043
You saw the way he was.

980
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,649
But every day
he'd tell me

981
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:14,888
"i will stay by
your side forever."

982
01:38:20,662 --> 01:38:23,463
Oh, that dreaded thing.

983
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:27,400
It hasn't been the same
since that night.

984
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:42,649
-<i> You know, we can arrange for</i>
<i> you to see a grief counselor</i>

985
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:44,183
<i> if you'd like.</i>

986
01:38:45,486 --> 01:38:48,421
-I think that...Seeing
a psychotherapist to talk

987
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:51,391
about my first therapist seems..

988
01:38:51,393 --> 01:38:53,326
...kinda disloyal.

989
01:38:56,664 --> 01:38:58,865
Neblin would have
laughed at that.

990
01:38:58,867 --> 01:39:01,034
