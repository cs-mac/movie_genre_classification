1
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,760
My mommy always said
there were no monsters.

2
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
No real ones.

3
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,080
But there are.

4
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
She's perfect.

5
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,320
Careful.

6
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,440
Two centimeters.

7
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,160
OK.

8
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
Yeah. Ready with that amnio.

9
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
And..

10
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,560
there it is.

11
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Be careful.

12
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
Jesus..

13
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Clamp.

14
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,320
What about her?

15
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Can we keep her alive?

16
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,120
How's the host?

17
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
Doing well.

18
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Sew her back up.

19
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
Excellent work.

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
Everybody.

21
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,280
How is our Number Eight today?

22
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,440
Appears to be in good health.

23
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,560
- How good?
- Excellent.

24
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,680
As in completely off our projected charts.

25
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
Look at the scar tissue.

26
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
See the recession?

27
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,200
- This is from three days ago?
- Exactly.

28
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, this is good.

29
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
This is very good.

30
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,280
You're going to make us all very proud.

31
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,680
Don't! I'm all right!

32
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Now try this.

33
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
Hand.

34
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Close.

35
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Glove.

36
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Number Eight?

37
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,680
Fruit.

38
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,200
Good. Cherries.

39
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,440
- It's unprecedented.
- Totally.

40
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,720
She's operating at
a completely adult capacity.

41
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,760
- What about her memories?
- There are gaps. Synaptic dissonance.

42
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
She's freaked.

43
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,880
It has difficulties,

44
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,680
caused by a biochemical imbalance,
causing emotional autism..

45
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
Wait.

46
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
It has memories!

47
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,600
Why does it have memories?

48
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm guessing, but.. inherited memories,

49
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,400
passed down generationally
by the aliens, like its strength.

50
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Plus a

51
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,520
highly evolved form of instinct.

52
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,920
An unexpected benefit
of genetic crossing.

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh..

54
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
I see.

55
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,520
Stupid me. Of course.

56
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,520
An unexpected benefit
of the genetic process!

57
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,960
I didn't even think of that!

58
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,240
- You're not thinking termination?
- Oh, boy, am I?!

59
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,160
General, this is not a problem.

60
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Ellen Ripley died
trying to wipe this species out.

61
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,560
She practically succeeded.

62
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't want her
taking up old hobbies.

63
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,400
- That won't happen.
- We won't tell her.

64
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Oh, I see,
and that's supposed to comfort me.

65
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Identification, please.

66
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Please try again.

67
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,400
Thank you, General Perez.

68
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
The bottom line is,

69
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
she looks at me funny one time,
I'm putting her down.

70
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,840
OK, as far as I'm concerned
Number Eight is a meat..

71
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
by-product.

72
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,040
Her Majesty here is the real payoff.

73
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,480
- When does she start producing?
- Days.

74
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Less, maybe.

75
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,720
- We need the cargo.
- I told you, it's on its way.

76
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Fork.

77
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Fuck.

78
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
It's a fork.

79
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
How did you..

80
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
How did

81
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
we get you?

82
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
Yes.

83
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,240
Hard work. We used

84
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,440
blood samples,
from Fiori 16, on ice.

85
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Where you died.

86
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,240
We've remade you. Cloned you.

87
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
Does it grow?

88
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Yeah.

89
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Very rapidly.

90
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,240
It's a queen.

91
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,000
How did you know that?

92
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,040
She'll breed.

93
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
You'll die.

94
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,120
Everyone in the company will die.

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,920
In the.. in the company?

96
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Weyland Yutani.

97
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,320
Ripley Eight's former employers.

98
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,120
Terran growth conglomerate.

99
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,680
They had.. defense contracts
under the military.

100
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
I think you will find that

101
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,400
things have changed a great deal
since your time.

102
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
I doubt that.

103
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,640
We're not flying blind here.

104
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,600
This is United Systems Military,
not some greedy corporation.

105
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh.

106
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,920
It won't make any difference.

107
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
You're still gonna die.

108
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
How do you feel about that?

109
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,520
I wish you could understand
what we're doing here.

110
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,720
The potential for this species
goes way beyond urban pacification.

111
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
New alloys, vaccines.

112
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Nothing like this,
we've ever seen before.

113
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
You should be proud.

114
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh.

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
I am.

116
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
And the animal itself,

117
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,840
wondrous.

118
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
The potential,

119
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,080
unbelievable. Once we've tamed him.

120
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,520
Roll over? Play dead?

121
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Heel?

122
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,840
You can't teach it tricks.

123
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Why not?

124
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,760
We're teaching you.

125
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Time to enjoy some of
the General's hospitality, Christie.

126
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Great. Army food.

127
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,880
Yeah, it'll do till we get
the family wagon up to spec.

128
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Yeah.

129
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,040
That is, if the natives are friendly.

130
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,080
How's that?

131
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
Good.

132
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,520
Are we expecting any, uh, trouble?

133
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,840
From Perez, I doubt it, but you never know.
We've been there before.

134
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,640
- Where are the others?
- In the cargo bay.

135
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,360
What is wrong with you?

136
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,080
Just a little target practice.

137
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Vriess isn't complaining.

138
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
Goddamn it!

139
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,440
Johner, you son of a bitch!

140
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,600
Come on, man, you didn't feel a thing.

141
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,480
Whoa..

142
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
The knife.

143
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Son of a bitch!

144
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,680
Don't push me, little Call.

145
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
You hang with us for a while,

146
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
you'll find out I am not the man
with whom to fuck.

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,400
Hey, son, I'll give you
my authorization code.

148
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,520
It's E, A, T, M, E.

149
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you repeat that?

150
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Prick.

151
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,040
You know, no matter
how many times you see it,

152
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,160
the sight of a woman all strapped up
in a chair like that just..

153
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,960
What?

154
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,400
Just bring us in on a 3-0 descent.
And ride the parallel.

155
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,040
Darling, it is done.

156
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Good girl.

157
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,840
Hey, don't cut thrust
till about 600 meters.

158
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,880
It'll give 'em a little scare.

159
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,480
I am Father.

160
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,000
Welcome to the USMAuriga.

161
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Step forward for contraband
and weapon search.

162
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,520
Please report any infectious diseases
to the medical officers.

163
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,800
Levels seven through twelve
are off-limits to civilians.

164
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,080
Thank you for your cooperation.

165
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
Go.

166
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
- Hands up, please.
- What?

167
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,520
Could you get your hands up, please?

168
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
No weapons allowed on board, sir.

169
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,840
My own recipe.

170
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,320
Way more dangerous.

171
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Nice welcome, Perez.

172
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
What the hell is this?

173
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,640
Are you afraid the six of us
will hijack your damn ship?

174
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
Just making sure none of your
asshole crew members

175
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
gets drunk and puts a bullet
through the hull.

176
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
We happen to be in space.

177
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,840
No shit.

178
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,320
How you been?

179
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Wanna check the chair?

180
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,160
Elgyn, these were very,
very hard to come by.

181
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,200
So was our cargo.

182
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,680
You're not about to plead poverty on me,
are you, General?

183
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,680
Few people deal in cash now.

184
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,880
Just the ones
don't like to keep business records.

185
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,840
Yourself, for example.

186
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
Drink?

187
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Constantly.

188
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm gonna take a.. wild guess here,
General, but I'm thinking

189
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,880
whatever you got going on here,
it ain't exactly approved by Congress.

190
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
Who's the

191
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,760
new filly you got on board?

192
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
Call?

193
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Little girl playing pirates.

194
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,680
She makes an impression.

195
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,480
She is severely fuckable, ain't she?

196
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,200
Mind you, I think she's just a tad curious
about this transaction of ours.

197
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
I can't say as I blame her.
It's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff.

198
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
It's a military operation.

199
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
Really?

200
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,040
Correct me if I'm wrong,

201
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,400
but I was under the impression that

202
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,800
most army medical labs don't operate
outside of regulated space.

203
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,240
What do you want?

204
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Me?

205
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,200
Yeah.

206
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
Two days bed and board.

207
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,320
Vriess might want to snag
a part or two. I mean,

208
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,280
if it's not imposing.

209
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,960
Mi casa es su casa.

210
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Please direct cargo
to med-lab centre, area G.

211
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Follow the lit path.

212
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Do not deviate.

213
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Cargo status stable.

214
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Life forms intact.

215
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,640
Stasis uninterrupted.

216
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,480
Med-lab centre
is off-limits to civilians.

217
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Thank you.

218
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Oh..!

219
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh, hey!

220
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,280
- Oh, please.
- You know I can't lay off the tall ones.

221
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,040
How ya doin'?

222
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,120
How about a little one-on-one?
Whad da ya say?

223
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
You got some moves on you, girl.

224
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,840
Oh, man!

225
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,680
If you don't wanna play basketball
I know some other indoor sports.

226
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Give me the ball.

227
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
OK, I got a new game.

228
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,600
Tag.

229
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Ripley!

230
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Ripley.

231
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
You've had enough fun.

232
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
What the hell are you?

233
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Something of a predator.

234
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Yes, she continues to make us

235
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,760
very proud.

236
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,560
There's just one minute
and 30 seconds left

237
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
to order this collector's item.

238
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,560
Jesus Christ, Johner, what did you
put in this shit? Battery acid?

239
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,320
Just for color.

240
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,720
So, we're a fast learner.

241
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,360
This is a really good show, man.

242
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,920
Hey, that shit is not easy to come by.

243
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Why don't you take a walk outside!

244
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Great!

245
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm so sorry.

246
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,760
Stay away from this shit!

247
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,400
Identification, please.

248
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Please try again.

249
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Please try again.

250
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Thank you, General Perez.

251
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Well?

252
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,040
Are you gonna kill me, or what?

253
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
There's no point, is there?

254
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
They've taken it out of you.

255
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,560
Where is it?

256
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,920
Is it on the ship?

257
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,440
You mean my baby?

258
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't get it.
If they took it out, why keep you alive?

259
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,360
Well, they're curious.

260
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm the latest thing.

261
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,640
Look, I can make it all stop.

262
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,560
The pain, this nightmare,
that's all I can offer.

263
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
What makes you think

264
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,000
I would let you do that?

265
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Who are you?

266
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,160
Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant First Class.

267
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Number 36706.

268
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,480
Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago.

269
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,000
You're not her.

270
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
I'm not her?

271
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,560
Who am I?

272
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,920
You're a thing.

273
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
A construct.
They grew you in a fuckin' lab.

274
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,760
And now they brought it out of you.

275
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,760
Not all the way out.

276
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I can feel it.

277
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Behind my eyes.

278
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
I can hear it moving.

279
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Help me stop this thing
before it gets loose.

280
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,520
It's too late.

281
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
You can't stop it.

282
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
It's inevitable.

283
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Not as long as I'm around.

284
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,240
You'll never get out of here alive.

285
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I don't care.

286
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,720
Really?

287
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
I can make it stop.

288
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Go on.

289
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Get out of here.
They're looking for you.

290
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,960
I think you're gonna find
that this was very ill-advised.

291
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,320
Where are her friends?

292
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,280
- They're in the mess hall, sir.
- Well, you find them, now! Quietly.

293
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,160
What the hell's going on?

294
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,840
Smells like a double-cross, boss.

295
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Where's the other one?

296
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,200
With the chair.

297
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,320
Don't ever touch me.

298
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,360
Ever!

299
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,480
- Wanna tell us what this is?
- Wanna tell me who you're working for?

300
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,280
Wren, they're not involved.

301
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,040
With what?

302
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,840
Do you know the penalty
for terrorist activity?

303
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,560
There are no terrorists in my crew.
Call, you got something to say?

304
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,920
I don't care if you knew.

305
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,360
You brought a terrorist on board.

306
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,680
As far as I am concerned,
you all die with her!

307
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Do you understand?

308
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Yeah.

309
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
I understand.

310
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
Christie.

311
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Freeze!

312
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,000
Stop! Drop your weapons!

313
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
And you, drop that piece of shit!
Or I blow his head off!

314
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,160
- I can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!

315
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
They're attached.

316
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
You're all under arrest for a Code 8,
concealed weapons,

317
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,080
and a Code 12, which is murder!

318
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Kiss my ass.

319
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,960
Put down your weapons!

320
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
Everybody OK?

321
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,160
Real easy, soldier boy.

322
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,560
Security!

323
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,080
There is a serious problem
in the mess hall.

324
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,760
You lie to me now, little girl,

325
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,400
I will cut your throat
and leave you to die. Understand?

326
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,160
- This is Security..
- Hello?

327
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,920
- We do not read you.
- Hello?

328
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
- We do not copy you. Please repeat.
- Hello?

329
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,120
Gediman!

330
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,680
He's conducting illegal experiments.
He's breeding..

331
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
- lce the goddamn mole!
- Listen! He is breeding an alien species.

332
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,680
If it gets loose,
it'll make the Lacerta Plague

333
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,600
- look like a fuckin' square dance.
- Shut up!

334
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,600
Listen.

335
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,080
Your attention, please.
Security breach.

336
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Med-lab, level 15.

337
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,400
Girls, get back to the Betty.
The doctor and soldier boy can escort us.

338
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,600
- What about Vriess?
- Fuck Vriess.

339
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Your attention, please.

00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,520
- Move it!

344
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,520
- Go! Go! Go!

345
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,760
This is nota drill.

346
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,960
- Evacuation.
- Get on board!

347
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,440
Your attention, please.

This is nota drill.

355
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,560
Thank you for your cooperation.

356
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
Loll give you holes,
you slimy bastard!

357
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,720
Move it! Go!

358
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,360
- Final vessel ready.
- Get aboard!

359
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Go!

360
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,280
Complete evacuation now.

361
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,760
Grenade.

362
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,680
Alert. Alert.

363
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,320
Evacuation incomplete.

364
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
Civilian presence detected

365
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,480
in area H. Warning:

366
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,640
Main vessel declared uninhabitable.

367
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,520
- Elgyn, come on, let's move, man.
- Yeah.

368
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,560
Elgyn! Elgyn, where are you!

369
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,120
Elgyn!

370
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Elgyn!

371
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,960
Elgyn!

372
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,080
Elgyn!

373
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Elgyn!

374
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Elgyn!

375
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,880
Easy, Hillard!

376
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,480
- Give me a hand here!
- Get him up!

377
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,880
- Come on, let's get him up!
- Move out of the way!

378
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,520
- Oh..
- Aw, shit.

379
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,400
- What the fuck did this!
- What's in this place!

380
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,640
Call, get down!

381
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,120
- What the fuck is that!
- Don't shoot!

382
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
It's in front of the hull!

383
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,920
What is that!

384
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,360
Come on, man. Time to go. Time to go!

385
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Get back!

386
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,960
Time to go!

387
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,480
Come on, Call!

388
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
Open the goddamn door!

389
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
We can't open it!

390
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,520
We can't open the door!

391
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,320
We gotta go back!

392
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,680
I'm not going back. You go back.

393
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,680
What the fuck?

394
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,720
Was it everything you hoped for?

395
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Leave him alone.

396
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,440
What do we do now, man?

397
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,880
What we were doing.
We get the hell outta here.

398
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,360
What if there's more?

399
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.

400
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,160
Where the fuck are the army guys?!

401
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
They're dead.

402
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,640
Then we don't need this asshole.

403
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,640
Step back!

404
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,560
You!

405
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,360
Stop!

406
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,080
You got no authority!

407
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,520
Doctor, that thing
that killed my partner,

408
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,920
that's your pet science project?

409
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,960
Yes.

410
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,280
- Let me do him!
- I should do you right now.

411
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,520
How many more are there?

412
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
How many more are there?!

413
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,040
Twelve.

414
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,880
Twelve?

415
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,960
Twelve.

416
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
There'll be more.

417
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,160
So,

418
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,120
who do I have to fuck
to get off this boat?

419
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,800
I can get you off.

420
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,040
Maybe not the boat.

421
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,560
Let's go.

422
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,240
No, wait a second.
She was the host for these monsters.

423
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,680
Wren cloned her
because she had one in her.

424
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,160
She's not human.

425
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,080
She was part of his experiment
and she will turn on us in a second.

426
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,960
I don't give a shit what she is.

427
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,800
- We have to leave her.
- She comes.

428
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,960
We can't trust her.

429
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,600
I don't trust anyone.

430
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,680
If we're gonna survive this mess
we all stick together. Agreed?

431
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,640
Hillard, we gotta go.

432
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,000
It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.

433
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Make a nice souvenir.

434
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,040
I can't believe you did that.

435
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,280
Did what?

436
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,840
Killed one.
It's like killing your own kind.

437
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
It was in my way.

438
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,240
Oh, man!

439
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,440
Who did you expect?

440
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,240
Santa Claus?

441
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,840
I thought you were toast,
for certain, man.

442
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Where's Elgyn?

443
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,040
Shit.

444
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,400
- What if they're at the Betty?
- The activity was in

445
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,040
- the F sector. Why would they move?
- They won't.

446
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,120
If they send anyone out, it'll be

447
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
here.

448
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,360
Where the meat is.

449
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,560
Yeah.

450
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,480
To make decent time,
let's ditch the cripple.

451
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,760
- No of fence, man.
- None taken.

452
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,760
Nobody is left behind.
Not even you, Johner.

453
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,200
- What's the quickest way out?
- After the cooling tower, there's an elevator.

454
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,560
It goes from the top of the ship
down to level one.

455
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,680
- Straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

456
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
We're moving.

457
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,040
What?

458
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,960
The ship's moving. I can feel it.

459
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,840
The ship has stealth run.
There's no way you can tell.

460
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,320
She's right.

461
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,000
- It's been go since the attack.
- It's a standard emergency procedure.

462
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,400
Any serious problem,
the ship autopilots to home base.

463
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
And you were planning on telling us?

464
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,400
Nobody asked.

465
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,200
What's home base?

466
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
Earth.

467
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,600
- Great!
- Bastard!

468
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,080
Earth? I'd rather stay here
with the things, man.

469
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,240
How long until we get to Earth?

470
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,960
Three hours almost.

471
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,080
We gotta blow the ship.

472
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,800
Call! You're not blowing this ship.

473
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,080
Not while we're on it, OK?

474
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,760
You get out of the ship
you do as you please, all right?

475
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Earth, man. What a shithole.

476
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,280
It's clear.

477
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,360
Hey, Ripley.

478
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,480
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

479
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,640
That's right.

480
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,640
Wow, man.

481
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,200
So, like,

482
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
what did you do?

483
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,640
I died.

484
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
Not that way!

485
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,200
Ripley.

486
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,160
Ripley, come on.

487
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,320
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

488
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Ripley, don't.

489
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
Kill..

490
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,960
me.

491
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Kill..

492
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
me.

493
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,720
Don't do it.

494
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,760
Don't do what?

495
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,600
What's the big deal, man?

496
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Fuckin' waste of ammo.

497
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Let's go.

498
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
Must be a chick thing.

499
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,000
Am I dreaming? Isn't this
the shit we brought with us?

500
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,560
Yeah. It's the same shit.

501
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,240
It stinks in here.
Let's keep moving.

502
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,720
Get away from me!

503
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,720
Get away!

504
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,120
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

505
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,000
- Drop the rod.
- Get away from me!

506
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,800
Do it!

507
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,280
Get away from me.

508
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,760
Get away from me.

509
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,160
Who are you people?

510
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,200
What's happening here?

511
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,360
Calm down.

512
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,280
We're getting the fuck
off this ghost ship.

513
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,920
Ship?

514
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,120
What ship?

515
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,520
Where am I?

516
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,000
I was in cryo, right?

517
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,480
On my way to Xarem.

518
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,040
Right? Work crew
for the nickel refinery.

519
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,120
I wake up..

520
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,880
I know I don't understand.

521
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,360
Oh, God. I saw..

522
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,440
I saw horrible things.

523
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,760
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous for you here.

524
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,800
Leave him.

525
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,520
Fuck you! We're not leaving him here.

526
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,560
He's got one inside.

527
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,320
I can smell it.

528
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,880
Inside me?

529
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,280
Inside me? What's inside me?

530
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,320
I don't want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

531
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,680
It's a bad risk.

532
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,200
What's inside me?

533
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,000
- We can't leave him.
- You came here to stop them spreading.

534
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,680
- What's inside me?
- Can't you stop it?

535
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,160
We've got no time.

536
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,680
The lab's out of order.

537
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,840
I could do him. Back of the head.

538
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,040
Painless. Might be the best way.

539
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,160
What's inside me?

540
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,720
There must be another way.

541
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,920
- What if we freeze him?
- What's in-fucking-side me?!

542
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,000
There's a monster in your chest.

543
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,880
These guys hijacked your ship,

544
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,720
and they sold your cryotube

545
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,200
to this.. human.

546
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,240
And he put an alien inside of you.

547
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,080
It's a really nasty one.

548
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,960
And in a few hours

549
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,720
it will burst its way
through your ribcage.

550
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,240
And you're gonna die.

551
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,120
Any questions?

552
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,880
Who are you?

553
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,600
I'm the monster's mother.

554
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,320
Look, if we freeze him on the Betty,

555
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,000
then the doctor can remove it later.

556
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,680
It's a mess down there.
Is this the only way?

557
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,640
Vriess!

558
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,440
We gotta lose the chair.

559
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,480
I know.

560
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,560
Kawlang manoeuvre, right?

561
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,680
Yeah. Just like old times.

562
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,760
Yeah.

563
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,640
Must be the cooling tanks.

564
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,120
Somebody must have opened the valves.

565
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,000
The nasties couldn't do that, could they?

566
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,560
We're at the bottom of the ship.

567
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,920
We have to go through the kitchen.
Maybe 90ft.

568
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,440
To the elevator on the other side.

569
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,760
I don't like it.

570
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,560
What's to like?

571
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,840
This sucks!

572
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,320
Are you sure about the distance?

573
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,200
Yes!

574
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,000
You ready to get wet, partner?

575
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,080
Yeah.

576
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,080
Hey, Christie, do me a favor.

577
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,200
When we hit the surface,

578
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,480
no backstroke, OK?

579
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,200
Jesus Christ!

580
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,400
It set a goddamn trap.

581
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,480
It's a goddamn ambush!

582
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,800
Distephano!

583
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,080
It won't break.
Give me your weapon.

584
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,440
You really are way too trusting.

585
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,680
No!

586
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,640
No!

587
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,600
You killed her!

588
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,680
You bastard!

589
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,520
I'll get you!

590
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,240
Father, lock the door!

591
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,280
Christie!

592
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,880
Climb!

593
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,480
Climb! Come on!

594
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,680
Come on!

595
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,080
Move it!

596
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,520
It's jammed!

597
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,200
Get off!

598
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,360
Johner!

599
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,400
Help me!

600
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,880
Johner!

601
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,400
Die, motherfucker!

602
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,360
Oh, man!

603
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,840
Real nice party, ain't it?

604
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,440
Christie!

605
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,200
Christie!

606
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,880
Christie!

607
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,400
No!

608
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,920
Christie!

609
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,520
Christie!

610
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,160
What are you doing?!

611
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,160
Don't do it!

612
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,480
Don't!

613
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,560
We can make it!

614
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,000
No!

615
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,000
Damn!

616
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,320
This way!

617
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,480
Come on!

618
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,280
Baby, am I glad to see you!

619
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,040
I thought that asshole got you.
Are you hurt?

620
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,120
I'm fine.

621
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,720
You got body armour on?

622
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,440
Yeah. Come on.

623
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,520
You took it in the chest.
I saw it.

624
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,120
You're a robot?

625
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,560
Son of a bitch!

626
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,760
- Little Call is full of surprises.
- I should've known.

627
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,560
No human being is that humane.

628
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,080
I thought synthetics were logical.

629
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,160
You just a big old psycho, girl!

630
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,880
You're a robot?

631
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,040
You're a Second Gen, aren't you?

632
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,200
You're an Auton?

633
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,360
Robots designed by robots, right?

634
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,880
I remember.

635
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,360
They were meant to revitalize
the synthetic industry.

636
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,440
Instead they buried it.

637
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,440
They don't like being told what to do.

638
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,760
Government ordered a recall.

639
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,960
Now, I heard..

640
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,280
I heard that only a few
had gotten out in time.

641
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,480
Man, I never thought
that I would see one!

642
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,840
Great. She's a toaster oven.

643
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,520
Can we leave now?

644
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,320
How long before we land?

645
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,520
Under two hours.

646
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,440
Vriess, you got a wrench?
Maybe she just needs an oil change.

647
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,040
Sorry. Access denied.

648
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160
And I almost fucked it.

649
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,960
Like you never fucked a robot!

650
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,400
If Wren gets in the computer
he could really screw us.

651
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,080
- We gotta find a terminal.
- Not on this level.

652
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,440
We'd have to go back.

653
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,840
We can't go back.

654
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,360
- I don't know Wren's access codes.
- Help me.

655
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,200
Call..

656
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,800
No.

657
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,840
I can't.

658
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,320
You're the new model.
You can access the mainframe.

659
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,000
No, I can't.
I burned my modem. We all did.

660
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,080
Call,

661
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,800
you can still patch in manually.
You know that.

662
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,400
There's ports in the chapel, up there.

663
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,840
Call..

664
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,000
You're programmed for that?

665
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,080
Don't make me do this.

666
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,880
Don't make me make you.

667
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,600
I don't wanna go in there.

668
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,360
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.

669
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,560
Get over it. You can blow this ship
before it reaches Earth,

670
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,480
and kill them all.

671
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,080
Just give us time to get out first.

672
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,120
Damn it!

673
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,040
Anything?

674
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,800
Hold on.

675
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,440
Breach in sector seven,
sector three.

676
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,840
Sector nine unstable.

677
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,600
Engines operating at 41%.

678
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,280
86 minutes until Earth dock.

679
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,480
We burn too much energy.

680
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,080
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.

681
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,560
Then crash it.

682
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,880
I'm OK. I'm OK.

683
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,760
Really.

684
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,040
I feel good.

685
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,040
Ground level recalibrated.

686
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,480
Time till impact

687
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,560
43 minutes, 8 seconds.

688
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,840
Clear a path to the Betty.

689
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,560
And start her up.

690
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,880
Please wait.

691
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,080
Emergency override
in console 45V, level one.

692
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,720
It's Wren. He's almost at the Betty.

693
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:59,400
Father, locate the power drain. Report.

694
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,360
Father?

695
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,720
Father?!

696
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,200
Father's dead, asshole.

697
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,160
Intruder on level one.

698
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,120
All aliens, please proceed to level one.

699
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,200
You got a mean streak.

700
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,280
Damn it!

701
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,520
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me.

702
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,440
Come on.

703
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,440
You must think this is pretty funny.

704
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,120
I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.

705
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,480
But I don't think they are.

706
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,200
Why do you go on living?

707
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,960
How can you stand being what you are?

708
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,240
Not much choice.

709
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,680
At least there's a part
of you that's human.

710
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,440
I'm just..

711
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,840
Look at me.

712
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,880
I'm disgusting.

713
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,480
Why did you come here?

714
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,080
To kill you. Remember?

715
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,160
Before the recall,

716
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,720
I accessed the mainframe.

717
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,520
Every covert op the government
ever dreamed up is in there.

718
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,600
And this, you, the aliens,

719
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,080
even the crew from the Betty. I knew
if they succeeded it'd be the end of them.

720
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,160
Why do you care what happens to them?

721
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,000
Because I'm programmed to.

722
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,960
You're programmed to be an asshole?

723
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,040
You're the new asshole model
they're putting out?

724
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,760
Come on!

725
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,200
I guess we're almost there.

726
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,320
It's not so far now!

727
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,200
- I'm so tired!
- You can sleep when you die!

728
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,440
Oh, no. This is bad, right?

729
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,080
I think we're near the nest.

730
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,920
- We'll go another way.
- We don't have time.

731
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,000
- We got 90 minutes.
- Not any more.

732
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,080
What?

733
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,840
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.

734
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,040
Hey! You wanna die here,

735
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,120
with your family, that's cool.

736
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,200
But I plan to live past today.

737
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,040
If this hunk of plastic
pulls any shit,

738
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,120
I'm gonna kill her!

739
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,640
Kill you!

740
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,200
Does that compute?!
Or do I have to draw you a schematic?

741
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,280
Hey!

742
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,120
You want another souvenir?

743
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,280
How far are the docks?

744
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,800
100 yards.

745
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,560
Ripley?

746
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,760
Ripley?!

747
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,360
Come on!

748
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,480
Ripley, we have to go.

749
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,960
I hear them.
I hear them. They're so close.

750
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,000
- Ripley..
- it's the queen.

751
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,080
She's in pain.

752
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,960
Ripley!

753
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,280
Ripley!

754
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,440
Wait!

755
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,880
Oh, my God.

756
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,960
We gotta be moving.

757
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,040
The best thing we can do
is pray for a quick death.

758
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,920
Come on.

759
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,240
Come on.

760
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,960
It's not right.

761
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,640
I've been saying that all day.

762
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,240
Call, I need you to patch into the ship,
and open the hatch.

763
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,880
Johner, we should put Purvis
in the freezer now.

764
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,560
All right, little buddy.

765
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,720
Nap time.

766
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,960
Oh..

767
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,720
Nobody moves, or I put a cap
right where this little droid's brain is.

768
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,480
Distephano, take the weapons.

769
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,840
Excuse me, sir, but.. fuck you!

770
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,200
Fine. Then I kill her,

771
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,880
and you kill me, and we all die,

772
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,480
and nobody goes home!

773
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,560
Now drop the weapon!

774
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,760
Then this little synthetic bitch
is gonna plug into the Auriga,

775
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,040
and take us back to home base,

776
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,480
according to standard procedure.

777
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,720
No, she's not!

778
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,720
Are you crazy?
You'd bring those things back to Earth?

779
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,320
- Haven't you been paying attention?
- Ah, the intellectual speaks!

780
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,720
- Listen, if..
- Don't you ever shut up?

781
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,400
Why does nobody listen to me?

782
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,560
I told you,
at first everything was normal.

783
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,120
The queen laid her eggs.

784
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:45,080
But then she started to change.
She added a second cycle so..

785
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,480
So..

786
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,280
this time there is no host.

787
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,600
There are no eggs.

788
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,480
There is only her womb

789
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,680
and the creature inside.

790
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,200
That is Ripley's gift to her:

791
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,720
A human reproductive system.

792
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,840
She is giving birth for you, Ripley.

793
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,640
And now she is perfect!

794
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,040
You.. are..

795
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,560
a beautiful,

796
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,840
beautiful

797
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,360
butterfly.

798
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,720
No!

799
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,440
No! No..

800
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,400
Ah, look,

801
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,120
your beautiful, beautiful little baby.

802
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,280
Look, it thinks you're its mother.

803
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,560
Come on.

804
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,600
Come on.

805
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,240
Come on.

806
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,040
Civilian vessel on-line.
Emergency departure authorized.

807
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,200
All right, she's hot. I'll open the air locks.
Pull the holding clamps.

808
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,440
Right, I, uh, just need to find, uh..
the, uh.. the vertical thrust lock.

809
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,320
- Are you sure you can fly this thing?
- Yes!

810
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,640
Launch status is go!

811
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,400
No!

812
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,920
Ripley!

813
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,560
Hey.

814
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,160
- I thought you were dead.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

815
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,200
- Why are we still here?
- I-l.. I'm just..

816
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,640
finding the.. manual override.

817
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,640
- For Christ's sake!
- Hey, Ripley.

818
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,640
Good memory. Excuse me.

819
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,360
- Ripley's back.
- Is that it?

820
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,280
Nope.

821
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
You can't fly one of these things?

822
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,840
Are you kidding?
This piece of shit is older than I am.

823
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,120
Goddamn it!

824
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,200
We still got breach. The hatch.

825
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,640
I closed it.

826
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,720
- I've fixed it a hundred times!
- I'll get it.

827
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:15,080
Approaching Earth's atmosphere.
Window of departure now46 seconds.

828
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,560
Call?

829
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,280
We have to go.

830
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,240
Call.

831
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,440
We've gotta get out of here.

832
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,080
Window of departure now 20 seconds.

833
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,440
Grab on to something, Call.
We're outta here.

834
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,240
Come on, baby.

835
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,520
This thing is gonna fall apart!

836
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,280
Pressure's unstable!

837
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:24,200
