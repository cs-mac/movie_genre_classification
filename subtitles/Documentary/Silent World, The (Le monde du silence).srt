1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,720
Somewhere, a while ago already

2
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,242
Sir?

3
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,662
Excuse me, sir?
Your seatbelt, please.

4
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,789
Oh, sorry.

5
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,256
God, I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,014
<i>There I was, after 10 years-
well, 12, to be precise...</i>

7
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,728
<i>So, after twelve years of absence</i>

8
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,774
<i>and in spite of my fear,
I was going to visit them.</i>

9
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,822
<i>In life there are
a number of motivations</i>

10
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>that are no one's business,
that force you to leave,</i>

11
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,496
<i>without looking back.</i>

12
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,875
<i>And there are
just as many motivations</i>

13
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,919
<i>that force you to return.</i>

14
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,591
<i>So after all those years,</i>

15
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>I decided to retrace my steps.</i>

16
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,891
<i>Take the journey...</i>

17
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,604
<i>to announce my death.</i>

18
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,526
<i>Announce it in person,</i>

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,363
<i>and try to give the others,
and myself, one last time,</i>

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>the illusion that I am,</i>

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,455
<i>until its very end,</i>

22
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,462
<i>the master of my life.</i>

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,550
<i>Let's see how that goes.</i>

24
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:39,427
IT'S ONLY THE END OF THE WORLD

25
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,671
Mom! Tony! He's here!

26
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,965
- That twat took a cab!
- Shit, I'm not ready.

27
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,801
You could've done that before!

28
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,761
Before! That's rich!

29
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,181
I was mixing baba ganoush
while you primped.

30
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,184
You've been spiffing up for hours!

31
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,896
Suzanne, stop! A mother
can smarten up for her son.

32
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,066
Louis loves fashion and color.
All gay men do!

33
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,319
- That explains the tranny look!
- Tranny? Thanks.

34
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,115
I don't want to fight,
he's almost here!

35
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:10,203
You always want the last word!
Think I'll give it to you?

36
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,538
I don't care.

37
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,915
Exactly! "I don't care,
I don't care."

38
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,375
That's Missy's motto!

39
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,475
The cab must've cost you an arm.

40
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,477
I said I'd pick you up.

41
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,439
Louis! Love the hair!
I can't see, but looks nice.

42
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,275
The cab must've cost you
a pretty penny!

43
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,818
I just said that!

44
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,322
Louis, you don't know Catherine.

45
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,406
No.

46
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,700
Catherine, Louis.
Louis, Catherine.

47
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,994
- Hi, Catherine.
- Hi.

48
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,831
You must be crazy hot. Gimme that.

49
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,583
Let him come inside!

50
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,959
She's happy.

51
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,462
- She's wagging like a poodle.
- Antoine!

52
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm coming, Louis!
Stupid nail polish.

53
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,467
Hair dryer won't dry!

54
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,344
I'm delighted, Catherine.

55
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,180
Of course... I mean, me course...

56
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,640
Uh, me too.

57
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,644
I'm delighted too. Oh God!

58
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,773
You shake hands?
Like you're presidents?

59
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,941
Or strangers?

60
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,526
They are strangers!

61
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,404
She didn't know.

62
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,322
Give her a kiss, Louis.

63
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,825
Suzanne's right, kisses.

64
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,618
Charmed.

65
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,497
Charmed? Why the heck "charmed"?

66
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,790
They've never met!

67
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,667
They've never met, Mom!

68
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,336
Stop screaming, crazy!

69
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,630
Never?

70
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,799
Why no, he wasn't there.

71
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,012
You're batshit crazy!

72
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,058
I forgot, that's all.
I didn't realize...

73
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,646
Well, darn it!
We sure do live in strange times.

74
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
Sweetie!

75
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,107
No.

76
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
Louis.

77
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,444
You hate "sweetie."

78
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,199
- You knew they'd never met.
- He wasn't at the wedding.

79
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,785
He couldn't make it.
Remember, Martine?

80
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:00,248
I know, darling,
but it slipped my mind.

81
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,168
Since then
there's been no occasion...

82
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,545
Catherine, she just
wants attention.

83
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,756
Shut it, will you.

84
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,549
A bummer about the cab.

85
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,636
I'd have picked you up.
I got a car now.

86
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,014
I said he'd do that, Mom.

87
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,892
- How was the journey?
- I told you last night.

88
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,976
I don't remember.

89
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,979
- But I told you.
- Suzanne, who gives a shit?

90
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,064
Antoine!

91
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,565
So you travelled safe?

92
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,194
Yes. But I wouldn't
call it travelling.

93
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,782
Well, then...

94
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,825
Let's.

95
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,172
See, Catherine, like I said.
That's Louis.

96
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,925
Kisses only Mom,
not even his brother...

97
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,468
Drop it, will you?

98
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,512
Am I talking to you? Fuck off!

99
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,930
Antoine!

100
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,019
They're with their
other grandmother. My mom.

101
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,646
Of course.

102
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,109
We had no way of knowing.
It was so...

103
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:14,447
She was expecting them.
She'd have made a scene...

104
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,575
But they'd have loved to see you.

105
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,786
And me too. I mean...

106
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,498
Antoine and I would've
liked you to meet them.

107
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,335
That's our oldest, she's 8.

108
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,338
Everyone says she looks
just like Antoine.

109
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,300
His spitting image.

110
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,431
But we say that of all children,
right? True or not.

111
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,182
- We do.
- Don't we?

112
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,353
Alrighty! Appetizers
in the living room, I guess?

113
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,983
Cold cuts from Célestin's
and chorizo for Louis...

114
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,068
- Still a fan?
- Yes.

115
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,154
She's got her dad's temper!

116
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,406
A stubborn little devil!
An Antoinette.

117
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,324
Lucky us.

118
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,287
Louis, you had send me a note...

119
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,875
<i>sent! - sorry, sent me a note,
</i>and flowers.

120
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,879
God were they pretty!

121
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,717
I was really, really happy!
I sure liked them.

122
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,719
And I, well...

123
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,349
Antoine and I had sent you
a photo of her, and...

124
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:28,396
It was ridiculous. Well...
She fit in Antoine's hand.

125
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,358
She was so tiny.
A teeny-tiny baby.

126
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,901
Remember, Antoine?

127
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,905
No. I love forgetting the most
important things in my life.

128
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,455
Yeah.

129
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,750
Actually, on this photo,

130
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,711
the resemblance to Antoine...

131
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,088
Zero.

132
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,966
Zero, really.
Big, big fat zero.

133
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,513
But we don't look like anyone
at that age.

134
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,807
Anyway, she's grown up.

135
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,852
Don't you think
you're boring him with that?

136
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,854
You think so?

137
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,272
Not at all!

138
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,816
Why?

139
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,109
Catherine, no.

140
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
No but...

141
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,155
That's my thing.
I bore everybody with my kids.

142
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,868
You think kids interest people.
But guess what? Nope.

143
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,745
No, Catherine.

144
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,125
I don't know why he said that.
Why'd you say that?

145
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,044
It's mean. Well, unpleasant.

146
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,964
Yeah, Antoine. Be fucking decent.

147
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,592
Like that dress?
"Nightmare in Tokyo"?

148
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,138
Beats that jacket
and the "clueless dick" kit.

149
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,725
What about that paint on your face?

150
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,727
- Fuck you!
- Enough, kids!

151
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,145
He started it.

152
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,294
Louis?

153
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,449
I'm not bored, Catherine.

154
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,035
I love hearing about your kids.

155
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,745
I'm glad.

156
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,871
And, um...

157
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,834
Don't you have a boy
who has my name?

158
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,462
Yes.

159
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,382
Yes. Sorry, yes.

160
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,552
I'm happy. I'm touched.

161
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
I mean, it touched me.

162
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,223
Six years old now...

163
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,060
Six. They're two years apart, and...

164
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,312
I don't know

165
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,606
if I should keep going or...

166
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,276
Hey whoa, whoa! Don't blame me.

167
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,319
If you want to talk, talk.

168
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,115
Don't make me sound
like a bully muzzling you.

169
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,908
You're nuts, Antoine.

170
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,993
You're nuts.

171
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,203
Tell him, please.
He's all ears.

172
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,748
Go ahead.

173
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,876
He loves it. Our children,
the children of the world...

174
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:23,006
He's so fond of this topic!
The evolution of our offspring.

175
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,216
His favorite conversation.
So tell him!

176
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,968
Chill the fuck out, Tony.

177
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,431
Oh God, okay, sorry.
I shouldn't have.

178
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,308
I didn't mean to...

179
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,436
I'm sorry, darling. Go on.

180
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm embarrassed. Sorry, Catherine.

181
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,734
No offense, Antoine...
You're making me uncomfortable.

182
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,028
I'm so sorry, really!

183
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,365
Big Bad Antoine
spoiled the lovely day!

184
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,450
Shut up and let her talk!

185
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,369
Go on, Catherine.
Ignore him.

186
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,912
Yeah, ignore me!

187
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,332
There's my dip
and then jalapegno... <i>Peno ?</i>

188
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,416
Peño.

189
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,586
Anyhow, spicy.
And fry sauce of course.

190
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,171
Catherine, do tell.

191
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,592
No but...

192
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,637
That's it, he just...

193
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,725
He has your name, sir.
I mean, Louis.

194
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,686
And, um...

195
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:23,817
What I think is interesting
is that, first and foremost,

196
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,070
he has, if we go back,

197
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:31,908
your father's name,
and so, needless to say...

198
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,743
Here we go, French kings...

199
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,330
Look, Antoine,
I'll just shut up, alright?

200
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,833
And you tell the story.

201
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,668
Or no one does, and...

202
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,546
We just sit here choking
on fry sauce!

203
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,174
Choking on my dip,
little did I know.

204
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,261
- Martine, I meant...
- Express yourself, doll.

205
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,847
I was kidding, sweetheart.

206
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,226
Tell Louis the story. Tell him.

207
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,691
He's got your father's name.

208
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,863
And I...
Well, <i>we thought it'd be great.</i>

209
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,075
- In my family...
<i>- Oh, it's you, hon!</i>

210
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,828
Well, there's a tradition

211
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,331
by which the parents' first name,

212
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,918
or the first name
of the baby's grandfather...

213
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,379
Basically, the first son's name

214
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,342
and the grandfather's name are...

215
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,260
identical.

216
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:37,432
I told Lori you're here. She said,
"Must be a cold day in hell!"

217
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,060
Dumb as ever, that one.

218
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,771
So, Antoine's the eldest,

219
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,775
but Antoine, to me, was a no.

220
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,985
And Louis was a yes.

221
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:54,032
Antoine didn't want an Antoine,
said it'd be bad luck.

222
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,202
Since you people don't have kids,

223
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,413
we weren't depriving you
of anything.

224
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,711
But...

225
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,259
I mean, we say that,
but of course you can...

226
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,430
have children.
Everything's possible nowadays.

227
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,352
You'll have some, I'm sure.
You're still young and...

228
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,187
Would you have named him Louis?

229
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,981
You still can. Right, Antoine?

230
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,066
Mm-hmm.

231
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,859
Okay, Catherine, I need a hand.

232
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,529
- Are you hungry?
- Getting there.

233
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,989
Me too.
Louis, wanna see my room?

234
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,074
Sure.

235
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,285
- What do I do? Jerk off?
<i>- Come hold my pots!</i>

236
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,579
Antoine?

237
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,873
- Antoine, d'you hear?
- Yeah!

238
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,542
Jesus Christ!

239
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,170
I hardly remember you.

240
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,215
I was young and...

241
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,844
I have zero memories.

242
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,471
Only what people told me.

243
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,557
Anyway, I'm just...

244
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,226
Just rambling.

245
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,439
It sucks that you left.

246
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,860
Sucks, uh...

247
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,279
for me, for her,

248
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,823
Antoine.

249
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,826
For you too, right?

250
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,621
You don't have to answer.

251
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,082
But maybe you regret it too?

252
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,669
Maybe you needed us?

253
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,465
I... I'm sorry.

254
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,593
That's why I'm here.

255
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,804
Partly.

256
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,642
It's funny, 'cause before
I got your postcard or letter,

257
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,396
I'd say to myself that...
we were due, y'know.

258
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,107
That the time was right.

259
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,318
- Yeah.
- And...

260
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,986
whenever...

261
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,864
I'm the one who gets the mail.

262
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:03,286
<i>And whenever I see a postcard
in the pile,</i>

263
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,164
<i>I try to put it picture side up.</i>

264
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:11,294
<i>That way, I have something
to turn over. To discover.</i>

265
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,172
Something I'm hoping for.

266
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,720
It's funny 'cause...
we're all following you,

267
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,765
reading articles,
doing all that stuff and...

268
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,893
You know, you can't not know that...

269
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,771
we feel, I mean...

270
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,026
We all feel a sort of...

271
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:37,612
admiration.

272
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,489
For you.

273
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,449
Sounds silly, but...

274
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,618
It's a gift.

275
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,370
You have a gift.

276
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,457
You're laughing?

277
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,209
Yeah, I...

278
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,879
Why? It's a gift, that's it.

279
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,339
It's not funny.

280
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,383
I'm complimenting you.

281
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,884
You got a gift.

282
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,636
You're lucky.

283
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,641
Yeah 'cause...
You don't really use it with us.

284
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,227
It's for others.

285
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,730
Or maybe for no one.

286
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,734
I don't know you.

287
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,238
I'm just saying that.
I'm not judging.

288
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,742
Those are facts.
I'm thinking out loud.

289
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,747
Fucking kills me. I'm so itchy.

290
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,831
What?

291
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,499
I dunno, the makeup.

292
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,714
I never use it, so it itches.

293
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,301
I just wanted... I dunno.
Know what I mean?

294
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,512
And Mom's makeup is shit.

295
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,474
It's red and gross,
so I bought this stuff.

296
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,730
Don't you wanna sit down?

297
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,858
It's cozy.

298
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,777
I'm good.

299
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,464
Those are all mine.

300
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,802
<i>We just call them
your "elliptic bits."</i>

301
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,513
<i>Maybe "elliptic" is wrong.</i>

302
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,847
<i>No.</i>

303
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,141
<i>I mean...</i>

304
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,559
<i>I get it.</i>

305
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,603
<i>We each have our collection.</i>

306
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,563
<i>Antoine.</i>

307
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,982
<i>Mom, obviously.</i>

308
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,234
<i>And she's right.</i>

309
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,029
<i>You've never forgotten the...
our birthdays.</i>

310
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,616
<i>The important days of our lives.</i>

311
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,953
<i>Always a postcard, always something.</i>

312
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,956
Anyway, I dunno.

313
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,418
I've stopped complaining 'cause...

314
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,172
She lectures us when we dare
say you're... not around.

315
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,760
"He does what he has to do.
He always has."

316
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,554
She says that?

317
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,557
Of course. I didn't make it up.

318
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:14,519
But don't worry, I'm an adult, I...

319
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,521
No problem.

320
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,731
No problemo.

321
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,607
No!

322
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,610
No problemo.

323
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,696
Dunno why I said that.

324
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,865
I hate that.

325
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,575
It's not me.

326
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,578
I hate that expression,
it's ridiculous.

327
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,413
So what is "you"?

328
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,916
It's weird how you always
send postcards,

329
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,002
as if you're on vacation,

330
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:41,588
and mailmen can see what you write.

331
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,340
I dunno.

332
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,386
Do you let everyone see
the important things you write?

333
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,015
Well, what you write isn't...

334
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,893
Okay, this is just...

335
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,978
Pathetic. I'm pathetic.

336
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,065
Everyone says so.

337
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,150
Sorry.

338
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,278
I didn't mean to...

339
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,365
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

340
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,369
No, it's me.

341
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,497
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:24,631
Friggin' heat wave
is driving us crazy.

343
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,800
And here it's worse.

344
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,052
Everything's worse here.

345
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,056
I wanted to leave but, I dunno...

346
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,100
I'm good here.

347
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,060
Got the basement,

348
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,479
my room, the storage.

349
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,107
That's the room behind you.

350
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,569
Shit from the old house.
Yours, mostly.

351
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,948
Mom's gonna ask
if you want any of it.

352
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,117
Bet you don't.

353
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,360
Louis?

354
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,446
Are you listening?

355
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:32,032
Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.

356
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,784
Did you buy the car?

357
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,829
Antoine's old one.

358
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,915
<i>Mom bought it.</i>

359
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,043
<i>Mom doesn't drive.</i>

360
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,130
<i>Mm-hmm, so guess
who's her slave driver?</i>

361
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:51,176
<i>But I can drive downtown,
see the girls.</i>

362
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,679
<i>And I drive Mom for errands.</i>

363
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,098
<i>We don't depend on anyone.</i>

364
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,185
<i>We bother no one.</i>

365
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,606
<i>And I like those little moments
with Mom.</i>

366
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,526
<i>She's fun.</i>

367
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,196
<i>She's nuts, though.</i>

368
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,657
Anyway...

369
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,828
No.

370
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,874
I knew you'd say no.
Smoking isn't very you.

371
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,044
Are you completely high?

372
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,921
No.

373
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,090
I hardly feel it anymore.

374
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,552
In fact, it might do me good.

375
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,722
- I don't usually smoke, but...
- So?

376
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,765
Why you here?

377
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,227
Got someone to introduce?

378
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,396
Are you pregnant?

379
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,483
For you. For, uh...

380
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,404
I don't know.

381
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,949
I'd love to see our old house.

382
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,617
Why?

383
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,704
Why do you wanna go back
to that ugly place?

384
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,874
I don't know. Out of nostalgia.

385
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,252
Is it for a play?

386
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,878
No.

387
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,632
No.

388
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:16,052
<i>Suzanne! Louis! Are you coming?</i>

389
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,345
Stop screaming!

390
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,806
<i>Well, get the hell up!</i>

391
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,852
Check out the storage room
if you want.

392
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,312
And your old stuff.

393
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,773
Out of nostalgia.

394
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,198
Reminds me of our Sundays!

395
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,159
- Ugh! Please!
- What?

396
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,412
She knows about Sundays.
Be honest, say it!

397
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,039
Let her talk, Antoine.

398
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,584
He's embarrassed.
His Majesty longed for adventure!

399
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,462
That's why he went
to China after college.

400
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,840
- You went to China?
- So?

401
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:58,094
So, I was working,
my husband was working...

402
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,180
Bottom line, we both worked.

403
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,723
There you are, sweetie!

404
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,100
It's story time. Lucky you!

405
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,519
- Our Sundays?
- Ha! See?

406
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,438
Even Louis, Mom!

407
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,023
Let us be, Antoine.

408
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,441
Louis, red?

409
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,610
Louis's always white, dear.

410
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,946
- White, please.
- Only our family did that!

411
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,825
It was a family thing.
Our thing! Mine, too.

412
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,369
It was a tradition.

413
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,995
Do you need a hand?

414
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,831
Nah, calms me, just getting ahead.

415
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,792
I wanna tell my story!

416
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,127
Go on, let's get it over with.

417
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,546
Sunday was our day off.

418
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:38,510
So we went out for a ride.
Systematically.

419
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,303
Systematically!

420
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,847
It was like... a ritual.

421
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,100
What are you doing?

422
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,810
Nothing. I'm listening.

423
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,478
Stay, Antoine.

424
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,024
Forget him. Listen to me.
He loves to upset me.

425
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,529
So, we'd go on an outing.
And we'd take the car.

426
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,615
Their dad always owned a car.

427
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,244
Here, back then, owning a car...

428
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,287
But he worked.

429
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,539
It was his car.

430
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,501
It was old, ugly and noisy,
but it was his.

431
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,878
Sunday mornings,
he washed it.

432
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,589
Washed the hell out of it.

433
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,926
And after lunch...
Hop! Off we went.

434
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:22,137
Every Sunday! A tradition.

435
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,431
No vacations, but every Sunday,

436
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,932
come shine or rain...

437
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,144
No! "Come rain or shine,
hell or high water."

438
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,731
Rain or shine, hell or high water.
You're right!

439
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:37,986
He had expressions like that
for every situation in life.

440
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,654
- He did?
- Yes.

441
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,116
"He did?" You shitting me?
You know all this!

442
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,201
Why tell stories we already know?

443
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,829
We do that in life,
stop being so stiff!

444
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:51,499
We recall and relive
the things we love.

445
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:55,211
I know she knows,
but I enjoy telling her again.

446
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,797
That's why we remember! For me!

447
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,090
Happy?

448
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,801
If you hate it so much,
cover your ears,

449
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:05,430
beat it and stop cheesing us off!

450
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,057
Cheese off?

451
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,977
Damn right! Means piss off!
Your brother's specialty.

452
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:16,733
So, the first Sunday in May,
or after March 8th...

453
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:18,568
My birthday, of course.

454
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,406
Or if the 8th was a Sunday
we hit the jackpot!

455
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:28,828
That was the real deal.
We'd drive an hour or two.

456
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,208
Fields, forests, castles,
vineyards, sometimes.

457
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:38,129
We'd stroll, eat on the grass,
take a nap...

458
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,090
On the plaid blanket.

459
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:43,051
Tuna salad, rice,
mayo, deviled eggs.

460
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:45,553
Antoine still loves
that salad, right?

461
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,806
Always says "Make your salad!"

462
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,308
He's sulking.

463
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,769
And then, uh...

464
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:57,774
Night came, and we'd be weary
from the drive,

465
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:01,945
and we'd walk in and say,
"Home, sweet home!"

466
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,783
Proof that all those
fancy trips to the beach,

467
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,953
airports, planes,
sassy attendants...

468
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,039
Anyway...

469
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,962
Then, well,
the boys got older and...

470
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,134
Well, Suzanne arrived!

471
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:28,680
The boys had their bikes,
went their separate ways.

472
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,558
And we stopped
the Sunday outings, `cause,

473
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,811
with only Suzanne,
it wasn't worth it.

474
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,273
Our fault, again.

475
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,358
Or mine, Antoine.

476
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:43,319
Heavens!

477
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,281
Suzanne, I don't believe it!

478
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,700
Yeah, drop it, Mom!

479
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:49,868
But...

480
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,828
I'm gonna kill myself!

481
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,331
That's our day?
Dumb memories and shit music?

482
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,168
- Fucking hell!
- It's our song, Suzanne.

483
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,504
- Drop it, Mom! Jeez!
- Our aerobics song!

484
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:04,507
- We're taking off.
- Suzanne, come!

485
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,134
You outta your mind?

486
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,970
You do aerobics?

487
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,139
Piss your pants!

488
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,350
I adore this song.
Suzanne, come!

489
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,143
I'm obsessed,
it's a real find!

490
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,062
Everybody found it, Mom!

491
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:20,357
- You just live in a parallel world.
- I googled it.

492
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,318
Translation said it's about
Picasso being in love,

493
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,072
or Picasso...
Anyway, it wasn't clear.

494
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,948
Come on, now!

495
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,241
No!

496
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,370
Make it a perfect day,
impress your brother!

497
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,997
Don't embarrass her!

498
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:39,042
Suzanne, please!

499
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:42,087
Suzanne, come on!

500
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,838
Come show them!

501
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,217
All your moves are wrong,
it's a disaster.

502
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,593
Well then come.

503
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:52,055
Show your poor old mom how to do it.

504
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,015
Alright, one, two...

505
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,605
God, Mom, you're terrible!

506
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,358
Looks like you're having a stroke.

507
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,739
Mom, focus instead of
hitting on the teacher!

508
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,200
In his dreams, maybe!

509
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,029
Yes?

510
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,325
Where are you,
why does it say unknown?

511
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,371
Oh, right.

512
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,585
Not yet, no.

513
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,927
I've been here for an hour,
I can't just...

514
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,972
shove it in their face.

515
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,228
It was tough with my sister.

516
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,024
I don't know her.

517
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,069
She's so pretty.

518
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,657
And so much older. It's nuts.
The others too.

519
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,827
And I am too, of course.
I don't see myself.

520
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:10,170
I don't know, after lunch maybe.

521
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,631
Over coffee and dessert.
I don't know.

522
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,509
When the moment is right.

523
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,391
I don't think I'll stay
after telling them.

524
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't know how they'll react.

525
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,815
Maybe they won't even cry.

526
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:35,653
Listen, this isn't the time.

527
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,490
I'll call you later.

528
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,075
Yeah.

529
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,037
I'm scared.

530
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,331
I'm scared of them.

531
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,959
Okay. Alright.

532
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,587
Me too. Ciao.

533
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:04,849
Sorry.

534
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,727
Sorry.

535
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,188
No, it's... Excuse me, sorry.

536
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,070
Are you alright?

537
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,322
- Uh... me?
- Yes, you.

538
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,533
Yes. Why?

539
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,785
I don't know.

540
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:26,871
You haven't said much since earlier.

541
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,043
No, that's just...

542
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,045
That's me.

543
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,466
I'm fine.

544
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,095
What do you want me to say?

545
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,097
Nothing.

546
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,186
I'm sorry about earlier, in there.

547
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,982
Antoine saying your kids
don't interest me.

548
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,819
No idea why he said that.

549
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:01,698
He loves to think
I'm not interested.

550
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,242
I assume he must've...

551
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,911
tried to turn you against me.

552
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,419
Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

553
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,505
I'd already forgotten about it.

554
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,050
I...

555
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,803
I'm used to it.

556
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,854
But why would you say...

557
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:37,025
that he tried to turn me
against you?

558
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,320
Just a thought.

559
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,197
I know Antoine.

560
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,908
You do?

561
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,414
Sorry, I'm...

562
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:55,377
It's weird you'd say that, 'cause...

563
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,003
he...

564
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,548
doesn't talk about you...

565
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,217
often...

566
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,012
Almost never, actually.

567
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,265
And when he does...

568
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,352
No.

569
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:19,025
I didn't mean to judge.
You're right.

570
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,906
He thinks that...

571
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,786
you don't care about his life.

572
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:34,916
Or him, me, the kids,
his job and all.

573
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,796
D'you know what he does?
For a living?

574
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,881
Do you know his...

575
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,885
I'm not criticizing...

576
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:48,805
Really, don't take it as...

577
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,183
- I'm not criticizing.
- No.

578
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:53,560
But...

579
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,271
do you know his job?

580
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,698
He makes tools.

581
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,076
In a small shop, not from here.

582
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,831
And, even myself, I don't...

583
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:17,542
know, exactly.

584
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,171
But anyway, he...

585
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,799
thinks his life
doesn't interest you.

586
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,927
So, he... Well, that is...

587
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,681
He believes, I think,

588
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:34,809
that what he does, uh...

589
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,732
is... unlikely to interest you.

590
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:48,239
And I think he probably isn't...
entirely mistaken.

591
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,787
Unless I'm wrong.
I might be wrong.

592
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,291
Maybe you are.

593
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,422
But today I was hoping...

594
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,299
No, no, no.

595
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,550
Wait...

596
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,469
Don't tell me.

597
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,429
Alright? Please.

598
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:15,517
I'd prefer you to tell him.

599
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,768
Alright.

600
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,437
If you tell me,

601
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,567
it won't change anything.
It isn't my role. Alright?

602
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,905
I wasn't actually
saying anything, Catherine.

603
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,824
- We're talking.
- Yes, but...

604
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:34,411
I'm not good at talking.
And they...

605
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,206
They're...

606
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,208
waiting for this.

607
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,836
- See you in a bit?
- Yes.

608
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,755
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

609
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:39,976
Louis.

610
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:41,269
C'mere!

611
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:17,806
Shut the door.
Antoine will see me.

612
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,979
He'll rag on me, again.
I'm at 3 per day, max, so...

613
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,315
I quit quitting.
I felt too dumb.

614
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,697
Hanging in there?

615
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,616
Yeah, I'm fine.

616
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,621
Three words.

617
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:43,456
Same old, right.

618
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,167
Always these...

619
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:48,461
two or three-word answers.

620
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,506
Like on your postcards.

621
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,927
Or that little smile.

622
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,262
Stop it.

623
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,101
Did they talk to you?

624
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,312
Suzanne just did, right?

625
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:09,691
They have things to say, of course.

626
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:13,111
They'll make the most of it.

627
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:17,699
They don't know when
they'll have another chance.

628
00:44:22,662 --> 00:44:23,913
Suzanne...

629
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,918
She's clueless, poor girl.

630
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,921
She doesn't know you.
Doesn't know much.

631
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,924
She's pictured you
from what she's heard.

632
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,385
And Antoine...

633
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:41,431
You know him.
"My way, or no way."

634
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,269
Problem is...

635
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:49,189
Well...

636
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:52,567
We're afraid of time.

637
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,028
The time you give us.

638
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,448
And I don't...

639
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:02,410
pretend to think
you'll stay long...

640
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,788
And that's fine.

641
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,750
But now you're here.

642
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:10,960
So...

643
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,338
Forgive them.

644
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,841
Forgive, because...
they'll be...

645
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:18,843
What's the word?

646
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:22,389
Abrupt?

647
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,432
Or clumsy.

648
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,851
It doesn't matter.

649
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:30,230
God, I can see them!

650
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:35,735
Asking things, and you...
Three words, a little smile...

651
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,612
You being you.

652
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,073
Poor them.

653
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:43,827
What if I don't only
have words to answer?

654
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,121
What if I have words to say?

655
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,039
Lucky us!

656
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,625
I'm kidding.

657
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,799
But it won't be enough.

658
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:01,928
For Suzanne, until next time.

659
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,972
I won't even ask when.

660
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,144
And Antoine, well...

661
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,772
He'll be more bitter about you,

662
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:16,192
even more lost.

663
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:21,906
Suzanne wants to leave.
She told you.

664
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:27,829
Go and live her life some place.
Far away, of course.

665
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:33,668
Antoine... he'd like more freedom.

666
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:36,171
I can feel it.

667
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:39,257
Not to owe anything.

668
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,177
To whom?
Everyone, I guess.

669
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:46,389
Me, above all.
And Suzanne, too.

670
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,478
They want to confide this
in you, Louis!

671
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,939
They need your approval.

672
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:59,694
You never took responsibility,
and I'm not asking you to.

673
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:01,363
I'm not the eldest, Martine.

674
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,615
I'm not the surrogate father...

675
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:05,367
Cut the crap, Louis!

676
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:09,913
Don't play dumb.
Use your head a bit.

677
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:12,457
Age has nothing to do with it.

678
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,418
Doesn't make you
the man of the house.

679
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,046
I was, as a child!

680
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:21,883
Status, salary, luck,

681
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,135
beauty, gifts, courage!

682
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:27,180
The things you're born with,
or without!

683
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,767
Should I keep going?

684
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,435
Who's the writer, here?

685
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:41,152
I know you won't come back.

686
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:50,453
Encourage them.

687
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:52,664
No one ever did.

688
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,293
I did, but I don't count,
my words don't matter.

689
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,629
Encourage them, Louis.

690
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:04,134
Give them your permission
to do this, or that.

691
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:09,305
Tell Suzanne, even if it's just
hot air, an empty promise,

692
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:14,102
"Suzanne, why don't you
come visit me?"

693
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,188
Tell her she can.

694
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:19,983
That she has the right.

695
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:32,620
You're still in the homo ghetto?

696
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:37,500
Yes or no?

697
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:40,045
No. I've moved.

698
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,088
What?

699
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:45,175
I still write there, dummy!

700
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:47,844
Someone picks up the mail for me.

701
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,680
Don't worry. I like it that way.

702
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:02,400
You like your mother not knowing
where you live?

703
00:49:03,943 --> 00:49:05,570
Holy shit.

704
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:09,074
That's funny.

705
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:10,700
I mean...

706
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:13,370
You're funny.

707
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:18,333
You still don't get it.

708
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:22,379
Think we don't love you?

709
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,047
Or understand you?

710
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,095
You're right.

711
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:32,430
I don't understand you.

712
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:36,017
But I love you.

713
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,104
I love you.

714
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:49,322
No one will take that away from me.

715
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:58,873
Write that one down,
for one of your plays.

716
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,969
Why are you here?

717
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,974
You can tell your mother.

718
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,437
You thought, "Heck!
It's been 12 years!

719
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:22,439
Let's grab a bite on the patio!"

720
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,955
Well, you look great, I'm glad.

721
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,500
Damn it!

722
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,295
Where's that thingy?

723
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,590
How old are you now?

724
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,924
Me?

725
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:51,593
No, the watering can!

726
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:55,472
Saint-Anthony came around.

727
00:50:57,515 --> 00:51:00,935
For the kisses, for Antoine,
for the food,

728
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,480
and for me.

729
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,608
Here.

730
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,987
Tell me if I should get it.
As a Christmas gift.

731
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:13,156
To me, from me.

732
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:29,107
I'm 34.

733
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,610
Oh, my...

734
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,994
It's been 34 years
for me too, then.

735
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:43,872
Is that a long time?

736
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,041
I can't tell anymore.

737
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,090
Look, just do what
you have to do, Louis.

738
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:02,932
Gosh, that's crazy.

739
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:09,397
I just...

740
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,109
I wish I could take a photo,
you've got...

741
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:17,822
your father's eyes,
right here, right now.

742
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:26,664
Well, anywho...

743
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:30,919
There's no need for tears
or declarations today.

744
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:33,588
I was saying that...

745
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,049
for the future.

746
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,842
Gotta think about it!

747
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:50,522
But the day should end
as it started,

748
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:53,525
without obligations,
without intention.

749
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:57,946
And well, quite simply...
Just... well.

750
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:07,622
Of course.

751
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,960
That idiot called her hens Denise.

752
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:14,254
She's mentally challenged.

753
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:16,297
I walk in the hen house,

754
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:18,550
hens running everywhere.

755
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:21,720
I go "Look at your cute hens!"

756
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:25,348
"What did you name 'em?"
"I named 'em Denise!"

757
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:29,394
So I go "That's pretty.
Which one is Denise?"

758
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:32,105
She goes "They're all named Denise!"

759
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,526
I called all of them Denise.

760
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:44,325
Will I go to hell
if I love that story?

761
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,994
Why hell?

762
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:49,372
Well, she's got Down's syndrome.

763
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,208
Whatever syndrome,
a hell of a big one.

764
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,754
Down, Up, Wide... She's got it.

765
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,716
Someone could've told her,,
"Don't call them all Denise."

766
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,594
I don't like it much.

767
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:05,597
I don't like it...

768
00:55:05,638 --> 00:55:08,391
I find it mean,
and unseemly.

769
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,727
It's funny, c'mon!

770
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:16,900
St. Catherine's among us.

771
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,735
- You alright?
- Yeah.

772
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:20,320
Why?

773
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:22,072
I dunno. You wanna...

774
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:24,783
Do something else,
go for a walk, or...

775
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,495
- play games.
- You and your fucking games.

776
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:30,330
Get off my friggin' back!

777
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,874
I don't know about games but,

778
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,168
actually, I would've loved...

779
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:41,800
- Well...
- What? The old house?

780
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:43,885
- Yes.
- What?

781
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:46,513
He wants to see
the old house.

782
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:49,057
I don't mind.
I can drive you.

783
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:52,310
Why d'you wanna go there?
Are you daft?

784
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,188
He's not daft, let him be.

785
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,774
- You're daft!
- You're stupid!

786
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:01,695
But Louis, really,
why d'you want to go there?

787
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,115
Did you forget something
in your room?

788
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:08,743
No.

789
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,580
I don't know, I just do.

790
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,458
I'm curious to...

791
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:18,294
see the surroundings,

792
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:21,339
how they've evolved...

793
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:24,676
How time has modified or...

794
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:26,928
wrecked them.

795
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:31,725
It's not even for sale.
You can't visit it.

796
00:56:31,766 --> 00:56:34,978
I drove by last week, and...

797
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,313
it's completely abandoned.

798
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:42,485
You wanna go back to that shithole,

799
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:47,824
to see how time has wrecked,
modified it.

800
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:51,494
Is that the most la-di-da
shit plan you got?

801
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:52,662
Antoine.

802
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:56,624
I meant no offense but...

803
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,126
Of course not.

804
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:01,421
It took us 20 years
to get outta there,

805
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:05,842
and you want to go see
if the wind has wafted

806
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:09,637
the autumn leaves
onto the rusted roof?

807
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,140
What the fuck? Who cares?

808
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:15,935
Leave him alone, he just
wants to go for a ride.

809
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:17,395
I mean...

810
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:21,358
I'll come with you,
Louis, if you want.

811
00:57:21,399 --> 00:57:22,984
Doesn't matter.

812
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,695
- It was a bad idea.
- No shit!

813
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:29,282
I'll beat off in Auschwitz,
jizz out a poem!

814
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,659
Antoine! Bad taste!

815
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:33,078
Alrighty, Louis!

816
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:37,665
Give us some gossip!

817
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,292
Let's dish!

818
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:41,961
I don't know any.

819
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:44,130
Well, make it up!

820
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,966
You know, showbiz gossip!

821
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:50,762
Who screwed who, who was screwed.

822
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:52,722
Your fingers stink.
You smoked?

823
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:53,807
Wine, Louis?

824
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:55,642
- No thanks.
- You smoked.

825
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:00,605
I don't know any gossip.
I don't go out.

826
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:07,237
Coffee, Mr. Louis?
I was going to make a pot.

827
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:10,782
What century d'you
Misses and Misters live in?

828
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,410
What's it to you, dumbass?

829
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:16,079
For fuck's sake,
am I talking to you?

830
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,665
Stop fucking picking on me,

831
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:20,834
telling me to shut up.

832
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,086
Telling me I'm stupid.

833
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,046
Stay the fuck outta this.

834
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,549
Kids, no. Not this.

835
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,051
Do you hear that?
What's that tone?

836
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:32,345
It's well deserved.

837
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,228
- You never talk to me like that.
- I'm starting!

838
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,606
That's my tone when
you fucking annoy me!

839
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,655
Never mind, I got it.

840
00:58:50,947 --> 00:58:53,742
That's too cute!
You're a cutie pie...

841
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,368
Aren't you?

842
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:00,081
Wanna look cool in front of
your bro? 'Cause he's here?

843
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,792
This is for you, Louis.

844
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,379
Is it working?
Are you impressed, Loulou?

845
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,465
Rou-lou-cou-lou-lou!

846
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:11,926
Loulou! Yoohoo!

847
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:17,223
This is a load of bullshit.
It's bullshit. Mom!

848
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:19,142
Suzanne, the neighbors!

849
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,146
You make no sense!

850
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:25,440
This isn't about Louis!

851
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:29,486
Why d'you always humiliate me?
Humiliate everyone!

852
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:32,113
This day fucking sucks!

853
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:34,949
Suzanne, come back!

854
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:37,786
Gosh, and you just let her go!

855
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,454
She'll be back.

856
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:43,375
Lord. Such a shame.

857
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:51,299
Catherine, I'd fancy
a cup of coffee.

858
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,844
"Catherine, I'd fancy
a cup of coffee."

859
00:59:54,886 --> 00:59:55,929
Antoine.

860
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,474
What? Antoine, Antoine!
Yes, Antoine! What?

861
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:01,685
That's my goddamn name, yeah!

862
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:04,688
All day long!
Fucking pain in the ass!

863
01:00:13,113 --> 01:00:14,114
Fine.

864
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:17,117
I'll work on my timing!

865
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:21,037
I was about to say
it's lovely being together.

866
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:26,334
Later, maybe.

867
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,139
Excuse me, Catherine.

868
01:00:39,514 --> 01:00:40,932
No worries.

869
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:03,705
We're not complete boors.
What's wrong with you?

870
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,624
Why are you being so hostile?

871
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:34,833
Louis?

872
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:39,129
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

873
01:04:40,588 --> 01:04:43,717
I'm... Martine's asking for you.

874
01:04:43,758 --> 01:04:47,846
Dessert will be ready in 30 or 40.
Would that be alright?

875
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:49,848
I'll be right up.

876
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:51,391
Alright.

877
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,309
Sorry.

878
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:17,542
How much time?

879
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:37,437
How much time what?

880
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,652
How much time...

881
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,742
Will you, um...

882
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:55,663
Antoine's alone upstairs and...

883
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:59,042
You could talk to him.

884
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:07,425
I'm coming.

885
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:44,587
So, um...

886
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:47,215
I need a smoke.

887
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:49,843
Gotta buy smokes.

888
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:52,387
Well, you can... Never mind.

889
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:54,389
Yeah, I know.

890
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:57,851
Don't rat out Mom,
I hate her fancy cigs.

891
01:06:57,892 --> 01:07:00,228
I never smoke but when I smoke...

892
01:07:00,645 --> 01:07:01,980
I smoke.

893
01:07:03,898 --> 01:07:06,609
- And you need to smoke, right now.
- Mm-hmm.

894
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:13,450
You coming? If you want,
in the car, we could...

895
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,118
What?

896
01:07:15,618 --> 01:07:19,456
- Talk?
- No. I mean... I guess, yeah.

897
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:22,834
Yeah.

898
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,421
- I need some fresh air.
- Well, then.

899
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:28,715
Done.

900
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:35,180
I actually flew in early.
Traveled overnight.

901
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:39,059
I wanted to see the sunrise
at the airport,

902
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,478
eat at the small café.

903
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:47,233
Thought I'd come
for breakfast, but...

904
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:51,363
I waited for the proper moment.

905
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,533
You're telling me this... because?

906
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,536
What should I say?
Anything specific?

907
01:07:58,578 --> 01:08:02,665
No. I don't know,
just wanted you to know.

908
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,584
It's not important.

909
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:08,880
I told you 'cause it's true.
I wanted to tell you.

910
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:11,716
Listen...

911
01:08:11,758 --> 01:08:13,385
Don't start, okay?

912
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:22,477
Don't start what?

913
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:24,437
This, Louis. This.

914
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,191
Don't smother me
with airport stories...

915
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:32,070
Should've come earlier, later...
I drown in that crap.

916
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,321
Not in the mood.

917
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:42,288
So you traveled last night?
How was it?

918
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,918
Come on!

919
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:50,839
It went fine, I guess.
It's a short trip.

920
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:54,718
You guys think I live on
another planet.

921
01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:57,721
Coming here's not
the end of the world.

922
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:00,849
But if you don't want to talk,
it's fine.

923
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,308
Please!

924
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:04,769
I'm listening, alright?

925
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:07,772
Go on, tell me.

926
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:10,400
I want you to. Come on!

927
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:13,319
I want to know.
The airport, the café.

928
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:15,989
The heat's driving us nuts, okay?

929
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:18,324
No, you're right.
It's irrelevant.

930
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,038
I just thought that...
I don't know.

931
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:28,168
You'd be happy... or glad.
To know that, this morning

932
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:31,796
I was at the airport café.
Remember the café?

933
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:33,631
Waiting.

934
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,345
I couldn't show up at dawn
and scare them.

935
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:43,683
I can see Suzanne
on the porch, with a shotgun.

936
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:46,978
She's such a pothead.

937
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:51,316
She'd grab it upside down,
blow a hole in her head!

938
01:09:53,526 --> 01:09:54,986
You done?

939
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,989
I was waiting,
thus I said to myself...

940
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:59,115
Thus?

941
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:00,283
Thus!

942
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:01,826
Thus!

943
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:04,704
- Thus...
- I was waiting, and...

944
01:10:04,996 --> 01:10:08,667
I thought I'd tell you about this.

945
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,086
About being there, doing nothing.

946
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,213
Thought you'd get it.

947
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:17,509
So I'm telling you.
Only you, not them.

948
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:22,514
They'd be upset that we could've
spent more time together.

949
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,976
Hanging out there felt good.

950
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:30,355
- You know how...
- See, that's just... That's it!

951
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:34,192
This is exactly what I meant. This.

952
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:38,321
That crap I have to listen to.
What's true, what's not...

953
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:40,573
I knew it, I'm not dumb.

954
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,829
I didn't forget that.

955
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,124
Your endless stories,
and words, words, words,

956
01:10:49,165 --> 01:10:52,836
to confuse us, and fuck us over!

957
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:56,172
You get away with it,
and I'm lost!

958
01:10:57,215 --> 01:11:01,386
- You're sick, Antoine.
- I'm sick now? No, you're sick!

959
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:05,640
I know your little story!
The airport, the café...

960
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:09,269
And what else? All those details...

961
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:14,774
A dude cooking fries, your clothes
soaking up the smell of grease...

962
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:19,070
And you were alone, all alone
in the airport, weren't you?

963
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:21,865
You could hear a pin drop.

964
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:25,994
So, you're there.
Reading your paper?

965
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:28,121
I bet you are!

966
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,123
Or some money magazine,

967
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:33,043
with the shiny paper
and the big red letters...

968
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:44,387
And I don't know either
why you came, Louis.

969
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:47,474
No one knows. No one understands.

970
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:50,226
And you hate that,
'cause if we knew...

971
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,687
Oh, it'd be easy!

972
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:56,900
You'd have taken off already,
or wouldn't have come!

973
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,986
But you think that matters?

974
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:05,033
Think airports, cafés,
magazines matter to me?

975
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:09,162
You're wrong, buddy!
It doesn't matter at all!

976
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:11,664
It doesn't matter anymore!

977
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,878
That's not what you thought
at the airport.

978
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,464
Or you weren't going to tell me.

979
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:23,677
You're saying that to fill
the void between us.

980
01:12:24,302 --> 01:12:27,931
Bam, I'm here!
So you're making shit up.

981
01:12:27,972 --> 01:12:31,267
You made all that up
to talk to me?

982
01:12:31,309 --> 01:12:34,312
So I'd feel special.

983
01:12:34,813 --> 01:12:36,272
Special?

984
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,777
To know you could've
spent more time with us?

985
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:45,490
You didn't think that.
We're strangers.

986
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:47,701
Strangers share nothing.

987
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:51,287
We're strangers, Louis.
Haven't we always been?

988
01:12:51,996 --> 01:12:54,916
You thought "I'll take that angle,

989
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,168
so I can handle him."

990
01:12:58,169 --> 01:12:59,254
You thought...

991
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:04,009
"I've studied, lived, written...
I can handle him."

992
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,803
Funny. People say that of me...

993
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:09,264
He's hard to handle.

994
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:12,017
"Handle Antoine with kid gloves!"

995
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:15,562
Like an animal in a cage.

996
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:18,106
That you pet. And kill.

997
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:20,859
That's what you did
at the airport, Louis.

998
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:26,197
You thought you had a technique
to grab me.

999
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:29,617
But I'm not in the mood.

1000
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:32,537
I'm not interested.

1001
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,791
What are you doing here?
I don't wanna know!

1002
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,918
I don't care.

1003
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,255
You're here, you're not.
That's your problem.

1004
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:46,843
You're home. You come,
you go, you stay. Fine.

1005
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:49,596
Not everything's so great
in your small life.

1006
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:52,182
- `Cause it is small.
- Antoine, slow down.

1007
01:13:52,223 --> 01:13:57,270
You were at the airport café,
thinking about sweet nothing!

1008
01:13:57,312 --> 01:14:00,065
The coffee's giving you the runs,

1009
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,317
you're thinking about no one!

1010
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:05,320
You're there,
living your fucking life,

1011
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:08,239
so get the fuck over it already!

1012
01:15:20,478 --> 01:15:21,855
- Antoine?
- No.

1013
01:15:22,355 --> 01:15:26,067
I don't wanna be here.
And listen to you. Or talk.

1014
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:29,612
I'm scared. You happy?

1015
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:37,120
You guys always have to
tell me everything.

1016
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:38,496
And I have to listen

1017
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:41,499
I hate listening. I hate talking.

1018
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:48,882
We think silent people
are good listeners.

1019
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:52,844
But I shut up so people
leave me alone.

1020
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:55,347
Do you get that?

1021
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,101
Do you?

1022
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,146
I do.

1023
01:16:04,647 --> 01:16:05,899
Amazing.

1024
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:14,908
By the way...

1025
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,827
Pierre died last week. Cancer.

1026
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:19,704
Pierre?

1027
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:21,581
Jolicoeur.

1028
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,377
Pierre Jolicoeur, your Pierre.

1029
01:16:34,135 --> 01:16:37,222
I better help with dessert
or they'll gimme hell.

1030
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:08,837
Antoine, is that you?

1031
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:12,966
Where is everyone?

1032
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:15,969
- What?
- Where are the others?

1033
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,303
I dunno.

1034
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:18,680
Here.

1035
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:20,515
Hold this while I...

1036
01:17:23,643 --> 01:17:26,396
<i>I think I heard someone come in.</i>

1037
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:30,734
<i>Shouldn't I go get everyone?
I think it was Antoine.</i>

1038
01:17:30,775 --> 01:17:33,028
<i>They'll come when they're ready.</i>

1039
01:17:33,069 --> 01:17:34,612
<i>Help me with this.</i>

1040
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:45,582
I don't get it.

1041
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:46,666
What?

1042
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:50,503
Think you're alone?

1043
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,509
You're handsome when you smile.

1044
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:05,143
You think we're alone?
Think Mom gets any of this?

1045
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,441
No one gets it.
Never did, never will.

1046
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,652
That's the beauty of it, right?

1047
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,947
<i>I think Antoine and Louis
had a fight.</i>

1048
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:19,574
Get outta here.

1049
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:23,661
Antoine!

1050
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:26,915
Yeah, coming!

1051
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:30,585
There was no drama...

1052
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:33,672
I was young, I can't remember,
but there was no drama...

1053
01:18:33,713 --> 01:18:36,424
tragic stuff, or betrayals,

1054
01:18:37,008 --> 01:18:38,343
or murders.

1055
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:41,680
Shit like that...
So he'd avoid us.

1056
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:42,972
He doesn't care.

1057
01:18:44,974 --> 01:18:47,519
<i>He doesn't feel the need for "us".</i>

1058
01:18:48,019 --> 01:18:49,396
<i>He wants to be far.</i>

1059
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:52,107
<i>He's almost farther
sitting on our couch.</i>

1060
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:54,067
He's the sad one.

1061
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:57,487
He missed all those years,
never saw you grow.

1062
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,864
And life went on,

1063
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:03,284
<i>as it does today, invariably.</i>

1064
01:19:03,326 --> 01:19:04,828
Just like in books.

1065
01:19:20,593 --> 01:19:23,847
<i>You're unhappy, but only
'cause it's convenient.</i>

1066
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:27,267
<i>- So choose to be happy.
- Easy to say.</i>

1067
01:19:27,308 --> 01:19:29,185
Anyway, it's almost over.

1068
01:19:29,227 --> 01:19:31,396
Really? Why?

1069
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,690
So...

1070
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:17,400
Yep!

1071
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:21,071
Appetizers, mains,
finger food... Nope.

1072
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:24,908
But desserts?
I'm just unbeatable.

1073
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:33,375
I...

1074
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,336
I've got something to tell you.

1075
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:38,254
Things, actually.

1076
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:44,928
I'll come back.

1077
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:47,013
And more often.

1078
01:20:49,307 --> 01:20:51,101
And write.

1079
01:20:52,352 --> 01:20:53,937
More often.

1080
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:56,731
Not just two
or three words.

1081
01:20:58,316 --> 01:20:59,943
Because...

1082
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:04,489
I regret it all.

1083
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:09,786
The time we've wasted.
The time I've wasted.

1084
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:18,044
Suzanne, if you want to visit,
you're welcome.

1085
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:21,631
For a weekend, or longer,
as you wish. We'll set it...

1086
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:28,471
And Antoine...

1087
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:30,640
If we had dinner,

1088
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:33,518
we could continue
the conversation we began,

1089
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,311
calmly.

1090
01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:37,522
When I'm back. Or you come.

1091
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:39,566
I can't. Too much work.

1092
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:41,359
A weekend?

1093
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:44,696
Just a weekend.

1094
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:46,364
Weekends are just as...

1095
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,159
Everyone can survive
a weekend, Antoine.

1096
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:54,247
You can. You have the right to.

1097
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:01,129
- You love the city.
- I love the city, now?

1098
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,344
You always did.

1099
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:45,131
Truth is, I have to go.

1100
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:52,722
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

1101
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:56,309
When all is well,
Antoine messes things up!

1102
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:58,436
Or are you tidying up?

1103
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,605
Don't hold your breath.

1104
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:04,567
What's wrong with you two?

1105
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:08,655
Are you drunk? Or high?
You guys got high?

1106
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,532
He's used to it.

1107
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:16,621
I'll drive you. No more cabs.

1108
01:23:17,038 --> 01:23:18,331
- What?
- Here.

1109
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:20,792
Already, now?

1110
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,836
Didn't he say that?

1111
01:23:22,877 --> 01:23:24,796
No.

1112
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,589
Louis, you're
staying tonight?

1113
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:28,883
My bad! In the car, didn't you say

1114
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:31,594
you had a meeting tonight?

1115
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:33,304
Tonight, right?

1116
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:34,848
Are you insane, Antoine?

1117
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,891
I'm not insane, I listen.

1118
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:40,478
He has to go,
so I kindly offer my help.

1119
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,481
Airport's 40 minutes
from your mom's, right?

1120
01:23:43,523 --> 01:23:45,358
That's right, honey.

1121
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,944
I'll grab the kids on my way.

1122
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:51,406
Excuse me, how long to
the airport? 40 minutes?

1123
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:52,741
When d'you last go?

1124
01:23:52,782 --> 01:23:54,451
You've never been!

1125
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:57,871
I go all the time, idiot,
Julien lives there!

1126
01:23:57,912 --> 01:24:00,081
So? What's the difference?

1127
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,542
He's not taking another cab!

1128
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,919
That isn't the point, Antoine!

1129
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:07,005
It is not the point!

1130
01:24:12,385 --> 01:24:14,220
Louis...

1131
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:15,513
You're going?

1132
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:19,100
I can drive you,
tonight, or tomorrow.

1133
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:20,226
You sleep over,

1134
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:22,020
we have breakfast.

1135
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:25,231
What's that meeting?

1136
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:27,275
Yes, what's that meeting?

1137
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,569
Is it that important?

1138
01:24:31,988 --> 01:24:33,490
It can't wait?

1139
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:38,286
On a Sunday, I mean...

1140
01:24:40,246 --> 01:24:42,248
You said it was crucial.

1141
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:43,792
Shut up!

1142
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,385
What's the problem, here?

1143
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,638
We were doing fine!

1144
01:24:57,514 --> 01:24:59,391
In a moment, pow!

1145
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:02,268
Why, Louis?

1146
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:04,688
Why?

1147
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:15,323
Because.

1148
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:18,660
I have a meeting.

1149
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:21,496
Thank you. Let's go.

1150
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:24,416
What the fuck, Antoine!
Don't touch him!

1151
01:25:37,929 --> 01:25:39,180
What's wrong?

1152
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:42,600
- Antoine, I'm fine!
- Just helping...

1153
01:25:42,642 --> 01:25:46,730
What the hell's going on!
This is pure madness!

1154
01:25:46,771 --> 01:25:49,399
No! He'll miss his plane.

1155
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:54,279
- We can at least kiss goodbye.
- Now! Kiss kiss, chop chop!

1156
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,698
Only two seconds ago we were...

1157
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,450
eating nicely,

1158
01:25:58,491 --> 01:26:00,994
speaking happily, sharing a moment

1159
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:02,954
and you just act up,

1160
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:05,623
breaking, spoiling
every bit of it!

1161
01:26:05,665 --> 01:26:07,500
I'm warning you,

1162
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:08,918
I won't forget this.

1163
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,921
Your brother was trying...
I don't get it.

1164
01:26:11,963 --> 01:26:13,882
- It's okay, Mom.
- Kissy, kissy, come on!

1165
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:15,300
- Antoine...
- Shut up!

1166
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:18,970
Jesus! I'll drive him!
Louis, let me take you!

1167
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,472
Suzanne, stop!

1168
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:22,265
I'm driving him!

1169
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:26,019
- We can't drive like a...
- Like what? Say it!

1170
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:30,398
I'm driving him! The end!
I'll be back in an hour.

1171
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,400
- You're so despicable!
- Me?

1172
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:35,570
You don't hear yourself!
See yourself!

1173
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:38,615
How you rush him!
How you talk to me!

1174
01:26:38,656 --> 01:26:40,200
And your wife!

1175
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:43,370
You...

1176
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:45,538
you little piece of shit.

1177
01:26:46,706 --> 01:26:50,126
- Come on, defend me!
- Of course she will!

1178
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,795
Suzanne?

1179
01:26:53,004 --> 01:26:54,589
I don't get it.

1180
01:26:56,132 --> 01:26:57,717
So I'll come visit?

1181
01:27:05,141 --> 01:27:06,601
Let's go, Louis.

1182
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:08,353
Louis!

1183
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:12,816
See you soon.

1184
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:16,194
Let him go, you fucking psycho!

1185
01:27:16,236 --> 01:27:17,529
What did I do?

1186
01:27:17,987 --> 01:27:19,489
What you do is,

1187
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:23,910
you ruin our fucking lives
and our day with Louis

1188
01:27:23,952 --> 01:27:25,787
with your brutality!

1189
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:28,039
Brutality? My... Me?

1190
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:30,000
Yes, you!

1191
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:32,627
- Antoine.
- Stop, I'm fine!

1192
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:35,380
Calm down.
It's okay, just...

1193
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:38,216
Calm us... Calm yourself.

1194
01:27:38,925 --> 01:27:40,635
Don't be so brutal.

1195
01:27:40,677 --> 01:27:43,888
Who's brutal? I'm trying to help!

1196
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,141
You weren't brutal,
it's a misunder...

1197
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:49,394
- You! Goodness incarnate...
- Brutal and stupid!

1198
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:56,609
You understand shit!
You know shit!

1199
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:58,528
So shut your mouth, bitch!

1200
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:02,365
Don't ever talk to
your sister like that!

1201
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:05,702
Fine! Y'know what?
You figure it out.

1202
01:28:05,744 --> 01:28:08,413
I screwed up, as usual.

1203
01:28:08,455 --> 01:28:11,124
So go for it, Louis.
Go for it!

1204
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:12,417
Go!

1205
01:28:15,545 --> 01:28:19,966
He said "I must go."
Those very words!

1206
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:23,762
Is it my fucking fault again?

1207
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:25,138
Is it?

1208
01:28:26,556 --> 01:28:30,852
You guys think I'm an idiot!
And I've had it!

1209
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:34,314
There was nothing bad
in what I did!

1210
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:35,565
Let's go.

1211
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:43,365
It's not fair! You treat me
like I'm a circus freak!

1212
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,284
It's not fair.

1213
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:51,498
You've no right! You can't always
win! You can't do that to me!

1214
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,543
Don't cry, Antoine...

1215
01:28:55,585 --> 01:28:56,670
I'll kill you!

1216
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:58,004
Antoine, no!

1217
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:05,595
Don't touch him, Louis.

1218
01:29:07,472 --> 01:29:09,265
Come. Don't.

1219
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:12,018
Stop it. Get away from him.

1220
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:17,732
Antoine, it's over.

1221
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:20,318
Come.

1222
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:27,367
It's over.

1223
01:29:56,396 --> 01:29:58,982
We'll be better prepared
next time.

1224
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:46,001
in loving memory of François Barbeau
