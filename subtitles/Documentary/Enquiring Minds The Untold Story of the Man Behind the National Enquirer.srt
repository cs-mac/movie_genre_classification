1
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:28,430
- Ah who's this?
- You're cute.

2
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:31,407
<i>Just look at him.</i>

3
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:36,226
<i>Go on inside.</i>

4
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:37,907
<i>Oh dear.</i>

5
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,461
This guy doesn't seem to get it.

6
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,203
Bow!

7
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:05,228
<i>Where are you trying to sit
without properly greeting us?</i>

8
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,590
That's what he's trying to
get at right now.

9
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:18,232
How do I get initiated here?

10
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:24,076
Shall I sing?
Or...

11
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,097
should I get hit a few times?

12
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:33,837
Oh boy...

13
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,442
Hey.

14
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:40,601
<i>I hear you're in here
for attempted murder.</i>

15
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,511
You crazy nut.

16
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:45,742
Don't waste your strength because
I went through a lot to get you in here.

17
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,824
First, I'm going to explain the situation
to you, so listen up.

18
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:56,443
The man you messed with in jail...

19
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,570
He's our Boss.

20
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:03,071
He's on a completely different level
from scum like you.

21
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,057
That man bled from his nose
because of you, Attempted Murder.

22
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:12,276
<i>The news about it
has already spread everywhere.</i>

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,485
Even within this prison, there are
a dozen gangs who know you've come.

24
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:23,683
Hey.

25
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:34,468
We can't show them that
you can walk with both legs.

26
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,306
Our Boss has a reputation to uphold.
Is that so or not?

27
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:42,257
Will it do if I just apologize?

28
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:44,743
If I go to the Boss and...

29
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:46,036
Hey, you!

30
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:52,860
Ah, you mannerless bastard.
Hey, get up.

31
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,706
Who's your Boss?

32
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,986
Let's talk about it.

33
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,468
I'll do what you say.
If we just talk...

34
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,416
Get up.

35
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:19,836
Bastard.

36
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:28,202
Hey, does it hurt?

37
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:37,156
Do you see the sweat on
the sole of my foot? The sweat?

38
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:42,973
I sweated... to make sure
that you were in this room.

39
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,789
- How long have you got?
- 3 years and 6 months, sir.

40
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,754
I still have 8 years left.

41
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:55,220
We've got plenty of time.

42
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,004
Oh boy, oh boy.

43
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:19,021
Oh boy...
Someone come help!

44
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,032
<i>Call them.</i>

45
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,724
Officer, that prisoner is hurting himself.

46
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,580
He keeps banging his head on the wall
and saying he's going to die.

47
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:39,130
Officers, thank you very much.

48
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,328
He only came in here
to inflict harm on himself.

49
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,187
He should be given something refreshing.

50
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,407
Welcome!

51
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:31,585
Why did he call you out?

52
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,575
Is he going to give us something?

53
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:37,010
- Welcome!
- Yeah.

54
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,280
Danny!

55
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:43,578
Danny, you're mean!
You didn't call for me last time, right?

56
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:48,154
- You were too expensive.
- Danny, stay the night tonight.

57
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm so tired, huh?

58
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,889
Isn't it written on my face?
That I'm a sucker?

59
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,685
- Suck me dry.
- Danny.

60
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,446
Do Woo, this girl wants me
to stay the night.

61
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:02,207
You have Yeon Hee.
How many are coming today?

62
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,295
Five.

63
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,770
Then should I send in nine more?

64
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,978
Yes. Have this girl and that girl
with Director Oh...

65
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,719
Executive Director Chae.

66
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,789
Are you by chance gay?

67
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,990
This and this.

68
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:21,386
No matter how much my girls flirt with you,
I hear that you don't even look at them.

69
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,619
Don't try to take them away
in the middle of our meeting.

70
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,663
You want me to pretend
that I don't know anything?

71
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,614
I like to gossip...

72
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:43,990
If you're afraid, you can prove it to me.

73
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,723
Please take extra care
of our room tonight.

74
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:54,844
We have important matters to discuss,
so ask the band to come in an hour later.

75
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:03,870
<i>- Did you see it last time?
- I saw a little.</i>

76
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:09,018
I heard that Do Woo's treating tonight.
What's the occasion?

77
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,971
<i>Did that old man give you money?</i>

78
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,946
Would that old man give him money?

79
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,573
It's probably money he earned
from a part-time job.

80
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:21,101
Stop trying to tiptoe around it
and tell us.

81
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,502
<i>It's something that
we're going to be reluctant about, right?</i>

82
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,701
I need some money.

83
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,895
Money?
You need some too, right?

84
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,945
<i>Yeah.
A lot.</i>

85
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:40,358
Why is my life like this? There are
only guys like this guy around me.

86
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,723
<i>You in trouble?
How much?</i>

87
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,264
For now...
I need five.

88
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:54,258
- He said five.
- Five billion won is a lot.

89
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:59,286
Hey, even if we drank five billion won
in this room every year...

90
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:03,189
It would take ten years.
And we could have ten ladies with us.

91
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,842
We could have five companies
that went bankrupt.

92
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,423
Doesn't your father
have a lot of cash, Do Woo?

93
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,448
His father?
A measly few hundred in annual revenue?

94
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:19,251
If a construction company revenued
a few hundred a year...

95
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,687
<i>Can it build about two apartment buildings?</i>

96
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,817
What a pathetic kid.
Hey, Yeon Hee.

97
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,614
- Yeah, Danny.
- Pour me a drink.

98
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:27,960
Okay.

99
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,327
Chae Do Woo.
Might as well come out with it.

100
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:33,059
I heard a rumor that
you messed with Byukjaewon.

101
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,533
<i>- It's about that, right?
- What's Byukjaewon?</i>

102
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,503
You don't know? It's that company
that sells tofu and dumplings.

103
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,534
Because of the dumpling scandal,
their stock price fell.

104
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,139
I heard there was someone who shook it up.
Was it you, Do Woo?

105
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,755
What's with this childish act?
Tofu and dumplings?

106
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,103
It's pretty big.
Its revenue is in the tens of billions.

107
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,989
Everything's been planned out.
I just need to hit it a couple more times.

108
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,515
You bastard.
So you're going to take over a company...

109
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:08,187
and you were thinking of
giving us the interest?

110
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:13,971
Since it's risky,
I'll take in the risk first...

111
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,497
Drink.

112
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,392
- How many shots is this?
- Thirteen.

113
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:21,449
These thirteen...
drink them all.

114
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:25,179
If he drinks all thirteen,
he'll die.

115
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:28,522
My taste for liquor is disappearing
because of this bastard.

116
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,552
You're not going to drink it?

117
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,441
I need the 5 billion Won by next Friday.

118
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,941
Hearing your voice annoys me.

119
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:52,980
So drink...
and shut up.

120
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,874
Do Woo might be annoying
but his IQ is 180.

121
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,155
We should listen to his plan first.

122
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:21,379
Baby, that 180-IQ Man's glass is empty.

123
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,676
<i>What are you doing?</i>

124
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:33,512
This has been planned for three months
and I'm this close to pulling it off.

125
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,889
The minimum profit is 10 billion Won,
the maximum is up to 30 billion Won.

126
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,948
- Do Woo.
- Yeah.

127
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,176
Drink.

128
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,044
Do Woo.

129
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:06,400
I'll drink it.

130
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:11,847
That kind of favor...
is something you ask of your own Daddy.

131
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,636
<i>Should I be your Daddy?</i>

132
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:17,423
Huh?

133
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,197
Call me that.

134
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,834
Dad... dy.

135
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:42,380
<i>Daddy!
Daddy!</i>

136
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,161
<i>Ah, seriously...</i>

137
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,327
<i>If I tell you to call me by that, you do.</i>

138
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,867
Ah I'm not drunk.
Let's have another beer!

139
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,582
Hey son!

140
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,270
<i>Your car already left!
Did you not pay your driver?</i>

141
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,452
<i>- Director Oh!
- Yeah.</i>

142
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,542
- Take care of my son...
- Okay, I'll take care of it. Go home.

143
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,214
Bye!

144
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,347
You're conscious, right?

145
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,974
I've... known you since
our Imperial College days.

146
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,714
Are you someone who gets drunk?

147
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:37,310
About Byukjaewon.
How much money did you already invest?

148
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,764
Three billion Won.
I'm missing seven billion Won.

149
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:41,855
In total 10 billion Won.

150
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,126
You put in quite a lot.
You that confident?

151
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,302
That account you took from Jae In with 2
billion Won. It's still as is, right?

152
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,524
Trying putting in half of that.

153
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:59,460
You... scary bastard.
How did you know about that?

154
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:04,926
One month from Friday.
Doesn't matter when it goes out.

155
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,167
I won't take a cent
of what you invested.

156
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:13,063
You'll give us 100 to 300 percent
in profit margin?

157
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,398
If you liquidate your safety deposit boxes,
it'll be about 2 billion Won.

158
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,709
Today it was 15,200 Won,
so the profit margin rose 76 percent.

159
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,262
If you sell at opening, it should be
a little more than 2 billion Won.

160
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:39,292
What?
I had something like that?

161
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:41,800
The inheritance you got two years ago
pays off tomorrow.

162
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,806
You slick bastard.

163
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:47,986
How do you know about the stock
I didn't even know I had?

164
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:52,057
I'm the slick bastard who's doing it.
Want in?

165
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,150
Okay. I'm in.

166
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,282
To be honest, Danny only knows
how to spend money.

167
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:04,387
I'll invest in you.
Because you only know how to earn money.

168
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,088
Me?

169
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,610
Someone who's able to tell
who makes money?

170
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,702
<i>How many?</i>

171
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,428
Two.

172
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,258
<i>How many?</i>

173
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,510
Three.

174
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,442
Take him away.
He's well.

175
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,662
<i>Ahh.</i>

176
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:59,226
Ah, ah.

177
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:39,138
2924.

178
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,328
<i>Let's go.</i>

179
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:46,031
- Please put me in another room.
- What?

180
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:50,927
If I go back, I'm going to die in that
room. So please place me in another room.

181
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,520
If I die, you have to write
a written explanation.

182
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:57,307
So... please put me in a different room.

183
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,469
Come inside.

184
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,689
Hey, you.

185
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:47,589
You there.

186
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,898
You're not with those gangsters, right?

187
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:58,310
But how come they don't hit you?

188
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,786
Those bastards just leave you be.

189
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:07,054
Has it been long since you've been here?

190
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,746
So is that why...
you know some tricks?

191
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,818
Look here.
Teach me.

192
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,561
What do I have to do
to those bastards?

193
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,343
No... I just want to change rooms.
How do I do that?

194
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:23,073
What do I have to do?

195
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:37,232
Why am I asking a crazy gangster...

196
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:42,404
Ah man, I'm going nuts.

197
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,480
Money.

198
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,496
Money kept in custody...

199
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,993
they've asked me to put in a lot.

200
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,911
Money.
And food.

201
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:12,284
Along with brand name training clothes.

202
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:14,913
Of many different sizes.

203
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:17,929
They ask me to put in a lot.

204
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,099
When people come to visit, they say it.

205
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,171
To put in a lot for them.

206
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:25,278
That's all you need.

207
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:28,617
Money...
Money...

208
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,630
Money.

209
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,136
<i>Don't come.</i>

210
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,099
You mustn't come.

211
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,375
You know the money at home?
Take that and leave for someplace far away.

212
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,595
Don't even tell me where you're going!

213
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:49,901
These guys are ten times worse
than the gangsters last time...

214
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,506
If they find out about you Myung Sun...

215
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,409
they might even harass your family.

216
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:58,143
Shin... but...

217
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,835
From now on...

218
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:02,384
I'm not the kids' uncle.

219
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,926
Don't even write me a letter.
Do you understand?

220
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,672
Then who will
send you supplies, Shin?

221
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,800
After Kyung Ah heard what happened to you,
she severed off all ties...

222
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,729
I said don't do it!

223
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:18,090
Don't mention Kyung Ah's name,
don't call me 'Uncle'...

224
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,774
And from now on,
don't even think about me either.

225
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:28,492
Just do as I tell you!

226
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,138
<i>It's been over a week since they've moved.</i>

227
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,392
<i>They basically sold off
their furniture or whatever...</i>

228
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:19,954
<i>At dawn, they rented a moving van,
packed their things and left.</i>

229
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:23,318
<i>Aren't you Shin's fiancee?</i>

230
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,930
How could you not have known?

231
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:28,754
Do you know where they went to?

232
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:33,496
It's because I can't reach them
by their cell phones.

233
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:36,164
I'm worried since I can't contact them
all of a sudden.

234
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:38,269
Do you not know?

235
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,517
I heard that you have a good relationship
with the residents here.

236
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,814
We do have a good relationship.

237
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:47,637
I even count the number of spoons
and chopsticks in each home.

238
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:50,248
But they left without telling you either?

239
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:56,938
But I heard that Shin got put in jail... and
you severed off all ties with the family.

240
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,727
That's how I heard it.

241
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:02,214
<i>I hear a lot of things.</i>

242
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:06,372
That's right. I cut ties off with them
but now I want to repair them.

243
00:22:06,373 --> 00:22:08,921
Are you going to send me away
just like that?

244
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:45,660
Yes, Mr. President.
A girl came to look for them.

245
00:22:46,284 --> 00:22:48,565
It seems like she heard something
from the security guard.

246
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,166
Yes, I understand.

247
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:16,826
Uh Boss... are you going
to let that guy go?

248
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,263
Don't make too much noise.

249
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:28,930
We're not an amateur baseball team.
Don't worry.

250
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,889
Just teach him a lesson.

251
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:36,183
We'll take care of him
exactly to your liking, Boss.

252
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:41,552
Ah, why does it keep falling?

253
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,321
<i>Over here!
Over here!</i>

254
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:08,836
<i>Food's here!</i>

255
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:16,266
Hey.

256
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,564
If the food's arrived,
you should say so!

257
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:24,272
- The bathroom door's open. It's cold.
- Yes sir.

258
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:27,398
<i>Scoop the soup, you bastard!</i>

259
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:36,450
Give it.

260
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,070
<i>- Let's eat.
- Yes, enjoy your meal!</i>

261
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,180
Oh my...

262
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:33,036
It spilled.

263
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,557
Hey.

264
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:05,216
Save me!
These guys are going to kill me!

265
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:08,240
<i>Guard!
Guard!</i>

266
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:13,219
- What's he doing?
- We're watching an act, sir.

267
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:18,678
Guard!
I'm going to die.

268
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,140
- 2924.
- These guys are trying to kill me.

269
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:23,748
I said these guys are trying to kill me!

270
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,080
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

271
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,754
What?

272
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,000
I've been put in the wrong room.

273
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,311
This room isn't right.
I don't know this person.

274
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,419
And I...

275
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,099
don't have anyone who would visit me.

276
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,799
- Kim Shin?
- Who are you?

277
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,131
My name is Chae Eun Soo and...

278
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,074
And what?

279
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:29,455
I came here to apologize.

280
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:38,069
What is she?

281
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm Chae Eun Soo, the daughter of
Chae Dong Woo of Chae Dong Group.

282
00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:03,489
On behalf of the company, we extend our deepest
apologies for the damage we've caused...

283
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:10,209
I will do my best to do whatever I can to provide
compensation and comfort for your losses.

284
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:15,036
If there's anything you need,
please let me know.

285
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:18,791
Clothes, blankets,
anything to eat...

286
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,399
<i>- You there.
- Yes?</i>

287
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:23,202
I think you've made a mistake...

288
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,372
You're Kim Shin, right?

289
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:30,928
- That's right but...
- Your brother is Kim Wook, correct?

290
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:40,064
I heard that he committed suicide.
Because of his business.

291
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:46,418
You.
What are you?

292
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:51,144
That's because...
it's our company's fault.

293
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:57,585
I would like to do whatever I can to...
Even if it's small...

294
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,267
<i>What is this nonsense?</i>

295
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,158
What about it is because of your company?

296
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,056
I'm not sure of the details.

297
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,070
I only know...
how to apologize.

298
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,099
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

299
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,145
You really have poor manners.

300
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:46,601
You should stand and bow, kid.
Say that you've returned...

301
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:51,058
And when the Boss gives you permission
can you sit.

302
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:57,712
Hey.

303
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:00,206
Jeez, I ought to just...

304
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:03,447
There.
And there.

305
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:05,113
<i>Jeez...</i>

306
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,014
Hey, Attempted Murder.

307
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,873
You should be making a ruckus and
pressing that emergency bell over there.

308
00:31:12,588 --> 00:31:13,978
Hey.

309
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:17,222
Stand while I still ask nicely, huh?
Here we go...

310
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:21,288
One...
Two...

311
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,931
About me.

312
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:27,448
I wasn't going to make a peep
and then get out of here...

313
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,337
Has this jerk gone crazy?

314
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:36,148
I suddenly have something to think about.

315
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:39,691
So don't mess with me.
So I can think.

316
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:44,468
Oh!
Oh!

317
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,512
Why don't you stop it!

318
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:51,188
What's he saying?

319
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:54,981
I said stop it.

320
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:58,293
My nickname in the army was
'Crazy Dog'...

321
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:03,165
You want to know...
the behind-the-story to it?

322
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,815
Over there!
Over there!

323
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:36,196
<i>He's... the younger brother
of the president of the dumpling company.</i>

324
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:42,000
<i>[Broadcasting Company Disturbance...]
The one who committed suicide...</i>

325
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,986
Does the Chairman know about this too?

326
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:48,999
It's likely that he's
been briefed about it...

327
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,944
Eun Soo goes to visit this guy
and brings him food.

328
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:01,443
How did she find out about this?

329
00:34:01,787 --> 00:34:04,098
Is it likely that we have a spy?

330
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,511
How does a girl who stays at home
find out about this and find him in prison?

331
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:16,278
Look into where the leak is.

332
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,386
- Yes sir.
- What else?

333
00:34:20,836 --> 00:34:24,214
<i>This is the list of people
the Chairman will meet with this week.</i>

334
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,004
This was sent from the prison.

335
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:09,848
<i>Because the recipient has refused to accept
the items that you have sent to the prison...</i>

336
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:13,350
<i>you will receive the equivalent
of the amount for the food.</i>

337
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:20,736
<i>Sender: Kim Shin.
It looks like he sent it himself.</i>

338
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:22,404
Should I read this to you as well?

339
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:28,437
I was really...
about to get hit.

340
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:33,278
If that pane of glass
weren't blocking us...

341
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:39,271
that person, Kim Shin,
could have hit me.

342
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:42,904
He's a man who's in for attempted murder.
What do you expect?

343
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,633
But...

344
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:47,118
But what?

345
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:51,028
But strangely, he wasn't scary.

346
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:52,975
<i>Isn't that quite strange?</i>

347
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:56,832
He got angry and was yelling...

348
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:02,842
He didn't seem scary but...
could I say... he looked sad?

349
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,008
- What?
- He's good looking, isn't he?

350
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:13,438
- That guy.
- Mr. Do...

351
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:17,870
You want to read it yourself?
The letter that sad man sent.

352
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,404
Please read it for me.

353
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:23,715
If you're going to report to my
father anyway, you have to read it.

354
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,412
All right.

355
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:32,241
Mr. Do.

356
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:40,129
This is Kim Shin.

357
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,810
The younger brother of the man
who committed suicide, like you said.

358
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,171
I have something to ask you.

359
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,516
I hope you can come to visit me again.

360
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:52,012
Let's go.
The Chairman is waiting for us.

361
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:58,450
<i>The people of this country
who speak so bluntly...</i>

362
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:01,962
That's the beginnings of a nonstarter
in the character of the people.

363
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:06,459
You have to lead with an appropriate amount
of autocracy and charisma.

364
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,376
That's what the people want.

365
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:15,371
In that sense, if President Park led
this country for another twenty years...

366
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:17,725
the GNP would be double what it is today.

367
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:18,960
- Right?
- Yes.

368
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:23,744
What this country needs is a monarchy.
An autocratic monarchy.

369
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,904
Even if President Park were still alive...

370
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:30,848
that would be difficult in our present day.

371
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,572
There is so much discussion
with the world of the Internet...

372
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:36,047
My, my, how frustrating!

373
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:38,067
What's so hard about it?

374
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:40,667
You buy a few Internet companies...

375
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:43,278
Those slackers who don't do anything
because they don't want to work.

376
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:46,136
You get a few hundred of them
and pull them in.

377
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,042
What's that? A part-time job.
Put them to work.

378
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:51,965
Hard?
That's easy.

379
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:54,723
That's why I told you.

380
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:58,473
That we need to conduct business
like Chairman Chae.

381
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,840
But running for congressman
isn't that expensive.

382
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,453
Why won't you go for it?

383
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:09,211
Stop trying to coax me.

384
00:38:09,212 --> 00:38:12,399
Take a look at this man's answer, huh?

385
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,424
He's interested in it!
He's interested!

386
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:26,952
These people whom I have invited
cannot leave empty-handed.

387
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:30,886
Oh dear, she's pretty.
She's pretty, huh?

388
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:32,695
Of course she's pretty!

389
00:38:32,696 --> 00:38:37,349
She's got a pretty face
but she's not very smart.

390
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,287
University is pointless.

391
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:45,231
At first, I thought about sending her
to study abroad...

392
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:49,759
But if you send a girl overseas, the only
thing that will happen is that she gets hurt.

393
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,586
That's why I keep her here.

394
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:54,095
What are you doing?
Present your greetings.

395
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:56,820
Oh, she's a beauty.
A beauty!

396
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:02,937
<i>She's my only daughter...</i>

397
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:07,313
<i>And when I die, I'm thinking of
giving her more than my son.</i>

398
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:10,543
So look around for a decent match.

399
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:14,256
Chairman, will you notice a son from
just anyone's family?

400
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:16,608
I don't want an average
second-generation rich man.

401
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:20,066
And I hate those who
took drugs in New York.

402
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:24,160
I'd like a man who's able
to earn his own money...

403
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:28,425
knows a few things
and has mastery over them.

404
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:31,285
<i>Would there be a man like that?</i>

405
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:38,690
<i>This old man has become more greedy
as he gets older!</i>

406
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,615
<i>2924.</i>

407
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,245
<i>Stay still!
2486! Stay put!</i>

408
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,533
You know how many demerits you get every
time you're put in solitary confinement?

409
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:39,899
It's not like you can enjoy yourself
with the accumulated amount anyway.

410
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,636
<i>Let's be careful.</i>

411
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,974
Just... think that
you were bitten by a crazy dog.

412
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:59,178
Boss, this isn't a situation
you should involve yourself with.

413
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:04,441
If you get involved,
your demerits will increase...

414
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:08,939
And if your demerits increase,
it will affect your parole.

415
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,236
Boss.

416
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:14,860
No matter what, you have to make parole
and get of here early.

417
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:18,685
That way we can stay in business.

418
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:22,561
So Boss, please do not get
flushed by that kid's...

419
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,939
Am I like toilet water
to be flushed?

420
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:38,131
For now, I told the kids to lay off of him.

421
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:56,814
- Oh, that's not bad.
- The others will be shocked when they see.

422
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,675
Just give us an order.

423
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:25,607
We'll take care of him
without anyone catching on.

424
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:30,816
There are plenty of fellows
who are lining up to join our group.

425
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:34,108
If we can get a useful one to...

426
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:39,685
<i>A few days later, a few days later...</i>

427
00:42:39,686 --> 00:42:42,038
What is there to take care of?
Just leave him be.

428
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:46,333
Seriously, Boss.

429
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:49,606
Us, South Faction, aren't
the only ones here.

430
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:54,885
All the factions of the country, at least
one or two of them of each are in here.

431
00:42:56,731 --> 00:43:00,775
'Boss is getting hit by a nobody.'

432
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:03,332
Do you want this kind of rumor
to float around the country?

433
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:10,888
Our Yong Shik.
You sure have grown a lot in here.

434
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,655
Now you're teaching me a thing or two.
Huh?

435
00:43:47,983 --> 00:43:48,983
Let me go!

436
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:04,265
<i>Grab him!</i>

437
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:07,889
<i>Stay still!</i>

438
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:11,132
Let go!

439
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,609
<i>Let go!</i>

440
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,067
- Stay right there!
- Break it up!

441
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,823
- Grandma!
- Me?

442
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,560
I came to find a friend
who moved here from Seoul.

443
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:06,270
- Do you know where she lives?
- Seoul?

444
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:10,408
Uh, she's a mother with two kids.
Two daughters.

445
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:11,818
Yu Ri and Nu Ri.

446
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:15,173
It's probably been about a week
since they've moved in.

447
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:20,285
Is it that house over there?

448
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,570
<i>I'll give you food.</i>

449
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,122
<i>I'll make you a lot of tasty food.</i>

450
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:37,751
Yu Ri, your mom's coming.

451
00:45:37,752 --> 00:45:41,891
- Yu Ri.
- Kyung Ah's here! Kyung Ah!

452
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:43,939
Yu Ri!
Have you been well?

453
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:45,539
Go on inside.

454
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:56,993
It looks like Shin used a loan shark
to repay Wook's debt.

455
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:00,450
That makes it our debt.

456
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,675
<i>So instead of us,
he's taken a loan upon himself.</i>

457
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:08,050
<i>Instead of myself and the kids.</i>

458
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:14,003
Wook left us after that incident...

459
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:19,602
If the insurance money came out right, then
we could have at least sold the apartment...

460
00:46:19,603 --> 00:46:23,073
and we could have repaid that debt.

461
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:27,847
Because those people
don't want to give us the money...

462
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:31,471
they make false claims
about the dead...

463
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:38,934
What would you like to drink?
We don't have coffee.

464
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,127
You're cold, right?

465
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:48,342
The boiler must be old,
it's not very warm.

466
00:46:50,323 --> 00:46:53,649
- How much is that debt?
- I don't know.

467
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,010
Shin won't tell me.

468
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:02,745
I know.
That portrait won't talk.

469
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:06,544
That he will cause trouble
before thinking about his actions.

470
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,987
<i>To be in debt to pay off a debt.</i>

471
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:13,048
<i>And because he wouldn't be able to pay,
he voluntarily went into prison.</i>

472
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,986
But he didn't say anything that made sense.
To me. Not even one thing.

473
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:26,435
He just said words that disgusted me.

474
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:32,591
Myung Sun, I was really disgusted,
by that man.

475
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:38,227
Shin tried to cut me off too.

476
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,799
<i>You're more precious to him than I am.</i>

477
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,729
<i>So he probably had to
push you away further.</i>

478
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,751
But why did you come?

479
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:56,018
You might as well have misunderstood
and left without looking back.

480
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,337
Just...

481
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:01,715
Kyung Ah.

482
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:08,104
Shin and our situation...
is so bad.

483
00:48:11,002 --> 00:48:14,994
I missed you all.
Yu Ri and Nu Ri.

484
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,876
You too.

485
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:22,884
Stay the night and go back.

486
00:48:22,885 --> 00:48:25,098
Go back and forget us.

487
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,367
<i>That's what Shin would have wanted too.</i>

488
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:33,901
- Should I?
- Yeah.

489
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:42,016
That doesn't seem to work very well.
That.

490
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:45,023
To forget.

491
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:50,083
I'm sorry.
Kyung Ah.

492
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,463
We're so sorry.

493
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,047
To Shin... and to you...

494
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,975
Here...

495
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:09,291
Kim Shin's older brother, Kim Wook.

496
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,741
That person's dead.

497
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:13,221
His wife, Oh Myung Sun.

498
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,095
Their daughters Kim Yu Ri, Kim Nu Ri.

499
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,777
Everyone's here.

500
00:49:20,778 --> 00:49:23,652
What is this?
Who are these people?

501
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,974
Oh, it's cold.

502
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:37,886
Hello.
It took a lot of effort to find you.

503
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:43,016
Thanks to this young lady,
she guided us right here.

504
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:47,993
But who are you, young lady?

505
00:49:47,994 --> 00:49:50,554
Are you Kim Shin's fiancee?

506
00:49:53,377 --> 00:49:54,959
Hi.

507
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:06,075
<i>- That was a set!
- Fine fine!</i>

508
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:08,525
<i>Okay, again.
Again.</i>

509
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,588
<i>You're Kim Shin, right?</i>

510
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:28,564
Your brother is Kim Wook, correct?
I heard that he committed suicide.

511
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:32,502
- Because of the business...
- Who... are you?

512
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:36,963
That's because...
it's our company's fault.

513
00:50:37,775 --> 00:50:41,341
I would like to do whatever I can to...
Even if it's small...

514
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:45,503
<i>What is this nonsense?
What about it is because of your company?</i>

515
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:58,517
Is it true that no one came to visit me?

516
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:06,695
That's strange.
I asked her to come.

517
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,625
When was it that you said
that you would never take visitors?

518
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:11,939
Excuse me.

519
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,519
The woman who visited me last time...
is there a way I can get her phone number?

520
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,235
Can you look into it for me?

521
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:28,172
<i>- There we go.
- Oh my.</i>

522
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,080
It's freezing cold out there.

523
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:24,322
Grandma, I'm going to sit here
for a bit and then leave.

524
00:52:26,947 --> 00:52:28,488
That's better.

525
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:32,145
Who are you calling?

526
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:43,856
Lady, shut that baby up!

527
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:45,883
I can't talk.

528
00:52:45,884 --> 00:52:47,090
<i>Nu Ri.</i>

529
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:48,963
<i>Nu Ri.</i>

530
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:53,832
<i>Nu Ri.</i>

531
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:57,317
Hello.
This is the police, right?

532
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:00,744
We have some gangsters in our house
and they're bullying us.

533
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:03,428
Myung Sun, what's the address here?

534
00:53:05,564 --> 00:53:09,133
Thank you for your hard work.
I'm a representative for Chae Kwon Dwa.

535
00:53:09,134 --> 00:53:11,307
I'm here to collect a debt.

536
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:16,304
This woman borrowed my savings and promised
to pay me back in a few days but she didn't.

537
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:21,514
In this harsh winter, it looks like
my family will soon be out on the streets.

538
00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:25,307
She called me a gangster?
Oh dear me...

539
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,161
Officer, is lending money a crime?

540
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:32,483
Yes, I understand.

541
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:35,082
Of course I want to settle it politely.

542
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:38,188
Yes, yes.
Have a good day.

543
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:45,951
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:50,325
I was going to keep my words civil,
but she called me a gangster.

545
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:58,020
A gangster... we're going to
have to show her what that means.

546
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:20,612
<i>What's going on?</i>

547
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:23,384
<i>- Let's go eat.
- Come here.</i>

548
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:26,914
<i>- Gather around!
- Hurry hurry!</i>

549
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,778
<i>Hurry up and gather around!</i>

550
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:31,946
<i>Everyone is gathering together.</i>

551
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:33,778
<i>Okay, your name!</i>

552
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:39,452
<i>Next!</i>

553
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:23,420
Seriously!
This arrogant jerk!

554
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:25,748
- You bastard!
- Stop right there!

555
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:34,976
Come here you bastard!

556
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:36,722
<i>Come here!</i>

557
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:43,635
<i>- Stop it!
- Stop it!</i>

558
00:55:43,636 --> 00:55:45,227
Come here!

559
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:48,098
<i>You aren't complying?</i>

560
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:49,666
<i>- Let me go!
- Seriously!</i>

561
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,822
You bastard.

562
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:16,979
<i>Bastard!</i>

563
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:14,920
This isn't even enough
for one month's interest.

564
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,538
You come crawling to a faraway place,
with gas and travel expenses.

565
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,758
What is this paltry amount!

566
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:20,978
Anyway, let's see each other again
next month, Lady.

567
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:25,161
And next time, give us a reasonable amount.
What is this?

568
00:57:25,162 --> 00:57:27,339
We destroyed the children's
toys for nothing.

569
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,377
Hey.

570
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:32,503
Keep a close eye on this lady
so that she doesn't escape again.

571
00:57:32,504 --> 00:57:33,618
Yes, I understand.

572
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:36,595
I'm hungry.

573
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:39,702
What do you boys want to eat?

574
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:42,347
<i>Something with broth?</i>

575
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,943
That money...

576
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:50,022
was the last bit we had.

577
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,424
After we moved out of our apartment
and gave our workers' their wages...

578
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:58,829
that was what was left.

579
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:05,972
My children have nothing now.

580
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:20,769
<i>- Have a drink.
- Yes, sir.</i>

581
00:58:42,259 --> 00:58:44,674
Mister.
Punch in your number.

582
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:02,299
Hello.

583
00:59:05,595 --> 00:59:10,233
That number is mine so contact me
about Kim Shin's debt issue.

584
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:13,714
I'm better than a woman with children
who only knows how to do housework.

585
00:59:14,527 --> 00:59:17,922
- What did this young lady say just now?
- That she'll repay the debt herself.

586
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:21,355
So there are women like this
in the world now, huh?

587
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:23,774
How much is it?
Kim Shin's debt?

588
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:27,616
Ah, I'm touched.

589
00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:31,856
A lover should act like this...
People these days...

590
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:34,099
That's wrong.
It's not like that.

591
00:59:34,899 --> 00:59:36,606
You said that you're going to
repay the debt.

592
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:38,180
A woman who hasn't
registered a marriage to him.

593
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:40,251
That means you're his lover.

594
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:44,680
That jerk and I...
aren't lovers.

595
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,864
If you want money from me,
don't call me that.

596
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:50,135
Do you hear me Mister?

597
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:02,343
<i>Do you not want to live?</i>

598
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:08,672
<i>You know those guys are
part of the South Faction gang, yes?</i>

599
01:00:09,911 --> 01:00:12,885
<i>If you knew, then going straight
for their leader...</i>

600
01:00:12,886 --> 01:00:14,456
<i>means that you want them to kill you.</i>

601
01:00:19,535 --> 01:00:21,445
<i>What I've said is off the record.</i>

602
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:25,146
I just threw it out there
so we'll move on.

603
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,718
2924.

604
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:32,165
Starting today, we've assigned you
to a new room.

605
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:34,460
We even changed the guard...

606
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,339
Once you are there, behave yourself.

607
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,268
Ah.

608
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,355
Your fellow cellmate, 4687,
will be joining you.

609
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,081
Make sure to thank him
when you see him.

610
01:00:47,903 --> 01:00:52,033
Because if it weren't for him,
you would have really died.

611
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:09,526
Was I... wrong?

612
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,852
At first...

613
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:18,895
I just wanted to extend
my jail time a little longer...

614
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:24,609
Because if I get out of here early,
nothing good will come of it.

615
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:29,539
So if I keep fighting and get beaten...

616
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:34,292
Then I could stay in here
for 10 more years, I guess.

617
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:37,296
That's what I thought.

618
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,400
Do you know that?

619
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:49,064
If I do that, then I could become
the best fighter in here.

620
01:01:57,477 --> 01:01:59,919
But...

621
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,311
It became more and more tiresome.

622
01:02:05,427 --> 01:02:08,357
Be it in here or in the world...

623
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:13,216
There's nothing that I can do.

624
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:16,890
There's nothing...
that I can do.

625
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:21,833
Therefore...

626
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,237
should I just die?

627
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,526
I thought like that.

628
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:35,771
We must be brothers.

629
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:39,124
Wook.

630
01:02:43,074 --> 01:02:45,210
You were like that too, right?

631
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:55,334
<i>Last night, Daddy...</i>

632
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:59,256
<i>in his doting affectionate way...</i>

633
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:03,066
<i>held in his hand, crayons...</i>

634
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:06,831
<i>he bought and brought for me.</i>

635
01:03:06,832 --> 01:03:10,492
<i>All night... in dreamland...</i>

636
01:03:10,493 --> 01:03:14,867
<i>An elephant was dancing...</i>

637
01:03:14,868 --> 01:03:18,696
<i>Crayon soldiers...</i>

638
01:03:18,697 --> 01:03:22,721
<i>rode the other leaves and played.</i>

639
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,950
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

640
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:13,516
I'm going to turn into a dirty and
awful girl and repay your debt.

641
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,541
<i>Think of it as my entrance fee
to another world.</i>

642
01:04:16,642 --> 01:04:19,084
What did they do to you?

643
01:04:19,085 --> 01:04:21,448
- We can't see each other anymore.
- Are you okay?

644
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:24,288
Because you and I...
are going to live in different worlds.

645
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:26,828
<i>Let's try the Byukjaewon project again.</i>

646
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,334
<i>Let's try to spread some rumors slowly.</i>

647
01:04:28,335 --> 01:04:30,943
<i>The road's been covered already,
so let's light the fire.</i>

648
01:04:30,944 --> 01:04:32,747
<i>Those without money will probably say this.</i>

649
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:34,751
<i>Why would you do that for some money?</i>

650
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:37,073
<i>You fall short and
you grumble everywhere else.</i>

651
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:39,705
<i>Blaming others for your whole life.</i>

652
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:40,975
Don't you feel ashamed?

653
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:42,477
What did you say your name was?

654
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,692
Chae. Do. Woo.
