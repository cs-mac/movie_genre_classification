CARTER: Colombia is the world's second
largest recipient of U.S. military aid,

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,022
receiving approximately $1 billion a year

3
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:54,120
for training and equipping
the Colombian armed forces.

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,597
The revolutionary
armed forces of Colombia

5
00:00:56,597 --> 00:01:01,501
are Latin America's oldest, largest
and best-equipped guerrilla insurgency.

6
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,005
Known by their Spanish acronym FARC,

7
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,564
they have waged a cruel,

8
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:08,008
50-year campaign of terror
against the government

9
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,717
and the people of Colombia.

10
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:15,648
Their tactics include bombings,
murder, mortar attacks, kidnapping,

11
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,983
extortion and hijacking.

12
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:25,524
American soldiers are frequently deployed

13
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:30,055
to assist in anti-narcotics
and anti-guerrilla operations,

14
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:34,900
and the American government has posted
over $70 million of reward money

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,032
for any information leading
to the capture of FARC leadership.

16
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,817
The Colombian people frequently
take to the streets

17
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:53,788
to protest the FARC's brutal methods
and to call for the end to the violence

18
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,849
and for the release of
hundreds of hostages.

19
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:07,302
Although, with its massive cocaine revenue,
the FARC has been able to equip its army

20
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:12,034
with the most modern weapons of any
terrorist organization in the world.

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia?

The most powerful, most dangerous
Communist guerrilla force on the planet.

They kill about 3,000 Colombians a year.

They stay funded by protecting

Right. People up here buy their drugs,

01:22:46,905 --> 01:22:48,338
(GUNSHOT)

791
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:54,410
- Alvaro!
- Stop!

792
01:23:32,184 --> 01:23:33,674
(SCREAMING)

793
01:24:15,026 --> 01:24:18,124
- Do it.
- Go on.

794
01:24:18,897 --> 01:24:21,024
Tell your people the truth.

795
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,664
What about your wife, your son,

796
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:29,731
is this what they would have wanted?
Help me to end this.

797
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:32,567
Death is all I have left.

798
01:24:36,414 --> 01:24:39,577
Kill me, or I will kill you.

799
01:24:40,552 --> 01:24:42,315
Stand down, soldier.

800
01:24:44,589 --> 01:24:47,387
General Valez, Carter?

801
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:51,428
We have secured your man.
Where is your proof?

802
01:24:53,765 --> 01:24:57,428
This man's a traitor.
Give him the vid pack.

803
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:03,129
We have footage of him
killing your soldiers on that.

804
01:25:06,878 --> 01:25:08,277
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

805
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:10,809
Alvaro.

806
01:25:14,986 --> 01:25:16,920
You're working with him?

807
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:21,090
He works for me.
I am his commanding officer.

808
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,251
What?

809
01:25:23,762 --> 01:25:28,131
When I was a little boy,
the guerrillas cut my father's throat,

810
01:25:29,034 --> 01:25:30,501
and they made me watch.

811
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:33,732
That's why I became a soldier,
to hunt them down.

812
01:25:35,473 --> 01:25:39,432
What about your talk of peace,
those innocent men you killed?

813
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:41,274
They were your allies.

814
01:25:41,274 --> 01:25:44,338
They sacrificed for Colombia.
They are heroes.

815
01:25:45,317 --> 01:25:50,516
The bogus intel on the peace talks,
and my men... You set us up!

816
01:25:50,516 --> 01:25:52,250
Alvaro, kill him.

817
01:25:53,325 --> 01:25:55,225
Rivera. Videotape the bodies.

818
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:57,853
Make it look like
they tried to bomb the base.

819
01:25:57,853 --> 01:26:01,729
Rivera, Carlos Rivera.
The factory bombings of Bogota.

820
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:04,325
It wasn't FARC. It was you.

821
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,836
That is a lie. Kill him, Alvaro.

822
01:26:06,836 --> 01:26:10,898
No, no. Rivera has a handler,
his codename is Apotequil.

823
01:26:16,548 --> 01:26:17,879
Apotequil.

824
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:20,642
You?

825
01:26:21,753 --> 01:26:23,050
My wife.

826
01:26:24,923 --> 01:26:26,220
My son.

827
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:33,490
They died heroes for Colombia.
Their sacrifice brought us together.

828
01:26:34,733 --> 01:26:38,829
- You killed them.
- No. America killed them.

829
01:26:39,504 --> 01:26:43,804
The guerrillas killed them.
But now we will win.

830
01:26:43,804 --> 01:26:47,675
We will crush the guerrillas
and we will kick the Americans out,

831
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,839
and Colombia will belong to us again.

832
01:26:49,839 --> 01:26:53,282
Alvaro, I will lead us into a new era.

833
01:26:53,282 --> 01:26:57,947
Two lives? What is that compared to
the destiny of our country?

834
01:26:58,623 --> 01:26:59,749
(GUNSHOT)

835
01:27:20,011 --> 01:27:23,742
You are no soldier.
You die a traitor to Colombia.

836
01:27:29,321 --> 01:27:31,346
He betrayed our country.

837
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:34,853
He betrayed us all.

838
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:43,227
This is so wrong.

839
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:46,232
Then make it right.

840
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:00,143
BOYTANO: "There is a special breed of
warrior ready to answer our nation's call,

841
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:04,171
"a common man with uncommon desire to succeed.

842
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:10,718
"Forged by adversity, he stands alongside
America's finest special operations forces

843
01:29:11,489 --> 01:29:14,686
"to serve his country, the American people,

844
01:29:14,686 --> 01:29:17,125
"and protect their way of life.

845
01:29:17,862 --> 01:29:19,295
(MARSHALING)

846
01:29:19,295 --> 01:29:23,323
"I am that man." SEAL creed.
