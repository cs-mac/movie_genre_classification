1
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>Alright let's</i>
<i>finish packing</i>
<i>and get the hell outta here.</i>

2
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,400
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

3
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,280
<i>A gun.</i>

4
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Are you serious?

5
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,080
Ben...

6
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
<i>will be out soon.</i>
<i>He'll try to find me.</i>

7
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
He always does.

8
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,007
He has no idea where 
you're going.

9
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,280
What if he finds out?

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,040
<i>Alice, I don't like</i>
<i>you having a gun. You don't</i>
<i>even have a license for it.</i>

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
<i>I don't understand. Why</i>
<i>can't you just stay here and</i>
<i>work while I'm in New York.</i>

12
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,480
I don't want to be
alone in the apartment.
I don't feel safe here.

13
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>Besides, I'm already</i>
<i>behind on my deadline.</i>

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,800
You're putting yourself
under too much pressure.
It's too soon.

15
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,800
If I don't go to work
I will go crazy.

16
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
You look
really great on film.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,840
You're a real
voyeur ain'tcha?

18
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
Filmmaker.

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, like there's
a difference?

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,360
There's other
things to film.

21
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
You're ruining my shots.

22
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,600
So how much are you
paying for this
place anyway?

23
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Free.

24
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
Free?

25
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
Uh-huh.

26
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,800
This is the slimy producer
who's been trying to get
in your pants

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,600
for the last
year, correct?

28
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,520
He's not slimy. He's rich.
And he's helping out
a struggling writer.

29
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah. Right.

30
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,440
You know
what I was thinking?

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,880
Maybe you should write
about your own life?

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
It might be therapeutic.

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,200
I have no interest
in writing a horror film.

34
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,600
<i>Oh my God</i>
<i>we've found it.</i>

35
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
<i>You think it's</i>
<i>big enough for me?</i>

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,640
<i>It's big enough</i>
<i>for a football team.</i>

37
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,400
<i>Oh my Goodness.</i>

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,760
<i>You are gonna be</i>
<i>so lonely here.</i>

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,120
<i>That's exactly</i>
<i>what I want.</i>
<i>It's perfect.</i>

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,840
Well alright then!

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,080
<i>It's huge.</i>

42
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Oh my Goodness.

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Ohhhh.

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,040
Come on,
let's go upstairs.

45
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,920
<i>Oh.</i>

46
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,920
Bedroom?

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,920
Yes.

48
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Look at that balcony.

49
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,040
I could definitely
get used to this.

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,320
Okay.

51
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,880
Old houses
are like people.

52
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,080
They grumble
and moan and cry
like they're in pain.

53
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,640
And keep you
awake at night.

54
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm gonna miss you.

55
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,240
Are you?

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,720
Yes.
Even your sarcasm.

57
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,080
Ben was stupid to do
what he did to you.

58
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,000
I hate it
when you're sad, Alice.
It makes me sad too.

59
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,400
Come on.

60
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Come on, let's check
out the rest of the house
before you have to leave.

61
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,640
Alice?

62
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,920
Where are ya?

63
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,760
Hey.

64
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,640
How odd.

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,280
I wonder
who owned this place before
the producer guy bought it.

66
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,600
I have no idea.

67
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,920
A family, I guess.

68
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,360
Alice.

69
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Don't... Don't
torture yourself.

70
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Come on. Come.

71
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,320
Come on.
Let's go.

72
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Are you
sure you want me
to take the car?

73
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
Yes.

74
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,080
<i>You'll be stranded</i>
<i>here without it.</i>

75
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,520
That's the whole point,
so I can focus and work.

76
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Why don't you just let me
take a cab to the airport,
it's not a big deal.

77
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Becky, I don't want the car.
I'm never gonna use it.

78
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,960
Okay. If you're sure.
This is everything.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Where's my laptop?

80
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,960
<i>Up stairs</i>
<i>in the bedroom</i>
<i>with your suitcase.</i>

81
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,800
Is this enough
food for one week?

82
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,800
Plenty. I don't eat
much when I'm working.
I'll unpack the rest.

83
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,600
Come on,
let's go before
you miss your flight.

84
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,560
You'd better
call me.

85
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,760
Oh, of course I will.

86
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
Don't forget
to brush your teeth.

87
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,760
Thanks, Mom.
Don't forget
to drive carefully.

88
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Hello.

89
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,280
Hello?

90
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,560
Becca? Hi.

91
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,680
<i>Ally. I have something</i>
<i>to tell you. Promise me</i>
<i>you won't freak out.</i>

92
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,040
<i>Ben turned up</i>
<i>at the apartment looking</i>
<i>for you. He's out of prison.</i>

93
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,000
Since when?

94
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,320
<i>Last night.</i>

95
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
Last night?

96
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,720
And you didn't
call me to warn me?

97
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,080
<i>Calm down, please.</i>
<i>He has no idea</i>
<i>were you are.</i>

98
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,280
No, I'm not calming down.

99
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,840
<i>Ben knows he's going</i>
<i>to go back to prison if</i>
<i>he comes within a mile of you.</i>

100
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Rebecca, Ben doesn't
care about the law
and you know that!

101
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,560
Shit!

102
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
<i>Need a hand Scooch?</i>

103
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,360
<i>I got it.</i>
<i>Play with your toy.</i>

104
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,280
Hey, show me the ring.

105
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,440
Haven't you seen it
enough already?

106
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,440
<i>Well Mrs. Woods,</i>
<i>I would like to see</i>
<i>how the lens does on closeups.</i>

107
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,520
<i>Tsk.</i>

108
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,280
Wish I could've
afforded the other one.

109
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,320
David.

110
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Don't say that. Alright?

111
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,640
I adore this ring.

112
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,400
And I adore you.

113
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,360
So what time
is your mom coming?

114
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,120
Seven.

115
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,640
Is she planning
on spending the night again?

116
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,360
It's her house.

117
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,760
She just gets
lonely by herself.

118
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,360
Alright. I'll talk to her.

119
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,040
Thank you.

120
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,400
You're welcome.

121
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,040
<i>Well</i>

122
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,600
<i>dinner's almost done</i>
<i>I think you could put</i>
<i>that thing away.</i>

123
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
David!

124
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
Alright!

125
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,960
<i>You look so cute</i>
<i>in your sexy glasses.</i>

126
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,560
<i>Come on turn it off.</i>

127
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
<i>Don't tell me</i>
<i>you weren't a
<i>runway model one day.</i>

128
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
Flattery will
get you nowhere.

129
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,360
<i>Okay. Why don't</i>
<i>you pretend you're</i>
<i>somebody famous then.</i>

130
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,720
No, Ally, I'm reading!
Give me the damn camera!

131
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

132
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,520
<i>Oh oh oh, she thinks</i>
<i>she's stronger than me!</i>

133
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,200
I can't leave
the film like that!

134
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,760
<i>It's still rolling!

135
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,080
So how long
are you going
to keep me a secret?

136
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,640
You're not a secret.

137
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,720
Nobody knows about me.

138
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,040
I haven't met
any of your friends.

139
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,320
Are you ashamed of me?

140
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,280
Oh, that's not true.

141
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,680
Then what
are you afraid of?

142
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm afraid that
if Ben finds out
how close we are

143
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,240
he's gonna get
the wrong idea.

144
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,800
Wrong idea about what?

145
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,080
It doesn't matter.

146
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,440
Ally, nothing
is going to happen to you.

147
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,160
<i>I had this dream once</i>
<i>where he killed me.</i>

148
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,520
<i>It's just a dream.</i>

149
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,760
<i>He's getting out soon.</i>

150
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,920
Come on, come on, come on.

151
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>Hello?</i>

152
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,880
Oh, it's me.

153
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,240
<i>Alice, it's 4:00</i>
<i>o'clock in the morning.</i>
<i>I though someone had died.</i>

154
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,280
I just. I needed
to hear your voice.

155
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,960
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

156
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,080
I'm not sure.

157
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,240
<i>What does that mean?</i>

158
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,760
I

159
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't know,
I think, uh,

160
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,280
I think there's
someone in the house.

161
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,200
<i>Have you called</i>
<i>the police?</i>

162
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,120
<i>No, it's not like that.</i>

163
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,800
<i>Call the damn</i>
<i>police or I will.</i>

164
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,120
<i>It's not normal.</i>

165
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,480
<i>Tell me what's</i>
<i>going on. You're</i>
<i>not making any sense.</i>

166
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,560
I think someone died here.

167
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,920
<i>Call the damn</i>
<i>police or I will.</i>

168
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,640
I can feel it.

169
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,600
I can feel
the sadness, the energy.

170
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,840
Did you hear
what I just said?

171
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
<i>Yes.</i>

172
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,320
Well?

173
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,440
<i>I think you watch</i>
<i>too many movies.</i>

174
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,760
This house is creepy.

175
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,880
<i>It's an old house, Ally.</i>
<i>Of course it's creepy.</i>

176
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,240
Someone used my laptop.

177
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,000
And I keep
hearing these voices.

178
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,600
Someone crying

179
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,360
like they're
in so much pain.

180
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,880
<i>Ally?</i>

181
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,840
Yes?

182
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,520
<i>Have you been taking</i>
<i>your medication?</i>

183
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,720
You don't believe me.

184
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,320
<i>It's 4:00 o'clock</i>
<i>in the morning and</i>
<i>you're talking about a ghost.</i>

185
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I shouldn't have called you.

186
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,640
<i>No. Don't say that, please.</i>

187
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,120
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>
<i>Look, why don't you get</i>
<i>a taxi back to the city,</i>

188
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
<i>you'll be</i>
<i>here in a few hours.</i>

189
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm not leaving.

190
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,920
I came here to work.

191
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,640
<i>You are putting yourself</i>
<i>under too much pressure.</i>

192
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,640
<i>You'll make yourself</i>
<i>sick again. Alice?</i>

193
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
<i>Alice?</i>

194
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,040
<i>Are you there?</i>

195
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,880
<i>Hello?</i>

196
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,640
Yes. Alright.

197
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,920
I'll take my pills.

198
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
Sorry I called you.

199
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,560
Inspire me, Lucy.

200
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,880
My muse.

201
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,000
You are so beautiful.

202
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,960
Thank you.

203
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,720
Can you please
stop filming? You know,
it kinda makes me nervous

204
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,040
What time
do you think
you'll be home?

205
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,600
Not too late.

206
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,000
<i>What's your friend's</i>
<i>name again?</i>

207
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,000
Marie.

208
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,720
She single?

209
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,800
No.

210
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,360
She's a,

211
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
she's married
to Luke, remember?

212
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,960
<i>Luke was at the wedding.</i>

213
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Was Marie at the wedding?

214
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,760
She's one
of my best friends.

215
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,640
<i>I haven't really seen her</i>
<i>that much since I've been</i>
<i>with you, you know.</i>

216
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,560
<i>She is gonna freak</i>
<i>when I tell her</i>
<i>that I'm pregnant.</i>

217
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,880
Ever since
we were little
we were always saying

218
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
we'd get
pregnant together.

219
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
You didn't tell her?

220
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,640
I've been saving it.

221
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,320
I wanna see her face
when I say ' I'm pregnant! '

222
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,240
you know?
I want the surprise.

223
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,280
You know, how do
I even know you're
seeing this girl. Huh?

224
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,840
<i>You could be...</i>
<i>going to see some guy</i>

225
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,000
David?

226
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,440
We're having a baby together?

227
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,840
How could you say that?

228
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,680
I guess I'm scared.

229
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,600
Scared of what?

230
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,480
Scared that you'll
meet someone else.

231
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Scared that I'll lose you.

232
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,520
But I belong
to you. Remember?

233
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,120
<i>You're just so</i>
<i>young and beautiful.</i>

234
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,160
<i>What man wouldn't</i>
<i>want to be with you?</i>

235
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,280
Hey!

236
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,000
You came to help.

237
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,960
Oh, my god... Oh, honey.

238
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Oh this place looks.

239
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,840
<i>Our son is going to be</i>
<i>so proud of his beautiful</i>
<i>and talented mother.</i>

240
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,200
Or maybe our daughter.

241
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,960
Then I'll have two
amazing women in my life.

242
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,840
<i>David.</i>

243
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,400
Can you stop playing
for a minute and
please help?

244
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,680
<i>I'm documenting. All</i>
<i>of it. Everything</i>
<i>we're doing.</i>

245
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,080
<i>For our kid.</i>

246
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,680
<i>You're documenting?</i>

247
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah, it's important.

248
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,280
Oh! What?

249
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,680
<i>That is</i>
<i>completely unnecessary.</i>

250
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,680
Ugh it's documentable.
Yeah, get it.

251
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,520
<i>Oh, okay, I will.</i>

252
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,200
<i>Ughhhh, you killed me!</i>

253
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,360
<i>Nooo!</i>

254
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
<i>That's ridiculous!</i>

255
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,000
Here here here.
Wait wait wait.
There, I'm helping.

256
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,840
No, yes, very helpful.

257
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
<i>I'm crazy about you,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

258
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,800
You're my world.

259
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,120
David. What
brought this on?

260
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,360
I'm just being
nice to my wife
because she deserves it.

261
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,160
Well, thank you,
but I'm working.

262
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,920
You're distracting me.

263
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
Yeah?

264
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,760
You don't want to be
distracted right now?

265
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,520
No, not right now.

266
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,920
Why not?

267
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,240
Hm.

268
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
David, come on.
I'm serious.

269
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,120
Your smell Schoochy.

270
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,520
David. David!

271
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,320
What? Honey?

272
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,240
Just. You know. Jesus.

273
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,480
I just want
to be close
to you, honey, don't.

274
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,240
What?

275
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,600
<i>Baby don't walk</i>
<i>away, I'm sorry.</i>

276
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,440
What happened
to you, Lucy?

277
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,320
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll go back</i>
<i>to school in a few years.</i>

278
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,840
Psychology?

279
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,840
<i>You're right.</i>

280
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,000
I never
thought about it
that way but it's true.

281
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,480
I'm going to,
uh, call you back.

282
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,200
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

283
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,800
Who were
you talking to?

284
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,560
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>what I said? Huh?</i>

285
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,720
Who were you talking to?

286
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,360
This is getting ridiculous.

287
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,320
I, I can't
handle this any more.

288
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,920
Well then
just answer.

289
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,200
Answer what?
It's, I don't
have to answer.

290
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,480
It's a simple question.
Yeah you do! Who were
you talking to?

291
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Your mother!

292
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,680
<i>Alright? I- I was</i>
<i>talking to your mother!</i>

293
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,080
<i>What's happening to you?</i>

294
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,440
<i>Every day you're</i>
<i>like a different person.</i>

295
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,680
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

296
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,200
<i>I would be more</i>
<i>comfortable if you</i>
<i>slept in the spare room.</i>

297
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,920
<i>Hello?</i>

298
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,160
<i>Lucy. Is that you?</i>

299
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,600
You look like
an angel when you sleep.

300
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,640
Hello? Who is this?

301
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,880
Who is this?

302
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,800
<i>David. David!</i>

303
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
I told you
to stop filming me!

304
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,080
<i>Where are you going?</i>

305
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,720
David. Uh, I'm
just gonna take

306
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,720
a couple of days,
you know, take a break.

307
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,080
<i>You're</i>

308
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,960
you're smothering me!

309
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,400
Come on, close the door.

310
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,720
You're not leaving.

311
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,320
<i>Close the door.</i>

312
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,920
Just gimme the car keys.

313
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,720
No.

314
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,120
<i>Just.</i>

315
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,040
No!

316
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,720
I knew it.

317
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,600
You are not leaving
me for another man.

318
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,080
What?

319
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,360
<i>Lucy, I've heard</i>
<i>you on the phone with him!

320
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,280
Talking.
Laughing. Flirting.

321
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,120
<i>You, you</i>
<i>think I'm stupid!</i>

322
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,240
David. Maybe,

323
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,800
<i>maybe, you know,</i>
<i>we could talk to someone.</i>

324
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,560
We could get some help.

325
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,760
<i>Oh, really.</i>

326
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Oh, come on. No!

327
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,240
Help me.

328
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,800
Tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.

329
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,640
He thinks it's
someone else's baby.

330
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
<i>It's cold.</i>

331
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,280
<i>Where's David?</i>

332
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,160
What happened
to him, Lucy?

333
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,560
Lucy?

334
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,960
Show me.

335
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,320
<i>Hey, I haven't heard</i>
<i>from you in days.</i>

336
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,720
<i>Something bad</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

337
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,720
<i>Look,</i>

338
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,080
<i>maybe you're</i>
<i>going through some kind</i>
<i>of delayed shock here,</i>

339
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,640
<i>you never really dealt</i>
<i>with what Ben did to you.</i>

340
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
<i>What are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

341
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,720
<i>A few months ago</i>
<i>Ben broke into the apartment</i>

342
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,240
<i>he went crazy,</i>
<i>saying the baby</i>
<i>belonged to someone else.</i>

343
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,000
<i>I don't remember that.</i>

344
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,680
<i>He tried to drown</i>
<i>you in the bath, Alice.</i>

345
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,040
<i>You miscarried the next day.</i>

346
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,040
<i>You had a breakdown.</i>

347
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,360
<i>You have to stop</i>
<i>denying this.</i>

348
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,160
The missing tape.

349
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,480
You know if I had
the missing tape. If I
could find the missing tape.

350
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,920
<i>What are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>
<i>What missing tape?</i>

351
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,800
He was always filming.

352
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,840
Always. There was an
empty tape box. Then
there's obviously another tape.

353
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,040
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

354
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,840
If you could get
on the Internet.

355
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,040
Just find out,
look up everything

356
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,360
on the name David Woods.
David Woods. Okay.

357
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,800
<i>Who is David Woods?</i>

358
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,240
Can you not ask
questions! Just
do it, please?

359
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,360
<i>I'm still at</i>
<i>the hospital with my Mom.</i>
<i>I'll have to do it later.</i>

360
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,960
This is important.
Do you promise me
you're going to do it?

361
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,200
<i>I said I would.</i>

362
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,200
Thank you.

363
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,200
The woman in the mirror lies.

364
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,520
Hello.

365
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,240
<i>Ally, I checked on line</i>
<i>like you asked me to.</i>

366
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,000
What did you find out?

367
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,800
<i>David and Lucy Woods</i>
<i>were reported missing</i>
<i>May 5th 2006.</i>

368
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
I knew it.

369
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,800
Who reported them missing?

370
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,000
<i>David's mother. A few</i>
<i>days before he disappeared</i>

371
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,880
<i>he told his mother</i>
<i>that Lucy left him</i>
<i>for another man</i>

372
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,600
<i>and went back to Chicago.</i>
<i>They were only married</i>
<i>six months.</i>

373
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,960
<i>She was pregnant,</i>
<i>it says he had a history</i>

374
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,680
<i>of depression</i>
<i>and tried to kill</i>
<i>himself the year before</i>

375
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,960
<i>when Lucy</i>
<i>tried to call</i>
<i>off the engagement.</i>

376
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,240
<i>Alice, do you really</i>
<i>think he killed her?</i>

377
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,800
I don't know.

378
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,240
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>happened to David?</i>

379
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,760
I'll call you back.

380
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,160
<i>David.</i>

381
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,480
David, come on.

382
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,320
This this
is hurting my arms.

383
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,280
I know you
slept with him.

384
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,480
Admit it.

385
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,120
Say it!

386
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,080
David, you gotta
stop and think.

387
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,280
Think about
this. Jesus.

388
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,720
I swear to God.
I swear to God baby.

389
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,640
<i>You just</i>
<i>tell me the truth,</i>
<i>from the beginning</i>

390
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,240
and this will be over.

391
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,640
This is ridiculous.

392
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,760
<i>You called him</i>
<i>because you were lonely.</i>

393
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,960
<i>Because I neglected</i>
<i>you. And, right?</i>

394
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,200
David?

395
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,040
<i>It was Luke, wasn't it?</i>

396
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,800
Do you...? Luke?

397
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,320
Just say it.

398
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,520
<i>Marie was out of town,</i>

399
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,880
<i>and Luke was lonely too,</i>
<i>so you called him up and</i>

400
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,160
Oh, my God.

401
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,520
You seduced him.

402
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,080
<i>Oh my God.</i>

403
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,040
David, we're having a baby!

404
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,600
That thing's not my child.

405
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,720
Oh, no.

406
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,520
Say it.

407
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,720
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>the truth, Lucy.</i>

408
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,640
It's all I want,
it's just...

409
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,040
He, he, he,

410
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,560
I'll still love you.

411
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,600
Gosh!

412
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,400
I, uh...

413
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,560
Tsk. I seduced him.

414
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,040
<i>Come on, David.</i>

415
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,320
<i>Come on.</i>

416
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,640
Say it.

417
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,920
We made love and.

418
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,760
I only saw you, though.

419
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,200
Oh, oh.

420
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,520
Oh, shit.

421
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,120
David!

422
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,160
<i>David!</i>

423
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,080
<i>David!</i>

424
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,920
David.

425
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,120
David! David.

426
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,720
<i>No. No!</i>

427
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Phew.

428
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,800
Ugh.

429
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,720
Oh, Lucy.

430
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,880
Hello? Who's this?

431
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,600
<i>It's Ben.</i>

432
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,120
<i>Don't hang up, please.</i>

433
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,240
What do you want?

434
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,160
<i>Forgiveness.</i>

435
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,520
For what?

436
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,000
<i>While I was in prison</i>
<i>I thought about you a lot.</i>

437
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,200
<i>What I put you through.</i>

438
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,440
<i>The things</i>
<i>I said to you.</i>

439
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,360
<i>The baby.</i>

440
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,000
You're in the house.

441
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,840
You've been
in the house all along.
It's been you, watching me.

442
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,720
<i>No, I'm in Boston</i>
<i>with my mother.</i>

443
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,360
You're a liar.

444
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,280
<i>Please let me talk.</i>

445
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,040
<i>Look. I just need</i>
<i>to tell you that I'm sorry.</i>

446
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,520
<i>I'm sorry. And I know,</i>

447
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,400
<i>I know the baby was mine.</i>

448
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,560
<i>And I know that,</i>
<i>I know that I killed it!

449
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:06,720
<i>I'm sorry. I promise that</i>
<i>I'll never hurt you again.</i>

450
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,880
<i>I'm going to let</i>
<i>you go Alice. You're free.</i>

451
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,960
Lucy.

452
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,800
Lucy.

453
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,240
We're free now.

454
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,520
<i>David!</i>

455
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,280
<i>David. What are you doing?</i>

456
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,560
You damn idiot!
You damn fool!

457
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,320
<i>David.</i>

458
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,080
<i>Are you all right?</i>

459
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,920
<i>Lucy.</i>

460
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,120
Lucy?

461
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,720
<i>Alice? Where</i>
<i>have you been?</i>

462
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,440
<i>The gun. Where</i>
<i>did you put the gun?</i>

463
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,120
<i>What?</i>

464
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,280
<i>He's in the house.</i>
<i>He's going to kill me!</i>

465
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,280
<i>What?</i>

466
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,400
<i>David.</i>

467
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,000
<i>Who is David?</i>

468
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,000
Becky, we talked about
this. I told you about this.

469
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,080
<i>Alice, I haven't heard</i>
<i>from you all week. I've</i>
<i>been worried sick about you.</i>

470
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,960
<i>Are you still there?</i>

471
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,160
Why? Why did
you take the gun? Why?

472
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,080
<i>I couldn't leave</i>
<i>you with a gun.</i>

473
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,480
<i>No one's going</i>
<i>to hurt you, Alice.</i>

474
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,200
No! No!

475
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,360
No!

476
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,640
<i>David.</i>

477
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,000
Ah!

478
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,240
Ah!

479
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,000
Alice!

480
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,960
Oh, my God.

481
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,240
Alice?

482
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,360
Ugh.

483
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,080
Alice, what happened?

484
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,520
Come on, I've got you.

485
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,520
Oh.

486
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,480
Let me help you.

487
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,240
Let me help you.

488
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,840
No! No!

489
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,440
I don't want
to go in that bed!

490
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,040
Let me give you
some pills baby.

491
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,040
They're gonna
help you sleep.

492
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,360
Drink. Drink.
I'm sorry, baby.

493
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,200
<i>Da... uh, uh,</i>

494
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,360
<i>Da- Da- Da-</i>

495
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,760
<i>David's mother knew</i>
<i>that he killed Lucy.</i>

496
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,640
So she told the police

497
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,080
that they both went
missing to protect them.

498
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,840
And when she died
he moved back into the house

499
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,720
and he's been
here ever since.

500
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,280
<i>No, he...</i>

501
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,920
He was here.
He was in the house.

502
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:22,080
He's been watching me.
He's been watching me.

503
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,720
Shhhh. You have to rest.

504
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,680
<i>Just listen to what</i>
<i>I'm saying. Please,</i>

505
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,440
<i>I think someone died here.</i>

506
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,200
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

507
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,480
<i>David! We're having a baby!</i>

508
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,880
<i>David.</i>

509
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,160
<i>Ugh.</i>

510
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,960
I am so sorry
I left you alone.

511
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,480
I promise you
I will never leave
you alone again ever.

512
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,280
Okay?

513
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,880
<i>You look like</i>
<i>an angel when you sleep.</i>
