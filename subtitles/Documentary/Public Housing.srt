Subtitles Enhanced by "Dr.Zia R Khan".
Enjoy the Movie.

2
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,662
All right, get out of there.

3
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,208
Let's go.

4
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:10,874
<i>All the way down
and take a seat.</i>

5
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,420
<i>Let's go. Stop your dragging.
Let's go! Move!</i>

6
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,052
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

7
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:18,024
Let's go! Line up! Line up!
Move! Move! Right turn!

8
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,198
Stay with me!
Keep your head down!

9
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:26,783
Line up! Line up!

10
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,118
Everybody ready?
Come on.

11
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,286
Line up!
Get off me!

12
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:32,581
Come on.
- One...

13
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:34,875
Now march us to the changing rooms.
...2, 3.

14
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,501
Go. Let's go.
Line up!

15
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,131
I know you.

16
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:45,802
You just got paroled out of
here. You didn't last very long.

17
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,513
When was that?

18
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,140
8 weeks ago.

19
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,851
Did 9 years.

20
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,353
John. John Dillinger.

21
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,771
That's right.

22
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:58,982
My friends call me John.

23
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:04,154
But a son-of-a-bitch screw like you
better address me as Mr. Dillinger.

24
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:10,327
Open it! Open it or
I'll blow you in half.

25
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,455
Against the wall.

26
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:21,171
Take your clothes off, now!

27
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:22,964
You did it, kid.

28
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,174
Sure did, Walter.

29
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,511
Give me the goddamn jacket.

30
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,721
Red!

31
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:45,570
Come on. Hurry up!
- Get undressed. Take your clothes off.

32
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:46,780
Come on.

33
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,408
You eyeballing me,
you son of a bitch?

34
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:52,869
Cut it out, Shouse!

35
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,330
Shouse! Shouse!

36
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,049
Lockdown!

37
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,973
Bring them in from the yard!

38
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,359
There they are!

39
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,431
Walter! Come on.

40
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:37,475
Walter Dietrich's dead
'cause of you.

41
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:40,269
The bastard guard wouldn't
do what he was told, Johnny.

42
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:43,064
Homer?

43
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:44,690
Just let him
have it, Johnny.

44
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,775
Pete?

45
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,234
It's up to you.

46
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:13,886
How far is the farm?

47
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:15,971
3.2 miles.

48
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,082
We're ready!

49
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,209
Okay. Let's go!

50
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,213
Burn these, okay, honey?

51
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,091
Thanks for getting us out, Red.

52
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,300
It was Johnny's plan.

53
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,635
Yeah, but thanks.

54
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:05,104
Take me with you, mister.

55
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,023
I can't, darling. I'm sorry.

56
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,837
Welcome back, Pete.

57
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,592
Let's go to Chicago
and make some money.

58
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,214
Floyd, halt!

59
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,630
Melvin, look out!

60
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,096
Pretty Boy Floyd,
you are under arrest.

61
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:05,057
It's Charles. Charles Floyd.

62
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:10,521
Who are you? Melvin Purvis,
Bureau of Investigation.

63
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,440
Where is your friend,
Harry Campbell?

64
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,277
I believe you've killed me.

65
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,281
So you can go rot in hell.

66
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,697
Sport.

67
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,333
Red, call Oscar.
Okay.

68
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,087
Hi, there, doll.
Let's switch out the shorts.

69
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:18,297
We gonna use Berman?

70
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:20,758
Yeah. Get a Plymouth
and an Essex.

71
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,261
Where them other gals?

72
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:26,347
You get a hold of Marty?
Sure did.

73
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,473
How you doing, Mr. Johnny?

74
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:28,724
Doing great, Sport.

75
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:40,861
The main spring's too tight
on this one. Jammed twice.

76
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,988
I cut off one coil.

77
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,995
And it rides up
and to the right.

78
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,789
I widen port.

79
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,674
Hey, Red.
Hi, Harry.

80
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,388
Harry, this is Pete.
Pete, this is Harry Berman.

81
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:08,972
Hi, Pete. How you doing?

82
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,558
So, what do we got? Got a
couple of nice straight eights.

83
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,395
Bored them out. Rebuilt
the carburetors myself.

84
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,979
These are some really fast cars.

85
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,773
Perfect work cars for
a couple of gentlemen.

86
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,860
Johnny, how are you?
Good.

87
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,365
Marty,

88
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:30,327
tell me that me
and my boys are okay.

89
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:31,578
As long as you stay
in East Chicago,

90
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:34,081
you're in safe haven,
any time you want.

91
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:37,751
Extra cake's in here.

92
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:38,961
Thanks.

93
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:40,838
Hey, Anna.

94
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:45,050
I opened up in Chicago on Halsted
now. Come by and see the girls.

95
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:04,486
How are you?

96
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:11,660
On the floor! Now! Now! Do it!
Do it! On the floor, now! Now!

97
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,997
Let's play a game, Mr. President.
It's called Spin the Dial.

98
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,875
You, hands up!
Come on. And, you, sit down!

99
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,128
On the floor!

100
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:22,713
Relax, pops.

101
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,717
Open it up.

102
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:30,304
Empty it! Move, move!
Shut up!

103
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:31,847
It's one of these.

104
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,061
You can be a dead hero
or a live coward.

105
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:41,356
Get it open.
All of it!

106
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,942
You, hands up.
Come on!

107
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:46,778
Empty it! All of it!

108
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,655
Hey, sit down!

109
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,948
Push it to me!

110
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,077
And don't move!

111
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,552
We got company!

112
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,773
Move out of there!

113
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:36,620
You can put it away. Not here for
your money. Here for the bank's money.

114
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,163
I said, move it out of there!

115
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:39,373
What for?

116
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,463
Come here, sister.
Let's take a ride.

117
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,729
Get down!

118
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:41,518
Beat it.
You, too, sister.

119
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:46,773
Come here.

120
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,867
There you go, doll.
Something to remember me by.

121
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:05,042
You know, when I'm not doing
this, I'm a scout for the movies.

122
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:06,835
Really?

123
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:13,967
Join hands.

124
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,093
We'll freeze here!

125
00:16:15,178 --> 00:16:18,221
No. You'll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes.

126
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,121
Why do we
need this?

127
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,291
Because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines,

128
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:47,834
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction

129
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,212
because there is no federal
police force to stop them.

130
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,506
By my tally, your
Bureau wants to spend

131
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,800
more taxpayers' dollars
catching crooks

132
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,344
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place.

133
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:59,388
Well, that's ridiculous.
The Bureau has apprehended

134
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,806
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have

135
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,141
stolen up to and in excess of... Really?

136
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,353
How many have you
apprehended?

137
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:09,773
We have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons.

138
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:12,359
No, I mean you, Director
Hoover. How many?

139
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,277
Well, as Director, I administer.

140
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,447
How many have you
arrested personally?

141
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:24,371
I have never arrested anybody.

142
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,791
You've never arrested anybody.

143
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,459
Well, of course not.
I am an administrator.

144
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:31,628
With no field experience.

145
00:17:32,338 --> 00:17:35,340
You are shockingly
unqualified, aren't you, sir?

146
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,426
You have never
personally conducted

147
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,262
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life.

148
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,472
I think you're a front.

149
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,810
I think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth

150
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:50,605
created from the hoopla of headlines
by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there.

151
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,859
Crimebusters, G-men, you're
setting yourself up as a czar?

152
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:56,111
That's running wild in my estimation.

153
00:17:56,195 --> 00:17:57,654
A crime is what runs wild.

154
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:00,240
If this country requires
a Bureau such as yours,

155
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,784
I question whether you are
the person fit to run it.

156
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,413
Well, I will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians.

157
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,874
Your appropriation
increase is denied.

158
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,636
Feed the following
to Walter Winchell.

159
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:25,266
McKellar is a Neanderthal, and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me.

160
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,518
We will not contest him
in his committee room.

161
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,479
We will fight him on the front page.

162
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,190
Where is John Dillinger?

163
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,451
Agent Purvis, congratulations.

164
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,119
Thank you, sir.

165
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,163
May I ask why?
They're ready for him.

166
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:49,832
This is Henry Suydam. He is
our expert in press relations.

167
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,585
Congratulations
for Pretty Boy Floyd,

168
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:54,921
for which you have
my personal gratitude.

169
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,006
Second, you are, as of this moment,

170
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,009
the Special Agent in Charge
of the Chicago field office.

171
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:01,928
Are you up to that task, Agent Purvis?

172
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,513
Absolutely, sir.

173
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:09,811
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

174
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:16,067
Today, I am declaring the United
States of America's first War on Crime.

175
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:22,532
And I'd like to introduce one of our
finest G-men, Agent Melvin Purvis.

176
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:25,576
Agent Purvis will be in charge
of the field office in Chicago,

177
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:28,412
the center of the crime
wave sweeping America.

178
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:32,875
His task will be to get Public
Enemy Number 1, John Dillinger.

179
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:35,336
Director?
Mr. Purvis?

180
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,796
Say a few words, would you?

181
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:43,511
Mr. Purvis, how did you
run down Pretty Boy Floyd?

182
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,015
Through an apple orchard.

183
00:19:50,352 --> 00:19:52,395
Mr. Tolson, when he's done, you
tell him if he needs anything,

184
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,272
you'll get it for him.

185
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:57,275
And tell him he may call me J. E.

186
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,528
Yeah, but people say John Dillinger's
a lot smarter and a lot tougher.

187
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,197
Well, nevertheless,
we will get him.

188
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,907
What makes you so sure?

189
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,868
We have two things
Dillinger does not.

190
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,035
What are they?

191
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,998
The Bureau's modern techniques
of fighting crime scientifically

192
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,791
and the visionary leadership

193
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,626
of our Director, J. Edgar Hoover.

194
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,759
The broad over there is looking at me.

195
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:25,303
She likes me.

196
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,179
How you doing, sweetheart?

197
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,746
Alvin. Good to see you.

198
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,080
How you doing?

199
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:54,457
Homer. Pete.

200
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,922
Me, Freddy and Doc are
looking to snatch a fellow.

201
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:05,343
He's a Saint Paul banker, Ed
Bremer. We need a few more hands.

202
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,179
I don't like kidnapping.

203
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:11,515
Well, robbing banks is getting tougher.

204
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,601
The public don't like kidnapping.

205
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,728
Who gives a damn
what the public likes?

206
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:17,563
I do. I hide out among them.

207
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,315
We gotta care what they think.

208
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:21,859
We also got a mail train
we're looking at, too.

209
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:26,447
By the way, if somebody was to get
pinched, who knows their way around?

210
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:32,036
Syndicate lawyer named Piquett,
Louis Piquett. We all use him.

211
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,871
What's it all about, this train?

212
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,707
Needs two or three more real
right guys to stick it up.

213
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,459
Be ready in a couple of months.

214
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:43,214
About $1,700,000. It's a
Federal Reserve shipment.

215
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,592
It's the kind of score
you go away on after.

216
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,011
Where you gonna go?

217
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:53,599
I don't know. Brazil,
Cuba. I like Varadero Beach.

218
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,476
What about you?

219
00:21:56,269 --> 00:21:57,561
No plans.

220
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,522
Yeah, well, you ought to.

221
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,483
What we're doing
won't last forever.

222
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:04,735
We're having too
good a time today.

223
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,904
We ain't thinking
about tomorrow.

224
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:11,826
Keep me in mind on the train,
would you? All right. Thanks.

225
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,914
You know how much they made
taking that Hamm Brewery guy?

226
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,083
$100,000. Simmer down, Homer.

227
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:22,003
Come on, fellas.
Let's go to the bar.

228
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,005
I got three broads
convinced I own the place.

229
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,549
See you.

230
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,929
Is Homer staying
steady enough?

231
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,140
Homer's fine.

232
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:36,892
One rule I learned
from Walter Dietrich,

233
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:38,644
never work with people
who are desperate.

234
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,439
Yeah, well, I got a rule,
too. Stay away from the women.

235
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:47,486
Without women, it's
like back in the stir.

236
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:49,697
That's why they
invented whores.

237
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:52,575
Hey, hey, Anna.

238
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,243
How are you doing, big boy?

239
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,203
Who's this?
Veronica.

240
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,747
Veronica, Red.

241
00:22:57,831 --> 00:22:59,623
Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Anna.

242
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,065
I don't know why you gave
that fellow the go-by,

243
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:28,152
but I'm awful glad you did.

244
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,404
What's your name?

245
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:31,614
Billie Frechette.

246
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:35,701
Can I buy you a drink?

247
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:36,911
Okay.

248
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:42,708
You got a name?

249
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,545
Yeah.

250
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,507
Jack. You dance, Jack?

251
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:52,718
I don't know how.

252
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,054
Come on.

253
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,558
How come you don't
know how to dance?

254
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:01,852
Frechette.

255
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:03,896
That French?

256
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:07,858
On my father's side.
There's an "e" at the end.

257
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:09,860
This is a two-step.

258
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:12,029
Blackbird

259
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,495
Where somebody waits for me

260
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:26,544
Sugar's sweet, so is he

261
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:34,635
Daddy's French.
What's on the other side?

262
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:40,391
My mama's
a Menominee Indian, okay?

263
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:42,810
Most men don't like that.

264
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,480
I ain't most men.

265
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:47,648
Yeah?

266
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,278
And I've been a dice girl, and I
check coats at the Steuben Club.

267
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,076
And what do you do?

268
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:03,497
I'm catching up.

269
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,085
Meeting somebody like you,

270
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:11,338
dark and beautiful,

271
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,051
like that bird in that song.

272
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:22,391
Blackbird, bye-bye

273
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:28,606
No one here can love

274
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:34,528
Or understand me

275
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,159
You cold?

276
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:07,478
What is it exactly
you do for a living?

277
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:11,774
I'm John Dillinger. I rob banks.

278
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:18,239
That's where all these
people here put their money.

279
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,784
Why did you tell me that?

280
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,954
You could have made up a story.

281
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:26,580
I'm not gonna lie to you.

282
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:31,085
That's a serious thing to
say to a girl you just met.

283
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,336
I know you.

284
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,963
Well, I don't know you.

285
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,424
I haven't been anyplace.

286
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,843
Well, some of the places
I've been ain't so hot.

287
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,473
Where I'm going is
a whole lot better.

288
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,767
Want to come along?

289
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,186
Boy, you are in a hurry!

290
00:26:49,854 --> 00:26:53,065
If you were looking at what I'm
looking at, you'd be in a hurry, too.

291
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,608
Well,

292
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,611
it's me they're looking at this time.

293
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,530
You're beautiful.

294
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,949
They're looking at me
because they're not used to

295
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,867
having a girl in their restaurant

296
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:05,703
in a $3 dress.

297
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:08,831
Listen, doll.

298
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,626
That's 'cause they're all
about where people come from.

299
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:17,131
The only thing that's important
is where somebody's going.

300
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,509
Where are you going?

301
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:24,221
Anywhere I want.

302
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:33,731
Let's get out of here.

303
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,578
Hey, Johnny!

304
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,459
Go wait for me outside.

305
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:03,552
Gil.

306
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:08,599
Ever since I got out, I've
been working for Frank Nitti.

307
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:11,852
These guys are connected to
everybody all over the country now.

308
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:14,730
He looks like a barber.

309
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,622
Phil D'Andrea. Every time I
read about one of your bank jobs

310
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:34,458
where you give the customers
back their money, you crack me up.

311
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,837
You need anything, ask Gilbert.

312
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,547
Gilbert knows how to find me.

313
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,132
Thank you.

314
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,109
Where'd that girl go?
I don't know, sir.

315
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:01,985
She jumped in a cab
and took off.

316
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,075
<i>This is Lowell Thomas.</i>

317
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,785
<i>From West Virginia comes accusations</i>

318
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,246
<i>by the Carnegie CoaI company
of Red influence</i>

319
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,997
<i>on the United Mine Workers' strike.</i>

320
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:17,626
<i>Meanwhile, in Racine, Wisconsin,
after raiding the American Trust Bank,</i>

321
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,003
<i>Public Enemy Number 1,
John Dillinger,</i>

322
00:29:20,088 --> 00:29:23,090
<i>roams the wilds pursued

323
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:26,596
<i>And in Geneva, the League of Nations
voted the USSR full membership.</i>

324
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,555
According to the bank
teller, Barbara Patzke,

325
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,974
this is John Dillinger's coat.

326
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:34,852
It's made by Shragge
Quality out of St. Louis.

327
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:39,565
Price, $35, windproof
32-ounce wool. Top stitching.

328
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:41,817
Thank you, Agent Baum.

329
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,197
Agents in our offices
across the country

330
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:52,244
are identifying every store in the
United States that sold this overcoat.

331
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:55,706
Then we will cross-reference
every Dillinger associate

332
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,333
at locales where
that coat was sold.

333
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,294
He was in a place.

334
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,838
He got cold. He bought a coat.

335
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:05,674
Unless he was traveling through,

336
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,594
he was being harbored nearby.

337
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:10,345
If he returns, we will be there.

338
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,936
It is by such methods that our
Bureau will get John Dillinger.

339
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:19,856
Now, Doris,
would you please contact

340
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,234
the Chicago area telephone
exchange supervisors. There are six.

341
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,445
Request appointments for
Carter Baum and myself.

342
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,406
Gentlemen,

343
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:34,412
shortly you will be provided
Thompson submachine guns, BARs

344
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:37,582
and a.351 Winchester
semi-automatic rifle.

345
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:45,757
We are pursuing hardened
killers. They will be dangerous.

346
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:49,761
And those of you who aren't
prepared for that should go.

347
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:54,224
And if you are going
to go, please go now.

348
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:00,230
This is a phone call conversation

349
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:03,399
from a car dealership
from 27 minutes ago.

350
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:04,484
Harry Berman.

351
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:08,279
When you drop it, leave
the keys on the floorboard.

352
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,532
<i>I got a DeSoto.
Okay.</i>

353
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:12,200
<i>Interior's no good.</i>

354
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,952
How did we get to Berman?

355
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,328
Off the Dillinger coat.

356
00:31:15,412 --> 00:31:17,080
The coat was bought
in Cicero, lllinois,

357
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:19,457
a few doors down from
Berman's dealership.

358
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:23,378
Now, we know Berman. He's been supplying
cars to the Syndicate since Capone.

359
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:25,255
When Dillinger bought that coat,

360
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,215
he must have been at
Berman's switching cars.

361
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,009
As soon as they call to drop
the DeSoto, we'll tail it.

362
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:31,694
I want men on this...

363
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:33,471
around the clock.

364
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:44,732
May I check your coat, sir?

365
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:46,025
Yes, thank you.

366
00:31:48,028 --> 00:31:49,153
You ran out on me.

367
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:51,030
You left me standing
on the sidewalk.

368
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:52,574
If you're gonna be my girl,

369
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:55,910
you're gonna have to swear to me
that you'll never ever do that again.

370
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,204
Hey, I'm not your girl.
Brown overcoat.

371
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,581
And I'm not
gonna say that.

372
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,749
I'm waiting.
So am I.

373
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:05,128
"I'm never gonna run out on
you ever again." Say the words.

374
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:06,921
No.
My coat.

375
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,215
Well, I ain't ever gonna run
out on you, and that's a promise.

376
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,551
Well, I want to run
out of here, so, lady...

377
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:31,821
Hit the road, sport.
Keep the tip.

378
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:36,784
You ain't getting other people's
hats and coats no more neither.

379
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,119
Why'd you do that?

380
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:39,954
'Cause you're with me now.

381
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,081
I don't know anything about you.

382
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,792
I was raised on a farm
in Mooresville, Indiana.

383
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:46,002
My mama died when I was 3.

384
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:49,631
My daddy beat the hell out of me 'cause
he didn't know no better way to raise me.

385
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:54,969
I like baseball, movies, good
clothes, fast cars, whiskey and you.

386
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:57,972
What else you need to know?

387
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:35,426
Have a seat.

388
00:33:38,222 --> 00:33:39,389
You been living here long?

389
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah.

390
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,600
Since yesterday.

391
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:47,897
Hey.

392
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:01,119
I got you something.

393
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:04,015
When I was a girl,

394
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,601
we went to live on the
reservation in Flandreau

395
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,519
'cause my daddy died.

396
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:13,274
In Flandreau,
nothing ever happened.

397
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:17,779
And when I was 13, I went to live
in Milwaukee with my Aunt Ines.

398
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,200
We had a lot of
Indian friends,

399
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:26,162
and we went around to
churches and put on plays.

400
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,709
And nothing exciting ever
happened there, either.

401
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:36,798
So I haven't been anywhere or done
anything except come to Chicago

402
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,717
and try to make my way.

403
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:04,158
You're all packed.

404
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:11,541
Well, baby,

405
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:17,964
I'm gonna take you with me.

406
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:25,054
And you're gonna start a whole
new exciting kind of life.

407
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:32,895
And what do you want?

408
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,109
Everything.

409
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:42,655
Right now.

410
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:50,705
Purvis.

411
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:54,083
Berman dropped the DeSoto at
Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago.

412
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,754
Men go in and out of an apartment
rented to a Miss Vi Scott.

413
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,341
They carry heavy suitcases. One
of them looks like Dillinger.

414
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:11,392
Where are your men?

415
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:13,561
In cars on Clarendon
and Wilson Avenue.

416
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,146
Blocking vehicles?
The alley?

417
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,441
Who has a line of sight
on the DeSoto to you?

418
00:37:25,198 --> 00:37:28,618
Are they aware that we are
here? Any rapid movements?

419
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:29,827
No.

420
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:33,164
Carter,

421
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,418
you keep an eye on
the DeSoto from there.

422
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,840
Barton, you're with me.

423
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:14,789
Yes?

424
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,377
I'm Special Agent Melvin
Purvis, Miss Scott.

425
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,170
Are you here by yourself?

426
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,464
No. I'm here with my fiancé.

427
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:24,966
And what is your fiancé's name?

428
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,093
Leonard McHenry.

429
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,638
May we come in?

430
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:31,806
Well, please.

431
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,766
I'm perfectly safe,
but come on in.

432
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,313
Something wrong?

433
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:41,816
You have identification?

434
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:44,527
Yeah, sure.

435
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:48,614
Honey, would you get my driver's
license? It's in my jacket pocket.

436
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:49,740
Sure.

437
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:52,118
I know you.

438
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,286
You're...

439
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,789
You're Melvin Purvis. Right?

440
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,292
Yeah. I seen your picture.

441
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:03,879
And what do you do
for a living, Leonard?

442
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:05,965
I travel in ladies' shoes.

443
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:08,676
Show him, honey.

444
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,846
Cute, huh?

445
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:19,603
Well, you enjoy the rest
of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.

446
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:21,731
Thanks.
Good night.

447
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:33,659
No one in or out. I'll get
the others. You stay here.

448
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:36,120
You watch that door
from right there.

449
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:43,753
Get the men
from Sheridan.

450
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:16,660
Bureau of Investigation.
What's your name?

451
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:19,663
You wanna know my name?

452
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,173
Come on.

453
00:40:31,134 --> 00:40:33,385
Baum, you keep an eye
on the alley.

454
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,398
Barton?

455
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:49,443
Barton.

456
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:30,985
Where is he?

457
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:43,581
They're headed east!

458
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:45,749
Who was in the blocking car?

459
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,168
That was us.

460
00:41:49,254 --> 00:41:52,089
We heard gunfire
so we came here.

461
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:56,635
Who was it? Dillinger?

462
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:03,017
The man we let get away
wasn't John Dillinger.

463
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,060
That was Baby Face Nelson.

464
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,839
Get on the floor!
Now! Go!

465
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:34,299
Y'all get up against that wall.

466
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:36,426
Go on, all of you.
- This is a stick-up! Up!

467
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:38,386
Put them up! Up!

468
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:40,013
Down on the floor,
now! Down!

469
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:41,598
Put them up! Come on.
Put them up!

470
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:43,099
This is a stick-up!

471
00:42:43,684 --> 00:42:45,143
Let's go. Come on.
Up!

472
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,853
Where I can see them, up!

473
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:50,482
Customers, stay calm.
Don't move.

474
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,151
Hey! You! Up!

475
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:57,822
<i>Hands up!
Move! Empty it!</i>

476
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:01,660
John Dillinger held up
a bank for $74,000

477
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:03,954
while you failed to arrest Nelson.

478
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:06,164
Sir, I take full responsibility.

479
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,584
And I would like
to make a request.

480
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:12,504
<i>That we transfer men with
special qualifications</i>

481
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:14,506
<i>to augment the staff
here in Chicago.</i>

482
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:16,591
There are some former
Texas and Oklahoma lawmen

483
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:18,885
currently with the Bureau in Dallas.

484
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,013
<i>I thought you understood
what I'm building.</i>

485
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:25,642
A modern force of professional
young men of the best sort.

486
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:29,479
I'm afraid our type
cannot get the job done.

487
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:31,648
Excuse me, I cannot hear you.

488
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:34,609
<i>Our type cannot get the job done.</i>

489
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:36,069
I cannot hear you.

490
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:39,739
Our type cannot
get the job done.

491
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:42,200
<i>Without qualified help,</i>

492
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:44,744
I would have to resign
this appointment.

493
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,122
Otherwise, I am leading
my men to slaughter.

494
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,669
Mr. Tolson will call you,
Agent Purvis.

495
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,075
Did he say what he looked like?

496
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,368
Didn't say.

497
00:44:25,453 --> 00:44:26,494
You gentlemen need any help?

498
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:27,662
Thank you, no.

499
00:44:44,055 --> 00:44:45,388
Shine?
Morning.

500
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,432
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.

501
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:52,562
Agent Winstead?

502
00:44:53,147 --> 00:44:54,939
That's right.
It's a pleasure.

503
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,069
Welcome to Chicago. We have a lot
of work to do here on Mr. Dillinger.

504
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:00,945
Another time.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

505
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,238
Have a nice day.

506
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:26,971
Put Johnny Patton down front
on the other four tracks.

507
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,101
It's hot out, right?

508
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:32,602
Yes, Frank.

509
00:45:32,978 --> 00:45:35,522
Ever since those pricks
shot me, I can't get warm.

510
00:45:38,317 --> 00:45:39,401
What?

511
00:45:39,485 --> 00:45:41,277
Some people from
Chicago over there.

512
00:45:50,162 --> 00:45:51,371
Johnny.

513
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:53,832
What do you say we meet you
in Tucson around the 25th?

514
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,500
Okay.
All right.

515
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,710
I heard one today.
Indiana paper,

516
00:45:57,795 --> 00:46:00,964
"Wanted, John Dillinger,
dead or dead."

517
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,637
I think we wore out
the Midwest for a while.

518
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:13,226
What?

519
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,938
Come out to the Colonial tonight.
It's our joint. Be my guest.

520
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:19,274
The best steaks in Miami.

521
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:21,943
You're not gonna
take our picture, are you?

522
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:23,695
No pictures.

523
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,196
All right. We'll be there.

524
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,075
Thank you for taking me
on this trip.

525
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:32,662
You going somewhere, doll?
Am I?

526
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:35,582
No.
Don't kid a kidder.

527
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,792
Then don't play me for a fool.

528
00:46:37,877 --> 00:46:40,879
We both know I end up back
checking coats at the Steuben Club,

529
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:42,297
one way or the other.

530
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,673
What does that mean?

531
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:47,302
You don't think past today
or tomorrow. And eventually,

532
00:46:47,386 --> 00:46:48,970
they will catch you or kill you

533
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:51,514
and I don't want to be
there when that happens.

534
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:53,933
Who gave you a crystal ball?

535
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:55,810
I don't need one.

536
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,270
Ask Homer.

537
00:46:58,189 --> 00:46:59,230
Ask Homer what?

538
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:01,900
And his goddamn joke,
"dead or dead."

539
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:09,908
You ain't going nowhere,
you hear me?

540
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:12,368
I'm gonna die an old man
in your arms.

541
00:47:12,912 --> 00:47:14,370
We're too good for them.

542
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,707
They ain't tough enough,
smart enough or fast enough.

543
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:20,335
I hit any bank I want any time.

544
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:23,630
They got to be at
every bank all the time.

545
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,050
That's why we're
on top of the world.

546
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:29,636
Ain't nobody
lay a glove on us.

547
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:31,679
No.

548
00:47:32,932 --> 00:47:36,351
I ain't going nowhere.
Neither are you.

549
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,937
What do you got
to say about that?

550
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:15,932
Hi, folks.

551
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,769
Afternoon. Got a reservation for
a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan.

552
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,110
I can send up some sandwiches
and beer if you like.

553
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:28,486
That'd be swell.

554
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:30,572
Some friends of mine
should be here already,

555
00:48:30,656 --> 00:48:32,657
a J.C. Davies and a Mr. Clark?

556
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:35,034
Out shopping, I believe.

557
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,619
I'll let them know you're
in when they get back.

558
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:37,829
Okey-doke.

559
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:42,417
The elevator's
right down that way.

560
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:43,960
Thank you very much.

561
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:20,413
You look like you
could use some company.

562
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:25,168
How's about me and my friend Prince
Albert come and pay you a visit?

563
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,505
Get on in here, both of you.

564
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,143
Johnny! Johnny!

565
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,273
Put some clothes on, miss.

566
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:54,113
What the hell
happened, boys?

567
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:56,658
There was a fire in the hotel.

568
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:02,163
Firemen found our guns.
They called the cops.

569
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:03,289
Where they taking you?

570
00:50:03,374 --> 00:50:04,874
We're getting
shanghaied to Ohio.

571
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,084
Where's Billie?

572
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:18,012
Your girl's been put on
a bus back to Chicago.

573
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:19,847
We ain't holding her.

574
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,453
Right this way.

575
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:54,757
Well,

576
00:50:57,803 --> 00:51:00,304
here's the man who
killed Pretty Boy Floyd.

577
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:04,809
Damn good thing he was pretty,
'cause he sure wasn't Whiz Kid Floyd.

578
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:12,483
Tell me something,
Mr. Purvis.

579
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:16,154
That fellow, the one who got
killed at the Sherone Apartments,

580
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:21,325
the newspaper said
you found him alive.

581
00:51:24,955 --> 00:51:26,414
It's the eyes, ain't it?

582
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,585
They look at you
right before they go.

583
00:51:34,548 --> 00:51:38,176
And then they just
drift away into nothing.

584
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,807
That'll keep you up nights.

585
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,854
And what keeps you up
nights, Mr. Dillinger?

586
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:55,693
Coffee.

587
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:05,077
You act like a confident
man, Mr. Purvis.

588
00:52:05,162 --> 00:52:06,704
You got a few qualities.

589
00:52:07,164 --> 00:52:09,457
Probably pretty good
from a distance,

590
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:11,959
especially when you got
the fellow outnumbered.

591
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:13,711
But up close, toe to toe,

592
00:52:14,379 --> 00:52:17,381
when somebody's about to
die right here, right now,

593
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:21,886
I'm used to that.

594
00:52:23,514 --> 00:52:24,722
What about you?

595
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:27,058
Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.

596
00:52:28,268 --> 00:52:29,852
I'll see you down the road.

597
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:34,690
No, you will not.

598
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,070
The only way that you
will leave a jail cell

599
00:52:39,154 --> 00:52:41,614
is when we take you out
to execute you.

600
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,452
Well, we'll see about that.

601
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,999
You ought to get yourself
another line of work, Melvin.

602
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:05,137
Hey, I was just kidding.

603
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:08,307
I believe I'm gonna let you
boys keep me here a while.

604
00:53:10,227 --> 00:53:13,396
We'd like that, Johnny, but
don't get too comfortable.

605
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:15,481
They're moving you.

606
00:53:15,566 --> 00:53:16,566
Where to?

607
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,942
Indiana.

608
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:20,653
Why?

609
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,615
I have absolutely nothing
I want to do in Indiana.

610
00:56:09,782 --> 00:56:10,949
He's here.

611
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,915
Back up, fellas.
Back up.

612
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,466
We'll take custody now.
Take the manacles off.

613
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,892
Are you glad
to see Indiana again?

614
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,894
About as glad as Indiana
is to see me, I suppose.

615
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:42,397
Did you smuggle the guns into
Indiana State Penitentiary

616
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,232
for the big break
of September 26th?

617
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,485
Right now, you're
too inquisitive, buddy.

618
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,737
Put your arm
around Dillinger.

619
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:54,993
Hey, when was the last time
you were in Mooresville?

620
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,287
Ten years ago.

621
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,833
I was a wild boy, and,
well, I was foolish.

622
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,835
I held up a grocery store,

623
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,172
which I never should have done
'cause Mr. Morgan was a good man.

624
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:12,344
And they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a $50 theft.

625
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:18,141
When I was in prison,
I met a lot of good fellows.

626
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:20,268
So sure, yeah,

627
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,980
I helped set up the break
at Michigan City. Why not?

628
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,025
I stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me.

629
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,070
Johnny, how long does it
take you to go through a bank?

630
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:35,075
Oh, about one minute,
40 seconds.

631
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,118
Flat.

632
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,287
Let's go.

633
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,602
Mr. Johnny, your lawyer's here.

634
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,205
You come highly recommended
by Alvin Karpis.

635
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,001
At the arraignment,

636
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:29,296
they're gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen.

637
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,215
What can you do for me?

638
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:34,467
What's on your mind?

639
00:58:36,053 --> 00:58:37,429
The electric chair.

640
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:54,112
Your Honor, are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation

641
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,783
or is the State to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice?

642
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,163
The very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice!

643
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,875
The clanging of shackles
brings to our minds

644
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:08,543
the dungeons of the czars,

645
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,546
not the flag-bedecked liberty
of an American courtroom.

646
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:15,008
I request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith.

647
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:17,052
This is a very dangerous
man, Your Honor.

648
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,929
And I'm responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner.

649
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,390
Are you a lawyer? What right do
you have to address this court?

650
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:26,269
All right. Remove the
shackles from the prisoner.

651
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:30,232
Your Honor, we would like
to relocate the prisoner.

652
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,692
Only Indiana State
Penitentiary in Michigan City

653
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,195
can guarantee
Dillinger will not escape.

654
00:59:35,279 --> 00:59:36,947
Sheriff Holley?
I concur, Your Honor.

655
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,200
Sheriff Holley, I think this is a
very nice jail you have right here.

656
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,410
What makes you think there's
something wrong with it?

657
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,954
There's nothing wrong with my jail.

658
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,455
It's the strongest jail in Indiana.

659
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:47,290
That's what I thought.

660
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,210
But of course, I don't want
to embarrass Mrs. Holley.

661
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,255
I appreciate she's a woman
and she's afraid of an escape.

662
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,173
Oh, no. I'm not afraid
of an escape.

663
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,385
I can take care of John
Dillinger or any other prisoner.

664
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:02,055
Okay.

665
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:04,140
Dillinger will stay here.

666
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,684
Thank you, Your Honor.

667
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,979
The defense will need four
months to prepare itself.

668
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,855
It should take 10 days.

669
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,234
To go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad.

670
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:15,568
There's a law against lynching.

671
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,820
There's a law against murder!

672
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,697
Then observe the law part.

673
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,284
Or just stand Dillinger
up against a wall

674
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,078
and shoot him.
Just shoot him.

675
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:27,998
Then there's no need to throw away
the State's money on this mockery.

676
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,499
Calm down.

677
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,085
I apologize to the court.

678
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:35,213
Bob and I respect
each other very much.

679
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:39,384
Watch out or he'll be putting
his arm around you, too.

680
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,180
Trial starts in one
month on March 12th.

681
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,270
Attaboy, counselor.

682
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,310
Open the gate.

683
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,111
Hey, Cahoon!

684
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,115
Come here a minute.

685
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,829
Come on, Sam.

686
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,332
You and me's going places.

687
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:00,590
Call Bryant.

688
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,967
Bryant?

689
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:16,981
Call Max.

690
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,026
I'll kill you if I have
to. Don't think I won't.

691
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,655
Open up!

692
01:03:03,904 --> 01:03:05,488
I'll plug him right here.

693
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:13,621
Open the gun safe.
Go on. Open it up!

694
01:03:30,032 --> 01:03:31,240
Lock up the warden.

695
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:32,992
That wasn't real, was it?

696
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,500
Let's go.

697
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:04,273
Put your hands up!

698
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:06,275
Which one of these
here cars is the fastest?

699
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,820
That would be that Ford right
there. It's got the new V-8.

700
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:10,738
We're gonna take
that one. Go on.

701
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:16,828
That's Sheriff Lillian
Holley's personal car.

702
01:04:16,912 --> 01:04:18,037
Good.

703
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:42,622
Mr. Youngblood,
are we clear now?

704
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,374
We are.

705
01:05:58,388 --> 01:05:59,640
Okay, then.

706
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:02,809
Oh, come on, buddy.

707
01:06:04,896 --> 01:06:07,397
You gotta relax a little bit.
Just take it easy.

708
01:06:07,482 --> 01:06:10,651
Do you know the words
to The Last Round-Up?

709
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:14,446
<i>Get along, little dogies</i>

710
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:16,365
<i>Get along, get along</i>

711
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:19,159
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along</i>

712
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:23,747
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along</i>

713
01:06:24,499 --> 01:06:27,000
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along</i>

714
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:32,839
<i>I'm a-headed for
the last round-up</i>

715
01:06:33,925 --> 01:06:35,801
How did he act?
Was he jolly?

716
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:37,678
Yes. He sang
part of the way.

717
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,684
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along</i>

718
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:47,104
<i>While in Washington today,
President Roosevelt said,</i>

719
01:06:47,188 --> 01:06:48,814
<i>"John Dillinger
is making a mockery</i>

720
01:06:48,898 --> 01:06:51,191
<i>"of the system of justice
in this country."</i>

721
01:06:51,901 --> 01:06:55,445
<i>The passing of John J. McGraw, long-time
manager of the New York Giants...</i>

722
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:06,873
Hello.
Hey, doll, it's me.

723
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,750
Look, I can't talk long.
You okay?

724
01:07:08,835 --> 01:07:09,876
Yeah.

725
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:12,462
I heard it on the radio.
How about you?

726
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:14,298
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

727
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:16,717
Don't come to Chicago, Johnny.

728
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:19,386
What's that supposed to mean?

729
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:21,930
I promised I'd look after you,
didn't I?

730
01:07:22,015 --> 01:07:23,223
Yes.

731
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:24,599
Well, then that's
what I'm gonna do.

732
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:27,644
You know that, don't you?

733
01:07:27,937 --> 01:07:29,062
Yes.

734
01:07:31,065 --> 01:07:32,941
Look, I think
they're watching me.

735
01:07:34,736 --> 01:07:36,820
I'm gonna come get you out
of there and take care of you.

736
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:39,448
Baby, don't come to Chicago!

737
01:07:39,532 --> 01:07:40,782
Say you know it.

738
01:07:44,162 --> 01:07:45,579
Say it.

739
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,500
I know you will take care of me.

740
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:55,672
I love you.

741
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:20,113
Sooner or later,

742
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,116
she will go to him

743
01:08:24,494 --> 01:08:26,453
or he is gonna come for her.

744
01:08:46,307 --> 01:08:49,476
Say, Sport! Mr. Johnny, you
got to hold it right there.

745
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,942
Can't stay here
no more, Mr. Johnny.

746
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:01,238
Says who?

747
01:09:01,322 --> 01:09:04,324
Sport's only following orders.
So am I.

748
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:06,576
They thought you might come here.

749
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:08,829
I don't get it.

750
01:09:09,705 --> 01:09:11,415
Talk to your pal Gilbert.

751
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:12,833
About what?

752
01:09:13,418 --> 01:09:15,252
You gotta talk to Gilbert Catena.

753
01:09:28,015 --> 01:09:30,684
Come on. Come on, get out
of here! Beat it! Scram!

754
01:09:32,645 --> 01:09:34,354
The welcome mat was not out.

755
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:37,190
I kept hearing your name.
Now, I'm going to ask you once.

756
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:39,526
And I just did.

757
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:04,134
Anybody see him come in?

758
01:10:04,218 --> 01:10:05,427
I don't think so.

759
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:17,355
You want to know
if we're armed?

760
01:10:18,483 --> 01:10:19,733
We're armed.

761
01:10:22,904 --> 01:10:24,112
Calm down.

762
01:10:26,407 --> 01:10:27,949
Calm down. Calm down.

763
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:31,369
Hey, back to work.

764
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:35,415
What's the deal, Phil?

765
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,501
Look around. What do you see?

766
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:39,836
A whole bunch of telephones.

767
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:40,962
You see money.

768
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:43,924
Last month, there were
independent wire services

769
01:10:44,008 --> 01:10:47,677
letting bookies know who won the
third race at Sportsman's Park,

770
01:10:47,762 --> 01:10:52,098
300 of them nationwide.
Now there's only one, ours.

771
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:55,685
On October 23rd, you robbed a
bank in Greencastle, Indiana.

772
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,647
You got away with $74,802.

773
01:10:58,731 --> 01:11:00,690
You thought that was a big score.

774
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:02,734
These phones make that every day.

775
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,363
And it keeps getting made,
day after day after day,

776
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:09,866
a river of money, and
it gets deeper and wider,

777
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:14,246
week in and week out, month in
and month out, flowing right to us.

778
01:11:18,459 --> 01:11:20,418
Unless the cops
come through that door.

779
01:11:20,503 --> 01:11:22,462
Which you pay them not to do.

780
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,005
Right.

781
01:11:25,299 --> 01:11:27,342
Unless you're around.

782
01:11:27,426 --> 01:11:30,262
Then they gotta come through
that door no matter what.

783
01:11:30,346 --> 01:11:31,680
What does that tell you?

784
01:11:31,764 --> 01:11:33,014
I'm popular.

785
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:36,226
It tells us you're bad for business.

786
01:11:37,311 --> 01:11:39,396
So the Syndicate's got a new policy.

787
01:11:40,106 --> 01:11:44,109
All the guys like you,
Karpis, Nelson, Campbell,

788
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,029
we ain't laundering your
money or bonds no more.

789
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,407
You ain't holing up in
our whorehouses anymore.

790
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:55,829
No armorers, no doctors, no safe
havens, no nothing. You get it?

791
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:04,838
Personally, you need
something to tide you over?

792
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:12,262
Good luck to you.

793
01:12:15,725 --> 01:12:19,102
Hamilton has a 34-year-old
sister in Detroit. Arrest her.

794
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:23,481
Pick up all known Dillinger
associates, doctors, family,

795
01:12:23,566 --> 01:12:25,609
Pierpont's mother in Indianapolis,

796
01:12:25,693 --> 01:12:27,611
Dillinger's family in Mooresville.

797
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:29,863
We suspect them of harboring.

798
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:33,033
But Hamilton's family has not
had word from Red in years.

799
01:12:33,534 --> 01:12:35,869
You convince them to get word.

800
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,455
Create informants, Agent Purvis.

801
01:12:38,539 --> 01:12:41,374
The suspects are to be
interrogated vigorously, grilled,

802
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:43,835
no obsolete notions
of sentimentality.

803
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:45,962
We are in the modern age.
We are making history.

804
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:48,298
Take direct, expedient action.

805
01:12:48,382 --> 01:12:51,468
As they say in Italy these days,
"Take off the white gloves!"

806
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:54,346
Do we understand each
other, Agent Purvis?

807
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:03,229
These are fine young men
here. What's your name, son?

808
01:13:03,314 --> 01:13:04,397
Harris.

809
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:08,818
G- men all over the country
have picked up the gauntlet

810
01:13:08,903 --> 01:13:11,529
flung down by the outlaws
and the wanton murderers.

811
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:12,947
And these junior
crime fighters here,

812
01:13:13,032 --> 01:13:15,659
these Junior G-men, has,
every one of them,

813
01:13:15,743 --> 01:13:17,577
stopped some crime
from occurring

814
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:20,705
and forestalled an entry into
the black book of criminal deeds.

815
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:23,541
Today, I am rewarding them
with these medals.

816
01:13:23,626 --> 01:13:26,336
My friend Harris here is
the first. Well done, son.

817
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,838
You can size up a score like
nobody's business, Tommy.

818
01:13:28,923 --> 01:13:30,215
You're a good egg.

819
01:13:31,425 --> 01:13:33,677
But I don't like
Baby Face Nelson.

820
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:37,430
You got Nelson all wrong, John.
He thinks the world of you.

821
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:41,226
Hell, the whole country
thinks you're a goddamn hero.

822
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:44,020
Where's the bank?

823
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:45,522
Sioux Falls.

824
01:13:45,606 --> 01:13:48,358
Nelson says there's
$800,000 in there.

825
01:13:48,818 --> 01:13:50,777
Says he's got us a sweet
little place to hole up

826
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:53,196
till after the heat blows over.

827
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,656
What's he here for?

828
01:13:56,283 --> 01:14:00,870
John, we gotta all be friends, all
right, or this ain't gonna work.

829
01:14:00,955 --> 01:14:05,208
Red told you, after the bank,
we bust out Pierpont and Makley.

830
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:07,210
It'll take a lot
of careful planning.

831
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:09,045
Yeah. So?

832
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:12,465
<i>...and Public Enemy Number 1,
John Dillinger.</i>

833
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:16,803
<i>They may be sitting amongst you.</i>

834
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:21,850
<i>They may be in your row.</i>

835
01:14:31,277 --> 01:14:32,694
<i>Turn to your right.</i>

836
01:14:36,157 --> 01:14:37,824
<i>And turn to your left.</i>

837
01:14:39,326 --> 01:14:43,413
<i>If you see them, call the Bureau of
Investigation or your local police.</i>

838
01:14:56,761 --> 01:14:57,969
After the bank,

839
01:14:58,053 --> 01:15:01,264
we'll figure out if we
can bust them out. Okay?

840
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:07,645
Okay.

841
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:22,869
"You don't work with
people you don't know

842
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:24,245
"and you don't work
when you're desperate."

843
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:26,414
Walter Dietrich.
Remember that?

844
01:15:26,707 --> 01:15:28,208
Walter forgot.

845
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:31,795
When you're desperate,
that's when you got no choice.

846
01:15:47,895 --> 01:15:49,312
I got one!

847
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:01,324
What are you doing? Get your
hands up! Get your hands up!

848
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,332
Come on, sugar,
let's go. Come on.

849
01:16:11,043 --> 01:16:13,044
Where's all the damn money
we came here for?

850
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:22,011
Come on.

851
01:16:22,346 --> 01:16:23,972
Open the door. What
are you looking at, huh?

852
01:16:25,599 --> 01:16:27,100
What are you looking at?

853
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:51,958
Tommy.

854
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,939
John, let's go!

855
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:23,448
Let's go!
Get in the goddamn car!

856
01:17:25,117 --> 01:17:27,076
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

857
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:39,149
How'd you find
this place?

858
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:41,777
Don't worry. Nobody
will find us. Come on.

859
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:52,830
How much?

860
01:18:53,415 --> 01:18:55,833
$46, 120.

861
01:18:58,253 --> 01:19:01,171
That'd be less than
$800,000. Am I right?

862
01:19:03,883 --> 01:19:05,092
Am I right?

863
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,136
It's $8,000 a man.

864
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:13,851
Leave me my share and get out.

865
01:19:35,373 --> 01:19:37,624
We gotta cut loose from Nelson.

866
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:39,334
You gotta rest up a while.

867
01:19:39,919 --> 01:19:41,170
No.

868
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:45,340
No. If we don't get out of
here first thing in the morning,

869
01:19:46,134 --> 01:19:47,134
we're gonna wind up dead.

870
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:48,802
Only you're gonna make it.

871
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,600
God damn it, don't talk like that, Red.

872
01:19:54,684 --> 01:19:57,644
No, Johnny. I got a
feeling that my time is up.

873
01:19:58,563 --> 01:20:00,814
And when your time is up,
your time's up.

874
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:06,320
Red,

875
01:20:07,822 --> 01:20:08,822
look here.

876
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,953
Tomorrow morning, Homer,
you and me will go to Reno,

877
01:20:15,997 --> 01:20:17,372
and everything will be fine.

878
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,268
Give me a shot.

879
01:20:38,353 --> 01:20:40,354
I'll give you the shot if you
tell me where the gang's holed up.

880
01:20:40,438 --> 01:20:41,980
I don't know anything.
Where's Baby Face Nelson?

881
01:20:42,065 --> 01:20:43,190
I don't know!
Where's Dillinger?

882
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:44,316
I wanna know where
they are. I don't know!

883
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,734
Tell me! Where are they?

884
01:20:46,528 --> 01:20:48,070
The bullet entered
the back of his head.

885
01:20:48,154 --> 01:20:49,613
It's resting over his right eye.

886
01:20:49,697 --> 01:20:50,739
Do not interfere.

887
01:20:50,865 --> 01:20:52,699
Do not interfere. His brain is
swelling! He will be dead soon!

888
01:20:52,784 --> 01:20:54,701
He's suffering and I
need to sedate him!

889
01:20:54,786 --> 01:20:55,911
Not yet.

890
01:20:55,995 --> 01:20:57,830
If you interfere,
I will arrest you.

891
01:20:57,914 --> 01:21:01,917
I don't know! Please, give
me a shot! Oh, mother, please!

892
01:21:02,001 --> 01:21:03,794
Tell me where he is!
I don't know!

893
01:21:03,878 --> 01:21:04,962
All right.

894
01:21:06,756 --> 01:21:07,840
Where?

895
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:12,344
Tell me!

896
01:21:14,013 --> 01:21:15,764
Little Bohemia.

897
01:21:15,849 --> 01:21:17,432
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

898
01:21:18,059 --> 01:21:19,393
Fuck you!

899
01:21:23,106 --> 01:21:24,481
Give me a shot.

900
01:21:38,288 --> 01:21:41,623
Little Bohemia is in
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

901
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,500
Sam, you drive up.

902
01:23:07,126 --> 01:23:11,922
Madala and Clegg, you cut through
the woods. Stay in the trees.

903
01:23:12,006 --> 01:23:13,340
Come up on it
from the south,

904
01:23:13,424 --> 01:23:16,426
close enough to see if
they're in the barroom there.

905
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:18,512
Rice, Rorer,

906
01:23:21,015 --> 01:23:23,850
come up on it from the
north. The kitchen is there.

907
01:23:24,686 --> 01:23:27,729
You see if they're in what is probably
the dining room. You stay in the trees.

908
01:23:27,855 --> 01:23:29,773
And if he sees them in there? We go in.

909
01:23:29,857 --> 01:23:31,191
And if he doesn't?

910
01:23:33,861 --> 01:23:35,195
We go in anyway.

911
01:23:37,073 --> 01:23:38,907
There's too much
real estate out here.

912
01:23:38,992 --> 01:23:40,242
Too many ways for him
to get out,

913
01:23:40,326 --> 01:23:42,619
too few of us to block him in.

914
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,579
We need to blockade
the roads behind us.

915
01:23:44,664 --> 01:23:47,416
We need to wait for Cowley's
group to surround him.

916
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,710
Mr. Purvis, this is
not the way to do it.

917
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,215
I will not risk their
escaping the Bureau again.

918
01:23:57,135 --> 01:23:59,803
You and Hurt take the northeast
corner where the road turns.

919
01:23:59,887 --> 01:24:04,099
Cover that and the front.
Campbell, Baum, you're with me.

920
01:24:10,773 --> 01:24:11,815
Thanks, but we gotta go.

921
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:13,483
No, come on, stick
around. Let's have a party.

922
01:24:13,568 --> 01:24:15,610
We gotta work tomorrow.
Aw, work's for mugs.

923
01:24:15,695 --> 01:24:16,903
Get out of here!

924
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,667
You wanna see
my James Cagney?

925
01:24:30,752 --> 01:24:33,170
You wanna see my James
Cagney act? Huh? Huh?

926
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:35,672
What do you see? What do
you say? What do you know?

927
01:24:35,757 --> 01:24:38,925
What's your name, doll?
This your wife, you dumb egg?

928
01:24:51,022 --> 01:24:52,272
Go ahead.

929
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,999
Stop that car!

930
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,585
Bureau of Investigation!

931
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:16,713
Stop that car!

932
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:20,634
Fire!

933
01:26:15,106 --> 01:26:17,315
Don't shoot!
Get on the floor!

934
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,035
Johnny!

935
01:27:18,836 --> 01:27:20,003
Go!

936
01:27:59,877 --> 01:28:01,294
Someone got out!

937
01:28:03,005 --> 01:28:04,464
Is it Dillinger?

938
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,049
I think so!

939
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:10,470
Baum, you drive around
the woods. You flank him!

940
01:29:42,647 --> 01:29:43,688
Go.

941
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:46,691
Go!

942
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:02,875
Come on, Red, come on. Come
on. We're getting out of here.

943
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:16,472
Hey, give me the keys
to that car.

944
01:30:42,582 --> 01:30:43,582
Have you...

945
01:30:47,796 --> 01:30:49,422
All you bastards wear vests,

946
01:30:49,506 --> 01:30:52,591
so I'm gonna give it to you high
and I'm gonna give it to you low.

947
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:09,817
Carter?

948
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,241
Who was it? Dillinger?

949
01:31:17,325 --> 01:31:18,993
Nelson.

950
01:31:40,515 --> 01:31:42,850
Sir, there's somebody
on the road.

951
01:31:44,686 --> 01:31:46,270
Cowley! Did you see a car?

952
01:31:46,354 --> 01:31:47,772
A Ford, yeah,
it's going the other way.

953
01:31:47,856 --> 01:31:50,733
Turn it around! Madala,
get in. It's Nelson!

954
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:08,918
Get in, you dumb bastards!
Get in!

955
01:32:10,921 --> 01:32:13,172
Get in. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

956
01:32:13,715 --> 01:32:14,965
Where'd you get the car?

957
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:16,258
I killed a Fed by the road.

958
01:32:20,847 --> 01:32:22,223
Faster, Sam!

959
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:36,111
They're behind us.
Let them have it, Homer!

960
01:32:41,326 --> 01:32:43,160
Steady the car, God damn it!

961
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:54,547
Shit!

962
01:33:12,274 --> 01:33:14,108
Homer! Homer!

963
01:33:29,749 --> 01:33:30,958
Come on!

964
01:34:12,918 --> 01:34:14,418
Have you never seen
a man die before?

965
01:34:14,502 --> 01:34:15,669
Hush up.

966
01:34:18,214 --> 01:34:19,840
You gotta let go, John.

967
01:34:21,092 --> 01:34:22,217
Bullshit.

968
01:34:26,348 --> 01:34:28,265
And you gotta
let Billie go, too.

969
01:34:34,022 --> 01:34:35,397
I know you.

970
01:34:37,192 --> 01:34:38,901
You've never let nobody down.

971
01:34:40,362 --> 01:34:41,820
But this time,

972
01:34:42,906 --> 01:34:44,323
you gotta go on.

973
01:34:46,576 --> 01:34:47,993
You gotta let go.

974
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:23,904
Right now,

975
01:35:25,573 --> 01:35:27,491
all of Dillinger's
friends are dead.

976
01:35:30,578 --> 01:35:31,829
He is out there.

977
01:35:33,707 --> 01:35:35,082
He is alone.

978
01:35:37,127 --> 01:35:41,046
And there will not be a
better chance to run him down.

979
01:35:42,173 --> 01:35:43,841
Yeah, but he could
be anywhere.

980
01:35:43,925 --> 01:35:45,676
He could be anywhere.

981
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,762
But he is not anywhere, because
what he wants is right here.

982
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,204
I don't believe
in the government,

983
01:36:14,289 --> 01:36:16,540
and I don't believe in the
government spending all its money,

984
01:36:16,624 --> 01:36:19,460
and hence I don't
take any part of it.

985
01:36:20,253 --> 01:36:22,921
And you say no, you...

986
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:42,566
I ought to refuse to accept the
money. It's government money.

987
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:45,194
I don't believe in
the government spending.

988
01:36:45,403 --> 01:36:47,654
I'm not gonna take it.

989
01:36:51,117 --> 01:36:52,493
What's she doing?

990
01:36:53,203 --> 01:36:54,995
Still listening to the radio.

991
01:37:52,011 --> 01:37:54,805
Sir, we have questioned
a source, John Probasco.

992
01:37:54,889 --> 01:37:58,058
We have information that leads
us to believe that they're...

993
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,713
But Dillinger did aid
law enforcement in one way.

994
01:38:28,673 --> 01:38:32,593
He's cited as the reason Congress is
considering the first national crime bill,

995
01:38:32,677 --> 01:38:36,263
making criminal enterprise across
state lines a federal offense.

996
01:38:36,347 --> 01:38:37,514
Meanwhile, in Fargo,
North Dakota...

997
01:38:37,599 --> 01:38:39,308
We're building
coast-to-coast.

998
01:38:39,392 --> 01:38:41,894
We want it nice and quiet,
and they bring this on us?

999
01:38:42,437 --> 01:38:45,439
Frank, calm down. They rob banks. Right.

1000
01:38:45,773 --> 01:38:49,359
In one state, then another
state, that's called interstate.

1001
01:38:49,444 --> 01:38:51,820
We're coast to coast.
Wake up!

1002
01:38:51,905 --> 01:38:53,572
Now they can use these laws on us.

1003
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:14,676
What time is it?

1004
01:39:16,221 --> 01:39:19,139
It's 4:00 a. m., Sunday morning.
What's wrong?

1005
01:39:20,475 --> 01:39:21,934
I don't want to sleep.

1006
01:39:22,018 --> 01:39:23,143
Why?

1007
01:39:24,687 --> 01:39:26,688
Because I want
all the time we got.

1008
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:39,993
What if

1009
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:43,538
we could get out
of here altogether?

1010
01:39:46,834 --> 01:39:48,001
Where?

1011
01:39:50,255 --> 01:39:51,421
Like Cuba?

1012
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,382
Maybe further.

1013
01:39:55,635 --> 01:39:59,388
Alvin's got this job.
It's a big job, a lot of dough.

1014
01:40:02,225 --> 01:40:03,684
We could go away on it.

1015
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,979
We grab a Pan Am
Clipper to Caracas,

1016
01:40:07,855 --> 01:40:10,649
scoot on over to Rio
for some fun in the sun,

1017
01:40:13,236 --> 01:40:14,528
slide off the map.

1018
01:40:18,366 --> 01:40:19,741
We could go dancing

1019
01:40:20,743 --> 01:40:22,327
and have a lot of laughs

1020
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:25,163
any time we want.

1021
01:40:31,087 --> 01:40:32,879
Want to take
that ride with me?

1022
01:40:38,219 --> 01:40:40,512
Yeah, I want to take
that ride with you.

1023
01:41:05,997 --> 01:41:07,372
Where's the apartment?

1024
01:41:07,457 --> 01:41:08,707
Oakley and Potomac.

1025
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:11,293
All right, the bartender's
name is Larry Strong.

1026
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:13,170
He'll give you the keys.

1027
01:41:45,704 --> 01:41:47,830
Who brought you?
How did you get here?

1028
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:52,126
A taxi. I took a taxi.

1029
01:42:15,984 --> 01:42:18,194
Let's go. Let's go, guys.
Come on! Get her outside.

1030
01:43:37,733 --> 01:43:38,900
Where is he?

1031
01:43:39,902 --> 01:43:41,903
Where were you meeting?
Where were you hiding out?

1032
01:43:41,987 --> 01:43:45,239
Answer him or they'll drop
you in a black hole in Cook County.

1033
01:43:52,122 --> 01:43:53,414
Where is he?

1034
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:56,542
I have to go to the bathroom.

1035
01:44:32,955 --> 01:44:34,747
Christ, look what you did.

1036
01:44:37,793 --> 01:44:39,752
Where were you
supposed to meet him?

1037
01:44:43,924 --> 01:44:45,216
I can't hear you.

1038
01:44:45,842 --> 01:44:48,052
I can't hear you!

1039
01:44:59,523 --> 01:45:01,983
We were supposed to
meet at our apartment.

1040
01:45:03,277 --> 01:45:04,443
Where?

1041
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,696
On Addison.

1042
01:45:07,155 --> 01:45:08,406
What number?

1043
01:45:10,784 --> 01:45:12,618
1148.

1044
01:45:12,703 --> 01:45:14,161
When?

1045
01:45:17,499 --> 01:45:18,749
Right now.

1046
01:45:26,008 --> 01:45:28,509
Miss Roberts, can you
reach Agent Purvis?

1047
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:31,262
No. He's on his way back
from Mooresville, Indiana.

1048
01:45:31,346 --> 01:45:33,222
He's going directly
to Cook County Jail.

1049
01:45:36,476 --> 01:45:39,437
John Dillinger's holed up
at 1148 Addison.

1050
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:16,557
Where is he?

1051
01:46:20,354 --> 01:46:21,395
Well,

1052
01:46:24,316 --> 01:46:27,401
way the hell away from
here by now, isn't he?

1053
01:46:29,154 --> 01:46:32,740
You wanted to know where
he is, you dumb flatfoot.

1054
01:46:35,452 --> 01:46:38,913
Mr. Purvis, those men cannot
treat a woman in this way.

1055
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:44,585
You walked right past him
on State Street.

1056
01:46:45,629 --> 01:46:47,922
You were too scared
to look around.

1057
01:46:48,632 --> 01:46:50,966
He was at the curb
in that black Buick.

1058
01:46:52,177 --> 01:46:54,845
You asked me how I got there,
I told you I took a taxi,

1059
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:57,098
and you believed me?

1060
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:01,018
He dropped me off
and was waiting for me.

1061
01:47:01,603 --> 01:47:04,522
And you walked
right past him.

1062
01:47:13,407 --> 01:47:18,119
And when my Johnny finds out
how you slapped around his girl,

1063
01:47:19,454 --> 01:47:22,707
you know what happens
to you, fat boy?

1064
01:47:31,258 --> 01:47:32,466
Uncuff her.

1065
01:47:46,481 --> 01:47:48,482
Restroom is down the hall.

1066
01:47:55,657 --> 01:47:57,074
I can't stand up.

1067
01:48:16,928 --> 01:48:18,095
Miss Rogers.

1068
01:48:34,946 --> 01:48:35,946
Hello.

1069
01:48:36,531 --> 01:48:40,034
I'm Marty Zarkovich.
I was told to call you, Mr. Nitti.

1070
01:48:41,077 --> 01:48:43,037
<i>I think I can get her to play ball.</i>

1071
01:48:44,539 --> 01:48:45,706
Make sure.

1072
01:48:48,752 --> 01:48:49,960
Yes, sir, Mr. Nitti.

1073
01:48:59,596 --> 01:49:01,055
What did they say, Anna?

1074
01:49:04,059 --> 01:49:06,685
They say they send me
back to Romania.

1075
01:49:08,104 --> 01:49:09,396
You know what to do.

1076
01:49:16,404 --> 01:49:19,073
Can they fix deportation?
Can they do that?

1077
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:22,326
These guys can fix anything.

1078
01:49:32,379 --> 01:49:33,462
Okay.

1079
01:49:59,614 --> 01:50:00,865
I want guarantee.

1080
01:50:03,285 --> 01:50:06,370
If you aid us in
apprehending John Dillinger,

1081
01:50:06,997 --> 01:50:08,539
I give you my word

1082
01:50:09,165 --> 01:50:11,834
I will do everything I can to
influence Bureau of Immigration

1083
01:50:11,918 --> 01:50:13,377
to let you stay in America.

1084
01:50:13,461 --> 01:50:14,587
Not enough.

1085
01:50:15,964 --> 01:50:17,423
Well, that's all there is.

1086
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,758
I want guarantee.

1087
01:50:21,177 --> 01:50:22,970
Well, you're not gonna get one.

1088
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,140
I think you did this.

1089
01:50:26,224 --> 01:50:29,643
I think you told Immigration to pick
me up and send me back to Romania.

1090
01:50:32,022 --> 01:50:33,814
How do you socialize with him?

1091
01:50:37,736 --> 01:50:38,903
We go out.

1092
01:50:41,364 --> 01:50:44,116
Maybe tomorrow night.
Maybe not.

1093
01:50:45,285 --> 01:50:48,495
Maybe in a week, a month.
Maybe never.

1094
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:54,335
I will not guarantee
what Immigration will do,

1095
01:50:54,419 --> 01:50:56,587
but I can guarantee what I will do.

1096
01:50:56,671 --> 01:50:59,048
If you do not cooperate,

1097
01:51:00,383 --> 01:51:03,719
you will be on a boat out
of this country in 48 hours.

1098
01:51:04,346 --> 01:51:06,180
Do not play games with me.

1099
01:51:13,521 --> 01:51:14,688
Who is "we"?

1100
01:51:16,024 --> 01:51:19,318
Me, him, Polly Hamilton,
one of my girls.

1101
01:51:21,655 --> 01:51:23,280
How will we know?

1102
01:51:24,866 --> 01:51:26,867
I call you on the day
when I know.

1103
01:51:52,644 --> 01:51:53,644
Did you get in there?
Did you see her?

1104
01:51:53,728 --> 01:51:55,104
Yes, I did.

1105
01:51:56,398 --> 01:51:57,856
She palmed me this note.

1106
01:52:13,873 --> 01:52:15,416
She told me what it said.

1107
01:52:16,501 --> 01:52:17,751
That's good advice.

1108
01:52:21,339 --> 01:52:22,923
What are you doing here?

1109
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:27,344
Meeting people.

1110
01:52:42,944 --> 01:52:46,030
On Tuesday, it'll carry the payrolls
for seven factories around Rockford.

1111
01:52:46,114 --> 01:52:47,948
There's 2 ways in, 2 ways out.

1112
01:52:48,033 --> 01:52:50,826
Doc cuts the telephone lines
five minutes before.

1113
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:53,203
Train arrives,
you and I go in strong.

1114
01:52:53,288 --> 01:52:55,039
Harry handles the door
and the safe.

1115
01:52:55,123 --> 01:52:56,623
Jimmy and Freddy drive.

1116
01:52:59,627 --> 01:53:00,711
What do you figure?

1117
01:53:00,795 --> 01:53:04,256
About $1,500,000
to $1,700,000.

1118
01:53:04,924 --> 01:53:06,884
$300,000 each.

1119
01:53:06,968 --> 01:53:08,469
Holy cow.
Yeah.

1120
01:53:10,472 --> 01:53:12,973
We pull this Tuesday,
I'm gone Wednesday.

1121
01:53:13,058 --> 01:53:14,558
Yeah. Where? Cuba?

1122
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,185
No.

1123
01:53:17,103 --> 01:53:19,980
No. Where I go, I'm gonna have
to go a lot farther than Cuba.

1124
01:53:21,524 --> 01:53:22,775
Yeah.

1125
01:53:33,078 --> 01:53:34,078
Hi, Jimmy.

1126
01:53:34,162 --> 01:53:35,204
What do you say?

1127
01:53:35,288 --> 01:53:36,747
Polly, Jimmy's back!

1128
01:53:53,891 --> 01:53:55,225
I tell you what, doll.

1129
01:53:56,143 --> 01:53:58,978
How about you, Polly and me
go out to a movie tonight?

1130
01:53:59,063 --> 01:54:00,563
Get in some refrigeration.

1131
01:54:01,232 --> 01:54:02,690
Where do you want to go?

1132
01:54:03,192 --> 01:54:05,360
Maybe the Marbro
or the Biograph.

1133
01:54:07,196 --> 01:54:09,072
Jimmy's taking us
to the picture show.

1134
01:54:10,282 --> 01:54:12,659
I'll go to the store later and
make fried chicken for dinner.

1135
01:54:12,743 --> 01:54:14,035
Where you going?

1136
01:54:14,161 --> 01:54:15,411
Streetcar.

1137
01:54:15,871 --> 01:54:18,373
I gotta go downtown to get
my waitressing license.

1138
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:23,336
Hang on a minute. I'll take
you. It's too damn hot in here.

1139
01:54:23,921 --> 01:54:24,921
Yeah?

1140
01:54:41,188 --> 01:54:43,606
Mr. Purvis. Anna Sage.

1141
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,610
Afternoon, Miss Sage.

1142
01:54:55,703 --> 01:54:56,870
It is tonight!

1143
01:54:57,413 --> 01:54:59,205
Anna Sage will be with him

1144
01:54:59,290 --> 01:55:02,458
and will wear a white blouse
over an orange skirt.

1145
01:55:02,543 --> 01:55:04,460
That is how
we will know it is him.

1146
01:55:05,337 --> 01:55:07,297
He may have changed
his appearance.

1147
01:55:07,381 --> 01:55:10,175
And we have not learned if he will
go to the Marbro or the Biograph.

1148
01:55:10,259 --> 01:55:12,260
Two theaters?
That's right.

1149
01:55:12,344 --> 01:55:13,595
What's playing?

1150
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:14,888
Excuse me?

1151
01:55:14,972 --> 01:55:17,682
What's playing at the Marbro?
What's playing at the Biograph?

1152
01:55:21,103 --> 01:55:24,898
A Shirley Temple movie called
Little Miss Marker is at the Marbro.

1153
01:55:24,982 --> 01:55:27,233
The Biograph is playing
a gangster picture

1154
01:55:27,318 --> 01:55:30,361
starring Clark Gable,
Manhattan Melodrama.

1155
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:33,615
John Dillinger ain't going
to a Shirley Temple movie.

1156
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:37,577
Sergeants Zarkovich and O'Neill, from
the East Chicago Police Department,

1157
01:55:37,661 --> 01:55:41,497
and Agent Winstead will be
at the Biograph, as will I.

1158
01:55:41,582 --> 01:55:44,500
Now, Virgil Peterson, you
will coordinate the Marbro.

1159
01:55:44,585 --> 01:55:47,629
He will be armed and
extremely dangerous.

1160
01:55:51,967 --> 01:55:53,218
Is that it?

1161
01:55:53,302 --> 01:55:54,427
Yep.

1162
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:56,262
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

1163
01:56:01,477 --> 01:56:02,727
I'll go in with you.

1164
01:56:03,646 --> 01:56:04,938
All right.

1165
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:10,151
It might take 10 minutes.

1166
01:56:11,153 --> 01:56:12,487
I'll meet you outside.

1167
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,859
I'd like to see Babe take
one more swing this season.

1168
01:58:17,321 --> 01:58:21,783
But his leg is pretty sore. He takes a
bit of batting practice, but not very much.

1169
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,789
What's the score?

1170
01:58:28,957 --> 01:58:30,833
Cubs, 3-2, top of the 7th.

1171
01:58:31,293 --> 01:58:33,336
<i>...that's why he's
out of today's game.</i>

1172
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:35,880
<i>The pitch is high. Ball one.</i>

1173
01:58:36,382 --> 01:58:40,635
<i>Broaca, the batter
leading off for the Yankees,</i>

1174
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:43,179
<i>did not see the ball very well.</i>

1175
01:58:45,349 --> 01:58:46,641
<i>What's going on?</i>

1176
01:58:50,145 --> 01:58:51,437
Nothing yet.

1177
01:58:58,821 --> 01:59:01,030
They haven't shown up
at the Marbro.

1178
02:00:35,876 --> 02:00:37,168
Blackie!
Jim!

1179
02:00:37,252 --> 02:00:38,419
<i>Well, you old son of a gun!</i>

1180
02:00:38,504 --> 02:00:40,338
<i>I say, you're looking swell, Jim.</i>

1181
02:00:40,422 --> 02:00:42,006
<i>Let's get a load of this
Dempsey-Firpo binge, shall we?</i>

1182
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:44,550
<i>Yeah, yeah. But when will we get
together again? Gee, it's been weeks!</i>

1183
02:00:44,635 --> 02:00:46,177
<i>Well, what about
tomorrow night? Saturday?</i>

1184
02:00:46,678 --> 02:00:49,805
I will light my cigar
when he's coming out.

1185
02:00:50,474 --> 02:00:53,809
Zarkovich, O'Neill,
you and your men

1186
02:00:53,894 --> 02:00:56,437
take the hat store right
across from the theater.

1187
02:00:57,105 --> 02:01:01,442
Smith, Suran, Clegg, take two
agents, you cover the rear alley.

1188
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:06,072
And Rorer and Rice, you stay in
the car with Reinecke to the north.

1189
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:08,032
Clarence and I are
gonna be in the doorway

1190
02:01:08,116 --> 02:01:10,535
30 feet south of
the theater entrance.

1191
02:01:10,619 --> 02:01:14,205
Gerry, you're in the tan sedan
just to the north of the entrance.

1192
02:01:14,289 --> 02:01:15,748
In case he walks north?

1193
02:01:15,832 --> 02:01:17,792
He ain't gonna walk
north, Mr. Purvis.

1194
02:01:17,876 --> 02:01:21,337
He's gonna head south, cut through
the alley back to her place.

1195
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:24,882
Madala.

1196
02:01:34,601 --> 02:01:35,768
<i>Hello, Gallagher.</i>

1197
02:01:35,852 --> 02:01:37,228
<i>Hello, Snow.</i>

1198
02:01:37,312 --> 02:01:38,437
<i>Must be something pretty important,</i>

1199
02:01:38,522 --> 02:01:40,356
<i>getting me in here in
the middle of the game.</i>

1200
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,566
<i>What do you want?</i>

1201
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,818
<i>I want to do a little
favor for a friend.</i>

1202
02:02:03,672 --> 02:02:07,133
<i>You're the governor.
You can save his life.</i>

1203
02:02:09,052 --> 02:02:11,596
<i>He's guilty.
The jury says so.</i>

1204
02:02:32,868 --> 02:02:34,201
<i>Goodbye, Blackie.</i>

1205
02:03:01,396 --> 02:03:02,480
<i>Goodbye, Jim.</i>

1206
02:03:02,564 --> 02:03:03,981
<i>I can't help it, Blackie.</i>

1207
02:03:04,066 --> 02:03:05,691
<i>I'm not gonna let you die.</i>

1208
02:03:06,318 --> 02:03:07,568
<i>I've got to commute you.</i>

1209
02:03:08,153 --> 02:03:09,612
<i>You think you're doing me a favor</i>

1210
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:12,406
<i>by keeping me locked up in this
filthy trap for the rest of my life?</i>

1211
02:03:12,491 --> 02:03:16,035
<i>No, thanks. Come on,
warden, let's go.</i>

1212
02:03:41,603 --> 02:03:42,978
<i>So long, Blackie.</i>

1213
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:46,440
<i>Kid, keep your chin
up and your nose clean.</i>

1214
02:03:50,445 --> 02:03:52,863
<i>Die the way you lived, all of
a sudden, that's the way to go.</i>

1215
02:03:52,948 --> 02:03:54,699
<i>Don't drag it out.</i>

1216
02:03:54,783 --> 02:03:56,909
<i>Living like that
doesn't mean a thing.</i>

1217
02:07:13,983 --> 02:07:15,317
What did he say?

1218
02:07:18,029 --> 02:07:19,487
I couldn't hear him.

1219
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,669
You take care of this. I
need to go call Washington.

1220
02:09:04,802 --> 02:09:06,344
How you doing, Billie?

1221
02:09:10,725 --> 02:09:12,559
I'm Special Agent Winstead.

1222
02:09:17,023 --> 02:09:19,441
If you've come here to ask
me more damn questions...

1223
02:09:20,234 --> 02:09:22,527
"Where's this one
or that one?"

1224
02:09:22,611 --> 02:09:25,030
I didn't come here for
you to tell me something.

1225
02:09:26,032 --> 02:09:28,074
I came here to
tell you something.

1226
02:09:38,669 --> 02:09:40,712
They say you're the man who shot him.

1227
02:09:44,008 --> 02:09:46,509
That's right. One of them.

1228
02:09:48,012 --> 02:09:49,971
So why are you
coming here to see me?

1229
02:09:52,099 --> 02:09:54,100
To see the damage
you've done?

1230
02:09:57,188 --> 02:09:58,271
No.

1231
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:03,109
I came here because
he asked me to.

1232
02:10:08,032 --> 02:10:09,908
When he went down,
he said something.

1233
02:10:11,827 --> 02:10:13,661
I put my ear next to his mouth,

1234
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:16,748
and what I think he said was this.

1235
02:10:18,751 --> 02:10:20,001
He said,

1236
02:10:20,795 --> 02:10:22,670
"Tell Billie for me,

1237
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:25,840
"'Bye-bye, blackbird."'

1238
