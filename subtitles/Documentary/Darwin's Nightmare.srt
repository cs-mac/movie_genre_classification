1
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,170
Here is the control tower.

2
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:41,112
Nonsense. I'm in the control tower.

3
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,642
I have work to do, this is no office.

4
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,081
<i>Yes, but I... </i>

5
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:48,986
<i>I love you with all my heart</i>

6
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:55,561
<i>We love you, Tanzania</i>

7
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,573
In English..."Sawa"...

8
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,783
We all leave our families at home.

9
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,852
We think about home all the time.

10
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,786
But if we didn't work,

11
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:12,594
who would feed our families?

12
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,029
This is true for any country, always.

13
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,797
This is a common rule.

14
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,477
If there is work, things are fine.

15
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,546
One needs to work

16
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:36,049
and think about children
and family and a home...

17
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:38,478
And mom and dad.

18
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:43,918
Before, we always had holidays at home.

19
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:18,823
The youngest?

20
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:27,765
Not bad.

21
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,610
Here she is.

22
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,338
Who are those singing guys?

23
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,784
They carried a lot of fish!

24
00:22:57,895 --> 00:23:00,295
It was too heavily loaded.

25
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:14,086
- Where is your father?
- Not around.

26
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,267
Come on, tell him!

27
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,061
So where is he?

28
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,109
Which work is he doing?

29
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:30,174
He is on the water.

30
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,881
- So your papa catches fish?
- Mmm.

31
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:38,878
What is his name?

32
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:42,883
Masaba. Masaba.

33
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,192
- Masaba.
- Masaba.

34
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:48,625
And your mama?

35
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,363
- Mama?
- Yeah.

36
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,292
- Romukulu.
- Huh?

37
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,460
Romukulu.

38
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:56,600
- Romukulu.
- Romukulu.

39
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,879
So your father is also a fisherman?

40
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,473
My papa is dead.

41
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:09,742
And your mama?

42
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:12,849
She died from the virus.

43
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,857
His parents all died with AIDS.

44
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,257
I am a street child, that's all.

45
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:22,127
When you are older,
will you be a fisherman like your dad?

46
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,790
He doesn't care.

47
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,130
My dad's life... I do not want to follow.

48
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:30,331
I want to do my own profession.

49
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,004
I want to become a teacher.

50
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,675
<i>I love you, I love you... </i>

51
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,567
Lisa, wake up!

52
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,796
Her husband also died.

53
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:57,033
Yes, the virus took him.

54
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:04,972
When her youngest child died

55
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,750
she realized that she had AIDS, too.

56
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:12,515
Her kids are now alone.

57
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:17,793
Her man came from

58
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:20,863
the backcountry to fish for the factories.

59
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,294
And before being a fisherman?

60
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:28,235
Before they had a farm.

61
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:37,309
All I can do is...

62
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:45,053
I cannot eat anymore.

63
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:40,393
I know so many pilots...

64
00:43:46,676 --> 00:43:49,907
True, these pilots are so tough,

65
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:53,879
they came one day with a taxi
and took us to the hotel,

66
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,817
they first took Queeny,
and then they went after Eliza...

67
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:00,120
So violent!

68
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,618
Many pilots never returned.

69
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,090
Some may have died already.

70
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:34,947
He asks if pilots bring stuff for the war.

71
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:36,616
No war.

72
00:44:37,026 --> 00:44:38,323
Only fish!

73
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:44,042
Here, this one landed in the water.

74
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:51,722
When they loaded the fish...

75
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:55,497
He was trying to take off...

76
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:59,895
Also this one had already
charged the fish fillets,

77
00:47:00,102 --> 00:47:03,299
but for bad luck, the load was too heavy.

78
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,868
At the moment of take-off,

79
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:09,672
the plane started to tumble,

80
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:12,907
his belly scratched on the ground,

81
00:47:13,516 --> 00:47:15,575
then a wing broke

82
00:47:15,685 --> 00:47:19,177
and the plane ran into the village.

83
00:47:29,365 --> 00:47:31,265
It looks broken.

84
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:08,867
<i>... numerous deaths by famine</i>

85
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,871
<i>reported from the district of Tabora, </i>

86
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:16,009
<i>the people there need desperately
food aid in big quantity. </i>

87
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,505
<i>The United Nations World Food Program</i>

88
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:23,316
<i>has requested 17 million American dollars</i>

89
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:30,692
<i>to feed the two million starving people
in the central region of Tanzania. </i>

90
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:08,885
Ah, the policeman is awake.

91
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:59,000
The big beast came and ripped his leg off!

92
00:54:53,142 --> 00:54:56,270
IF YOU SLEEP WITH A WHORE
JUST BEAT HER

93
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:56,316
- Should I say something?
- Please!

94
01:03:56,418 --> 01:04:00,149
The problem is, I am alone,
my husband was sick...

95
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,834
My man has gone away.

96
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,831
Before this job, I was a normal farmer.

97
01:04:22,377 --> 01:04:24,140
Now I am better off.

98
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:35,946
My life is good, I have work...

99
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,027
I must stop speaking.

100
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:53,741
Someone is making me stop talking.

101
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:21,693
I should go to the hospital for an operation.

102
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:32,500
Can you explain your situation at work?

103
01:06:32,607 --> 01:06:36,941
The biggest trouble is the ammoniac gas.

104
01:06:43,018 --> 01:06:45,077
When it rains, that's worse.

105
01:06:45,186 --> 01:06:48,314
And during
the rainy season, it is a problem, like now.

106
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:54,018
The gas can harm your eyes...

107
01:10:32,413 --> 01:10:34,210
It is full of holes!

108
01:10:47,428 --> 01:10:50,295
We don't have that much for everyone.

109
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:53,023
We will share, all right!

110
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:57,204
I will eat it all by myself!

111
01:14:22,977 --> 01:14:27,107
<i>The Government says
there is no food shortage. </i>

112
01:14:27,348 --> 01:14:29,873
<i>The problem is</i>

113
01:14:29,984 --> 01:14:33,078
<i>that many civilians have nothing to eat</i>

114
01:14:33,187 --> 01:14:35,417
<i>and also no money to buy food. </i>

115
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:40,493
<i>So even if the food was sold on the market, </i>

116
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:44,053
<i>most civilians could not
afford to buy food... </i>

117
01:16:28,769 --> 01:16:32,227
<i>The EU has donated 45 million Shillings</i>

118
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:37,209
<i>to Tanzania in order to secure
the fish export from Lake Victoria... </i>

119
01:17:10,111 --> 01:17:12,409
In Mwanza, it's just the same!

120
01:19:34,288 --> 01:19:36,119
<i>Let the holy spirit come</i>

121
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:38,350
<i>in the name of Jesus Christ. </i>

122
01:19:38,459 --> 01:19:40,654
<i>You, devil, I am chasing you away... </i>

123
01:19:55,142 --> 01:19:59,101
<i>... and the good Christ
shall be defeating all evil. </i>

124
01:20:24,672 --> 01:20:26,902
<i>Here comes Jesus! </i>

125
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:40,578
<i>I cry for the fisherman of our town. </i>

126
01:20:45,259 --> 01:20:48,558
<i>Look at the miracles of Jesus Christ.</i>

127
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:55,701
<i>There was so much fish, 
the boat was too heavy to move! </i>

128
01:22:05,105 --> 01:22:07,699
Stas, have a bite for the camera!

129
01:24:51,105 --> 01:24:52,970
Here, right here!

130
01:24:54,374 --> 01:24:58,310
With a knife straight into the heart.

131
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:00,576
Blood came out...

132
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:04,339
Eliza had scratches all over her face.

133
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:09,522
I went to the funeral.

134
01:26:44,851 --> 01:26:48,184
Here comes the airplane, here it comes...

135
01:30:59,339 --> 01:31:03,139
Eat the sausages first. I will fry the fish!

136
01:31:09,983 --> 01:31:11,211
Very hot!

137
01:38:24,951 --> 01:38:27,476
We cooked some more.

138
01:38:27,587 --> 01:38:28,952
Let me try!

139
01:41:57,063 --> 01:42:01,193
I can't say that in English.
