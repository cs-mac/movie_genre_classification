1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,072
Woody Allen: I said this in a movie once:

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,400
Everyone knows the same truth

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,155
and our lives consist of
how we choose to distort it.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,991
Bill Pullman: I am kind of amazed at what

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
Lawrence and Richard are doing
because they are walking

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,550
into some pretty prickly arenas

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,480
and they have no armour other

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,675
than their own mental faculties.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,552
Werner Herzog: I think what these
two men are doing out there

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,876
promoting a scientific
world view

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,878
is something of great value

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,835
because it is part of
what humanity's all about.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,040
To be curious, to understand

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,396
what is the real world
surrounding us.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,880
And this is what I love
about science is that

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,758
it's knowledge
and knowledge is power

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,037
and it empowers you
and it frees you

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,352
because then you're not stuck.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,433
You're no longer stuck where you've been
or where somebody else has been stuck.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,231
There are no scientific authorities.
There are scientific experts.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,920
Richard knows a lot about zoology;,
I know a lot about physics.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,070
But there's no one whose views

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,878
are not subject to question.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,592
Science just seeks the truth without
prejudice, for better or worse.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,837
It doesn't say 'Should I find
this out?? It says 'Can I??

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,476
And that's the point about beliefs:
they don't change the facts.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,597
Facts, if you're rational,
should change your beliefs.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Throughout history new discoveries.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,075
Have challenged existing beliefs.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,077
Religion is no exception.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,635
Religion is just like
any other topic

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,439
and should not be
sacrosanct at all.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,636
You should be able
to discuss religion.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,675
Why not?.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,910
Sarah Silverman: I think religion
should be open to discussion.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,831
I think everything
should be. I think

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,832
when you make things taboo

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,759
even when feel like
you're protecting it

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,509
it's not for the greater good.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,229
We cannot close down
a conversation

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,794
about a set of

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,032
beliefs that lead to actions

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,951
which affect all of us.

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,789
All this stuff I was
taught about evolution

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,150
and big bang theory and all that

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,152
is lies straight
from the pit of hell.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
This is the trouble with ethics and
morality and the big questions

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,997
and the fact that religions think
they own that conversation.

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,840
Quite the contrary.
They kill that conversation.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,876
Bill Pullman:
And I think we follow people

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,920
who have courage, you know,
to think about things

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,640
that we haven't
thought about before

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,835
and in these times

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,596
where intolerance
is kind of championed

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm pretty impressed

56
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,598
that someone is
taking on the quest.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,559
That's what I get
from these guys:

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,994
The permission to
question everything.

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
Lawrence Krauss: Richard, ten years ago,
I asked you the question

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,760
in the popular writing and
speaking that you do which is:

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,876
what's more important
in some sense

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,440
if you had a choice which is to
explain science or destroy religion?.

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Oh I think that
they go together

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,760
because 'destroy religion'
makes it sound negative.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,113
Yeah.
To me it's a positive thing.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,879
Science is wonderful.
Science is beautiful.

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,400
And religion is not wonderful.
It's not beautiful.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,840
It gets in the way. There are all
sorts of other things wrong with it

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,876
but I mostly care about
truth, the beauty of truth,

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,470
the poetry of reality
which is science

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,200
and the fact that religion
as a scientific explanation...

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
It is a competing
scientific explanation...

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
It's so dull, it's so
boring, it's so petty.

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,400
It's wrong too.
And it's also wrong, yes.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,198
Which I think is a bit more...
More important, yeah.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,200
I think the same as you.
I want people to understand

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,474
how the universe really works.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,995
As an aside, ultimately,

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,073
is this other incompatibility
between science and religion

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,314
that when empirical evidence tells you
something you have to accept it...

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,557
When you give up that by saying 'I can
believe this myth and fairy tale'

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,040
then it opens you up
to lots of other things.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,192
So it's not innocuous. Inevitably when
you have to deal with the real world.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,998
You inevitably make
bad decisions.

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,832
If we can get people
to believe that

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,840
then it's easier...

87
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,229
Or should be easier to convince
people that evolution is true

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,673
because the evidence
is so strong.

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,796
Once you tell them
the evidence for evolution

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,348
they say 'Oh right, okay.
So much for God.'

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,595
Well tonight, Richard is in
Sydney while I'm in Canberra

92
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,751
and he's going to debate on a
television program called Q&A.

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,756
The Archbishop of Sydney

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,594
and I'm here in Canberra debating
in a Muslim debate initiative.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,640
We're both sort of
launching out

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,240
against the forces of evil
in different places

97
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,358
and that poetry was
to compelling to resist.

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,151
As far as I can see
this event has been advertised

99
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,191
only in the Muslim community.

100
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,118
Except for the few people
I've told about it

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,600
no one will know about it
except the Muslim community

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,272
so it'll be
an interesting audience.

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,518
Oh look over there.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,920
That's fascinating.

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,070
That may be our audience
right there, by the way.

106
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,593
That could be it.

107
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
Hi, how ya doin'?.

108
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,796
- Nice to see you.
- Morning Professor.

109
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,195
- How are you?.
- Hi.

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,312
I'm the uh... Uthman. Uthman Badar.
Oh okay.

111
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,675
You're the other person that's
going to talk. That's right.

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,198
It's interesting... I looked online and
didn't see any advertisements for it.

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,352
It'll be interesting to see.
We'll see how that goes.

114
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,432
But I have a rule... if there's less than
five people, we just go for coffee.

115
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,229
Does that sound good?.

116
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,158
I'm gonna sit in the back now
and read my Bible

117
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,635
which is...

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,390
I just thought I'd pick
it up for inspiration.

119
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,272
Christopher always inspires me.

120
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
Richard Dawkins:
Cardinal George Pell is the

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,520
most senior Roman
Catholic in Australia.

122
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,839
He's the Archbishop of Sydney

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,551
and I know rather little
else about him I'm afraid.

124
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,511
And he is sometimes talked about
as a possible candidate for Pope.

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,271
I have always refused to debate
religious fundamentalists.

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,591
It is my understanding that a
Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,999
is not a fundamentalist.

128
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,116
If he is, I've made a mistake.

129
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,920
MC: We're very excited to have these
two gentlemen here this evening

130
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,909
for this discussion.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,640
We know them already but please
let us introduce them properly

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,520
and make them feel very welcome.

133
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,040
Please help me welcome

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,120
the author of The God Delusion

135
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,715
the evolutionary biologist
Richard Dawkins.

136
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,400
The Archbishop of Sydney
please welcome

137
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,040
Cardinal George Pell.
(Cheering)

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Woman: Five, four, three...

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,560
(Theme music plays)

140
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,074
(Audience applauds)

141
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,793
George Pell, do you accept
that humans evolved from apes?.

142
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,278
Yeah probably.
From neanderthals yes.

143
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,671
From neanderthals?.

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,912
Probably. Why from neanderthals?.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,991
Who else would you suggest?.

146
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,320
Neanderthals were our cousins.

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,117
We're not descended from them.

148
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,077
These extant cousins?.

149
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,436
Where would I find a neanderthal
today if they're my cousins?.

150
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,160
They're not extant. They're extinct.
That's my point.

151
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,871
Your point is that
because they're not...

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
That because they're extant
they can't be our cousins?.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,752
I'm really am not much fussed.

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,719
That's very clear.

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
Ignoring the limitations
of science

156
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,789
also leads to sloppy
and arbitrary science.

157
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,078
Agood example is the field
of quantum mechanics.

158
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,030
The evidence of logic derives
from the evidence of reality.

159
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,836
Is it logical that I can be
in two places at once?. No.

160
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,797
But if I am an electron,
I certainly can be.

161
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,798
Because while you refer to quantum
mechanics, I actually understand it.

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
Most evolutionary
biologists today

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,198
don't believe that.
Don't believe what?.

164
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,040
They don't believe in

165
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,920
this crude fundamentalist version of
random selection that you propose.

166
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,600
I do not propose it
and I strongly deny

167
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,034
that evolution is
random selection.

168
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,720
This idea that we should
challenge our beliefs

169
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,359
I agree, in some areas,
and this is the point

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,238
I tried to touch upon the difference
between science and religion...

171
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,636
Only when you appreciate the
difference can you ascertain whether

172
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,556
different propositions
apply or not.

173
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,990
Anything about higher truth
morality for example

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,514
do you want me to challenge my belief
every day that murder is wrong?.

175
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,957
Well if any of you stopped
believing in God I would ask you,

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,111
would you go out tomorrow
and murder your neighbour?.

177
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,509
Well some of you say yes.

178
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,270
Evolution is
non-random selection.

179
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,675
Oh there's a purpose
to it, is there?.

180
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,755
No.

181
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,993
But... (Audience laughing)

182
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,880
Could you explain
what non-random means?.

183
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,189
Yes of course I could.
That's my life's work.

184
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,720
((Laughter, applause)

185
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,120
No idea should be
above ridicule.

186
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,680
Ridicule is a very
important tool.

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,275
And why should religion
not be subject to ridicule?.

188
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,191
If politics is subject
to ridicule, if science,

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,193
if sex, if everything else in the
world is subject to ridicule

190
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,590
as a way of illuminating
reality, why shouldn't religion?.

191
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,671
It's part of being human

192
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,396
to ask why we exist.

193
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,874
Richard: The question why

194
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,840
is not necessarily a question
that deserves to be answered.

195
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,195
There are all sorts of
questions that people can ask

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
Iike 'What is
the colour of jealousy??

197
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
That's a silly question.
Exactly.

198
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
Why?. is a silly question.

199
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,120
You can ask 'What are
the factors that led

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,678
to something coming
into existence??

201
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,120
That's a sensible question.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,350
But 'What is the purpose
of the universe??

203
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,194
is a silly question.
It has no meaning.

204
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,520
And so I hope that every student,

205
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
who ever goes to
university at one point

206
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,840
in their life has the
opportunity to have something

207
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,560
that is at the heart
of their being

208
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,320
something so central to their
being that if they lose it

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,472
they won't feel that they're human
anymore, to be proved wrong.

210
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Because that's the liberation
that science provides:

211
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,319
The realisation that

212
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,631
to assume the truth,
to assume the answer

213
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,076
before you ask the questions
leads you nowhere.

214
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,840
We do have a scientific
understanding of why we're here

215
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,680
and we therefore have to
make up our own meaning to life.

216
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,560
We have to stand up,
look the world

217
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,552
in the face, face up to the fact

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,760
that we are not going to last
forever, we have to make

219
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,309
the most of the short time
that we have on this planet,

220
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,080
we have to make this planet
as good as we possibly can

221
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,278
and try to leave it a better
place than we found it.

222
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,989
And if we live in a world where certain
things are not subject to question,

223
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,436
we live in a world
where thinking has stopped.

224
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,469

does not make the world

Richard: Well I got
thoroughly fed up with

241
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,758
BBC-type interviews

242
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,640
where you have a chairman
in the middle

243
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,800
and you get an interesting
conversation going on between...

244
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
there might be five people
around the table,

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,750
and A and B are having
an interesting conversation

246
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,628
and so the chairman suddenly says 'and
what do you think about this C??

247
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,235
totally breaking the flow,
spoiling the conversation

248
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,600
all in the interest of balance and
things like that and it occurred to me,

249
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,353
why on earth do we bother with chairmen?.
They're not necessary.

250
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,151
Certainly my recent encounter
with the Archbishop of Canterbury

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,639
in the Sheldonian Theatre
in Oxford,

252
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,192
that was completely ruined by the
chairman, who was a philosopher

253
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,993
and felt it was his role
to clarify things

254
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,111
and, of course,
that meant obscuring things.

255

* We're closer now * "

* Than light years to go *

257
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,200
Lawrence: Yeah I think
it's... I think conversations

258
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,040
and conversations
that aren't planned

259
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,838
are fascinating for people
to watch and listen to.

260
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,069
Richard: Yes.

261
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,558
Lawrence: I think it works.

262
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,799
((Crowd murmuring)

263
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Woman: We should probably go.

264
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,109
Richard: Okay.

265
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,438
So to fill it up...
we'd sometimes begin late...

266
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,720
From my experience, if it's really
full it begins a little late.

267
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,188
Usually three
or four minutes, yeah.

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,794
((Indistinct chatter)

269

Woman: Would you welcome these two
great scientists to the stage?.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
Please join me... Richard
Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss.

271
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,314
(Audience applauding)

272
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
I think it's
appropriate to begin...

273
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,956
Did any of you see Q&A?.

274
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,633
I was amazed... Cardinal Pell
who was on the programme

275
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,029
manifestly didn't
understand evolution.

276
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,839
Actually he didn't manifestly
understand anything

277
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,956
as far as I could see.

278
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,235
Why don't you elaborate a little
bit about that real problem?.

279
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,117
Because I think it's
a fascinating issue of

280
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,431
if speciation occurs,
if species change,

281
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,278
was there a first person?.

282
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,790
At first sight, it seems obvious

283
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,314
that there has to have
been a first person

284
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,920
and there has to have
been a first rabbit

285
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,080
and a first rhinoceros
and things.

286
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,400
After all people are
people, aren't they?.

287
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,550
And their ancestors
were not people.

288
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,036
If you go back sufficiently
far, your ancestor was a fish.

289
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,433
Mustn't there have been a
time when so to speak,

290
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,355
the last homo erectus parents gave
birth to the first homo sapiens baby?.

291
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,672
And the answer is no.

292
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,348
There never was a first person.

293
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,840
There never was a first
rabbit or first rhinoceros

294
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,800
because every organism ever born

295
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,640
belonged to the same
species as its parents.

296
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
And yet because
it was so gradual

297
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,680
and because it was so slow

298
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,040
not only was our 200 million
great grandparent a fish

299
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,110
but if you go back
further still

300
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,270
they were worms and so on.

301
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,995
And one suggestion that's
been made is that people

302
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,595
really have difficulty
grasping the idea

303
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,351
that animals turn into other
animals so imperceptibly

304
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,029
that you can hardly notice it.

305
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,600
It's not actually
that paradoxical.

306
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,114
It all happened
very very gradually.

307
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,834
And you can think of
parallels like the fact that

308
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,832
you can't see the hour
hand on your watch moving.

309
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,360
At some point we cease to think
of ourselves as middle-aged

310
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,200
and we start to think
of ourselves as old.

311
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,600
But nobody ever goes to bed
middle-aged and wakes up

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,397
and says 'I'm old.'

313
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,560
Lawrence: We had a
meeting at my institute

314
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,676
where we were trying to get
at the origin of life

315
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,870
and it's fascinating to learn
how much closer we're getting.

316
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,240
I don't know if you think we'll get to
the beginning in your lifetime or my lifetime.

317
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,153
Well it's an exciting thought and
I'm pretty hopeful that we might.

318
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,800
You'll never be able to prove
it for certain I suspect

319
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,280
but to come up with
a plausible theory

320
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,720
that people say 'Of course!.

321
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
That's so elegant
and so simple.'

322
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,520
Either it's true or it ought to be true.
I mean it could...

323
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,875
I think the key point
is plausibility.

324
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,040
It is amazing
and fascinating to me

325
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,640
and worth celebrating that the laws
of physics as we now understand them

326
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,400
have given us a plausible
story to answer questions.

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,109
That's amazing. Which is, how could
something arise from nothing?.

328
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,475
How could a complex
universe arise

329
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,232
from a universe in which
there was nothing?.

330
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,994
No particles and maybe
not even any space?.

331
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,438
And it's amazing to me
in cosmology now

332
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,520
that we are beginning
to get back and realise

333
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,120
that even something as
complex as a whole universe

334
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,560
could plausibly be created.

335
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,320
But that's all we ever claim.

336
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,437
And yet whenever we claim
that, we are called strident.

337
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,756
Do you notice that?.
Yes I do.

338
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,879
It came up in
the Q&A debate

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,429
and I tried to

340
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,877
very briefly expound
Lawrence's thesis

341
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,112
that you could get something
from literally nothing.

342
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,840
The audience just laughed. It
was obviously to them absurd.

343
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,479
How could you possibly
get something from nothing?.

344
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,511
It does violate common sense.

345
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,440
But as I said earlier this evening,
you can't go by common sense.

346
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,032
If we could do things
by common sense

347
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,037
we wouldn't need physicists.

348
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,795
((Laughter)

349
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,671
Common sense,
of course, comes from

350
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,758
what was necessary
for our brains to survive

351
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,560
in the pleistocene of Africa.

352
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,080
So they had to know
how to catch a buffalo

353
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,120
and how to find a water hole
and how to climb a tree

354
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,634
when being pursued
by a lion or something.

355
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,080
So our brains were never shaped by
natural selection to understand

356
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,311
either quantum mechanics,
the theory of the very small,

357
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,990
or relativity the theory
of the very fast.

358
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,680
And it's actually an astonishing
compliment to the human brain

359
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,195
that at least some humans
are capable of understanding.

360
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,639
No it is really remarkable that we've
been able to get as far as we can,

361
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,040
but you hit on another point:

362
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,080
Our brains not only
didn't evolve to understand

363
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,800
those aspects of the universe that
it couldn't experience directly

364
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,560
but another aspect of the universe it
can't experience directly is long time.

365
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,834
Absolutely.
And I think that's another reason

366
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,229
why evolution is
such a hard concept.

367
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,955
Because we can just see... we have
a slice of 1 00 years or less.

368
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,634
We can do seconds,
minutes, hours, days,

369
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,756
years, centuries...

370
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,832
Even millennia
we have trouble with.

371
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,360
You cannot grasp
the immensity of time

372
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,318
that is 1 00 million years.
Exactly.

373
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,832
Thank you very much.
Thank you very very much.

374
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,996

379
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,080
Lawrence: Alot of people think that just
because there's a lot we don't understand

380
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,520
at the edge of science that everything
we know is going to go out the window

381
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,670
and that's not true.
Evolution happened.

382
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,715
The big bang happened.

383
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,560
If I take a ball and drop it,
it's going to fall.

384
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,959
There are lots
of things we do know.

385
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,158
For me the only
solution I can see

386
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
is to try and educate people.

387
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Because if you don't
have an informed public

388
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,469
that's the greatest
threat to democracy.

389
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,998
So it's incumbent on scientists
to do a much better job

390
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,760
and then it's up to the public
to make the decision.

391
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,877
They can decide that they don't want
to do anything about global warming.

392
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,675
But they should at least be presented with
the evidence and understand the facts.

Richard: It's such a privilege

399
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,391
to be alive in the 21 st century

400
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,229
and to look out at the stars

401
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,117
to look down a microscope, to
look down an electron microscope

402
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,794
to look into a single cell

403
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,673
and see the prodigious
stupeying complexity

404
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,276
of a single cell and then
realize that there are

405
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,430
trillions of those cells
in your body

406
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,559
all conspiring together
to produce a working machine

407
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
which can walk and run

408
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,392
and eat and have sex and think.

409
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,072
What a privilege it is for each
of us to have in our heads

410
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,796
an organ which is capable of

411
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,670
constructing a model
of the universe.

412
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,152
It is sad that that model
will die when our brain dies

413
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,830
but my goodness what a privilege
it is before we do die.

(Audience cheering) Stephen Colbert:
Welcome back everybody. My guest tonight:

424
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,432
please welcome, Lawrence Krauss.

425
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,630
Hey Dr. Krauss, thank you
so much for coming on.

426
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,836
All right Sir.

427
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,716
Why does what you're saying
have to be an attack on my God?.

428
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,229
It doesn't have to be an attack...
But that's all you've done.

429
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,040
You've attacked my God
for the last six minutes.

430
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,679
No, you have. All I've said
is you don't need him.

431
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
That's an attack.
We've changed our minds about the universe.

432
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,040
We've learned that the universe is more
remarkable than anything we ever thought before

433
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,439
and in fact

434
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,994
changing your mind and, in fact,
being wrong is wonderful.

435
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,991
You should try it sometime.
It's really amazing.

436
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,113
Hmm-mm. It means
that... it means that...

437
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,636
If there is no God, okay

438
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,840
if there is
no thing called God

439
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,560
if he is nothing, can't
something come from him?.

440
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,160
(Audience laughing, cheering)

441
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,560
Lawrence Krauss,
thank you so much.

Lawrence: ((Chuckling)
This makes my day.

447
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,110
Miley Cyrus just tweeted
a picture of me

448
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,953
along with my quote
about stars where I say

449
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,678
'Forget Jesus. Stars died
so you could be born.'

450
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,916
And underneath,
she put the word 'beautiful'.

451
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,474
And she seems to have gotten
a lot of hate mail for that.

452
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,319
I actually think they don't
understand this too because,

453
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,431
you know, they think she's
saying the quote is beautiful

454
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,117
but clearly what she's saying is
that the picture of me is beautiful.

455
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,679
(Audience applauding)

456
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,637
Lawrence: I think we both agree
that what people want to do

457
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,838
is they want to believe, to take
that line from The X-F;iles...

458
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,952
(Audience laughing)

459
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,840
They want to believe in
believing and so most people

460
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,990
of faith, I think,
in our society

461
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,150
naturally pick and
choose from the doctrine

462
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,159
those things they find
absolutely ridiculous

463
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,753
and throw out.
Yeah.

464
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
And the Pope would say
that's not palatable.

465
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,800
And I would tend
to agree with the Pope.

466
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
I think, if you can't
believe some of this stuff

467
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,319
and need to throw it out,
just forget the whole thing.

468
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,195
Yeah.

469
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,320
That would be my view

470
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,754
and I suspect that

471
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,909
well there are, what, 535
members of the U.S. congress

472
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,272
and 1 has said that he doesn't
believe in a supreme being?.

473
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,915
That's statistically
not possible.

474
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,631
(Audience laughing)
I mean

475
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,518
a fair number of those members of congress
presumably have had some sort of education.

476
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,592
There have got to be
a very substantial number

477
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,633
of atheistic members
of the United States congress

478
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,156
probably more than a couple
of hundred would be my guess.

479
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,191
And yet they cannot admit it

480
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,869
and so in order to get elected

481
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,636
you have got to lie
about your belies.

482
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,792
I think that's right and I think
it's good to call them on it.

483
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,110
I disagree with you
slightly maybe because

484
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,077
I've spent a lot more
time in this country.

485
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,718
I would say

486
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,153
if people don't hold their
religion on their sleeve

487
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,920
then it's not relevant to them

488
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,831
then it's not in
the public domain

489
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,877
and journalists needn't
ask questions about it.

490
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,071
But if they do hold their
religion on their sleeve

491
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,153
then it becomes in the public
domain and it becomes

492
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,037
appropriate for journalists
to bring it up.

493
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,833
Because then it's an action.
They're saying 'Elect me

494
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
because I'm a person of faith.'

495
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,432
But I'm coming back

496
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,511
to the nub of the
question which is that

497
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,628
even if they don't take
any action based upon it...

498
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,316
I mean, an extreme example

499
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,198
which I actually published
on a blog somewhere

500
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,438
was a hypothetical doctor
who doesn't believe

501
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,000
in the sex theory
of reproduction

502
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,355
believes in
the stork theory of...

503
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,113
of reproduction.

504
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,634
I thought I was pushing
to the limit,

505
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,632
I assumed that everybody would
agree with me at least here,

506
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,234
that you would not wish
to consult such a doctor.

507
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,230
Not a bit of it.
I was kicked around the room.

508
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,233
'The doctor's private beliefs
are his private beliefs.

509
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,397
They're no business of yours.
So long as he can

510
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,676
take your appendix out
or whatever he has to do

511
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,433
then it doesn't matter that
he doesn't believe in sex.

512
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,476
He believes in
the stork theory.'

513
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,312
That's where we're
disagreeing because...

514
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,279
Because the stork theory is relevant
to his career as a doctor...

515
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,396
Make him an eye doctor then.

516
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,829
Then I'd have to say
for a politician

517
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,390
(Audience laughing)
I think there are rights to privacy.

518
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,158
I mean, I think
if someone believes

519
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,600
that it's okay for them
to have sex with animals

520
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,195
I shouldn't ask that question as long as
they don't make it a campaign platform.

521
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
And and and...

522
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,480
And so I happen to think that
there some a right to privacy

523
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,840
in the sense that, if you don't
wear it on your sleeve,

524
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,037
and these candidates do wear it
on their sleeve, including Obama.

525
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,280
And I think once
you bring that up

526
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,554
then it becomes fair game.

527
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,600
Now let's end with...
Because you pointed out

528
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,238
that there's one
member of congress...

529
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,876
And I didn't know there were that many...
(Audience laughing)

530
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,997
who argue that he doesn't
believe in a supreme being.

531
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,720
I just wrote an article
about a study

532
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,029
that's been done by a
group of psychologists

533
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,391
in Canada
and the United States...

534
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,469
It's just been published...

535
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,388
That asks what groups
people distrust

536
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,516
and it turns out

537
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,316
the group that is distrusted
the most are atheists.

538
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,908
Well they're not quite the most.
They're on par with rapists.

539
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,439
(Audience laughs)

540
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,628
And I wonder
if you could comment.

541
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,720
Well that seems to me
to be an adequate explanation

542
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,080
for why so many members
of the United States congress

543
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,720
are obviously lying
about their private beliefs.

544
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,359
I mean, if you're
on a par with rapists...

545
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,838
I suspect that
we've already had

546
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,674
in this country quite a number of
atheist presidents. I suspect.

547
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,675
It wouldn't surprise me in the
least if Kennedy was an atheist.

548
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,189
It wouldn't surprise me
if Clinton was an atheist.

549
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,475
It wouldn't surprise me
if Obama's an atheist.

550
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,550
But you cannot admit it or you
simply don't get elected.

551
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,797
I would like to start
a campaign for

552
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,915
Iame-duck presidents and senators
and people to say

553
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,788
'Okay I'm not standing
for election anymore.

554
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,309
I'm an atheist. I've been
an atheist all along.'

555
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,233

00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,199
Yes, that's right.

Hi Lawrence. Darren. How's it going?.

Oh no.

a real place to interview.

And so these mics work?.
I don't have to wear one?.

Lawrence Krauss welcome to One Plus One.
It's great to be here.

576
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,718
Albert Einstein was once
quoted as saying

577
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,268
'If you can't explain it
to a six-year-old,

578
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,078
you don't
understand it yourself.'

579
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,231
Your latest book
A Universe From Nothing

580
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,197
deals with some
fairly weighty topics.

581
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,796
How would you explain
to a six-year-old

582
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,592
that the universe
came from nothing?.

583
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,398
Oh well...
((Man chattering)

584
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,954
I see what you mean
but it's very unjust.

585
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,235
I mean, telling children
they're going to hell

586
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,435
is surely by any standards wicked.
I mean that's just evil.

587
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,074
But I am not

588
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,680
doing anything remotely
comparable to that.

589
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,194
What I'm doing is telling
children 'think for yourself.'

590
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,713
'Look for the evidence.'

591
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,592
I'm not saying 'This is the way it is.
Youd better believe it or else.'

592
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,995
Well it's funny
because six-year-olds

593
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,958
are a lot less biased
than adults often

594
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,320
and the neat thing is
I'd try and tell them that

595
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,560
nothing is not exactly
what they thought it was.

596
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,840
It was a little bit different.
That the laws of physics

597
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,116
tell you that even empty space is much
more interesting than you thought.

598
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,360
Empty space is a boiling
bubbling brew of stuff

599
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,193
that's popping in and out
of existence every second.

600
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,154
And what's more amazing is that
we've learned that if you take

601
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,153
just a bit of space and get
rid of all the particles

602
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,878
and all the radiation
and everything

603
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,550
that it still weighs something
and we don't understand why.

604
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,796

joining us on One Plus One.

((Man continues indistinct)

611
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,238
What a disgusting idea.

612
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,880
I mean, the idea that the
only way to forgive somebody

613
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,279
is to have a scapegoat,

614
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,148
to have your own son
tortured and killed

615
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,317
because there's
no other way to forgive.

616
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,358
The idea that there
can be no forgiveness

617
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,591
without bloodshed,
without punishment

618
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,192
is an ancient idea
and it's a horrible one.

619
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,830
In the particular case of the
doctrine of original sin

620
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,634
the original sin is suppose to
have been committed by Adam

621
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,472
who as we now know
never existed.

622
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,996
So we now have the preposterous
idea that Jesus was sacrificed

623
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,915
the scapegoat was sacrificed

624
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,474
for the sin of
a nonexistent forbear.

625
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,592
((Man speaking)
((Over intercom, indistinct)

626
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,280
That's the fellow who finally let me in.
He was out having a phone call.

627
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,919
Yes yeah. Hi I'm Jenny.
How are you?.

628
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,280
Hi. Good. I'm glad there's someone
here to actually do this.

629
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,599
Man: 26 to 8.

630
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,360
Hop over there Lawrence.
There you go.

631
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,679
It's good to see you again.

632
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,478
It is 26 to 8 on 702.

633
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,840
Lawrence Krauss is our guest.

634
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,559
His latest book is called
A Universe From Nothing.

635
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
You say the universe continues
to get weirder. Are there moments when

636
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,028
we might break through and things
suddenly make more sense for you?.

637
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,112
'cause some of the stuff you
do really upsets some people

638
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,237
and really inspires other people
to back their own belies.

639
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,999
Would you prefer that it was just
an esoteric academic discussion?.

640
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,160
No it's not esoteric.
These are wonderful things.

641
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,593
Everyone should be
talking about them.

642
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,960
It's some of the most beautiful ideas
and discoveries humans have ever made.

643
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,520
And if it upsets people,
how can learning about

644
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,318
how the universe really
works upset people?.

645
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,833
And it is a shame that it does.

646
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,520
Instead of being threatened
or having our faith threatened

647
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,873
by the discoveries of science

648
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,749
we should realise that we
should force our beliefs

649
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,680
to conform to the evidence of reality
rather than the other way around

650
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,160
and we should take joy in the
fact that we are actually here

651
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,080
in this random moment able
to even ask those questions

652
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,440
and get close enough
to the answers.

653
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,715
We don't have the ultimate answers.
I don't claim in the book

654
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,028
that I have
the ultimate answers.

655
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,396
I talk about what's plausible and
the fact that we're learning

656
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
we're getting closer
and closer to even

657
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,316
potentially answering
these ultimate questions

658
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,958
is something that
we should all celebrate.

659
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,235
People shouldn't be
threatened by science.

seen in any library recently.

I got to go...

670
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Man: Professor Dawkins,
what do you see

671
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,914
or rather hope for the
future of atheism

672
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,228
in the public sphere?.

673
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,668
My hope for the future of atheism is
that it will no longer be necessary.

674
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,478
We don't call ourselves
a-Thor-ists and a-Zeus-ists

675
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,757
and a-Leprechaun-ists

676
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,512
because it's not necessary.

677
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,397
And my hope is that
the day will come

678
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,560
when it's simply
taken for granted

679
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,040
that everybody doesn't
believe in yahweh

680
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,270
any more than they believe
in Thor and Jupiter.

681
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,476
I think there's some indication

682
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,599
that the religious lobby is
getting increasingly desperate

683
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,037
and is increasing
the venom and the vitriol

684
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,709
with which they fight back.

685
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,349
And I think what we may be seeing is
the beginning of the death throes.

686
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,040
And when you see a wounded
animal in its death throes

687
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,473
it tends to lash out.

Lawrence: There is a similarity...
My friend Richard Dawkins

727
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,433
who is here was kind enough to
write the afterword for the book

728
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,990
and he made a wonderful comparison
which is that there's some similarity.

729
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,594
Beore Darwin,
life was a miracle.

730
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,480
You couldn't ask 'Where did the diversity
of life come from?? It was a miracle.

731
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,760
It was designed.
What Darwin showed

732
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,716
were very simple
laws of biology.

733
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,874
Natural selection and genetic
mutation essentially

734
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,070
could produce all
the diversity of life,

735
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,160
the complexity we now see,
from very simple beginnings

736
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,798
with no miracle.

737
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,313
Now at the time he did it,
did it prove it?. No.

738
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,953
But it was plausible. Now there's
been 1 50 years of proof.

739
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,109
Now we take it the next step. Do we know
how the first forms of life started?.

740
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,235
Absolutely not.

741
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
But it's certainly plausible

742
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,029
that given everything we know
about genetics biochemistry

743
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,320
that chemistry by natural
processes can turn into biology.

744
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,760
Do we know that?. No.
But it's plausible.

745
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,797
And that's worth celebrating...
That you don't need miracles.

746
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,080
And the same is true
for the universe.

747
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,400
We've taken from biology
to that fundamental question

748
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,836
which was the last bastion
for many people of God:

749
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,832
'Why is there something rather than
nothing?? And said 'You don't need him.'

750
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,918
If this is the case,
and our universe

751
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,800
just popped into existence,
and space and time

752
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,160
were created in our universe the
moment it came into existence

753
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,798
along with the laws
of physics we measure

754
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,395
then there's an object,
if you want to call it that,

755
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,072
that is greater
than our universe.

756
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,152
We call it in physics now
the multiverse,

757
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,629
in which case there are
many possible universes.

758
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,800
From a philosophical
perspective

759
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,756
people have a problem with a
universe that had a beginning.

760
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,991
That's why they invented God:
'cause they want something eternal,

761
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,832
with no cause... first cause,

762
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,354
prime mover... you pick
your philosophy or theology.

763
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,035
The point is that the multiverse

764
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,395
now serves the role
of the prime mover.

765
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,518
From a philosophical
perspective

766
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,349
It could be eternal and
certainly beyond our universe.

767
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,800
But the thing I also want to point out... I've
debated with Christian apologists often

768
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,679
and they say 'You invented the
multiverse cause you don't like God.'

769
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,472
Well it's true,
I don't like God.

770
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,271
But the multiverse was proposed

771
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,516
because the laws of physics
are driving us to it.

772
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,149
I don't even like the multiverse but
if nature tells me that's the case

773
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,153
and the laws of physics are
accidental, I've got to live with it.

774
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,475
So to conclude,

775
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,112
I've told you today the
universe can come from nothing.

776
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,839
More importantly I've told you

777
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,958
that you were far more insignificant
than you ever thought

778
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,029
and that's what I want you
to celebrate here today.

779
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,439
But instead of taking...

780
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,760
People say science takes away
spiritual fulfilment

781
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,829
and wonder and awe
and happiness.

782
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,038
You should be happier because you're
insignificant and the future's miserable

783
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,759
'cause you're here today
and you're endowed

784
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,600
by evolution with a conscience
and an intelligence

785
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,272
and you can ask these questions.

786
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,954
So instead of being depressed
and requiring meaning

787
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,678
in the universe
beyond your own existence

788
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,512
you create your own meaning

789
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,672
and enjoy your brief moment in the sun.
Thank you very much.

790
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,880
But the problem is that
most people, most of the time

791
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,160
are desperate to
believe ridiculous

792
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,080
and divisive ideas for
patently emotional reasons.

793
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,752
And while rarely explicit

794
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,558
what they're really
worried about is death.

795
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,520
When we're arguing about teaching
evolution in the schools

796
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,114
I would argue that we are
really arguing about death.

797
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,357
It seems to me
the only reason why

798
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,079
any religious person
cares about evolution

799
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,469
is because if their holy books
are wrong about our origins

800
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,713
they're very likely wrong about
our destiny after death.

801
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,078
Ex-Muslims like me

802
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,954
in Europe and in North America

803
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,473
are growing in number.

804
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,358
We give speeches, we publish
articles and books

805
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,476
and we communicate
with one another.

806
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,235
'Infidel' was the
epithet, an insult

807
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,550
that was thrown at me
over and over again

808
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,518
by family and former
Muslim friends.

809
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,713
It is a label that I now wear

810
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,916
with pride and joy.

811
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,720
We're in a brand new
age for religions.

812
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,757
For millennia, religions
did not have to worry

813
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,838
about the flock

814
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,760
acquiring lots of information

815
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,876
about other religions
or about their own religion.

816
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,840
These religions evolved
culturally in a world

817
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,760
of easy-to-maintain ignorance.

818
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,228
But the new transparency
of information brought about

819
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,949
by technology, cell phones,
the Internet and all the rest

820
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,998
is the first
really drastic change

821
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,992
in the epistemological
environment that religions

822
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,071
have had to face
in several millennia.

823
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,832
Thanks for your attention.

824
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,160
Man: To many he's more than
an evolutionary biologist.

825
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,912
He's a champion
of science and reason.

826
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,918
He's convinced many around the
world that it's more than okay

827
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,592
to come out as an atheist.

828
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,671
Please welcome to the stage

829
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,716
our final speaker of day two

830
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,160
of the Global Atheists
Convention, Richard Dawkins.

831
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,879
(Audience cheering)

832
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,274
Richard: I want to take
back intelligent design.

833
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,798
I want to take back
other hijacked words.

834
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,160
Just as the feminists have
rallied around the phrase

835
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,388
'take back the night'

836
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,600
maybe we should take back
intelligent design

837
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,158
in the true sense of the word.

838
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,117
Let's take back morality.

839
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,760
Let's redesign our morality

840
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,718
rather than trying to read
what's right and wrong

841
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,756
in a 3,000 year-old book.

842
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,513
Religion has hijacked
morality for centuries.

843
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,512
Let's take it back
and intelligently design it.

844
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,069
Let's intelligently
design our lives

845
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,114
rather than be dictated to
by priests and mullahs.

846
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,839
Let's intelligently
design our future

847
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,640
using the gift of foresight

848
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,040
something that never
existed before brains...

849
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,431
And for practical purposes that
means human brains... evolved.

850
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,989
The ability to design

851
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,560
is one of the crowning
glories of our species.

852
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,278
Bridges, planes, buildings,

853
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,351
all sorts of
ingenious contraptions.

854
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,597
The essence of design, in
this true sense of the word,

855
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,115
is deliberate foresight.

856
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,073
Human designers can
look into the future

857
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,151
and see the possible mistakes

858
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,151
see the possible pitfalls

859
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,390
try things out in imagination...

860
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,160
Above all, look into the
future, which is something

861
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,549
natural selection cannot do.

862
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,760
This is one of the major
misunderstandings of evolution.

863
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,000
People are so used to the idea

864
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,800
that natural selection produces
apparently good design

865
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,360
that they think that natural
selection must be capable

866
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,040
of peering into the
future of taking steps

867
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,794
to stop the species going
extinct, for example.

868
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,550
Never happens. It cannot happen.

869
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,200
Nature cannot plan
for the future;,

870
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,713
the human brain can.

871
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,350
We can look at trends
in the present

872
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,351
and extrapolate into the future.

873
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,671
We can foresee
possible scenarios

874
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,751
that might lead to
our species going extinct

875
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,435
and take steps to avoid it.

876
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,431

you do it with

that it is born

Lawrence: I guess the best
part of communicating

is the excitement.

899

Science turns us on. Science is fun.
Science excites us.

You can't communicate unless you're
excited but on the other hand

I feel it's so
fascinating for me

that I want to tell
people about it.

903

Carl Sagan said

'When you're in love
you want to tell the world.'

905

I'm in love with science
and I have to tell the world.

idea that science is just fun.

Science is hard.
Yeah.

And so it's not fun in the sense
that it's just sort of...

Easy and you can laze around doing it.
It is hard.

That'd be perfect. "

as weaning off
the wisdom of old books

visited by somebody

926
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,959
and Galileo showed this person
something through his telescope

927
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,392
and it contradicted
what he thought before

928
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,353
and eventually he said
'Mr. Galileo your demonstration

929
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,989
is so convincing
that were it not

930
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,469
that Aristotle positively
states the contrary,

931
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
I would believe you.'

932
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,870
He was actually looking
through a telescope.

933
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,120
Lawrence:
It's surprising in some sense,

934
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,430
that we're talked about as being
arrogant for somehow saying

935
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,756
we create our own importance

936
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,990
that our knowledge
and our understanding

937
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,355
and the way we live our lives
is what makes our importance.

938
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,796
People don't seem to recognise that
a universe that's created for us

939
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,313
is a little more arrogant.

940
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,791
Richard:
Incredibly arrogant yes.

941
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,873
Lawrence: And for me
that's the most powerful

942
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,394
and enlivening thing
is the fact that more

943
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,310
unimportant we become
the more powerful

944
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,274
is the importance of science
for pointing out that

945
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,400
the universe exists
whether we like it or not.

946
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,359
Richard: That cosmic humility is the exact
opposite of what we're often accused of.

947
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,839
Science is responsible

948
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,799
for the justified
humility of humanity

949
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,711
which is a new thing.

950
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,954
Lawrence:
Richard I remember vividly

951
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,430
the very first time we had a
discussion that we disagreed.

952
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,273
I argued to you
that I thought that

953
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,319
if you were trying to convince
people of your point

954
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,472
the first thing you shouldn't say is
'Everything you believe is wrong

955
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,158
and you're really stupid'

956
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,559
and it's better to try and
sort of go where they are.

957
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,473
Yeah, I mean, I think

958
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,833
I, myself, have been convinced
of somebody telling me

959
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,239
'Everything you believe
is rubbish.'

960
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,312
As a student I was
very persuaded by

961
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,269
that old French theologian
Teilhard De Chardin

962
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,630
who wrote a book called
The Phenomenon Of Man

963
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,039
which is...

964
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,394
pretentious gibberish

965
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,232
but it fooled me
when I was a student.

966
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,590
And then I read Peter Medawar's

967
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,236
brilliant review
of the book which is

968
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,073
almost certainly the best negative
book review ever written.

969
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,748
And I was completely
turned around by that

970
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,880
even though you might think
I'd have pushed back

971
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,713
and said 'Wait a minute. You're
insulting my intelligence.'

972
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,075
Well yes, maybe you are
insulting my intelligence.

973
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,440
I deserve to have
my intelligence insulted.

974
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,590
People get...
In fact there's a lot of...

975
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,355
There's a lot of research
that says pedagogically

976
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,680
the only way you can
really get people to learn

977
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,070
is by confronting their own
misconceptions and using them.

978
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,230
I use it in physics
all the time.

979
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,239
Kids learn stuff on...

980
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,831
You write stuff on the blackboard it
goes in one ear and out the other

981
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,269
but if you confront a belie they
have and show them immediately

982
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,069
that they can see for themselves
it's crazy, then they remember it.

983
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,479
Richard: Yes.

984
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,110
Woman: This weekend the Reason
Rally took over the National Mall

985
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,155
here in Washington D.C.

986
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,400
Billed as the largest gathering of the
secular movement in world history

987
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,840
National Mall Parks Service estimated that
over 30,000 people were in attendance.

988
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,308
And despite the rain, the
participants waited for hours

989
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,320
to see speakers
like Lawrence Krauss,

990
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,515
Richard Dawkins, Adam
Savage, so we have to ask

991
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,830
what the largest gathering
in history of atheists,

992
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,957
humanists, secularists,
free thinkers, skeptics...

993
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,359
What does it really mean?.

994
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,640
Man: I'm David Silverman
president of American Atheists

995
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,160
and I would like to
welcome you all to this

996
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,080
the largest atheist gathering
in world history.

997
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,674
((Cheering)

998
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,240
But I don't believe in God.
I have two proofs

999
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,993
for not believing in God... First
of all, God, if you're there,

1000
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,116
we're here in Washington.
Come down now.

1001
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,080
If you're there,
this is a pretty good time.

1002
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,753
I'm sure Fox News would love it.
Just come down, say hello.

1003
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,436
We are the people
who believe in this life.

1004
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,988
We are the people
who believe in morality.

1005
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,868
If you are doing something
for reward or punishment,

1006
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,076
you do not have morality.

1007
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,674
Let's make it
so they're as embarrassed

1008
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,557
to say something bad
about atheists

1009
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,274
as they are to say
something bad about Mormons.

1010
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,077
Mormon.

1011
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,591
Mormon. ((Cackling)

1012
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,469
* Thank you God
for fixing the cataracts *

1013
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,993
* Of Sam's mum *

1014
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,030
* I didn't realise
that it was so simple *

1015
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,714
* But you showed a great example
of just how it can be done *

1016
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,680
* They only need to pray
in a particular spot *

1017
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,955
* To a particular version
of a particular God *

1018
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,190
* And if you pull that off
without a hitch *

1019
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,473
* He will fix one eye of one
middle-class white bitch *

1020
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,679
They are ruled by fear.

1021
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,591
That's not my style
and it's not yours either.

1022
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,636
Folks it's certainly time
that we all grew up.

1023
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,598
Instead of forging ahead
into the 1 4th century

1024
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,190
we should be embracing
the 21 st by writing fini,

1025
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,437
to the belie in the
bigoted, capricious, cruel,

1026
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,159
deceitful, genocidal,
homophobic,

1027
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,080
misogynistic, racist,

1028
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,640
vindictive and violent bully.

1029
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,917
((Cheering)

1030
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,518
Ladies and gentlemen thank you.

1031
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,040
Folks, Professor
Richard Dawkins.

1032
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,679

01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,549
((Chanting) Richard! Richard!
Richard! Richard!

01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,475
((Chanting continues)

1035
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,757
What a magnificent,
inspiring sight.

1036
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,794
I was expecting great things
even in fine weather.

1037
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,513
In the rain look at this.

1038
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,990
This is the most incredible sight
I can remember ever seeing.

1039
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,679
How is it necessary
to have a rally

1040
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,751
for reason?.

1041
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,790
How could anyone rally
against reason?.

1042
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,194
I am often accused of

1043
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,631
expressing contempt and
despising religious people.

1044
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,635
I don't despise
religious people;,

1045
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,915
I despise what they stand for.

1046
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,589
There are too many
people in this country

1047
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,030
who have been cowed into fear

1048
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,920
of coming out as atheists

1049
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,593
or secularists or agnostics.

1050
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,230
We are far more numerous
than anybody realises.

1051
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,999
((Cheering)

1052
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,669
What I want to suggest you
do when you meet somebody

1053
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,800
who claims to be
religious, ask them,

1054
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,597
'Do you really believe

1055
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,680
that when a priest
blesses a wafer

1056
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,320
it turns into
the body of Christ?.

1057
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,676
Are you seriously telling me
you believe that?'.

1058
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,832
Don't fall for the convention

1059
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,993
that we're all too polite
to talk about religion.

1060
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,395
Religion is not off the table.

1061
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,431
Religion is not off limits.

1062
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,832
Religion makes specific
claims about the universe

1063
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,031
which need to be substantiated

1064
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,590
and need to be challenged
and if necessary

1065
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,558
need to be ridiculed
with contempt.

1066
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,314
Thank you very much.

1067
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,560
Lawrence?. Yes yeah?.

1068
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,949
Do you mind if we get a picture?.
No problem.

1069
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,160
Hi. It is so good to meet you.

1070
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,520
Can I get a picture of you real quick?.
Sure yeah.

1071
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,840
I seen you on the TV.
Yeah.

1072
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,600
Hey Dr. Krauss. Hi.

1073
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,920
Could I shake your hand too?.
Sure.

1074
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,200
Can I shake
your hand really quick?.

1075
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,600
Your Universe Of Nothing speech
started my road to atheism.

1076
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,880
Hi how are you?.

1077
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,840
I'm Kenny Hibb
from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

1078
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,760
Oh okay.

1079
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,240
Went back to school for science becasue of you.

1080
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,280
I'm a big fan.

1081
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,280
It's not like a pancake.
It's like the space...

1082
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,919
With the x-y-z axis
just remain perpendicular.

1083
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,360
And light travels in a straight line.
Oh okay.

1084
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,160
Bill Maher: Hi everybody
out there on the mall.

1085
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,560
It's a great honour to be
addressing the Reason Rally.

1086
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,320
And when you look at the who's
who lists throughout history

1087
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,920
of people who were either
declared atheists

1088
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,720
or who voiced publicly their opinion
that religion was bullshit

1089
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,032
you can feel a swell of pride as you
stand out there on the mall today.

1090
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,720
Let's let everybody know

1091
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,320
that they can come out of
the closet if they're afraid to

1092
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,960
because we're here to support
them and embrace them

1093
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,520
because this is an amazing
community of people

1094
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,149
who are non-believers
and I think it's wrong

1095
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,754
that the religious right
and various belief systems

1096
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,549
have gotten a monopoly
on morality and patriotism.

1097
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,632
We are Americans and we're
moral and righteous Americans

1098
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,312
and we don't need
a God to prove it.

1099
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,909
Come on out and join us.

1100
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,796
I have concluded through
careful empirical analysis

1101
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,553
and much thought that somebody
is looking out for me

1102
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,437
keeping track of what
I think about things

1103
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,670
forgiving me when I
do less than I ought

1104
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,000
giving me strength to shoot for
more than I think I'm capable of.

1105
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,160
I believe they know everything that I
do and think and they still love me

1106
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,390
and I've concluded
after careul consideration

1107
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,480
that this person
keeping score is me.

1108
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,948
((Laughter, cheering)

1109
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,240
Immanuel Kant was asked
'What is the enlightenment?'.

1110
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,631
He said 'Sapere aude:
Dare to know.'

1111
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,640
The age of reason then
was an age when humanity

1112
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,160
was born again

1113
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,957
not from original sin

1114
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,074
but from original ignorance
and dependence on authority.

1115
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,037
Never again!
((Cheering)

1116
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
Man: Folks you're
in for a treat.

1117
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,116
The author of
the New York Times bestseller.

1118
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,520
A Universe From Nothing

1119
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,397
((crowd cheering)

1120
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,680
Please welcome physicist
Dr. Lawrence Krauss!

1121
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,955
((Cheering)

1122
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,360
As was just pointed out
a few years ago,

1123
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,670
my friend Richard Dawkins asked
me to give a talk at a meeting

1124
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,352
called The Universe From Nothing, so I did.

1125
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,920
Today I want to talk about
something that's equally plausible

1126
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,069
but much more tragic:

1127
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,909
How to get nothing
from something.

1128
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,154
It's happened a number of
times in human history.

1129
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,354
It happened during
the medieval era

1130
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,757
when religious dogma

1131
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,559
erased the enlightenment
of the Greeks.

1132
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,430
Measuring the circumference of the
earth all of that was forgotten.

1133
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,708
It happened in the Arabic world

1134
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,750
in the 11th century when
what was then the centre

1135
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,036
of culture and mathematics became

1136
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,720
an economic and intellectual backwater

1137
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,439
because of Islamic fundamentalism.

1138
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,078
And it can happen today.

1139
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,991
But the 21 st century

1140
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,995
is placing challenges
on us like we've never had:

1141
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,919
Global climate change,
over population,

1142
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,353
the energy crisis,

1143
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,234
the need finally to educate

1144
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,678
and stop the subjugation
of women around the world.

1145
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,556
Einstein said 60-odd years ago

1146
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,076
after we exploded
the first atomic weapon

1147
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,229
that everything has changed,
save the way we think.

1148
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,718
And unless we change
the way we think

1149
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:16,194
and unless we're willing to revere
open questioning, discussion,

1150
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,919
and a public policy
based on reality,

1151
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,680
we can take this wonderful
world we have now in many ways

1152
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,352
and turn something into nothing

1153
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,835
and we all have to make
sure that doesn't happen.

1154
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,638
Thank you very much.

1155
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,075
Man: Dr. Lawrence Krauss!

1156
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,555
I do see a problem
that you can't live a life

1157
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,315
based on delusion.

1158
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,358
You can't hold out reality
all the time

1159
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,476
and just exist in a fake world.

1160
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,838
You've got to constantly,
not only be challenging

1161
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,480
your own belies
but be willing to

1162
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,230
say that you have been
wrong and misinformed

1163
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,676
for your whole life
and change your views.

1164
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,673
Otherwise, you know,
it's a mindless existence.

1165
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,040
And that's not to say they don't
have the right to believe.

1166
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,191
I believe everyone has
the right to believe anything.

1167
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,794
They have the right
to believe anything

1168
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,918
but I have the right to find
that belief ridiculous.

1169
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,395
I've had people on
Twitter say things like

1170
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,480
'Everyone has the right
to their own opinion

1171
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,755
so just keep quiet
about your atheism.'

1172
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,671
Brilliant. There it is.

1173
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,671
You've summed it up for me.
Well done.

1174
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,518
I did a courtroom
scene on a show

1175
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,990
and I look at the judge
and right above his head

1176
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,308
it says In God We Trust.

1177
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,231
I mean, this should've hit me
before being on The Good Wife.

1178
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,629
But I just can't believe it.

1179
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,680
I just can't believe
that in 201 2

1180
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,272
that's in our courts system.

1181
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,918
These notions aren't shared
by everyone in America.

1182
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,679
W;ith religion the stories
have been told over centuries

1183
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,193
and science is always
telling a new story.

1184
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,236
And I think that that's
what's hard for people

1185
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,356
who hold religion as the truth

1186
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,152
to understand that

1187
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,276
science is something
that's broader.

1188
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,360
It doesn't start
6,000 years ago,

1189
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,440
it starts 4 or 5
billion years ago

1190
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,829
and that is a really...

1191
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,560
there's a lot more information
in there, in the book,

1192
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,632
if we had a book,
it'd be a lot thicker.

1193
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,400
And of course
we have seen backlash

1194
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,200
against scientific
understanding of reality.

1195
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,952
We have seen it
in many religions

1196
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,598
not only in the United States.

1197
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,480
So I believe
there's a great value

1198
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,233
in promoting this kind of work.

1199
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,840
People who like science are all
drawn to it for the same reason:

1200
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,432
It explains the physical world.

1201
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,238
What is this stuff?.

1202
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,912
Is it the last word

1203
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,757
on what reality is and what
the physical world is?.

1204
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,160
I don't know

1205
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,640
but if it's not the last word

1206
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,278
it's at least the best word.

1207
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,678
In our increasingly
complex scientific

1208
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,440
and technological civilisation,

1209
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,520
many policy issues require
scientific knowledge.

1210
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,480
How then can the public
exercise democratic control

1211
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,755
if it doesn't
understand science?.

1212
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,840
I think it's very
important to advance

1213
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,040
the pro-science view
in the modern world.

1214
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,238
What could be bad
about advancing

1215
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,310
knowledge and enlightenment?.

1216
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,593
It can only be a good thing.

1217
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,000
If you don't get that there's
some objective place

1218
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,920
from which we can all start,
which we call science,

1219
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,520
a place where we get rid of our biases
and get back to what we can observe

1220
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,680
if you don't think that's
the best place to start

1221
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,840
these conversations from

1222
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,559
then where do you
start them from?.

1223
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,640
You have to start from
'Well my evidence shows

1224
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,960
that gay people are just like
me and they love each other

1225
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,188
or that women are smart.'

1226
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,596
The magic book kills discussion.

1227
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:45,400
I went to Israel for the first
time the summer beore last.

1228
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,360
People always say 'Oh you go to
Israel, you're gonna be changed forever.

1229
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,237
You're gonna feel
so connected.'

1230
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,596
And I just... I didn't
feel that at all.

1231
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,840
I went... it just was so...

1232
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,593
When I saw the Western
Wall especially,

1233
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,678
and that this much room
was for the men

1234
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,432
and this much room
was for the women

1235
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,512
and they said 'Cover your
shins and cover this up

1236
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,160
or people will throw
rocks at you'

1237
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,114
and I just felt like
'(beep) you!'

1238
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,120
All I felt was '(beep) you!'

1239
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,680
I didn't feel
connected to anything

1240
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,591
because it wasn't
including me as an equal.

1241
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,236
It's the rules.
It's the arbitrary rules.

1242
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,309
He gave you free will.

1243
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,076
Well then why is he sending
me to hell for using it?.

1244
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,400
He moves in mysterious ways.

1245
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,231
I mean 'moves in
mysterious ways...'

1246
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,800
That is the philosophical
equivalent of going... running away.

1247
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,360
You know?. It's strange
'moves in mysterious ways.'

1248
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,080
What's the difference between a
random God and no God at all?.

1249
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,149
That's what I'd say.

1250
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,080
I think people don't really
believe the myths they invent.

1251
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,913
I've been to many
funerals in which

1252
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,440
the priest has spoken
of an afterlife

1253
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,200
and even the people
who are there

1254
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,111
are sobbing profusely.

1255
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,511
They don't really think
they're gonna meet

1256
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,556
their loved one
in five years time.

1257
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,631
If, on the other hand,
you stood on the quayside

1258
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,880
and watched the Queen Mary
set off for New York

1259
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,269
the people on the quayside are
not crying because they know

1260
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,999
they're going to see those
people again fairly soon.

1261
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,232
A funeral is fundamentally different
yet it should be the same.

1262
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,111
I think myths are like a drug.

1263
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,634
I think a lot of people
would rather just

1264
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,517
take the myth pill

1265
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,076
that makes them feel
nice and cozy and warm

1266
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,720
and fuzzy and okay
with everything

1267
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,719
rather than have to
look at the reality

1268
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,960
of what the world actually
is because it's so big.

1269
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,509
But then I think what's
so great about the world

1270
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,478
being so big or the
universe being so big

1271
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,512
is that it's so big
and that is so cool.

1272
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,390
Early Christians were called
atheists by the Romans

1273
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,920
'cause they didn't
believe in all the gods.

1274
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,832
I love that. That's what
atheism is really.

1275
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,795
It's the belief in one
less God than you.

1276
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,715
The whole forward movement of

1277
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,308
trying to do this thing, give
the people the opportunity

1278
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,880
to be educated to a point
where they don't have to

1279
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,075
Iean on stuff that's
probably not there

1280
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,713
is a worthy cause.

1281
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,830
You have to be able to
offer someone alternatives

1282
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,040
to the way they view the world

1283
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,553
or how can they learn something?.

1284
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,995
You can't keep teaching someone

1285
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,079
something they already know.

1286
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,633
If you are so attached to your belie
system that you stop listening

1287
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,160
out of fear of that
being challenged

1288
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,115
or shaken

1289
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,479
you're dead.

1290
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,760
Most scientists are
not up for this game

1291
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,080
of taking on these things

1292
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,150
and having it become a forum

1293
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,433
but once you start to step
up in front of doubters

1294
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,592
it becomes this idea of really

1295
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,156
can you change people's
minds from this debate

1296
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,158
or are you just
taking rocks

1297
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,276
and bashing each
other's brains out?.
