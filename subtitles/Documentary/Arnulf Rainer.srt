1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,594
You are psychotherapist?

2
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,564
No, would like to be one.
Fucking handwriting, right? - Yes.

3
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:10,322
No, pyrotechnician. What exactly
Do I get for this. In cash, I mean?

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:16,490
Well we...
We thought of ...

5
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,964
... 1.900 Euro after tax?

6
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,567
Oh ... Wow! Oh!
l am your man!

7
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:30,647
You know computers?
- l have send an email once.

8
00:00:32,212 --> 00:00:34,567
They caught me at the airport

9
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:38,401
Twelve years for two times
Bankrobbery.

10
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:41,410
And it was only plastic weapons.
Shit.

11
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:46,282
You are out on probation now?
- Hm, half a year.

12
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:50,041
ls this a problem?
- No, not at all.

13
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,568
Namaste. Namaste.

14
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:58,248
Good, Mister ...

15
00:00:58,412 --> 00:01:01,449
Gopal Tscharan. Gopal Tscharan.

16
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:06,203
Good, Mister Shrin. Then, hmm ... tell us
Something about yourself.

17
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:10,564
I am from Hadravat in lndia.
Been living there.

18
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:14,048
Have been building airplane parts.

19
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:18,450
Five long years, machinery
Machinery, machinery.

20
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:23,202
Enough of machinery. And then I
Met this German woman.

21
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,721
And she told me to come to Germany.

22
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,970
1961 I came to Germany
Been working 20 years for Mercedes Benz

23
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:33,846
In Stuttgart
Machinery, machinery, machinery.

24
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:37,123
Enough of machinery.
I said: ''What should I do?''

25
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:41,803
l went to Berlin and started
To do pantomime.

26
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:45,408
Pantomime, Pantomime, Pantomime.
Me quiet, me quiet, me quiet.

27
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,171
Enough of me quiet
What should I do?

28
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,170
In the meantime me meet
Other woman.

29
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:54,170
Told me to come to Maibach.

30
00:01:56,012 --> 00:02:01,086
Ok. - Small job, little one,
If you want to give me? Yes?

31
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:04,927
Well... You know computers
Technical things?

32
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:08,203
Computers?
I am a machine man.

33
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,848
You show me little Computer,
I make Computer for you.

34
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:16,409
I am working for telephone help line
One-Euro-Job.

35
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:22,882
But actually I would like to do something
More meaningful. You have been talking

36
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:26,607
About a project which makes people
Grow intellectually?

37
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:31,125
Well, yeah, it is about
Intellectual freedom, sort of.

38
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,846
Yeah, great!
- What kind of music are you listening to?

39
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:37,123
Oldies, Deejayed a little
Way back then in a youth club.

40
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:42,451
Have to say, sometimes I like to
Turn the volume up, yeah.

41
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,848
Bernd, you did telecommunication
Once, didn't you?

42
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes, I've been learning at the German Telekom
Communications engineering.

43
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:02,967
And afterwards I was in the field service team.

44
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:07,370
Until 1996. They fired me back then.

45
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:12,130
And where do you live now?
- You met me there.

46
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,688
At the petrol station?
- Yes.

47
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,960
Hmm ... Bernd, sorry for asking,
Maybe a bit embarrassing,

48
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:24,165
But I have to ask you:
You have a drinking problem, don't you?

49
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:28,684
Not at all bad, no. Don't worry.
It is no problem for us, I only

50
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,770
Need to know wether you are able
To work. Are you ok with that?

51
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,601
Yes, got it under control, really
- Ok.

52
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:37,690
Bernd, you have the job.

53
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,605
And where are they supposed to live?
ln a container?

54
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,401
No, why? They can stay here in the pension.
Nobody else is living here.

55
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:56,243
No, that is ...
Look, that is not possible.

56
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,528
Now this is a nice house you have got here!

57
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,400
Beer?

58
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:25,287
We need a control center
You understand?

59
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:28,210
Not at my place.

60
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,087
Good.

61
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:45,249
Hey man, get down!
Are you crazy?

62
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:52,290
Hey man, this is no problem.

63
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,131
And then we need a gripper
To strip the coax-insulation.

64
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:15,211
Five times. - Everyone of the working guys
Needs a car of his own,

65
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:19,769
And ... equipment, mobile phones.

66
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:22,281
And finally where do you want
To get the 1.000 Boxen?

67
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:25,131
No problem. Been researching:
These boxes can be ordered

68
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,648
In Switzerland. A little bit of money
But not too much.

69
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,970
Here is the box, Phillip!

70
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:39,727
What are they doing?
- Would like to know.

71
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,288
Well, let's give it a try

72
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:47,005
So we will do it.
- Yes, ok, let's try it.

73
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:57,006
Ok, our mastermind Phillip here
Has developed a plan,

74
00:05:57,132 --> 00:06:00,602
Allowing us to reach all of these targets
Within two months.

75
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:05,089
Two months? That would make it
4.16 boxes...

76
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,011
... a day for each of us.

77
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:10,408
Good mental arithmetic, Karl-Heinz,
Not bad but let's say, five a day.

78
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:13,365
That's easier, so are we ok
With five a day, yes?

79
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,486
Ok, then. Your employee ...

80
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,287
... is called lMA.
''lnstitute for media analysis''.

81
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,687
Get this into your heads.
Very important. Ok?

82
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:26,441
You visit people and tell them
You are installing the latest version

83
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:29,405
Of the quota box.
- How is this going to work, technically?

84
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:33,002
Phillip will tell you this in a minute. Ok?
If some guys want to know more

85
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:36,647
Or if there are any questions, you tell them
To call this emergency number.

86
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:41,004
This is important. The new emergency number
Is one page number one of your info folder, ok?

87
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,646
This is extremely important because if people
Call the real lMA, then we

88
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,809
Have a problem.
Do you understand? - Yes.

89
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:50,004
Gopal? Good.

90
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:55,769
Keyword under class television.
- Under class? Am I under class?

91
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:59,248
No, that is just like in India,
Simply the lowest class.

92
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,761
Boys!
- Ok?

93
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:06,085
This is what we are fighting for. Ok?

94
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,043
Now you are able to fuck these fuckers

95
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:13,683
Who make you feel like shit and who
Do everything to make you stay that way

96
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,765
To fuck them really hard.
- Nice thing!

97
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:21,488
This is it, right?
And this is the key to it all.

98
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,651
Cables counted?
- Yes, yes, yes.

99
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,800
''So let the earth grow
Grass and herbs

100
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:55,004
Let it grow
And be fruitful''

101
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,084
ls a great thing, right?
- Yes.

102
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,727
I am always so enthusiastic, you know what?
You can keep this.

103
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,049
l promise you will find advise
For whatever problem you may have.

104
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,881
And lots of good luck with the garden.

105
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,368
Thank you.
- Have a nice day. - Yes, and you.

106
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:26,131
Benni, put that thing back in again,
Or I have to beat you!

107
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,570
This is all possible because we
Have no death penalty.

108
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:35,765
My husband's saying the same thing.
Our German laws are simply too weak.

109
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:38,326
They should make Guenther Jauch
Rule the country.

110
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:43,128
He would know what to do.
- Yes, you might be right with that.

111
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:14,250
Sorry, I will put it all back in place.

112
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:20,492
Sorry, all back in order, ok?
No problem.

113
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,050
A little to the left
- Wonderful, Dieter.

114
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,288
What is this then?

115
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:33,483
Ouch!

116
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:38,608
Ouch, this hurts.
I am saying, ribs, Dieter. The ribs ...

117
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,121
Have to call emergency.

118
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:44,320
(Pegah) No.
We take over any damages.

119
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,131
Oh yes, of course the assurance
Will cover this.

120
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:52,250
Sure, furniture will be covered as well.

121
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:55,449
Exactly, don't worry. Ok.

122
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,522
Good, talk to you soon.
Thank you.

123
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:01,724
Harry slipped on a curtain.
He is not coming in again today. - What?

124
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,322
He had to go into hospital.
Didn't understand it all.

125
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,889
And how about you?
- How about it?

126
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,563
Fucking shit!
- I, hm ...

127
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,605
Don't know, must have mixed up some cables. -
Mixed up the cables?

128
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:20,648
Karl-Heinz, please!
Mixed up the cables?

129
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:24,931
Short cut, ok? Open fire.
Half the house burnt down.

130
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:28,965
l thought you are the electrician? -
Yes, I am sorry ...

131
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:32,323
l am no electrician.
l ... I lied to you.

132
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,051
I see.

133
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,923
Great! Well done!

134
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:40,647
Yes, but I needed that job. - And you have
To lie to me for that?

135
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,206
Well, have you got a clue,
How's that, jobless, no money?

136
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:04,289
Tell me,

137
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,731
What if we all have to go to prison?

138
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:12,524
And all this for some people
Who don't want to be saved at all?

139
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,604
This is not going to happen

140
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,009
Why are you not being able to sleep then?

141
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,602
I can't sleep since a long time.

142
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:38,965
Guggenheim has donated something?
Why haven't you been there?

143
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,491
Sorry, I  ... excuse me,
I'll call you back later?

144
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,284
Talk to you then, ciao.

145
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,370
Hello.
- Finished, So now I have to ...

146
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:55,484
Why's that? Excuse me!
- Yes, I have other customers as well.

147
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:58,888
Why don't you stay a little longer.
What's your name? ''Juergen''.

148
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,924
l've got a good glass of Whiskey, Juergen.
You have to ... - Sorry, gotta drive.

149
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,612
Come on, that's no problem.
l've got a chauffeur.

150
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,165
But my car is here.
- So what?

151
00:12:08,372 --> 00:12:12,081
Cheers! On us!

152
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,120
In all countries on earth

153
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,801
The working class rules

154
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:24,163
Cologne is in strike

155
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,602
And Cuba is doing the work

156
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:31,281
Moscow is making the weather

157
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,804
And Beijing is doing the reform.

158
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:37,400
l am sleeping now.
- What? You cannot go to sleep now!

159
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:40,171
Sorry, I am so tired. -
And what about your chauffeur?

160
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:00,523
Good morning.
- Hello.

161
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:07,285
You are Mr Kaethner?
- Yes, what is the problem?

162
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,482
The problem is back there.

163
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,926
What has he done? - Mr Bauer
Drove into a bus stop.

164
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,729
That is an assurance case, isn't it? -
Not with so much alcohol.

165
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,730
Additionally I have to mention he is
A troublemaker. And Mr Bauer

166
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:27,685
Has no place to stay, that's why
We have to arrest him.

167
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,770
If he cannot pay for the damage, that is.

168
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:34,727
And how much would that be? - 50.000 Euro.
- 50.000 Euro for a bus stop?

169
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:37,804
That thing cost 100.000 and that's
Only the repair cost.

170
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,446
In the end it can get more expensive
Or cheaper as well.

171
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,091
I cannot pay this anyway.
Take him with you.

172
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,531
Rainer, what's up?

173
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,884
Something wrong here.

174
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:13,964
l am hungry.

175
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,844
He can't do this, really.

176
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,770
Wow. I am gone. I am out of this.
- Shit.

177
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:27,965
Let him do it by himself.
Fuck revolution.

178
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:31,721
How can he be that stupid?
You know what this means?

179
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:35,003
I am finished. I am dead!
This is a fucking mess.

180
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:41,163
We never should have started this
With these bums. Never!

181
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:21,051
Where is everybody?
Time was 8 o'clock for the meeting.

182
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:26,084
Nobody will come. Not any more.
- I see. And why?

183
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:31,128
Why's that...
Because you let Bernd down!

184
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:36,722
l didn't do that. There is exactly
50.000 Euro in this suitcase.

185
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,047
If I spend this right now,
It's all over.

186
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:44,169
Bernd is our buddy
And he trusted you.

187
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:48,408
Bernd did a Job,
And I paid him for.

188
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,407
''Me, myself and I''!
Who do you think you are?

189
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:56,160
You have the money, get some guys,
Have them go to jail for you

190
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,921
And turn around like nothing?

191
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:06,405
This is a human being?
He is in prison now! - Pegah, please.

192
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:19,605
And if that has happened to me,
Would you act the same?

193
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,892
But you are not like that.
Bernd is.

194
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,362
l will not pay this, forget it.

195
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:40,042
Ok. Then I am gone.

196
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,206
Pegah!

197
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,051
Pegah!

198
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:54,091
Pegah, wait a minute!
Maybe you are not completely wrong.

199
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,487
Maybe you are right
But please,

200
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,848
Don't go now and
Leave me alone with this.

201
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:05,084
Look, I know I can be such an asshole.
I know that!

202
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,490
I don't know why!
It's just a feeling that

203
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,603
If I am not like that ...

204
00:17:12,012 --> 00:17:14,606
The only guys who help you now
Are different from the rest,

205
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:17,292
Not like the others.
Guys who still feel something.

206
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,210
And that's why they don't get along
In this fucking world!

207
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,802
But you don't fucking care!

208
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,330
You know you need them
But you cannot accept the way the are.

209
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,766
Sometimes I think,
If we should ever win this war

210
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:34,008
All stays the same - just like before

211
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:37,006
Only you are the boss then.

212
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,525
Just fuck off.

213
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,524
Ten.

214
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,445
Twenty.

215
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,085
Thirty.

216
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,765
Forty. Fifty.

217
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,160
Second door to the left, in the yard,
You can pick him up there.

218
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:31,568
Ok.

219
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:44,964
Yes? - This is Harry.
Karl-Heinz, is this you?

220
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:48,767
Ja. - Bernd is out!
- What? Since when?

221
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:52,726
This morning. Let's meet later. -
Ok, I am coming.

222
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:06,204
l don't believe this!
Hey, this is impossible!

223
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,089
Unbelievable!

224
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:12,886
Sober again, no?

225
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:16,971
It's good to have you back

226
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:18,684
Hello there, stupid.
- Just like you.

227
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:22,050
So, did you have a nice time? -
You have to tell us all!

228
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:39,641
Come on.

229
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,044
It's over.

230
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,447
l haven't got any money left.
l cannot pay you any longer.

231
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:52,967
Rainer, we have thought about this.

232
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:56,607
We go on without getting paid.

233
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,764
But we don't go into the houses any longer.
- The data,

234
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:05,044
All the date gets forwarded to IMA
Through the telephone line, right?

235
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:08,562
So we hook on right there.
No need to go into the houses.

236
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,608
Oh yes, really?
How's this going to work out then?

237
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:16,168
All houses have a general connection

238
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,762
That's where we connect, there is a code involved
Some new system from Switzerland

239
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:23,089
But Kalle can help us with that
And then we can make 7 or 8 a day.

240
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:24,770
Rainer, now watch this.

241
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,122
Simply some sort of rerouting

242
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:33,882
From the individual boxes
Right back to us here.

243
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:37,322
And then back there again.

244
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:41,401
Only we manipulate the files
Before we send them back.

245
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:45,963
And then the IMA gets all the
Manipulated files instead of the real ones.

246
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:50,888
And they have no chance to find out.
It's only a delay of five milliseconds.

247
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:59,127
Well, then ... Let's get going.

248
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:02,250
Yeah!
- Right!

249
00:23:02,972 --> 00:23:04,849
I'd knew it!

250
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:07,925
Bravo!

251
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:14,204
Don't get tired.
- We will make it. - You bet.

252
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,689
Ciao!
- See you later!

253
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:22,083
Hare Krishna!

254
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,690
You got petrol? - Yes.
- And, did you pay?

255
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:28,929
No. - Why not?
- The queue was too long.

256
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:31,805
Well then just wait in queue.
- There was one already.

257
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,454
Liberated households

258
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,051
Liberated households
1, 2, 3 ... and counting...

259
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:04,606
Cheers!

260
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:06,291
So ...

261
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:10,646
Dear friends!
Gentlemen.

262
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:13,650
I have to tell you this:

263
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,285
Today at 14:36
Central european time

264
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:20,245
Our computers capitulated.

265
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:22,363
Oh!
- Fucking shit!

266
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:26,971
There was a specific reason:
To work for us totally.

267
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,289
Yeah!
- Wow!

268
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:37,491
Cheers to mother.
- Why mother?

269
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,525
It's the alien!
Computers.

270
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:46,051
The bonus will be raised today.
Now it is one beer each connection.

271
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,250
Yeah!
- Beer! A beer!

272
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:51,883
Well done, old man!
- Cheers!

273
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:04,802
No more fucking around.

274
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:09,408
Your breath moves in waves
Like the ocean.

275
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:15,081
Your eyes gettign tired.

276
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,883
You close your eyes.

277
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:25,562
Imagine a green meadow.

278
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,481
There is a lake now.

279
00:26:31,972 --> 00:26:34,042
You jump into that lake ...

280
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,810
No. no.
- What do you mean, no?

281
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:41,684
l cannot swim.

282
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,922
(Bernd) Ok? - (Phillip) Stop it. No,
A little bit to the back.

283
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:16,560
Yes.

284
00:27:17,772 --> 00:27:20,332
Yeah, this is ok now.
- Ok, fine with me now.

285
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:21,646
Ok.

286
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:27,164
Wait a moment, it moved,
Go on a little, 10 degrees westward.

287
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:30,609
So this is the real time quota.
With 500 boxes we can manipulate

288
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,166
One channel only, so far.
No further than that.

289
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:35,169
Do it then!
- Thry that one! - Ok.

290
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:38,489
Which one should we use?
- Which one's got the highest quota?

291
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:42,281
Here, this is TTS. - And what's on there?
- ''My new dream body''.

292
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,290
Oh my god, isn't that that shit,
With the beauty operations?

293
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:48,961
Fuck. Fat drainage ...
Disgusting!

294
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,923
Alright, let's do it on TTS, ok?

295
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:55,125
Do you mind, Rainer?
- Absolutely not.

296
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:57,725
Ok.

297
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:00,804
One Moment.

298
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,084
Nothing happening.

299
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:17,205
Now.
- Doesn't move. - It is.

300
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,482
It moved
- No, no, no.

301
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:21,284
Of course, see!

302
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:23,687
There! You see!
It's moving!

303
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:41,445
But we need another 1.000 boxes.
We need another 1.000.

304
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:43,403
No problem, Phillip.
- Not a big deal!

305
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:47,525
But that's the minimum, 1.000.
- You are a genius, Phillip.

306
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,610
Fucking great!

307
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,811
See you later, boys!

308
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,330
Look at this!
There is the seaside!

309
00:29:02,772 --> 00:29:04,000
Hold it! Hold it!

310
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,965
Gentlemen, five boxes
That adds up to five bottle of beer

311
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:11,722
l'll do another one.
- One for me. - One more beer.

312
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,650
l am going down! l am going down!

313
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:13,646
Mr Gruendgens, do you want to comment
On the TTS quota crisis?

314
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:17,685
Crisis? What crisis? - The latest
Figures have been really bad!

315
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:20,007
We are stll leading the market.

316
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:23,326
Not like your fucking channel.

317
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,284
Bitch.

318
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:33,210
Maiwald, I want to see you
In my office within 20 minutes.

319
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:36,052
I don't give a shit.
Within 20 minutes.

320
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:44,806
Look, Maiwald. I don't care
How you move up the quota,

321
00:30:44,932 --> 00:30:48,083
Just do it.

322
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:53,928
The customers want better content.

323
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,647
Thank you, thanks a lot.

324
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:02,086
Ok.
- You are ok? - Yes.

325
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:05,887
Look, this is always the same:
We once had a soap on air.

326
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:08,810
A typical soap: fucking bad actors,
Story totally predictable

327
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:12,481
Cheapest of the cheap.
The quota was terrible.

328
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:15,445
People said: What a stupid, fucking shit?'

329
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:19,087
But we went on with the show.
Day in, day out. No mery at all.

330
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:23,364
For six months. After three months
The quota started to get better.

331
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:28,122
After five months even better. And
After six months people loved it.

332
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:31,642
But why's that?
- They simply got used to it.

333
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:35,970
Understand? Adaption.
Adaption is the biggest power on earth.

334
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:39,050
You show them this shit for so long
Until they don't want to see anything else.

335
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:42,209
And now we simply turn this around:
We show them good things for so long,

336
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,130
Until they are adapted to it.
- And you believe this could work?

337
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:49,325
Sure! Look out, I have been working
On something, sort of a concept.

338
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,846
Shit.

339
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:02,568
(Phillip) Look ... Pegah, I've got a
Documentation here about ancient Egypt.

340
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:08,051
You like this?
- Guess this will be good for 7,03 percent.

341
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:09,764
Yeah. Cool.

342
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,482
Another thing, somehow ...

343
00:32:15,012 --> 00:32:17,845
Ouch, 0,0 percent for
''Germany is looking for the superstar''.

344
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:20,566
Yeah ...
Kill them all!

345
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:23,490
''Angst essen Seele auf' (Fear Eats the Soul)
What's that then?

346
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:26,649
Early film by Fassbinder.
Thumbs up! Thumbs up, Phillip!

347
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:30,048
That's a teaching profession?
- No, a great director, trust me.

348
00:32:30,172 --> 00:32:32,640
Fassbeer?
- No, Fassbinder. The director.

349
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:34,251
Hmm, Beer!

350
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:38,206
Gopal, you are the greatest!

351
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:41,808
Men hunters in lndia!
- Men hunters in lndia, Phillip!

352
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:45,720
Men hunters in lndia!
- lndia, that's downhill Himalaja.

353
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:47,729
Yeah.
Yeah, ok. Good.

354
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:51,401
Look at this: Euro sport, they show
''American Choppers''. - What's that?

355
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:56,652
Customizing cars, real big cars.
Something for people into cars, bikes and stuff.

356
00:32:56,772 --> 00:33:02,244
Here ... this is Kl.KA! (children channel)
That's ... ''Wicki and the strong guys''!

357
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:09,448
Hey, Wicki! Hey, Wicki!
Tie it up! Tie it up!!

358
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:13,801
What's the name of the captain again?
- Halva! - Halva's his name!

359
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:45,846
TV has changed a lot lately,

360
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:48,645
Some of my friends don't even
Switch it on any longer

361
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:51,206
Others changes their appointments
All the time because some

362
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:55,769
Terrible exciting documentation
Is on cable one. So I guess it's time

363
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:58,565
To ask you guys!
This is Mrs. Hagen.

364
00:33:58,692 --> 00:34:02,367
Mrs. Hagen, do you like the new
TV programs? - Yes, it's simply awesome.

365
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:06,485
l think it is very interesting. They
Should go on with this.

366
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:10,241
I think it's fucking load of shit.
Hardly watch anything.

367
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,522
Me too. Yesterday I switched it on
And guess what?

368
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:15,803
Only stupid black and white movies.

369
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,884
I think the changes in TV programs
Is an excellent opportunity.

370
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:27,967
Earlier on we took it all as truth

371
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:31,562
And then we found out that
It is only garbage.

372
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:35,162
And nowadays the stuff we watch,

373
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:38,329
Is all about our own reality.

374
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,841
Many people like the changes
In TV programs.

375
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:44,089
This is a great thing: People
Are starting to think again.

376
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:48,245
Damn it, why the fuck I haven't got
At least 20 new scripts

377
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:50,681
Waiting for me on my desk?

378
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:56,448
All I got are some fucking musicals.

379
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:59,206
''Medley, a musical show''.

380
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:03,562
Are you mad? Thinking a musical
Has something to do with culture.

381
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:06,252
Didn't you say, we should take it easy?

382
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:09,170
But not for the whole of three days, asshole!

383
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,769
Out there, people are going crazy.
God knows why.

384
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:17,086
Did anybody, anyone of you
Think about our current status,

385
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:19,407
Our performance?

386
00:35:19,692 --> 00:35:23,321
Sure the quota went down lately,
But what exactly are we supposed to do?

387
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:28,367
Something intelligent,
Something clever damn it!

388
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:33,885
You went to university, didn't you!
Morons! You heard it!

389
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:38,847
Buddhismus, Friedrich Nietzsche
Comparative studies, what the fuck?

390
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:50,050
Just gimme somebody who hasn't
Been drugged since ten years.

391
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:54,603
That's why I want to say,
We should be very determined

392
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:59,487
This so called "Intellectual Awakening"

393
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:03,002
Is only weaking our already
Slow growth of economy.

394
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:06,522
Of course it is a positive trend,
Our children will be comparatively

395
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:11,043
Better in school.
But what is the price for this!

396
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,282
Consumer electronics
The computer game industry,

397
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:17,768
A foremost growing sector

398
00:36:17,892 --> 00:36:21,202
Now fell back of over a third
In overall turnaround

399
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:26,046
What, I am asking myself,

400
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:30,451
What else is going to happen,
Until we wake up?

401
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,002
Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.

402
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,410
Mrs Moll is here.

403
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,483
Let her in.

404
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:57,281
Anna! How are you doing?

405
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:01,971
You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

406
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:04,765
It's a real pity that we don't have
The time to meet more often.

407
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,645
Come on. Let's sit down.

408
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:12,970
Now tell me, how's everything?

409
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:17,722
Great! Our new format about literature,
simply great. - Sorry? Which one?

410
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:21,970
''Hit and Read''. We have VIPs
Throw darts at book covers.

411
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:25,801
And whatever they catch, that's
Going to be read. Great idea.

412
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:30,523
Sounds brilliant! You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

413
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:33,120
And what's Rainer doing?

414
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:35,881
Have you heard anything?

415
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:39,169
No, quite a while since the last time.
Why are you asking?

416
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:43,321
Oh, nothing specific.
Well, he was a .. was a friend, right?

417
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:48,403
He was very much into this whole
Quota thing before he dissapeared.

418
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,443
Do you know anything?

419
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:02,402
I call you because you ...
You have that system,

420
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,762
To locate mobile phones.

421
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:20,006
Cheers!
To Pegah, guys!

422
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:30,286
Hey.

423
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:42,049
Ok.

424
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:47,007
Slowly. Ok, ok, ok. You go first.
Carefull, there's a small step coming.

425
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:48,929
Two ...

426
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:54,048
And ... Three.

427
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:56,083
Yeah!

428
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:42,809
We are in Berlin now,
Warsaw bridge, let's see,

429
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:45,207
What this naughty one has to say
About our new television.

430
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:48,722
I noticed this: Yesterday I saw this
lnterview, well sort of a discussion

431
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:53,607
Running much longer than usual.
Well, I liked it.

432
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:43,928
Can you give me a real good applause?
Please!

433
00:40:49,172 --> 00:40:50,571
That's it then.

434
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:04,771
Televison has the tendency
To replicate reality now,

435
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:06,644
To be a picture of reality.

436
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:11,721
This is the original use of media:
Mediate and moderate.

437
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:15,242
Thus we are set free.
We can breathe

438
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,522
And live our lives.

439
00:41:23,172 --> 00:41:26,642
A few months ago I watched TV
At this time of the day

440
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:31,004
And today I am going out for
A walk along the river.

441
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:35,325
Fuck the quota!
Fuck the quota!

442
00:42:49,572 --> 00:42:51,005
Hello?

443
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:12,330
Hello!

444
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:11,250
Yes?

445
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:22,810
l take care about this

446
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,169
Rainer!

447
00:44:26,612 --> 00:44:29,331
Long time no see!
You look good.

448
00:44:29,452 --> 00:44:31,920
Five years younger.
No anger?

449
00:44:33,612 --> 00:44:35,091
What do you want?

450
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:40,048
Let me say one thing: Respect
Rainer. Great system!

451
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:45,604
Really, what you have done here,
I wouldn't have thought you are able to.

452
00:44:45,972 --> 00:44:50,443
I have to warn you, don't mix with this.
- Cool down, Rainer, cool down.

453
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:53,450
One call and all of you
Go to prison. Understand?

454
00:44:56,332 --> 00:44:59,847
Oh my god, Rainer!
Was it worth all this?

455
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:02,963
Well, I ...

456
00:45:03,692 --> 00:45:08,891
I mean was it really worth
Throwing away a career.

457
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:12,084
What for? Only to proof that TV is dumb?

458
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,123
Something really new.

459
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:20,202
Look, twenty years ago:
People got upset

460
00:45:20,332 --> 00:45:23,722
About the dying forests.
They went on street for peace in Vietnam.

461
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:27,640
These days it is all about
Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton.

462
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:32,323
And you know what?
They don't miss anything.

463
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,206
You started a ...

464
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:42,010
... Trend. - Yes, so what?

465
00:45:42,412 --> 00:45:45,609
People chatted a little about books
Like they did about TV before.

466
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:49,441
But do you honestly believe
This changes anything?

467
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:59,171
Maiwald.
- Who is Maiwald?

468
00:45:59,772 --> 00:46:02,730
That's his car, isn't it?
I burn it down!

469
00:46:02,852 --> 00:46:05,412
Harry, stop it! Calm down ...

470
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:09,125
The old food chain, Rainer.

471
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:12,608
The whole shit about the 60ies,
Almost ruined us.

472
00:46:12,732 --> 00:46:15,371
There can only be one on top of the stairs.

473
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:19,167
The rest has to be kept busy.
And that's not so simple.

474
00:46:19,932 --> 00:46:23,049
Television gave us stability.
The best system we ever had so far.

475
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:26,528
People stay at home
And don't get into any stupid ideas.

476
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:31,363
We don't fuck up the world, Rainer.
We are the good boys, we do good things.

477
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:35,120
You fucking fascist.

478
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:37,969
This is stupid.

479
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:42,011
Bollocks, Rainer.
Plain bollocks.

480
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:47,641
There is no difference left among
The state and the media

481
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:51,082
Religion, politics, science
Economy, all one big machine

482
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:55,651
For the sake of humanity.

483
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:59,322
People have work and all what is left
Is here in this box.

484
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:02,970
You better get out of here
Or I I forget myself!

485
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:10,688
Do you really believe,
I'll let you ruin my career?

486
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:19,127
This is the deal: You go on
With whatever you want to do here,

487
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:24,451
Only the TTS-quota gets up by 10 percent
Within the next twenty days.

488
00:47:25,372 --> 00:47:27,567
And I will finance all of this.

489
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:30,809
100.000 Euro for each percent.

490
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:36,010
You start right now or I report you
Right away. You choose.

491
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:44,849
Oh, by the way!

492
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:48,247
Greeting from Anna.

493
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,488
She is doing very well.

494
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,728
Good morning!

495
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:12,366
I vote for going on.
Let's give him his fucking quota.

496
00:48:13,692 --> 00:48:16,570
I don't trust him.
There's something fishy.

497
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:19,884
He will report us as soon as
He's the boss over there.

498
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:23,800
True. We should not give in to this asshole.

499
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:28,483
I don't think so.
If we would do this now,

500
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:32,002
He is in it just the same.
We can proof it all.

501
00:48:32,132 --> 00:48:35,408
Hey guys, quality and trash-TV

502
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:39,445
How is this going together?
We are betraying our own ideas.

503
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:43,486
But we need the cash.
One million, guys, one million!

504
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,729
New cars! Computers!

505
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:51,569
Money is the end of any revolution.
Same story always.

506
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,081
Good morning, Lore.
- Morning, Boss.

507
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:47,000
How was the weekend?
- Well ... Good! And you?

508
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:50,522
Wonderful, really wonderful!
My boat has got a new engine,

509
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,724
And now its fast as hell.
Really brilliant.

510
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:56,243
So these are the weekend's quotas?

511
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:01,091
So bad?

512
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:13,771
Please connect me to the
Minister of the interior. - Yes.

513
00:50:14,092 --> 00:50:16,481
Oh, and Mr Gruendgens
Wants to talk to you.

514
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:19,844
I was expecting that.

515
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:23,768
Tell our chairman, I will meet him
At half past nine.

516
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:28,124
Please don't disturb me until then.
Close the door! - Yes.

517
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:35,525
Maiwald, I am sorry,
You know how things work.

518
00:50:35,892 --> 00:50:40,647
The quota is a sheer catastrophe
Since months.

519
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:45,289
Things are not what they look like.

520
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:48,645
Rainer Kaethner,
You remember the name?

521
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:53,800
He ... is leading a group of saboteurs.
They manipulate the quota.

522
00:50:57,292 --> 00:51:00,489
Sorry! - I don't know, how they do it.
Whatever.

523
00:51:00,612 --> 00:51:02,409
Maiwald!

524
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:12,682
Brace yourself.
We are not in one of your shows.

525
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:15,886
Take it as a man.

526
00:51:16,332 --> 00:51:19,529
You haven't made the change
And it is on me now

527
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:23,088
To make a decision.

528
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,090
And I will not sacrifice myself.

529
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:27,964
You know how things are.

530
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:31,402
Maiwald.

531
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:35,760
The compensation will allow
You a proper new start.

532
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:41,084
Didn't you have that boat?
What was the name?

533
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:42,486
''Lissy''?

534
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:46,651
Go and have a nice holiday trip
You look like you need it.

535
00:51:49,212 --> 00:51:50,565
''Lucy''.
- Maiwald!

536
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,889
The boat is called ''Lucy'',
Fucking asshole!

537
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:58,205
I will tell them all
And you can go cleaning the toilets then.

538
00:51:59,212 --> 00:52:01,407
Corrupt pig.

539
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,411
Fucking asshole.

540
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:01,761
Go.

541
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:11,289
Morning!
Coffee anybody?

542
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,086
Double or two single ones?

543
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:21,324
It's all empty upstairs.

544
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:24,451
All empty.

545
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:27,483
What do you mean, ''All empty''?

546
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:12,291
We have to be out of here in two days
My uncle is coming back.

547
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:19,682
I can take two guys to stay in my bus.

548
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:27,243
Not important. Point is, we have to get
The system back running again.

549
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:30,125
Phillip, we have to work on the system.
Get it back working.

550
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:34,245
They discovered this long ago. -
We cannot stop now.

551
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,966
We haven't done it long enough.
- They find out within three minutes.

552
00:54:37,092 --> 00:54:41,244
And that's it then. All over.

553
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,123
At least we tried.

554
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:27,967
And what did we try to achieve?

555
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,042
Totally useless action.

556
00:55:34,612 --> 00:55:39,242
Like warming up a whole winter city
With one single radiant heater.

557
00:55:39,692 --> 00:55:44,163
Totally fucked up.

558
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:05,325
What have you got there?

559
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:10,768
Todays?
- Yes.

560
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:18,204
Phillip, look at this. - What is it?
- This is from today.

561
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:24,411
Here.

562
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:31,364
Impossible.
Todays? - Yes.

563
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:36,323
Holy shit!
- This can't be true!

564
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:40,405
18,7 percent! - That's the shit,
You wanted to see!

565
00:56:40,532 --> 00:56:43,205
Yes, that's it!
You can watch it by yourself!

566
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:46,244
What's going on? - People still
Watch the quality stuff,

567
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:48,840
Despite we stopped manipulating
The quota a week ago.

568
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:51,284
Oh really!

569
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,250
Damn it, we did it!
Shit, man, I knew this,

570
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,886
People aren't that stupid!
I knew it!

571
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:01,286
Look at this, old man!

572
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:05,963
Rainer, what are you saying?
We should go on, right? - Yes.

573
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:07,725
Hassloch.

574
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,411
Hassloch!

575
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:17,401
Hassloch?

576
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:21,605
A small village in the south
With a typical average and

577
00:57:21,732 --> 00:57:26,169
Representative profile.
People buy all things with a chip card.

578
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:31,366
All things going to be sold in Germany
Will be tested in Hassloch first. Get the idea?

579
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:35,690
Here it will be decided what is
Going to be produced and sold in the future.

580
00:57:50,852 --> 00:57:52,843
Harry, how much is this?

581
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:56,326
1,39 Euro, Gopal.
- Thanks.

582
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:01,131
4,95, please.
Thanks.

583
00:58:05,332 --> 00:58:10,565
That's 7,80 all together. And the bottle
Is on the house. I am the house.

584
00:58:10,692 --> 00:58:13,365
35,95, please.
- I only got 20.

585
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:16,802
Whatever. Take it.
But I need your chip card before you go.
