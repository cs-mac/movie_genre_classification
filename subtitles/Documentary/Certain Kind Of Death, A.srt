1
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:24,166
Are we the first?

2
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:29,206
Are we the first to arrive here?

3
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,606
Is the interpreter with you?

4
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:16,526
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.

5
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,446
I'm a mapmaker.

6
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:21,446
Can you translate French into English
and English into French?

7
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:24,646
Yes, I explained to the team leader in
Villa Hermosa.

8
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,006
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

9
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,286
-Êtes-vous MonsieurLoglin?
-Laughlin, oui.

10
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:31,846
Oh, Laughlin. Pardon.

11
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,606
They're all there! All of them!

12
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,606
Check for landing marks!

13
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:35,046
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks!

14
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,006
M-447148!

15
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:45,366
W-445529!

16
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:48,886
Number 445529, check!

17
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:53,446
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank!

18
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,406
447149, check!

19
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,846
Tell me something.
What's happening here?

20
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,366
-It's flight number 19!
-19 what?

21
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:04,166
It's that training mission from the
naval air station at Fort Lauderdale.

22
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:07,406
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

23
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,846
Who flies crates like these anymore?

24
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:14,646
No one! These planes were reported
missing in 1945.

25
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,126
But it looks brand-new!

26
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,086
Where's the pilot?

27
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:30,006
I don't understand!

28
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,766
Where's the crew?!

29
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:39,366
How the hell did it get here?!

30
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,126
He says this guy's local.

31
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,846
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

32
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,206
Sunburn?

33
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:56,486
He says the sun came out last night.

34
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,086
He says it sang to him.

35
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,006
Ernie, keep an eye on that point-out.

36
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:39,166
He's on 1 22.5.

37
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,806
I'll be right back.

38
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:45,886
Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?

39
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,886
Air East 31, negative.

40
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:53,846
The only traffic I have is
a TWA L-1011 in your 6:00 position...

41
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,286
...range 15 miles...

42
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,286
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in your 12:00
position, 50 miles.

43
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:03,286
Stand by. I'll take a look at
broadband, over.

44
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:07,046
Air East 31 has traffic 2:00,
slightly above and descending.

45
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:09,166
Air East 31, roger.

46
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,326
I have a primary target
about that position now.

47
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,126
I have no known traffic.

48
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,326
Stand by, I'll check low, over.

49
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,206
Check and see if they know who it is.

50
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:20,766
Center, Air East 31.

51
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,806
The traffic's not lower than us.

52
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:26,366
He's 1:00 now,
still above me and descending.

53
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,726
Air East 31,
can you say aircraft type?

54
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:34,086
Negative, Center, no distinct outline.

55
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:38,086
To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.

56
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:42,086
It has the brightest anti-collision
lights I think I've ever seen.

57
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:44,326
Alternating white to red.

58
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,326
The colors are striking.

59
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,606
Center, this is TWA 517.

60
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,966
Traffic now looks like
extra-bright landing lights.

61
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,166
I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.

62
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:58,806
It could be a satellite.

63
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,726
I have a primary target now
in your 10:00 position...

64
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,166
...five miles, over.

65
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,806
Affirmative, 31.

66
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:08,766
The traffic is proceeding northeast.
No altitude readout.

67
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,766
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he'll be a problem.

68
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:15,206
He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.

69
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:16,926
Wait a second!

70
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,366
Stand by, one.

71
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,766
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.

72
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:25,286
He's heading formy windshield.
We're turning immediately.

73
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,126
Descend and maintain flight level 310.

74
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,166
Break Allegheny,
turn right 30 degrees.

75
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:35,806
Get on the horn to the 45th Recon Wing
and see what they're testing up there.

76
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:39,766
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

77
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,606
Air East 31, roger.

78
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:45,726
The traffic is luminous and
exhibiting non-ballistic motion.

79
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,526
Roger. Continue descent
at your discretion.

80
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,486
Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.

81
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:54,726
The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.

82
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:58,286
And right by us! Right now!
Now that was really close.

83
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:01,166
Air East 31 is out of 340....

84
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,566
Ask if they want to report officially.

85
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:07,566
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

86
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:15,366
TWA 517, do you want to report a UFO?
Over.

87
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,446
Negative. We don't want to report.

88
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,686
Air East 31,
do you wish to report a UFO? Over.

89
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,966
Negative. We don't want
to report one either.

90
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:32,046
Air East 31, do you wish to file a
report of any kind? Over.

91
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,646
I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.

92
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,766
Air East 31, me neither.

93
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:40,206
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

94
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,926
Barry?

95
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:33,766
Honey?

96
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:50,406
Barry!

97
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:12,526
Dad, do my problems for me.

98
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,886
I don't have to do your problems for
you. You do your problems for you.

99
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:21,566
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

100
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:24,486
I don't understand these fractions.

101
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:27,806
All right. What's one-third of 60?

102
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:30,486
That's a fraction.
I don't understand it.

103
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,006
All right, look.

104
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,766
Let's say...

105
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:38,206
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.

106
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,406
And one-third is across
this switch here.

107
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,726
And now another train is coming.

108
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:54,206
How far do you have to move
this boxcar off the track...

109
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:56,806
...so that the other train
doesn't smash it?

110
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,566
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

111
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,086
Brad, any answer.

112
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,406
Remember last weekend...

113
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:10,206
...you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

114
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:13,446
Honey?

115
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,926
And you also promised Goofy Golf.

116
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:27,886
Roy, what is all this stuff
on my table?

117
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,686
I thought I told you
this was for my stuff.

118
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,766
I mean, you can have that table.

119
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,446
I don't want this on my table.

120
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:36,686
This can cause tetanus!

121
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,406
-What is this?!
-You know what's playing?

122
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:42,406
Pinocchio!
The kids have never seen Pinocchio.

123
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,126
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.

124
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:46,526
I don't believe this.

125
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:51,166
Who wants to go see
some dumb cartoon rated G for kids?

126
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:53,166
-How old are you?
-Eight.

127
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:55,046
-You want to be 9?
-Yeah.

128
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,766
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

129
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:01,006
That's a wonderful way
to win over your children.

130
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,126
I'm not serious. I'm just saying
that I grew up with Pinocchio.

131
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,126
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

132
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:13,006
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

133
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,846
Toby! You are close to death!
Come out here!

134
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:26,286
I'll give you your choice.
I'm not gonna be biased in any way.

135
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:30,406
You can either play Goofy Golf, which
means a lot of waiting and pushing...

136
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,926
...or you can see Pinocchio...

137
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,646
...which is a lot of furry animals and
magic and a wonderful time.

138
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,046
-Now, let's vote.
-Golf!

139
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:40,806
All right, everybody to bed!

140
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:44,966
No way! Dad said we could finish
watching The Ten Commandments!

141
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:48,406
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

142
00:16:48,606 --> 00:16:51,006
I told them
they'd watch only five commandments.

143
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:52,606
Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.

144
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:55,886
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.

145
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:58,046
Roy can't drive at night without me.

146
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:00,326
We're experiencing an overall outage!

147
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:03,406
Wait, I can't-- Honey!

148
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:07,486
Jiminy Cricket.
It's Earl on the phone.

149
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:16,366
Neary. Get into your truck
and report to line N in Tolono.

150
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:20,366
We're losing power across the grid.
Has the outage hit you yet?

151
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,406
Hey! Lights!

152
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,806
Barry!

153
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,206
Help! I'm lost.

154
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,486
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

155
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,966
Cough up Tolono
on Interstate Highway 90.

156
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,566
A little familiar landmark
of some sort.

157
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:38,566
-Cornbread Road, south of 20.
-Cornbread?

158
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,606
Power must have been restored.

159
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:43,846
Couple hundred neighbors think
it's Saturday night.

160
00:18:44,046 --> 00:18:45,126
Dispatch, this is 411.

161
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:48,046
Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?

162
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,286
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass!

163
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,806
Can you tell me where Cornbread is?
Turkey!

164
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:26,926
834...834.... F-27.

165
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:31,206
M-Mary-10 through M-Mary-12. Okay.

166
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,686
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

167
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,846
M-Mary-10.

168
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,086
Oh, shit!

169
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:41,766
What do you guys got out there?

170
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,206
I don't believe this!

171
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:46,886
My God! It's as big as a house!

172
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,086
Shaped like a barn.

173
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,886
This is absolutely crazy.

174
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:01,606
Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.

175
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:09,446
No!

176
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:11,006
Watch out!

177
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,206
Oh, my God! Lady!

178
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:20,846
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

179
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,446
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.

180
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,446
Hello! Here!

181
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:29,966
What's the matter with you?

182
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:32,806
Barry, come back here!

183
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,166
Ice cream!

184
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:26,086
This is nuts.

185
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,126
Wait a minute!

186
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:12,206
What are you guys doing? Hey!

187
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:15,006
That's Ohio!
That's a quarter!

188
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:23,526
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road!

189
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,886
Honey, wake up!

190
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:14,566
Ronnie, wake up!
You're not gonna believe what I saw!

191
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,326
Don't! Not now.

192
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:19,206
No, listen!
I never would have believed it!

193
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,766
There was this--
In the cab there was this whole--

194
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:24,526
It went-- It was-- There was a red
whoosh that--

195
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:27,566
Roy.

196
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:28,886
Ike called you.

197
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,326
And McGovern.

198
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:33,966
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.

199
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:35,686
I turned the radio off.

200
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:38,046
Don't do that. The phone rang
off the hook.

201
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:41,726
It woke Sylvia up two times already.
You'd better call them.

202
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,006
You know those pictures in National
Geographic, the aurora borealis?

203
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,726
This is better than that. Come on!

204
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,806
Come on, Ronnie, get up.

205
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:52,126
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. I don't know.

206
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:54,606
-Get up!
-Is it an accident?

207
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,606
It's not an accident.
You wanted out of the house, right?

208
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,326
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

209
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:02,886
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

210
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:04,806
It's really important.

211
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:07,526
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?

212
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,406
The kids! I'll get the kids.

213
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,566
Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.

214
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,406
Toby! Brad! Come on! Get up.

215
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:16,286
It's better than Goofy Golf!

216
00:28:20,486 --> 00:28:22,766
I'm going as fast as I can!

217
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:24,806
Come on.

218
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,766
Hi, Mrs. Harris.

219
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:31,566
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

220
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,566
There better be a good reason
for this...

221
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,166
...because it doesn't make sense!

222
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:40,246
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

223
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,726
You're sunburned. Look at you.

224
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:53,326
Honey, what is that?

225
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,006
Roy, what did it look like?

226
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,126
It was like an ice-cream cone.

227
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:06,326
What flavor?

228
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:07,766
Orange.

229
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,046
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

230
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,446
It was more like a shell.

231
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:15,046
Like a taco?

232
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:19,766
Was it like one of those Sara Lee
moon-shaped cookies?

233
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,406
Those crescent cookies?

234
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:33,126
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

235
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:40,326
I remember coming to places like
this just to look at each other.

236
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,086
Snuggle.

237
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:09,446
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!

238
00:32:10,206 --> 00:32:11,566
I don't believe it.

239
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:12,726
It's the Cotopaxi.

240
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:15,886
-Why is it here?
-Beats the shit out of me.

241
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,046
Is this the bathroom?

242
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,566
This is not your toy to play with
every time I turn around.

243
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:13,526
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.

244
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:17,206
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

245
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:19,686
I'm sorry, but you're
not to play with this!

246
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,446
Get out while I clean up your mess!

247
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,526
Thank you very much.

248
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,486
I found this overnight tanning stuff.

249
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:48,486
I want you to spray it on half
your face, so it's all one color.

250
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:51,566
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?

251
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,446
Then we'll tell everybody
you fell asleep...

252
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,486
...under the sun lamp
on your right side.

253
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:57,966
What for?

254
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,806
Dad, can I ask you a question?

255
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,446
Are they for real?

256
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:05,126
That's what for.

257
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:06,606
No, they are not for real.

258
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:09,046
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?

259
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:10,806
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

260
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:14,566
Don't talk about this until you know
what you're talking about.

261
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:18,646
lf I can't talk about it,
how will I know what's going on?

262
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:19,926
What?

263
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,646
Mom, I believe in them.

264
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,526
I believe in them too.

265
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:25,046
No, you don't.

266
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:26,886
Dad says we do.

267
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:28,806
No, he does not.

268
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:30,806
Do you, Roy?

269
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:35,366
All I want to do is know
what's going on.

270
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,566
Nothing's going on!
It's just one of those things.

271
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:40,486
Which things? Which things?

272
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:43,726
-I don't want to hear about this.
-This is very important!

273
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,726
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody!

274
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:48,966
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

275
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,766
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

276
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:56,246
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

277
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,366
I'm going out there again tonight.

278
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:03,686
No, you're not.

279
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:05,606
Yes, I am.

280
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,286
No, you're not.

281
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:08,726
Yes, I am.

282
00:35:11,206 --> 00:35:12,446
No, you're not.

283
00:35:12,646 --> 00:35:13,966
Do they live on the moon?

284
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:18,246
They got bases there so at night
they can come through your window.

285
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:21,446
This isn't a moon burn, goddamn it!

286
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:24,486
-You came through my window last.
-You hurt me!

287
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:27,206
-You took all my covers.
-Roy's not like that.

288
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:29,846
He loves his work. Don't say that!

289
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,406
What did he do?
He was with us all night!

290
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,086
I won't have to go tonight.

291
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:36,886
He is not like that at all!

292
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:39,366
Stop yelling at me!

293
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,766
Can't you tell him about this?

294
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:43,206
Hello?

295
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:45,166
I can't believe it.

296
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:46,646
Roy...

297
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,566
...you got fired.

298
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:51,446
They didn't even want to talk to you.

299
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:05,006
Where were the sounds coming from?

300
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:33,606
Where did these sounds come from?
Tell us, please.

301
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,926
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:09,926
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

303
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,166
I want to share with you now...

304
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:17,606
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

305
00:38:17,966 --> 00:38:20,846
We think it means something.

306
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,646
We think it is important.

307
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:29,966
To help you learn, I am using the hand
sign created by Zoltán Kodály.

308
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:36,086
Kodály developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

309
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:59,206
Hello?

310
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,006
Hi.

311
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,486
Hi, how are you? You came here too?

312
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,166
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

313
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:07,526
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.

314
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:10,646
-Good night!
-What?

315
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,406
Look at you.

316
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,366
You got the same burn.

317
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:23,246
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

318
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,846
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

319
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:28,486
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

320
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,086
I'll be right back.

321
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:32,486
Raise your head a bit
and give me a smile.

322
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:36,366
He's a little young for a record,
don't you think?

323
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:56,646
Weird.

324
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:02,806
I know this sounds crazy, but
ever since yesterday on the road...

325
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:05,446
...I've been seeing this shape.

326
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:10,566
In shaving cream and pillows....

327
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,686
Damn it, I know this!
I know what this is.

328
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:33,326
This means something.

329
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,286
This is important.

330
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:43,446
Here they come!

331
00:41:43,646 --> 00:41:44,846
Get the camera!

332
00:41:45,046 --> 00:41:46,806
Out of the northwest!

333
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:04,406
It's like Halloween for grownups.

334
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:07,446
Trick or treat.

335
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,406
Wait a minute!

336
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,406
The patterns are:

337
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:33,966
-We received two 15-minute broadcasts.
-Non-random signals?

338
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:37,766
1 04 rapid pulses. After a five-second
interval, 40 pulses.

339
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:40,326
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

340
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:42,726
60 seconds of silence,
then a new set of numbers.

341
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:46,966
40, break five.
36, break five. Ten.

342
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:49,286
-104 rapid pulses.
-Lord!

343
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:53,046
Wait 60 seconds and the
whole doggone thing repeats.

344
00:43:53,646 --> 00:43:56,326
-Where are the signals from?
-The neighborhood.

345
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:58,406
Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.

346
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:00,646
Well within the plane
of the ecliptic.

347
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:05,606
Are these non-random signals here, 40,
36, 10, in response to that?

348
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:09,286
They should be. We've sent
this combination out for weeks.

349
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,766
All we're getting back
are numbers.

350
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:20,006
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

351
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,606
They don't mean a thing.

352
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:23,726
There's so much we don't know.

353
00:44:23,926 --> 00:44:26,486
How about where the signals originate?

354
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:30,606
Excuse me.

355
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:34,766
What letter is 104?

356
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:38,406
Excuse me.

357
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:44,486
Before I got paid to speak French...

358
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:48,966
...I used to read maps.

359
00:44:51,046 --> 00:44:53,286
This first number is a longitude.

360
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:00,006
Two sets of three numbers.

361
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:03,086
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

362
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:07,366
The first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

363
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,286
It's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

364
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:14,886
These have to be Earth coordinates.

365
00:45:15,086 --> 00:45:17,006
There's a globe in the office.

366
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:21,646
This is what we need.

367
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:24,246
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

368
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:28,046
That's a $2500 globe!
What are you doing?

369
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,006
All right, everybody, quiet down!
Hold it down!

370
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:54,806
The antenna. How dumb!

371
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,686
-Which way's it pointing?
-Northeast.

372
00:45:56,886 --> 00:45:58,326
That's Wyoming.

373
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:07,246
We'll need a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

374
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,286
I want it to the square yard.

375
00:46:09,486 --> 00:46:12,726
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

376
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:01,286
Toys!

377
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:04,206
Toys!

378
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,686
Oh, my God!

379
00:49:47,246 --> 00:49:49,526
You can come and play now.

380
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:51,526
You can come and play now.

381
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:59,086
Come in through the door.

382
00:50:00,886 --> 00:50:04,086
One...two...three....

383
00:50:14,006 --> 00:50:16,046
Mom, look! The sun's here!

384
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,526
Oh, my God!

385
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,486
Go away!

386
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:26,086
Clean everything up!

387
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:43,686
-Mom, let me listen!
-Wait a minute!

388
00:52:00,646 --> 00:52:02,086
Mom, look!

389
00:52:10,446 --> 00:52:12,726
Come in through the door.

390
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:35,526
Barry!

391
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:52,726
May we have a statement?

392
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,686
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

393
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:57,926
We need it for the 6:00 news.

394
00:53:00,526 --> 00:53:01,766
They got him.

395
00:53:01,966 --> 00:53:02,886
What?

396
00:53:03,086 --> 00:53:05,606
Is it true you're leaving
to look for your son?

397
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:08,886
-Has there been a ransom note?
-Where will you start looking?

398
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:13,206
His name is Barry.

399
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:16,046
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

400
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,886
Are you involved in any
kind of parapsychologies?

401
00:53:21,846 --> 00:53:23,846
Turn around, please. Turn around!

402
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:29,046
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?

403
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:35,886
Folks, you can go in now. Room 3655.

404
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:39,526
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

405
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:40,806
That's the one I saw!

406
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:46,726
I swear that's the same one!
It's the one I saw!

407
00:53:48,046 --> 00:53:50,446
It's made of pewter, made in Japan...

408
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:53,646
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

409
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:59,406
I wanted to point out that we're
not all "polished brass" about this.

410
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:02,446
And also point out that last year...

411
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:05,566
...Americans shot more than seven
billion photographs...

412
00:54:05,766 --> 00:54:10,566
...at a record of $6.6 billion
for film equipment and processing.

413
00:54:10,766 --> 00:54:12,526
Now, with all those
shutters clicking...

414
00:54:12,726 --> 00:54:15,406
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

415
00:54:15,606 --> 00:54:18,886
I've been in the news
business for a long time.

416
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:22,806
We never took a picture
of a plane crash as it happened...

417
00:54:23,086 --> 00:54:26,486
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

418
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:37,606
There are lots of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

419
00:54:37,926 --> 00:54:39,526
Mental telepathy...

420
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:41,166
...time travel...

421
00:54:41,606 --> 00:54:43,126
...immortality...

422
00:54:43,726 --> 00:54:45,606
...even Santa Claus.

423
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:50,126
I know it's no fun to go home and
say, "Guess what happened today?

424
00:54:50,406 --> 00:54:53,926
I was in the shopping center,
and there was this bright light...

425
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:56,246
...and I rushed outside...

426
00:54:56,486 --> 00:54:58,406
...and it was an airplane."

427
00:54:58,646 --> 00:55:01,486
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.

428
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,006
I sure wish I had.

429
00:55:04,206 --> 00:55:06,086
For 15 years I've been looking...

430
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:09,166
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

431
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:10,966
I've never found any.

432
00:55:11,246 --> 00:55:13,966
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.

433
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:15,686
Why don't you admit...

434
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:19,406
...that the Air Force is conducting
tests in the Foothills area?

435
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:22,246
It would be easy to say yes to that.

436
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:26,406
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

437
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:28,886
I don't know what you saw.

438
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:31,366
You can't fool us by agreeing with us.

439
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:32,926
No, come on!

440
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:35,086
I saw Bigfoot once.

441
00:55:39,726 --> 00:55:43,726
1951. Back in Sequoia National park.

442
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:48,086
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.

443
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:55,206
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

444
00:55:59,926 --> 00:56:02,646
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

445
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:06,246
I was sitting on the porch,
looking through the screen.

446
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:08,726
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

447
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,126
It turned red and blue and green.

448
00:56:15,726 --> 00:56:20,446
UFOs do not represent a direct
physical threat to national security.

449
00:56:21,606 --> 00:56:25,006
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

450
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,206
Let's get in touch with
the forest service...

451
00:57:04,406 --> 00:57:08,006
...or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

452
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:12,006
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

453
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:20,566
lf this mission is fully developed...

454
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:26,246
...I get white knuckles thinking about
what might be ahead for those folks.

455
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,126
Your flight will be at 20:00 hours.

456
00:57:29,326 --> 00:57:32,806
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

457
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:36,726
And transportation will be provided
on the other end.

458
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:42,726
-I like the flash flood idea.
-Where will you get the water?

459
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:47,046
We'll tell them one of the reservoirs
is going to burst.

460
00:57:48,246 --> 00:57:49,766
There's not enough water in those
reservoirs!

461
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,126
Wait! Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

462
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:54,486
Disease.

463
00:57:54,726 --> 00:57:57,286
-Yeah, epidemic.
-What kind of disease?

464
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:58,526
A plague epidemic.

465
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,726
Nobody will believe a plague.

466
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:03,246
-Anthrax.
-Ranching country.

467
00:58:03,406 --> 00:58:05,646
There are a lot of sheep in the hills.

468
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:07,046
Good, I like that.

469
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:10,166
-It'll create a panic.
-But it may not evacuate everybody.

470
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:13,286
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

471
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:19,206
I need something so scary it'll
clear 300 square miles...

472
00:58:19,406 --> 00:58:22,126
...of every living Christian soul.

473
00:58:52,086 --> 00:58:53,766
Help yourself.

474
00:58:56,646 --> 00:59:00,966
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

475
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:02,446
It's okay.

476
01:00:44,526 --> 01:00:46,406
Well, I guess you've noticed...

477
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:51,526
...something is a little strange
with Dad.

478
01:00:54,606 --> 01:00:56,206
It's okay, though.

479
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,006
I'm still Dad.

480
01:01:04,846 --> 01:01:08,726
I can't describe it,
what I'm feeling...

481
01:01:09,006 --> 01:01:11,206
...and what I'm thinking.

482
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,846
This means something.

483
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:19,246
This is important.

484
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:31,686
That's not right.

485
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:36,726
It's not right.

486
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:40,526
That's not right.

487
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:09,446
What is it?

488
01:02:10,886 --> 01:02:13,126
What is it?!

489
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:21,846
It's not fair.

490
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:28,646
Tell me.

491
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,886
Open the door, please.

492
01:02:59,886 --> 01:03:01,046
please.

493
01:03:04,086 --> 01:03:05,686
Open this door!

494
01:03:05,966 --> 01:03:07,766
Open this door!

495
01:03:35,086 --> 01:03:37,846
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

496
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:48,046
Look, Roy. What it is,
is family therapy.

497
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,886
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

498
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:54,886
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

499
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:57,606
It's waterproof. It still works.

500
01:03:58,326 --> 01:03:59,686
promise me you'll go!

501
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:03,046
You crybaby! You crybaby!

502
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:05,046
-You crybaby!
-Get out of here!

503
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:06,446
Get out!

504
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:08,406
Come on, you guys.

505
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:10,766
You crybaby!

506
01:04:11,046 --> 01:04:12,526
-Be quiet!
-Stop it!

507
01:04:12,726 --> 01:04:14,246
I don't understand it!

508
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:16,846
-Neither do I.
-Get out!

509
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:19,886
Go to your room and close the door.

510
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:23,766
-Ronnie?
-Yes.

511
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:28,006
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.

512
01:04:28,366 --> 01:04:31,206
All this bullshit!
It's turning this house upside down!

513
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:33,686
I just hate you! That's why!

514
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:35,086
No!

515
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:38,926
Hold me. put your arms
around me. It'll really help me.

516
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:40,326
It'll really help me.

517
01:04:40,526 --> 01:04:43,126
Listen! Listen!
Don't you see what's happening?

518
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:45,566
None of our friends call us anymore!

519
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:47,886
You're out of work! You don't care!

520
01:04:48,086 --> 01:04:50,646
You're ruining us! You're ruining us!

521
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:53,446
-Ronnie, just hold on.
-No!

522
01:04:53,646 --> 01:04:54,886
Hold on.

523
01:05:02,126 --> 01:05:05,046
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

524
01:05:38,926 --> 01:05:41,846
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.

525
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:48,646
Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.

526
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:50,606
Thank you!

527
01:05:57,446 --> 01:05:59,246
Well, I guess he's had enough.

528
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,846
Are you going to yell at me?

529
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:21,686
Everything's fine.

530
01:06:31,526 --> 01:06:33,486
All this stuff is coming down.

531
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:40,886
It's all gonna be like it was.

532
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:53,646
That's the last straw!
Now I use my secret weapon!

533
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:27,086
Roy, I'm sorry about last night.
Roy!

534
01:07:30,006 --> 01:07:32,166
Roy, what are you doing?

535
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,606
Jesus!

536
01:07:43,566 --> 01:07:44,806
The plants are fine there!

537
01:07:46,126 --> 01:07:47,366
Can you hear me?

538
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:49,046
Wait!

539
01:07:49,326 --> 01:07:51,206
Wait! What are you doing?

540
01:07:51,406 --> 01:07:52,486
You're gonna love it!

541
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:55,046
-What do you mean?
-You'll really love this.

542
01:07:55,246 --> 01:07:57,806
Roy, what are you doing?

543
01:08:03,086 --> 01:08:04,686
Oh, Roy!

544
01:08:05,646 --> 01:08:06,486
My God!

545
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,486
Come on, men!

546
01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:14,926
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

547
01:08:18,406 --> 01:08:19,686
Stop it.

548
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,566
Stop. Stop it.

549
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,086
Honey!

550
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:28,846
lf I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.

551
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:33,366
What are you doing?

552
01:08:33,646 --> 01:08:35,206
-I got it.
-What are you doing?

553
01:08:35,406 --> 01:08:38,726
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

554
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:43,726
You ever look at something crazy, and
then see it another way and it's not?

555
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:44,806
No, I haven't.

556
01:08:45,006 --> 01:08:46,966
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

557
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,446
-I don't know what you're doing.
-Close your eyes.

558
01:08:49,646 --> 01:08:52,646
Close your eyes and hold your breath,
everything will be really pretty.

559
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,046
You're scaring us now.

560
01:08:55,246 --> 01:08:58,246
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.

561
01:08:58,486 --> 01:09:00,166
Everything's gonna be all right.

562
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:02,406
I haven't felt this good in years.

563
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:04,686
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.

564
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:10,646
-Now what else? What else?
-Like this? Like this?

565
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:13,126
Right.

566
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:51,726
Like this?

567
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:55,846
Chicken wire.

568
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:07,846
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law!

569
01:10:08,046 --> 01:10:09,606
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

570
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:10,886
I'll pay you for this.

571
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,046
Take it. Take it.

572
01:10:12,206 --> 01:10:13,926
I'm perfectly fine.

573
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,166
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.

574
01:10:16,406 --> 01:10:19,126
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence!

575
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:21,606
Toby! Listen to me. Listen to me.

576
01:10:21,806 --> 01:10:23,526
Come on, right now.
We're going.

577
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:26,726
-I want to stay here!
-Let go of the fence! Come on.

578
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:45,366
Stay!

579
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:52,486
-Where we going?
-Where we going?

580
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:54,086
-Where are we going?
-Just get in the car.

581
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:57,286
-Where are we going?
-Quietly, quickly, get in.

582
01:10:57,646 --> 01:10:58,806
Get in there, Toby.

583
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:00,246
Quickly.

584
01:11:03,246 --> 01:11:05,646
-Dad needs some more help!
-Lock the doors!

585
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:07,086
Dad needs some more help!

586
01:11:07,286 --> 01:11:09,166
Quiet! Just lock the doors.

587
01:11:09,326 --> 01:11:10,606
Roll up those windows.

588
01:11:10,886 --> 01:11:13,246
Dad needs some more help!

589
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:15,006
Honey, where you going?

590
01:11:15,246 --> 01:11:17,046
-What?
-Where are you going?

591
01:11:17,846 --> 01:11:20,166
Taking the kids to my sister's.

592
01:11:21,526 --> 01:11:23,686
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.

593
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:25,766
What?

594
01:11:26,126 --> 01:11:27,526
You said what?

595
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,846
Ronnie, wait!

596
01:11:34,126 --> 01:11:36,006
Ronnie, hold it.

597
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:38,806
Will you hold it one minute?

598
01:12:05,126 --> 01:12:05,926
Morning.

599
01:12:43,886 --> 01:12:46,886
What is wrong with me today?

600
01:12:52,726 --> 01:12:53,926
Who is it, please?

601
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:58,406
It's the mailman. There's a package
for Julie Anderson.

602
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:04,246
You can just leave it at the door!

603
01:13:05,846 --> 01:13:10,006
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C.O.D.

604
01:13:10,246 --> 01:13:11,526
And besides...

605
01:13:12,486 --> 01:13:14,766
...you and I have to have
a little talk...

606
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:17,286
...about Kim.

607
01:13:35,926 --> 01:13:38,766
Like sands through the hourglass...

608
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:41,446
...so are the Days of Our Lives.

609
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:46,726
Here comes the king
Here comes the big number one

610
01:13:48,046 --> 01:13:51,046
Budweiser beer
The king is second to none

611
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:54,446
When you say Bud
The king is coming

612
01:13:54,646 --> 01:13:56,166
Let's hear the call

613
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:58,606
When you say Bud
You've said it all

614
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,646
When you say Bud
You've said it all

615
01:14:06,566 --> 01:14:10,166
Good evening. At the top of the news
tonight, a rail disaster.

616
01:14:10,406 --> 01:14:12,166
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...

617
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:15,686
...a trainload of dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...

618
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:18,446
...and forced the widest
area evacuation...

619
01:14:18,646 --> 01:14:21,766
...in the history of these
controversial rail shipments.

620
01:14:21,966 --> 01:14:25,126
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

621
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,046
I can do other things.

622
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:31,886
I'm trying to be.

623
01:14:33,326 --> 01:14:34,166
Yes, I am.

624
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:37,206
The Army and National Guard are
supervising the evacuation.

625
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:41,926
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

626
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:43,686
It was a joke!

627
01:14:43,886 --> 01:14:46,566
--the danger will be over
within 72 hours.

628
01:14:47,126 --> 01:14:49,806
Ronnie, anything you want.

629
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:52,646
Anything you want, I'll do.

630
01:14:55,566 --> 01:14:56,966
For how long?

631
01:15:02,726 --> 01:15:04,246
All of you?

632
01:15:05,526 --> 01:15:09,926
No. Ronnie, I want to talk
about this in person.

633
01:15:10,926 --> 01:15:14,326
This is not-- We can't talk
about this on the telephone.

634
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:19,606
Ronnie! Don't hang up!
Just don't--

635
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,486
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was
the first national monument...

636
01:15:27,686 --> 01:15:31,286
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

637
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:34,846
Thousands of civilian refugees
are fleeing the area...

638
01:15:35,086 --> 01:15:38,366
...spurred by rumors that the
overturned tanker cars...

639
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:42,886
...at Walkashi Needles Junction were
filled to capacity with nerve gas.

640
01:15:48,406 --> 01:15:51,286
Fortunately,
there have been no fatalities.

641
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:53,646
--evacuate this area,
which soon...

642
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:57,446
...will become the "hot zone,"
depending on the prevailing winds.

643
01:15:57,646 --> 01:16:01,286
This is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.

644
01:16:01,526 --> 01:16:04,046
--due to a strong prevailing
north-south wind.

645
01:16:04,246 --> 01:16:06,926
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...

646
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:10,566
...are making every effort to
contain the leaking toxins...

647
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,766
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.

648
01:16:13,966 --> 01:16:17,166
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.

649
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:20,166
Everyone, please,
stay out of the area.

650
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:22,446
--thousands of others
are homeless.

651
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:26,926
U.S. Army Materiel Command has
issued these new area restrictions:

652
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:30,406
All roadways north of Crowheart on
Interstate 25.

653
01:16:30,606 --> 01:16:33,806
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.

654
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,846
All multilane undivided
full traffic interchange...

655
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:40,806
...railroad, local and historic
stage roads south of Cody.

656
01:16:50,726 --> 01:16:53,486
Why aren't there fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

657
01:16:57,806 --> 01:16:59,686
You're going the wrong way!

658
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:04,726
Turn back around. Back this way.

659
01:17:05,366 --> 01:17:06,806
What's the matter with you?

660
01:17:07,086 --> 01:17:08,606
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

661
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:11,526
It's just a rental, officer.

662
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:13,606
My fault! My fault!

663
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:16,006
Starting with the letter "F,"
as in "Frank"...

664
01:17:16,326 --> 01:17:18,326
...to the letter "J" as in "Jack"...

665
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:22,726
...please find your way to the loading
platform for immediate boarding.

666
01:17:26,246 --> 01:17:28,486
You'll be real disappointed
and sorry...

667
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:32,966
...if you don't have an early warning
system, such as a bird, a gas mask.

668
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,206
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

669
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:37,966
And any of you folks are
worth more than a dog.

670
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:09,846
Roy!

671
01:18:21,166 --> 01:18:24,046
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricade!

672
01:18:49,806 --> 01:18:50,806
Why are we here?

673
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:54,246
The only way there is across country.
We'll break through the fence.

674
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:56,206
-Let's go.
-All right, hold on.

675
01:19:19,366 --> 01:19:21,606
The police dragged the river for him.

676
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:24,646
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.

677
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:29,326
Then they went around to every house
within five miles...

678
01:19:30,286 --> 01:19:34,166
...looking inside backyard
refrigerators.

679
01:19:38,086 --> 01:19:41,286
They asked if I'd seen any strangers
in the neighbourhood.

680
01:20:46,606 --> 01:20:48,806
I don't believe it's real.

681
01:20:50,806 --> 01:20:52,806
I don't believe it's real!

682
01:20:53,966 --> 01:20:55,406
It's real.

683
01:21:01,686 --> 01:21:04,806
Let's get down there. Get some gas
and get down in there.

684
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:08,886
What are those?

685
01:21:32,366 --> 01:21:36,326
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

686
01:22:21,326 --> 01:22:23,566
What do you want?
Get your hands off!

687
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:28,046
-How are you feeling?
-I feel fine!

688
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:31,926
According to my birds, the bad air
is from you guys farting around!

689
01:22:42,646 --> 01:22:44,486
-Move them out!
-What's happening?

690
01:22:44,686 --> 01:22:46,406
Where are we going?

691
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,366
Where are you taking her?

692
01:22:48,566 --> 01:22:50,726
Hold it! Why can't we go together?

693
01:22:50,926 --> 01:22:51,686
Watch your step.

694
01:23:09,286 --> 01:23:12,966
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

695
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:16,646
We need answers from you that are
honest, direct and to the point.

696
01:23:16,846 --> 01:23:17,926
Where is Jillian?

697
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:23,126
Do you realize the danger you
and your friend have risked?

698
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:27,286
In coming here, you've
exposed yourself to toxic gas.

699
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:29,006
Well, I'm alive.

700
01:23:29,206 --> 01:23:30,566
We're talking.

701
01:23:31,566 --> 01:23:33,486
This is true, Mr. Neary.

702
01:23:34,326 --> 01:23:37,606
But if the wind blew from
the south instead of the north...

703
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:41,046
...this conversation would not be
taking place.

704
01:23:41,286 --> 01:23:43,046
There's nothing wrong with the air.

705
01:23:44,526 --> 01:23:46,006
What makes you say that?

706
01:23:46,286 --> 01:23:48,406
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

707
01:23:48,966 --> 01:23:51,046
Go outside and make me a liar.

708
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:57,446
I want to talk to the man in charge.

709
01:23:57,646 --> 01:23:59,886
Mr. Lacombe is the highest authority.

710
01:24:00,246 --> 01:24:02,006
He isn't even an American.

711
01:24:04,326 --> 01:24:07,126
Mr. Neary, are you an artist
or a painter?

712
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:09,286
No.

713
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:15,686
Have you been hearing a persistent
ringing in your ears?

714
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:17,646
Almost an agreeable ringing?

715
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:18,846
No.

716
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:22,286
Having headaches, migraines?

717
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:23,806
Yeah.

718
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:26,966
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

719
01:24:27,246 --> 01:24:28,326
Yeah.

720
01:24:29,366 --> 01:24:32,486
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

721
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:36,646
And burning on your face
and on your body?

722
01:24:36,846 --> 01:24:39,286
-Yes. Who are you people?
-Look at this.

723
01:24:39,566 --> 01:24:42,446
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you?

724
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,446
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

725
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,646
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

726
01:24:55,726 --> 01:24:58,726
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

727
01:25:01,526 --> 01:25:03,406
Who are you people?

728
01:25:09,806 --> 01:25:13,646
-These people strangers to you?
-Yeah. Except for her.

729
01:25:15,726 --> 01:25:18,446
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

730
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:21,366
Yeah, you might say that.

731
01:25:21,806 --> 01:25:24,966
-But what did you expect to find?
-An answer.

732
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:28,366
That's not crazy, is it?

733
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:46,806
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

734
01:25:47,086 --> 01:25:48,206
Is that it?

735
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:51,526
Is that all you're going to ask me?

736
01:25:52,366 --> 01:25:54,726
I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions.

737
01:25:54,926 --> 01:25:58,966
I want to speak to someone in charge.
I want to lodge a complaint.

738
01:25:59,366 --> 01:26:01,526
You have no right to make people crazy.

739
01:26:01,766 --> 01:26:05,766
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

740
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:09,686
lf this is just nerve gas, how come I
know everything in such detail?

741
01:26:09,926 --> 01:26:11,606
I've never been here before.

742
01:26:12,526 --> 01:26:14,326
How come I know so much?

743
01:26:14,646 --> 01:26:16,486
What the hell is going on
around here?!

744
01:26:16,686 --> 01:26:18,646
Who the hell are you people?!

745
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:44,486
Is that it?! Answer me!

746
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,486
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home!

747
01:27:10,126 --> 01:27:12,086
Five minutes. Five!

748
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:14,886
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

749
01:27:47,446 --> 01:27:50,606
You brought 12 people to
the decontamination camp...

750
01:27:50,806 --> 01:27:55,046
...instead of the evacuation centre
where they belong. Why?

751
01:27:55,246 --> 01:27:57,966
-Because this means something.
-This means something.

752
01:27:59,766 --> 01:28:02,886
These people have come from
all over their country...

753
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,846
...to a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

754
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:09,126
Why?

755
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:12,966
Because somebody could be trying
to subvert this whole operation...

756
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:16,486
...by sending in fanatics, cultists
and Christ knows what all.

757
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:26,126
This is a small group of people...

758
01:28:27,566 --> 01:28:30,606
...who have shared a vision in common.

759
01:28:31,246 --> 01:28:32,366
Look.

760
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:38,326
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

761
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:40,526
Even they do not know why.

762
01:29:01,846 --> 01:29:02,966
Don't! You'll be poisoned!

763
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:06,486
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

764
01:29:06,726 --> 01:29:10,566
The Army's getting us out because
they don't want any witnesses.

765
01:29:11,206 --> 01:29:14,406
lf the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

766
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:18,006
We wanted to see the mountain.
It was a coincidence when I painted it.

767
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:19,766
You can take it off!

768
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:22,646
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

769
01:29:23,606 --> 01:29:27,206
Listen. How many of you people are
for getting out of here?

770
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:35,886
I don't know what's happening either.
I must find out.

771
01:29:40,486 --> 01:29:44,966
For every one of these anxious,
anguished people who've come here...

772
01:29:47,406 --> 01:29:51,926
...there must be hundreds more touched
by the vision who never made it here.

773
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:55,686
Simply because they never watch
the television.

774
01:29:57,326 --> 01:30:00,486
Or perhaps they watched it, but never
made the psychic connection.

775
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:04,366
It's a coincidence.
It's not scientific.

776
01:30:06,726 --> 01:30:08,566
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

777
01:30:08,806 --> 01:30:11,246
...it is an event sociological.

778
01:30:30,086 --> 01:30:31,406
Wait a minute!

779
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:48,726
-My name's Neary!
-Larry Butler!

780
01:30:48,966 --> 01:30:50,566
-How are you?
-Okay! You?

781
01:30:50,766 --> 01:30:52,526
-Fine, fine!
-That's good!

782
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:57,406
Everybody keep their masks on until
you're out of here and out of danger.

783
01:30:57,646 --> 01:31:01,646
Listen, we want to get out of here!
What's the matter with you?

784
01:31:18,926 --> 01:31:22,086
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

785
01:31:22,326 --> 01:31:24,966
Major, I want you to use infrared...

786
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:27,566
...and get me a photo analysis of
the northern face.

787
01:31:27,766 --> 01:31:29,726
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

788
01:31:29,966 --> 01:31:31,926
Major Walsh, listen.

789
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:35,526
I don't like to do this. We're in
enough trouble with these cattlemen.

790
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:39,526
If you can't get these folks
out of the area by 20:00 hours...

791
01:31:39,726 --> 01:31:41,926
...start dusting with EZ-4.

792
01:31:42,606 --> 01:31:43,726
What's EZ-4?

793
01:31:44,006 --> 01:31:47,246
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

794
01:31:47,446 --> 01:31:48,806
Comes out of Riot Control.

795
01:31:49,006 --> 01:31:52,806
They'll sleep for six hours and
wake up with a headache, that's all.

796
01:31:53,006 --> 01:31:56,566
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people.

797
01:31:56,806 --> 01:31:58,766
They were invited!

798
01:32:04,646 --> 01:32:06,726
They belong here more than we.

799
01:32:14,286 --> 01:32:15,846
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

800
01:32:16,046 --> 01:32:19,366
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.

801
01:32:19,566 --> 01:32:21,006
Here come three more.

802
01:32:23,886 --> 01:32:25,766
The authority in this park...

803
01:32:25,966 --> 01:32:29,326
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

804
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:32,086
There's a ravine leading straight up.

805
01:32:32,326 --> 01:32:35,086
-It's an easier climb.
-It's no good.

806
01:32:35,366 --> 01:32:38,766
When you get to the top, it's
a 300-foot drop down. Get down!

807
01:32:38,966 --> 01:32:41,446
What do you think it's like
on the other side?

808
01:32:42,126 --> 01:32:45,126
There's a box canyon on the other side
with ravines and trails...

809
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:47,486
...if you take this incline
to the right.

810
01:32:47,686 --> 01:32:50,326
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.

811
01:32:50,566 --> 01:32:53,366
-There was no canyon in my doodles.
-Next time, sculpt.

812
01:32:53,606 --> 01:32:56,366
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.

813
01:32:56,566 --> 01:32:57,646
Come on, let's go.

814
01:33:02,966 --> 01:33:05,446
The authority in this park...

815
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:09,766
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

816
01:33:09,966 --> 01:33:14,366
You are entering a military
reservation...

817
01:33:14,606 --> 01:33:17,126
...and subject to military law.

818
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:18,846
Call the bastard.

819
01:33:22,606 --> 01:33:24,526
Bahama, this is pyramid. Over.

820
01:33:24,726 --> 01:33:25,846
Go ahead.

821
01:33:26,086 --> 01:33:28,326
Nothing to report at midstation.

822
01:33:28,526 --> 01:33:31,246
Up ahead there's thousands
of places to hide.

823
01:33:31,526 --> 01:33:35,286
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

824
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:38,646
Get everybody off the northern face,
call the other side...

825
01:33:38,886 --> 01:33:40,526
...and tell them we're gonna dust.

826
01:34:06,126 --> 01:34:07,526
Get down!

827
01:34:08,406 --> 01:34:11,086
You are entering a military
reservation...

828
01:34:11,406 --> 01:34:14,766
...and subject to military law.

829
01:34:43,206 --> 01:34:45,966
Larry! Larry, come on!

830
01:35:02,766 --> 01:35:05,806
Larry! Don't let them see you!
Get down!

831
01:35:40,206 --> 01:35:43,926
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles!

832
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:50,606
Don't stop!

833
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:52,886
Don't look back! Come on, come on!

834
01:36:23,086 --> 01:36:25,766
Hurry! We're only 10 feet
from the top.

835
01:36:25,966 --> 01:36:28,846
Just a few more feet! We can
slide down the other side!

836
01:36:35,886 --> 01:36:38,406
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

837
01:36:38,606 --> 01:36:39,486
Don't come down.

838
01:36:40,526 --> 01:36:42,086
Come on, come on. Come on!

839
01:36:42,366 --> 01:36:44,006
Don't worry. We'll make it.

840
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,566
Come on. Move it. Move your ass!

841
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:54,686
Come on. Come on, please.

842
01:36:57,286 --> 01:36:58,406
Hurry!

843
01:37:00,526 --> 01:37:01,566
Hold it!

844
01:37:05,606 --> 01:37:06,606
Jump! Jump!

845
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:22,046
-Do you see that?
-Oh, yes.

846
01:37:22,766 --> 01:37:23,846
Good.

847
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:27,246
Is it on?
Check the speaker system here.

848
01:37:27,486 --> 01:37:29,006
I want this up all the way.

849
01:37:32,486 --> 01:37:33,886
Are you reading me on this one?

850
01:37:34,606 --> 01:37:35,886
How about here?

851
01:37:38,086 --> 01:37:42,126
-Testing. Testing.
-Okay, one, two, three, four.

852
01:37:43,046 --> 01:37:44,686
Testing. Testing.

853
01:37:44,926 --> 01:37:47,886
One, two, three, testing.

854
01:37:54,886 --> 01:37:58,606
Gentlemen, ladies. Take your
positions, please.

855
01:37:59,726 --> 01:38:01,606
This is not a drill.

856
01:38:01,806 --> 01:38:05,166
I repeat, this is not a drill.

857
01:38:06,126 --> 01:38:09,646
Could we have the lights
in the arena down 60%, please?

858
01:38:10,086 --> 01:38:11,686
60%.

859
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:19,486
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

860
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:30,246
Okay, watch the skies, please.

861
01:38:30,926 --> 01:38:35,646
We now show uncorrelated targets
approaching from the north-northwest.

862
01:39:23,566 --> 01:39:26,526
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

863
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:37,246
You see that?

864
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:40,326
Yes.

865
01:39:41,086 --> 01:39:42,046
Good.

866
01:40:28,526 --> 01:40:32,806
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...

867
01:40:33,006 --> 01:40:36,686
...please evacuate the center
approach marker.

868
01:40:37,326 --> 01:40:41,566
Audio analysis personnel, behind
the double yellow line.

869
01:40:47,366 --> 01:40:49,726
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

870
01:40:50,366 --> 01:40:51,686
Auto ready?

871
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:55,046
Tone interpolation on interlock.
Altitude and tabling.

872
01:40:55,206 --> 01:40:57,126
ARP and interlock now.

873
01:40:57,646 --> 01:41:00,046
Speed set at seven and a half.

874
01:41:00,326 --> 01:41:03,406
All positive functions, standing by.

875
01:41:26,846 --> 01:41:28,006
Go ahead.

876
01:41:28,366 --> 01:41:29,406
-Sunset.
-Go.

877
01:41:30,566 --> 01:41:33,086
Okay. Start with the tone.

878
01:41:39,846 --> 01:41:40,966
-Tang.
-Go.

879
01:41:41,966 --> 01:41:43,646
Up a full tone.

880
01:41:46,766 --> 01:41:48,486
Down a major third.

881
01:41:48,806 --> 01:41:50,566
Now drop an octave.

882
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:56,686
-Cool blue.
-Go.

883
01:41:56,966 --> 01:41:58,846
Up a perfect fifth.

884
01:42:01,326 --> 01:42:03,166
Nothing. Nothing at all.

885
01:42:07,886 --> 01:42:09,086
Give me a tone.

886
01:42:09,566 --> 01:42:11,646
-"Re" to the second.
-Up a full tone.

887
01:42:11,846 --> 01:42:13,606
-"Mi" to the third.
-Down a major third.

888
01:42:13,806 --> 01:42:15,806
-"Do" to the first.
-Drop an octave.

889
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:17,646
"Do" up a perfect fifth.

890
01:42:17,886 --> 01:42:19,486
"Sol" to the fifth.

891
01:42:34,926 --> 01:42:36,166
I know that.

892
01:42:38,846 --> 01:42:39,966
Faster.

893
01:42:55,046 --> 01:42:56,166
Kick that mule!

894
01:43:00,286 --> 01:43:01,646
Let's go!

895
01:43:41,766 --> 01:43:43,166
I'm very happy tonight.

896
01:43:43,566 --> 01:43:45,246
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

897
01:43:45,926 --> 01:43:48,966
Not a Merle Haggard, but it was great.

898
01:44:07,846 --> 01:44:09,126
Mr. Lacombe?

899
01:44:15,526 --> 01:44:18,086
What is it? What's happening?

900
01:45:11,366 --> 01:45:13,886
Come on. Come on, let's go.

901
01:45:15,406 --> 01:45:16,806
Keep down.

902
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:23,966
They're talking way over my head.

903
01:46:31,366 --> 01:46:32,526
Duck, duck!

904
01:47:07,166 --> 01:47:08,446
Photo one.

905
01:47:08,646 --> 01:47:11,846
Fantastic! Keep those reloads coming.

906
01:47:12,006 --> 01:47:13,566
Fantastic!

907
01:47:19,886 --> 01:47:21,886
-You want to see better?
-I can see fine.

908
01:47:22,126 --> 01:47:25,086
-We can't stay here.
-I can.

909
01:47:26,046 --> 01:47:29,486
-Why?
-Because Barry's not here.

910
01:47:30,366 --> 01:47:32,286
I'm just not ready.

911
01:47:35,966 --> 01:47:37,966
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.

912
01:47:38,246 --> 01:47:39,686
I know.

913
01:48:11,846 --> 01:48:15,846
This is data control to
all personnel.

914
01:48:16,206 --> 01:48:19,366
We monitor no biologic hazards.

915
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,766
Range safety clear.

916
01:49:26,566 --> 01:49:29,126
Oh, my God.

917
01:50:20,486 --> 01:50:22,566
Oh, my God!

918
01:50:45,606 --> 01:50:46,846
Holy shit.

919
01:52:34,286 --> 01:52:36,486
There is a safety hazard zone...

920
01:52:36,646 --> 01:52:40,446
...extending 25 meters from the ship.

921
01:52:40,806 --> 01:52:45,446
Special teams are exempt and
should be aware of low gravity.

922
01:52:45,646 --> 01:52:49,766
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

923
01:52:52,126 --> 01:52:55,806
All departments at operational
during this phase...

924
01:52:56,006 --> 01:52:58,086
...signify by beeping twice.

925
01:52:58,366 --> 01:53:01,246
lf everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon...

926
01:53:01,606 --> 01:53:03,166
...play the five tones.

927
01:54:09,806 --> 01:54:12,326
Give her six quavers, then pause.

928
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:14,726
She sent us four quavers...

929
01:54:14,886 --> 01:54:18,086
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

930
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:33,886
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

931
01:54:34,126 --> 01:54:37,446
-I hope somebody's taking all this down.
-What are we saying to each other?

932
01:54:37,606 --> 01:54:40,286
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

933
01:54:40,486 --> 01:54:41,766
It's the first day of school.

934
01:54:49,766 --> 01:54:52,646
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

935
01:55:08,806 --> 01:55:11,246
We have a translation airlock
on their audio signal.

936
01:55:11,526 --> 01:55:12,806
We're taking over
this conversation now.

937
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,726
Let's go! Come on!

938
01:57:47,526 --> 01:57:49,286
I am Claude Lacombe.

939
01:57:52,526 --> 01:57:53,926
Frank Taylor...

940
01:57:54,126 --> 01:57:56,606
...Lieutenant, United States
Navy Reserve...

941
01:57:56,806 --> 01:57:58,606
...064199.

942
01:57:58,846 --> 01:58:01,006
Lieutenant, welcome home.

943
01:58:01,446 --> 01:58:03,166
This way to debriefing.

944
01:58:03,526 --> 01:58:04,486
Harry Ward Craig...

945
01:58:04,686 --> 01:58:06,686
...Captain, United States Navy...

946
01:58:06,886 --> 01:58:09,126
...043431 .

947
01:58:09,326 --> 01:58:12,446
Captain,
would you come right this way?

948
01:58:14,246 --> 01:58:16,606
Welcome back, Navy. Welcome back.

949
01:58:18,446 --> 01:58:21,446
-Craig, Harry Ward.
-"Captain, United States Navy...

950
01:58:21,646 --> 01:58:23,646
...0434311 ."

951

Disappeared off Chicken Shoals,
flight 19.

952
01:58:28,726 --> 01:58:32,486
Matthew Mc Michael, Lieutenant,

953
01:58:32,846 --> 01:58:35,086
...0909411 .

954
01:58:35,286 --> 01:58:36,846

Furlow, Otis B...

956
01:58:40,166 --> 01:58:42,926
...Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy.

957
01:58:43,206 --> 01:58:46,086
They haven't even aged.
Einstein was right.

958
01:58:46,326 --> 01:58:48,366
Einstein was probably one of them.

959
01:58:48,886 --> 01:58:51,046
Erickson, David A...

960

...Lieutenant J.G.,
United States Navy....

964
01:59:36,486 --> 01:59:37,766
Monsieur Neary...

965
01:59:38,526 --> 01:59:40,046
...what do you want?

966
01:59:42,846 --> 01:59:45,886
I just want to know that
it's really happening.

967
01:59:49,006 --> 01:59:53,726
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

968
01:59:53,926 --> 01:59:57,486
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

969
02:00:02,886 --> 02:00:04,926
All right, now we have to talk.

970
02:00:07,646 --> 02:00:09,606
He wants to speak about
Mr. Neary's case.

971
02:00:09,886 --> 02:00:12,366
Swensen, Matthew Daniel...

972

...reported missing April 1976.

973
02:00:16,806 --> 02:00:19,526
-Are they going away?
-Yes.

974
02:00:23,646 --> 02:00:24,686
Wait a second, wait.

975
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:28,806
He says these are ordinary people
under extraordinary circumstances.

976
02:00:29,966 --> 02:00:33,086
Delores, Rudolph E...

977

Goodbye.

980
02:00:54,246 --> 02:00:55,166
Monsieur Neary...

981
02:00:57,286 --> 02:00:58,686
...I envy you.

982
02:02:52,286 --> 02:02:54,926
I'm told we can count on your
complete cooperation.

983
02:02:55,206 --> 02:02:57,566
-What's your blood type?
-I don't know.

984
02:02:57,766 --> 02:03:00,366
-What's your birth date?
-December 4th, 1944.

985
02:03:00,646 --> 02:03:02,886
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

986
02:03:03,166 --> 02:03:06,046
Is there any liver disease
in your family?

987
02:04:02,726 --> 02:04:05,166
May the Lord be praised at all times.

988
02:04:05,406 --> 02:04:07,966
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

989
02:04:08,166 --> 02:04:09,446
Show us Your ways.

990
02:04:09,606 --> 02:04:11,406
And lead us along Your paths.

991
02:04:11,686 --> 02:04:15,046
God has given you
His angels charge over you.

992
02:04:15,326 --> 02:04:18,686
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey...

993
02:04:18,926 --> 02:04:23,646
...and peaceful days, so that with
Your holy angel as a guide...

994
02:04:23,846 --> 02:04:27,206
...they may safely reach their
destination....

995
02:07:59,526 --> 02:08:00,806
Bye!
