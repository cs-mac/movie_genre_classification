1
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,116
- Right and wrong.

2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,118
You hear lots of
talk about it but

3
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,342
that talk usually
stays on the surface.

4
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:35,178
Truth is, right and
wrong is everywhere.

5
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,097
In the air, on your
neighbors face,

6
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,166
under your skin.

7
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,584
And when it gets deeper,

8
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,420
you might hear about
values, ethics,

9
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,383
or moral responsibility.

10
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:18,696
Looking back now, I might
explain the world differently.

11
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:57,009
- That's point, me.

12
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,678
- Drop shots were tough today.

13
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,263
- There's a rumor
I've been working on

14
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,222
those in my spare time.

15
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,389
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,643
- Hey, is that Mitchell?

17
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,395
- Ken,
how you doing?

18
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,562
- Good, buddy.

19
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,064
Oh, there's Nicholas too.

20
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,066
- Hey Ken, back in town?

21
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,275
- Yeah, just for a week.

22
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,485
- How's the
reinsurance business?

23
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,611
I heard you guys
are cleaning up.

24
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,448
- Yeah, offshore is,
but us, not so much.

25
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,705
- Right, that's what I heard.

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,333
- I'll tell you what I
heard, that the claim's

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,627
super job is up for grabs.

28
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,339
Someone is going to be
a lock for CEO one day.

29
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,300
And the other guy will be
in line stuck behind him.

30
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,637
That's what we're
talking about, right?

31
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,347
- Whatever you say, Ken.

32
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,098
- Now Mitchy here
is cockier than ever,

33
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,351
I'd probably put
my money on him.

34
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,478
- Well, working the roof
has been paying off so far.

35
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,105
- As has dating the
boss's daughter.

36
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,149
- Still dating Sara, huh?

37
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,276
I figured ol' Mitchy would
have hit that by now.

38
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,486
All you got to do is
slip a ring on her finger

39
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,656
and it won't matter if you
get the promotion or not.

40
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,535
You're set for life.

41
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,372
Right, guys?

42
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,295
- Think your drink's getting
warm over there, Ken?

43
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,093
Too bad the Forbes List
doesn't have a bottom 500.

44
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,512
Ken would be famous.

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,555
- He did
have a point, though.

46
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,516
You have been awfully
confident considering

47
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,560
what's at stake here.

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,459
- I just expect the
best man to win.

49
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,211
- Hello?

50
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,545
- I'm calling
from Jasper head office

51
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,591
I have one of your claims,
a house fire, Switzer,

52
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,386
I see you made an estimate
but didn't sign the offers.

53
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,553
- Switzer,
yeah, that's because

54
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,389
I didn't make one.

55
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,141
I submitted my estimate,
then the examiner took over

56
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,226
and dealt with the
client himself.

57
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,603
- Mitchell Getz made
the first offer?

58
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,771
- He's done
that with me

59
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,440
a few times, and he
closes himself.

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,192
Who is this again?

61
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,862
- Great, then I'll go
ahead and file it, thanks.

62
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,656
- Hello?

63
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,617
- Hello, Mrs. Switzer?

64
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,495
- Yes?

65
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,788
- Mrs. Switzer, my name
is John,

66
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,790
I'm calling from Trinity
Hopkins Mutual, we're an
insurance company,

67
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,624
I'm calling...

68
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,833
- We
have a carrier,

69
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,418
Jasper Insurance.

70
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,795
- I see.

71
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,339
May I ask if you're
satisfied with your service?

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,216
Have you ever needed
to make a claim?

73
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,468
- Well yes,
we had a terrible fire,

74
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,220
but our claim was denied.

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,264
- I see, I'm sorry to hear that.

76
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,392
Can you tell me why
you were not covered?

77
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,644
- Because
we'd said we were non smokers

78
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,605
on our policy, the man
said he had to deny it.

79
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,855
- He did?

80
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,315
- Yes,
my husband, just

81
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,651
started smoking again.

82
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,735
He feels sick about it.

83
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:05,197
We lost our house and
now have nowhere to go.

84
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:09,452
- That's, that's unfortunate.

85
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:14,499
Did you question this man about
the non smoking exemption?

86
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,293
I didn't know that I could.

87
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,254
He spoke very quickly
and I wasn't really able

88
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,507
to follow at all.

89
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:26,302
Are you still there?

90
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,596
- I'm afraid I have
to take another call.

91
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,891
Thank you for your
time, Mrs. Switzer.

92
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,728
- Hey pal, you not
playing tonight?

93
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,771
- No, not tonight.

94
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,947
- Tsk tsk tsk, you work
too hard Nick, too hard.

95
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,910
- Karl,
want to play some ball?

96
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,495
Oh c'mon, I bet you
were quite

97
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,579
the slugger back in the
day.

98
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,913
- I wasn't too
bad when I hit the ball.

99
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,291
- I got a bat for
you.

100
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,416
- I'll be the
umpire, you're out.

101
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,584
- We have lots to talk about.

102
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,836
- We'll talk about
that promotion.

103
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:12,473
- Is that right? Yes, OK.

104
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,892
- Hello?

105
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,519
- Mrs. Switzer,
it's John again

106
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,896
from Trinity Hopkins Mutual.

107
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,730
Mrs. Switzer, you
are legally entitled

108
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,524
to a new home and to have all
of your possessions replaced.

109
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:26,821
Now you need to call the VP
of claims at Jasper Insurance,

110
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,906
OK, and tell him
that you are aware

111
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,343
that the negotiation
was illegal, OK?

112
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,345
Oh, thanks man.

113
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,932
- Good Job.
- Thanks.

114
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,725
- Hey Mister Corner Office.

115
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,560
- Hey, I thought you had class.

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,312
- Tina's going skiing
this afternoon.

117
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,855
I decided to go with.

118
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,565
Came to get Dad's Rover.

119
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,733
We might stay up
there til Friday.

120
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,569
- Don't you have more classes?

121
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,028
- What did Mitchell do?

122
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,656
Looks like he's catching shit.

123
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,658
- I don't know.

124
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,576
- See ya.

125
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,923
- Bye.

126
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,769
- Henry's on his shell again.

127
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:41,981
Claim super?

128
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,442
- Renewed my insurance today,

129
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,775
figured I'd go for some
personalized plates.

130
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,445
- OK.

131
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,779
- You like it? No?

132
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,614
- It's OK.

133
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,658
Congratulations again.

134
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,000
- Thank you, dear.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,629
So, since the promotion,
I've been thinking

136
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,552
about everything and

137
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,811
the timing felt right.

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,062
- Um...

139
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,106
- Um, maybe I
should ask properly?

140
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:26,400
- No...

141
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,943
- No, don't ask, or...

142
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,865
- It's just a surprise.

143
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,785
I mean, we're not even
living together yet.

144
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,748
- Yeah, so you just figure
maybe you need more time?

145
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:47,461
- My trips coming up, so there'd
be some time there I guess.

146
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,755
- Sure, sure.

147
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,884
- It has only been a
year for us, right?

148
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,894
- You're right, absolutely.

149
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,979
- I have some news.

150
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,860
I, uh, I've decided to
make my major my minor.

151
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,488
- What?

152
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,868
- Yeah, English minor,
visual arts major.

153
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,495
- Visual arts, huh?

154
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,998
But your minor is
still business, right?

155
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,833
I mean you can change your
major every second week,

156
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,711
but you keep your
business minor.

157
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,508
- Not anymore.
I'm changing it up.

158
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,885
- Sara, how many
credits is that?

159
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,846
- The point is I hate business.

160
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,933
- No, the point is
doubling your inheritance.

161
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,730
Aren't a few courses
worth getting through

162
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,105
just for that?

163
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,734
- No, it's not worth the grief.

164
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,070
And as you know, I've never
agreed with my fucking father

165
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,739
on that, anyway.

166
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,950
- He earned his money and he
wants it managed responsibly.

167
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,870
Not such a bad guy,
when you think about it.

168
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,871
Most fathers would not spring
for a beach tour of Thailand

169
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,749
on Christmas.

170
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,792
- So now I'm a spoiled brat?

171
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,586
- No, but you can't take
everything so lightly, Sara.

172
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,964
I mean, you're squandering
an opportunity.

173
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,591
- You mean money.

174
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,551
- I mean there's more to life
than just drifting sideways.

175
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,928
Visual arts...,

176
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,139
if you want to achieve
something, don't you

177
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,389
have to do
what you're good at?

178
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,933
- Whether I'm good or
bad is not the point.

179
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,729
And there's more to
life than being on some

180
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,980
pre-programed mission.

181
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,075
- I got this
promotion because I work hard.

182
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,538
- Nicholas,
come in, have a seat.

183
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,582
How's the transition?
Settling in?

184
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,000
- So far so good.

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,794
- Good, good.

186
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,839
Nicholas, we've recently
been forced to renegotiate

187
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,885
a number of claims and settle
above the original estimates.

188
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,263
Turns out Mitchell Getz
has been using

189
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,601
overtly illegal
negotiating practices.

190
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,104
- That's very unfortunate,
but good that we

191
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:09,104
got it straightened out.

192
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,023
- But it is troubling.

193
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,982
You see, the claimant that
brought it to our attention

194
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,985
was supposedly alerted
by Trinity Hopkins.

195
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,989
Yesterday I learned that they
ceased their telemarketing

196
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,202
campaign three months ago.

197
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,745
- They ceased it.

198
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,706
- Seems Mitchell wanted
to pat his numbers,

199
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:32,628
but he wasn't the only front
runner for the super promotion.

200
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,130
Did you have any
involvement with that

201
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,008
claimant being contacted?

202
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,091
- No.

203
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,969
- Alright.

204
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,053
We do intend to determine
the origin of that call,

205
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,682
so I'm asking a few people to
submit their phone records,

206
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,059
home and cell, I assume
you have no objections?

207
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,769
- No.

208
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,605
- We'll need your
current statements,

209
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,606
and the next batch
when they come in.

210
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,984
- Of course.

211
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,195
- And all of this stays within
the senior management circle

212
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,905
for now, understood?

213
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:04,826
- Well, seeing as how I am
now a part of that circle,

214
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,910
I wonder if maybe it would
best to just let it ride

215
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,913
as what was wrong has
now been made right

216
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,750
with the client?

217
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,086
- Another view is that
Mitchell's actions were aimed

218
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,173
at saving this company money.

219
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,341
The same can't be said for
whomever made that phone call,

220
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,677
can it?

221
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,082
- Right.

222
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,010
- Let's go.

223
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,264
For a guy who got the prize,
you're looking pretty down.

224
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,725
- Sara and I had a thing.

225
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,309
- I heard you guys
were on the outs.

226
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,729
- No, we're not on the outs.

227
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,780
Just taking some space.

228
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,118
- Can I get another one, please?

229
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,284
- For someone who
lost the prize,

230
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,162
you're looking pretty up.

231
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,205
- Well, you know how it goes.

232
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,293
Life goes on.

233
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,169
- Is Sara going?

234
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,755
- Going where?

235
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,798
- Tonight, to the party thing.

236
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,174
- How should I know?

237
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,969
- You invited them?

238
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,761
- I told Tina about it.

239
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,139
Sara might show up, I guess.

240
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,145
- You guess?

241
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,980
That'd beat getting the
promotion, wouldn't it,

242
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,356
getting her?

243
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,900
Just crank up your charm shit
and even Sara can't resist?

244
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,193
- My charm shit?

245
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,320
- Didn't you once tell me

246
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,197
that everything I have
could be yours?

247
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,116
Said it'd be dictated by
circumstance and legitimized

248
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,994
by the laws of manhood.

249
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,202
You were loaded.

250
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,831
- Well, that would
explain it, wouldn't it?

251
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,961
Why don't you just worry
about you and Sara?

252
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,090
- Yeah, you're right.

253
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,759
Think I'll go too.

254
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,764
- You're going to come, tonight?

255
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,863
Sounds good to me.

256
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,197
- So how long
have you known Mitchell?

257
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,657
- We went to
high school together.

258
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,033
- So you guys
are good friends?

259
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,035
- Must be.

260
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,413
- We've been having these nights
first Friday of the month.

261
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,835
Shitty neighborhood, and that
makes for some soft targets.

262
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,462
- New guy's
a fucking dick.

263
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,839
Alright, we need some waters.

264
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,256
Some waters, waters.

265
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,384
You want to grab us a couple?

266
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,260
Now fair warning, alright?

267
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,221
Everybody in here is going
to drop so if you don't, man,

268
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,182
you're going to be on
a different planet.

269
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,226
- Do you have just a half
a dose, or something?

270
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,269
- What is this, the office?

271
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,231
You know, maybe you'd
feel more comfortable

272
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,192
in a foreign environment if you
had more of that charm shit.

273
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,071
- Do you have half
a dose or not?

274
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,365
- That's what I
figured you'd say.

275
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,244
Here, these are half
doses of something mild.

276
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:48,048
Take both.

277
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,176
Hey.

278
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,052
- What are you doing here?

279
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,264
- How was your exams?

280
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,101
- They were OK.

281
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,186
- You guys look foggy.

282
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,437
- Yeah, but it feels great.

283
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,105
I have some here
for you girls, too.

284
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,481
- You took some, too?

285
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,111
Mr. Getz, you're
a bad influence.

286
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,154
- What?

287
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,904
- So then what happens?

288
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,323
Woo over all the babes?

289
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,200
- No, I'm reformed.

290
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,286
- You're reformed, are you?

291
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,538
- Yes, yes, it's sad but true.

292
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,332
And this place is all
about having fun, OK?

293
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,961
So here, take these,
you're going to love it.

294
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,047
- Maybe another time,
we're going to go.

295
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,132
- What? You just got here.

296
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,219
- I'm flying out Sunday,
so I want to take it easy.

297
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,386
- Where you going?

298
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,513
- Thailand for semester break.

299
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,266
- You're going to Thailand?
That's awesome.

300
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,102
- Hey, good.

301
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,896
- Thanks.

302
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,357
We'll see you guys later.

303
00:17:46,357 --> 00:19:17,323
- Yeah, yeah OK, bye.

304
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,417
- Can you stand?

305
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,170
- There's no buzzer downstairs.

306
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,253
I'm looking for
someone named Andrea.

307
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,547
- Andrea, visitor.

308
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,465
- Thanks.

309
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
- Yo, man, I'm Jesse.

310
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,763
- Hey.

311
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,348
Hi.

312
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,474
The cab company gave
me your address.

313
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,434
I think you helped
me out last night.

314
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,229
- What, you don't
remember anything?

315
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,356
- No, it's all pretty
much a blur, but, I think

316
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,401
you used your own money
to pay for the cab,

317
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,695
right, and tipped the driver
to see me up to my suite?

318
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,490
- Because your wallet was empty.

319
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,201
- It wasn't that much.

320
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,537
- You should probably
just take it.

321
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,707
- Alright.

322
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,625
- Just, about last night,
did you see anything?

323
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,502
- Jesse, there's no
smoking in the hallways,

324
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,714
you're going to get
us all kicked out.

325
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:00,343
- I can wait, can you come
in for a second or something?

326
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,136
This way.

327
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,722
Yeah, just go over there.

328
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,142
All I know is that I found you

329
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,603
and you didn't call
the cops because

330
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,314
you were really stoned.

331
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,566
Not that you would
have got

332
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,358
much response in this
neighborhood, anyway.

333
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,736
- And you didn't
see anybody else?

334
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,571
- No, what were you doing there?

335
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,407
- I was just at a party and
must've wandered outside.

336
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,452
Thanks for doing that, again,
you really didn't have too.

337
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:34,586
- Didn't I?

338
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,587
- I work downstairs.

339
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,548
You actually seem half
decent, what's your deal?

340
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,594
Addictions, criminal record?

341
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,637
- Uh, I'm engaged.

342
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,654
- You people and
your ceremonies.

343
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,490
- Hey, Nicholas Green.

344
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,410
No, Brown, right?

345
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,494
- Gray.

346
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,372
- Nicholas Gray.

347
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:13,583
Harry Price, your old
neighbor from Christopher St.

348
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,586
- Oh, Christopher St,
yeah, I remember you.

349
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,257
- You look the same.

350
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,469
What to say, huh?

351
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,679
Hey, you remember those bullies

352
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,638
that used to follow you home?

353
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,557
- The Cult brothers, yeah.

354
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,557
- So what happened?

355
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,644
They track you down?

356
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:38,441
- No, man, I think you
straightened them out for good.

357
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,652
- On that note, you
owe me a coffee.

358
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,195
Looks like you
could use one, too.

359
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,446
Don't worry about your face,
where we're going

360
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,661
it plays ironic.

361
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,828
And this friend of yours,

362
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,664
why didn't he have
your back last night?

363
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,541
- I don't know.

364
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,253
- C'mon, sure you do.

365
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:03,340
- Well, with Mitchell and I,
it's kind of always been

366
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,635
less about actual friendship
and more just about

367
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,684
pushing each other to be
better and something like that.

368
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:14,560
- Thank you, Monique.
-You're welcome.

369
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,479
-An insurance.

370
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,647
What's the next rung on the
corporate ladder for you?

371
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,482
- Thanks.

372
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:26,531
After claim super,
it's claims VP, then CEO.

373
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,492
- Wow, and still so young.

374
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,327
The classic overachiever.

375
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:37,666
I'll be sure to call you
with all my insurance needs.

376
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,502
- So what about you,
Harry, what do you do?

377
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,673
- I volunteer at the library.

378
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,720
I get along well with the books.

379
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,806
- You know, I remember I
used to watch you reading

380
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,682
all the time.

381
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,518
- You used to watch me read?

382
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:56,728
- Yeah, through that fence

383
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,688
that your dad put out.
Always by yourself.

384
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,440
In fact, except for the
day with the bullies,

385
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,692
I don't think I ever
saw you leave the yard.

386
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,862
- You know, I'd gotten shit
for saving your ass that day.

387
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,739
You know, my dad was
always against interfering

388
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,531
with the natural
state of the world.

389
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,742
But I used to watch you, too.

390
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,953
You know, you interacting
with your parents.

391
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,873
You were younger so I would
imagine having those same

392
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,669
interactions with my parents.

393
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,757
Used to close my eyes, try to
burn those images into my mind

394
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,679
trying to create memories.

395
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,394
But that we can't do, can we?

396
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,644
- I always wondered
what happened to you.

397
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,645
After that, I mean...

398
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,941
- Yeah, my dad was a
philosophy professor.

399
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,692
And he kept getting fired
for taking radical positions,

400
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,986
so we moved around a lot.

401
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,531
Probably a genius,
manic depressive.

402
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,701
It was sink or swim.
Formal ideas were everything.

403
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,994
He wanted people not
to live in half truths.

404
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,624
- And one day you guys
just weren't there.

405
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,502
- Yeah, well, when I was
15 he boarded me out there

406
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,797
to a school for the
gifted children.

407
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,383
And they turned out to be
some of the dumbest fucks

408
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:10,759
I ever met in my life,
so I didn't go back,

409
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,761
but I didn't go home either.

410
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,432
I swam.

411
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,521
He was never really
an emotional father,

412
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,650
he was extremely rational.

413
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,570
As for you, you know, you said
something very interesting.

414
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,365
You said every man
for himself, but yet,

415
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,994
you tracked down
Andrea to repay her.

416
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,455
You got a lot more
going on on that face

417
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:45,377
than that black eye of yours.

418
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,632
- Life's complicated, isn't it?

419
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:50,894
- Nope.

420
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:47,856
- Whoa, what happened to you?

421
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,900
- Blacked out on Friday.

422
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,859
Ended up in an alleyway.

423
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,153
Got mugged.

424
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,989
- I thought you went home.

425
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:58,742
- I tracked down Richard, and
he said the pills you gave me

426
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,869
with the X's on it were way
stronger than what you had.

427
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,622
Something like three
or four times the dose.

428
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,914
- Really?

429
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,041
That dealer was messing with me.

430
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,752
- Or maybe with Sara coming,
the more stoned I was,

431
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:13,924
the better for you.

432
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,968
- You know, if you needed

433
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:35,739
your hand held,
you shouldn't of come.

434
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,906
- What is it
your turtles are doing?

435
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,660
- Oh, trying
to flip Henry over.

436
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,540
They say it's some kind
of natural phenomenon.

437
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,919
- So does this place reflect
your girlfriend or you?

438
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,838
- Sara helped decorate,
but she doesn't live here.

439
00:27:52,838 --> 00:28:00,763
- It's nice.

440
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:01,015
Rent or own?

441
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:07,186
- Own, I got an inheritance, so.

442
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,522
- Your parents
passed away early.

443
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,817
But you don't have to feel
self conscious around me.

444
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:16,820
I understand the trappings
of comfort, I really do,

445
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,827
and by the way, I appreciate
getting this back, thank you.

446
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,623
- So you really never
tried alcohol before?

447
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,000
Never gave into the peer
pressure or anything?

448
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,005
- Never had any peers.

449
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,549
- I got to say, Harry, you're
a pretty interesting guy.

450
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,051
- Thank you.

451
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,098
- How'd you end up...

452
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:44,098
Seems like you could've...

453
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,811
- Why am I so poor?

454
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,980
I'd say it's because I'm not
a liar, but that would be a

455
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,607
semantic discussion, and
that's not really why I'm here,

456
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:54,910
is it?

457
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,994
- You said something yesterday

458
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:10,250
about losing yourself.

459
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,211
Fact is, I'm going to be fired.

460
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,838
Everything that I've ever
worked for my whole life

461
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,008
is about to turn to vapor and
I'm going to be radioactive

462
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,803
in the only industry I know.

463
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,596
And on top of that,
I proposed to Sara...

464
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,641
- But she said no.

465
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:30,603
- She said I'm too
focused on work.

466
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,230
To closed off,
she wanted some space.

467
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,859
All this stuff,
it starts to overwhelm you.

468
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:40,070
- And why is it
you're getting fired?

469
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,907
- Mitchell did
something unethical,
I fixed it anonymously,

470
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,952
and now Karl suspects a
whistleblower and he's reacting

471
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,622
very hard.

472
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,332
When he finds out what I did,
Mitchell's going to get

473
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,084
my job.

474
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:55,838
He's going to get everything.

475
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,965
- And what does
Sara think about it?

476
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,259
- She doesn't know, nobody does.

477
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:06,096
She is the one thing I
wish I could hang on to,

478
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,854
I just, I don't know how.

479
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,355
- Morality.

480
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,898
- What?

481
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,276
- Perhaps what you and
Sara are wrestling with,

482
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:23,990
opening up, understanding
the world is an exercise

483
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,700
in higher morality.

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,952
The gift that woman have,
a tendency toward

485
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:32,126
compassion, nurturing.

486
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,088
You being closed off
like Sara described you

487
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:42,259
could be unattractive to
her sense of morality.

488
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,136
- I guess that's one
way to look at it.

489
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,306
- The point is, once you take
a good look at the world,

490
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:50,307
you start seeing the
good and evil in things.

491
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,935
It'll expand your
outlook real fast.

492
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,145
And then Sara won't
see a guy with his head

493
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,364
in the sand anymore.

494
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,328
Assuming you're willing
to fight to keep her.

495
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:12,212
- I'm willing.

496
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,008
Can one live in this society
and not exploit anyone

497
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,096
or appropriate anything?

498
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,285
- Are you a
religious man, Nick?

499
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,286
Bad people go to hell?

500
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,163
- Not really, no.

501
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,913
- But I'll assume you act in
a civilized manner because

502
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,000
it's good for society.

503
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,920
And what's good for
society is good for you.

504
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,505
So you're a philosopher,

505
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:12,135
but the question is
have you read any?

506
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,179
Take Immanuel Kant, his
whole take on morality is that

507
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,472
you should only do the
actions that maximize

508
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,349
the greater good.

509
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:21,148
Every action, all the time.

510
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:29,485
Capitalism says that if you
work hard, you'll live well.

511
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:33,952
Runaway capitalism is
saying something else.

512
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,538
You know I was in Bolivia

513
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,248
when the world bank privatized
the water supply of the people?

514
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,376
I saw it.

515
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:47,086
I would've been in Tiananmen
Square if they'd let me.

516
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,047
And Nigeria in '62
if I'd been born yet.

517
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:53,190
Doesn't matter how hard you
work, the system's rigged.

518
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,150
But we're all connected
like dominoes.

519
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,237
Each choice you make ripples
out and affects someone

520
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,329
down the line.

521
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,414
Life is busy.

522
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:26,376
It's a fog of
misinformation out there.

523
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,503
But at their core,
I do think people care.

524
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:34,347
How about you,
Nicholas, do you care?

525
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,393
- Oh shit, dude.

526
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,697
- Bathroom break.

527
00:35:56,697 --> 00:36:01,327
- Yo man, how you
liking this housing?

528
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,371
- It's alright.

529
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,248
- Yeah man, they're great.

530
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,251
I know it's you, because like,
I lived in, like, 10 places

531
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,086
before this, they were bad.

532
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,255
I mean most of them were
like foster homes and shit,

533
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,467
like this one, right?

534
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,385
There's this guy who he's
like making like, you know,

535
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,554
like advances on me, right.

536
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,057
Like, no man, I don't want it.

537
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:26,353
I got beat up and
punched too, man.

538
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:29,023
There's this bigger guy and
he like stuck me, man.

539
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,610
Like right on my side, man,
it was bad.

540
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:38,405
My mom's is probably my
favorite, still, though.

541
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,326
I was good, man.

542
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,331
I was real good, like when I
was just a little kid you know?

543
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,583
- Hey, Jesse.

544
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,626
I've been thinking
about your rent problem,

545
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,588
and I don't know,
maybe I could help you out

546
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:57,050
with a loan just for this month,
until things pick up

547
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,300
for you again?

548
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,094
- That, like that
would be awe...

549
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,304
That would be amazing, man.

550
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:06,266
You know, I knew you were
a good guy, like right off.

551
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:09,478
I could tell.

552
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,076
- Cool.

553
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:23,286
- Oh my god.

554
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,463
- You should've seen me before.

555
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,425
This is really nice.

556
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,719
- It's nice to be back.

557
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,639
I had a good chance to reflect.

558
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,521
- Yeah, yeah I've been
doing a lot of that, too.

559
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,525
Starting too, you know,

560
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,362
really see things clearly.

561
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,240
I've been taking a really
good look at the world.

562
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,286
- Well it's beautiful
out there, Nick.

563
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,538
Colorful.

564
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:09,458
- Yeah.

565
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,543
Though the more
you understand it,

566
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:17,463
the more black
and white it gets.

567
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,175
Start to see who's
getting screwed,

568
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,177
who's responsible,

569
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,434
who needs to be
knocked down a peg.

570
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,603
What?

571
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:35,148
- You said you'd
been reflecting.

572
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,358
I'm just wondering
if you really changed

573
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,494
or just got a changed direction.

574
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:51,505
- You know, I really
do care about you.

575
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,217
- Nicholas,

576
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,637
what do we really
have in common?

577
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:08,389
Other than my father
is the main shareholder

578
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,195
of the company you
want to run one day?

579
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,614
I'm sorry for that
night at the party.

580
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,635
I should've looked out for you.

581
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,596
- If you're moving beyond her,

582
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:50,851
maybe you should
just let her go.

583
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,521
I heard you offered
to help Jesse.

584
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:02,485
Very cool, especially...

585
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,570
There's no doubt that poor
kid has been kicked around

586
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,744
his whole short shitty life.

587
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,661
Hey,

588
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,795
you drove here tonight, right?

589
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,467
- Where we going, exactly?

590
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,550
- Who is this guy?

591
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,427
- He's cool, Chelsea.

592
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,318
Thought I already told you that.

593
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:46,570
- Hey, Harry.

594
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,489
- We're going in, Nick.

595
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,740
I don't expect you to come.

596
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,451
- You're breaking in, why?

597
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,577
- It's the right thing to do.

598
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:53,579
- Check this shit out.

599
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,664
- No, what about
an alarm, or the cops?

600
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,708
- We got it covered, Nick.

601
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,561
Just keep your eyes peeled.

602
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,896
- No, no, no, go back.

603
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,438
- Hey, you work here?

604
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,324
- In situations like this, Nick,
we run.

605
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:52,721
- What the fuck?

606
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,806
- We had the safe combo, too.

607
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,181
What can I say,

608
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,603
I meet a lot of people whose
employers are pricks.

609
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:04,025
15% goes to charity,
that makes each cut 17%.

610
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,818
And you no longer have
to front Jesse's rent.

611
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,780
We take what we need and
we distribute the rest.

612
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,740
- All of this is
to avoid a loan?

613
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,786
- C'mon Nick, Jesse was
never going to pay you back.

614
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:18,871
Besides, we had this
already planned,

615
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,831
we just moved up the date.

616
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,793
- So I assume then, you
don't really volunteer

617
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:24,880
at the library.

618
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,632
- I do volunteer, actually,

619
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:34,471
and I never lie Nick, ever.

620
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:36,847
Look, you've been
doing the math.

621
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,641
The rules have always
been made by the ones

622
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:51,404
who have the most
to lose, right?

623
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:55,827
- Andrea seems
like a good person.

624
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,789
- You know, Nick, you
once asked me why I hadn't

625
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,623
made more of myself.

626
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:04,501
You've been out there
competing one way,

627
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,543
but there are a lot of ways.

628
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:09,963
Ways that are more connected
to the essence of life.

629
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,717
Men like you, you shape society.

630
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:17,054
Winners, leaders, alphas,
the question is profound,

631
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:20,432
yet one that each man
has to face alone.

632
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,860
Is one morally obligated
to affect change?

633
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,655
You know Nick, if you took
all the fire inside of you and

634
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:37,701
you put it into this, life
might start to feel more real.

635
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,851
You can be better than them all.

636
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:05,853
- Claimed
denied straightforward.

637
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:08,523
There's nothing we can do here.

638
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:12,818
If he sues, bring it back to me.

639
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,905
You'll let me know when your
remaining phone records arrive?

640
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:17,757
We've collected the others.

641
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:36,592
- Just the
man I wanted to see.

642
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:38,980
I've got two tickets
for tonight, you coming?

643
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:57,739
- I'm taking my vacation time.

644
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:58,907
- Alright, shh.

645
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:01,909
- Hey, where's Chelsea tonight?

646
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:03,911
- Chelsea's not a
team player, Nick.

647
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,164
- What about Barry, is
he like a, is he alright?

648
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:13,588
- Barry's got certain talents.

649
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,048
- Is that what he's
supposed to be doing?

650
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,257
- Aw, fuck.

651
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,550
- How'd you get in here?

652
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,052
- Where are the rides?

653
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:20,052
- What?

654
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:30,063
- The candy.

655
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,664
- C'mon.

656
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:48,054
C'mon, Jesse, let's go.

657
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,639
Hey, you know they
pay those poor fucks

658
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,061
24 cents and hour to
make 200 dollar shoes?

659
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:14,025
- Hey, Barry, where'd you learn
to hit the guard like that?

660
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,860
- In Korea.

661
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,320
I've been ball-peened
before, too, though.

662
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,072
But it was more

663
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,867
ceremonial.

664
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,036
- If I stayed one more
night, I'd feel better.

665
00:46:27,036 --> 00:46:30,164
- Ah, no, I'm sorry, you've got
to go to the shelter now OK?

666
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:31,916
You know where it is.

667
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,943
No booze.

668
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:01,755
- Hey, hoodies.

669
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:04,175
- So, Andrea,
how do you like living

670
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:05,050
in those lofts?

671
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,302
- We share a bathroom.

672
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,056
I'd move in a second.

673
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:13,101
- But, they don't pay
you enough to move?

674
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,144
- I might not have much
of a choice, anyway.

675
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:17,271
They're talking about knocking
the building down soon.

676
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:19,148
- Then what?

677
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:22,110
- Then, I guess I would have
to sell some of my pieces.

678
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,154
People have offered
to buy them before.

679
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:27,990
I just have a little bit
of a problem letting go.

680
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,204
- Well, I could, you
know, help you out.

681
00:48:34,204 --> 00:48:36,416
- How would I repay
you, that's not...

682
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,793
- No, you just call it a gift.

683
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:40,170
I owe you anyway, right?

684
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,967
- That's a really lovely
offer, Nicholas, thank you,

685
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,219
but I'd manage on my own and
this dinner is absolutely

686
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:52,974
plenty, so, I don't
really know what you think

687
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,018
you owe me anyway.

688
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,146
- So your only reward, then,
is just knowing that you help

689
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,023
us down and out times.

690
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,025
- No, I don't know.

691
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:05,904
I would rather not do it
all, it just seems to pop up

692
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:09,036
in my face and then I just
have to, just what it is.

693
00:49:14,036 --> 00:49:16,500
Why does this feel like a date?

694
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,418
What about your fiancé?

695
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:23,422
- Yeah, that's, that's over.

696
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,007
I do need a date on Sunday, too.

697
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,141
Guy from work is
getting married.

698
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,860
Oh, we're right over here.

699
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,530
Ah, do you want some
wine, red, white?

700
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:53,076
- Uh, either wine,
white, red, red.

701
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,077
- OK.

702
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,286
- Is the buffet free?

703
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:56,083
- Yes it is.

704
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,458
- Hi.

705
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,253
- Can I just get two
red wines, please?

706
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,880
- Just the
man I want to see.

707
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,090
I got an interesting
email yesterday.

708
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,135
Want to know what it said?

709
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:12,137
- Not really.

710
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:15,472
- Well, it said ask
Nicholas what he knows about

711
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:19,518
your claimant's renegotiations.

712
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:21,271
- And who would that be from?

713
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:24,315
- Anonymous. Strange. huh?

714
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:26,317
And one of my adjustors
remembers someone calling him

715
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:29,487
poking around in one
my settlements, too.

716
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:32,114
So you want to
know what I think?

717
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:35,201
I think you stole
yourself a promotion.

718
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,121
- Thanks.

719
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:41,123
- I don't really give
a shit what you think

720
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:43,336
because you work
under me now, OK.

721
00:50:45,336 --> 00:50:49,507
- Nicholas doesn't
care about work.

722
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:52,344
And then you show up here
with some dirty chick.

723
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:57,139
I'm worried that you're having
some psychological problems.

724
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,476
- Andrea has got
more going on for her

725
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,393
than you ever will, Mitchell.

726
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:11,905
Lose sleep over that.

727
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:14,284
- Well, this is nice, huh.

728
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:19,161
- So Nicholas,
where'd you two meet?

729
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,458
- A thrift shop?

730
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:27,336
- Actually, I was doing
a runway and Nicholas

731
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:29,173
was in the front row
waving a paper fan.

732
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:33,010
- Andrea's an artist,
actually, and she's quite good.

733
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,427
A lot of people want
to buy her stuff.

734
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,222
- I work at a metal shop mostly.

735
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,264
- I guess you're right Nick,

736
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:39,016
she does have a lot
going for her.

737
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,934
- Pardon?

738
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:43,188
- We can, we can cut
this short if you'd like.

739
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:50,235
- Excuse me, hi, sorry, can
I get a doggy bag please?

740
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,028
And also, if you could
just go around and wrap up

741
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:58,367
any other food you're going to
throw out tonight, thank you.

742
00:51:58,367 --> 00:52:00,411
- Is that for your dog?

743
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:05,208
Or yourself, or both?

744
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,418
- What's this guy's deal?

745
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,211
If you have something
to say, mister,

746
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,380
you just go right
ahead and say it.

747
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,385
- OK, you're way
out of your league.

748
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:19,304
Looks, style, obviously
social graces.

749
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,516
- You mean the kind of
social graces that include

750
00:52:21,516 --> 00:52:23,393
insulting strangers.

751
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:26,396
- You know, you two have
made this nice reception

752
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:29,273
just that much worse.

753
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:31,400
Some self awareness
can go a long way.

754
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,445
- Not really all
that hard to figure out

755
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:35,612
yourself, are you?

756
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,407
Sort of a cult of personality.

757
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,992
Always subtly but constantly
manipulating people

758
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:42,244
into revering you, and
underneath all that shiny,

759
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:45,289
it's really just a mess
of ego and insecurity.

760
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:48,460
A womanizer who probably
needs constant reassurance

761
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,585
in the bedroom.

762
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:52,297
- Well you'll never
find that out, so.

763
00:52:53,297 --> 00:52:55,507
- Unless I rejected you
at first, and then you'd

764
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:58,344
pursue me to exhaustion.

765
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:01,389
- And in the end be rejected
by the noble servant girl

766
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,224
as the townsfolk cheered.

767
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,311
- No, you're hot, the
problem would be getting

768
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,686
rid of you afterwards.

769
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:10,106
That is what's so bizarre
about guys like you.

770
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:12,400
You have been given every
advantage and still manage

771
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,028
to turn out just being a
completely boring cliche.

772
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:17,655
Rockstar who checks into rehab.

773
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:20,699
See, the thing about us
ugly dumb poor people

774
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,327
is that maybe we have
excuses for being miserable

775
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:27,664
nasty human beings whereas
you are just a failure.

776
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:30,418
- Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

777
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:31,585
- Wouldn't be the first time.

778
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:32,586
- This has been interesting.

779
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:55,485
- Interesting. Bye.

780
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,570
Self portrait.

781
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,472
- It's nice.

782
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:27,726
- You look uncomfortable.

783
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,393
- No, actually I feel
better than

784
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:30,813
I have in a long time.

785
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:35,693
- Why do you hang
out with Harry?

786
00:54:37,693 --> 00:54:40,530
- You really don't
like him, huh?

787
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:43,282
He mentioned that you
guys used to go out.

788
00:54:43,282 --> 00:54:45,367
- We didn't go out,
we slept together,

789
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,536
and then I got to know him.

790
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:48,621
He's a criminal, you know.

791
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,418
- Harry?

792
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:56,588
- You should probably know
right now that I don't hang out

793
00:54:56,588 --> 00:55:01,467
with criminals, period.

794
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:03,302
- I'm thirsty, want some water?

795
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:04,512
- You have to go all
the way

796
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:06,431
down the hall into the bathroom
for water.

797
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:08,516
But I have oranges, if you
want to make orange juice.

798
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:09,728
- Yeah, sure.

799
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,563
- You know, I've known
Mitchell a long time,

800
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:15,525
but I've never seen him get
what you gave him last night.

801
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:20,737
- What is your great
attraction to guys like that?

802
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:22,655
- Who?

803
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:25,784
- Like Harry and Mitchell.

804
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:29,161
- What, they're polar opposites.

805
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,641
- Seem like the same guy to me.

806
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:16,737
- Why don't you
get a fucking job?

807
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:27,739
- Leave me alone.

808
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,699
- He said fuck you.

809
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,458
- Tax money fucking pays
for you, you piece of shit.

810
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,592
You got to pay
your fucking dues.

811
00:57:48,592 --> 00:57:50,679
- Fuck it man, let's go.

812
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,375
- Hey, you'd do the same
fucking thing to me.

813
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,605
- What the fuck?

814
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,900
- I don't care about Mitchell,
or Sara, or the office.

815
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,777
I've moved on.

816
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:30,655
I just want to keep going in
the direction that feels real.

817
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:34,827
- That's what I'd like
to see from you, too.

818
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:38,456
C'mon.

819
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:45,710
Well you know, I
think the true test

820
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:50,800
is to imagine
yourself in trouble.

821
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,635
Who do you turn to?

822
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:57,514
You were almost family
with those people.

823
00:59:57,514 --> 00:00:02,101
So the ties might run deeper
for you than you think.

824
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:07,565
You may be on a moral path,
Nick, but, as Kant says,

825
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:11,985
"Moral persons also
duty to themselves."

826
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,864
You know, you can take
back your self respect.

827
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:17,867
You have a choice to live
up here or live down here

828
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:22,916
with the Mitchells and
the Saras and the Karls.

829
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:29,088
You can punish the industry
that profits on fear,

830
01:00:31,088 --> 01:00:35,851
that sells back the comfort, a
commodity it doesn't even own

831
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:46,938
or score from Jasper, that
can make a real difference

832
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:48,148
at the cause.

833
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,815
- Same can't be said for

834
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:51,742
whomever made that phone call,
can it?

835
01:00:59,742 --> 01:01:03,496
- If we kept it,
maybe around 40 grand,

836
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:05,706
it wouldn't attract attention.

837
01:01:05,706 --> 01:01:06,958
- Tell me more.

838
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:09,835
- Claims super committee
have laid policies,

839
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:13,547
I can't start one from scratch,
but I can change the name

840
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:15,050
on an existing policy
and push that through

841
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,842
from the inside.

842
01:01:16,842 --> 01:01:20,137
Property claims would
probably be best.

843
01:01:20,137 --> 01:02:14,943
You can get a fake ID?

844
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,777
- What's all this?

845
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:19,989
- This is my life
insurance policy

846
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,827
and I figured that
Sara shouldn't be
named the beneficiary

847
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:27,831
so I, um, I changed it to you.

848
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,916
With any luck, I'll get hit
by a bus and

849
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:30,916
can just move to Saint Martin.

850
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,835
- That's very weird.

851
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:36,880
- I know, but it's a job
perk and it's prepaid

852
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,009
for five years, I
have to name someone.

853
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,219
You deserve a financial
break far more than she does.

854
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:43,637
- That's a million dollars.

855
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:45,601
- Pink goes to the beneficiary.

856
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,945
- OK, here's to your health.

857
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:01,074
- Are you Nicholas Gray?

858
01:03:03,074 --> 01:03:04,081
Mr. Jasper would like to
see you in his office.

859
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,884
- Nicholas, come in.

860
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:25,179
A file in our system
was recently altered
using this name.

861
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:27,813
This person doesn't exist.

862
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:38,735
Nick, at the end of the
day, a man is his work.

863
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,695
Now that might sound
old school to you,

864
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,655
but certain notions
are timeless.

865
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,117
Winners know this.

866
01:03:47,117 --> 01:03:48,916
Losers allow weakness in.

867
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,126
- Who's this from?

868
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:59,840
- Maybe someone trying
to save you from yourself.

869
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,300
- This was sent to you?

870
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,137
- Whatever you're mixed
up in, how dare you

871
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:07,764
drag my family into it?

872
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:10,141
How did you get so corrupt?

873
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:14,938
Are you out of your mind?

874
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:16,074
- You don't know
what corrupt is.

875
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,166
- Are you saying
that Andrea overheard us?

876
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:39,266
You know, Nicholas,
now you're free.

877
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,938
Alarm's on the right
hand side, 0126.

878
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:57,067
Shit.

879
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,652
I dropped the fucking key,
we're going

880
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:28,260
to need it to get back out, find
something to prop open the door.

881
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,847
You know this industry sucks.

882
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:33,110
You tell me they
don't deserve more.

883
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,407
Seal it up.

884
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:53,369
- I thought
you had it.

885
01:05:53,369 --> 01:05:54,244
- What?

886
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:55,413
- I thought you had it.

887
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:56,039
- I thought you had it.

888
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,000
- Shit, check
for windows or something.

889
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,507
- Fuck.

890
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:09,802
There's nothing, I'm stuck.

891
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:11,222
- I don't
know what to do.

892
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:13,264
- Go.

893
01:06:14,264 --> 01:06:14,264
- Sure?

894
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:15,916
- Run.

895
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,295
- Hey, how you doing?

896
01:06:45,295 --> 01:06:47,427
You know, I had to tell them I
was family to get visitation?

897
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,304
Did you answer any questions?

898
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,847
- No.

899
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,306
- Did you see a lawyer?

900
01:06:56,306 --> 01:06:58,851
- Duty counsel, and
they handle it at first,

901
01:06:58,851 --> 01:07:00,228
and then I have
to find a lawyer.

902
01:07:00,228 --> 01:07:01,021
- Do you want me to
face this with you?

903
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:04,106
- No, it wouldn't help us.

904
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:05,275
- Admirable.

905
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:07,402
You feel sorry for what you did?

906
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:09,154
- No.

907
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:11,155
- No, because you weren't
wrong and they can't

908
01:07:11,155 --> 01:07:13,199
take that away from you.

909
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,201
They're going to try to
take other things, fines,

910
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:18,246
restitution for the damage,
they got the upper hand

911
01:07:18,246 --> 01:07:21,291
right now, but the
fight's not over.

912
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,126
You just remember what I
told you about my friend.

913
01:07:24,126 --> 01:07:27,922
When he got arrested, about
him hiding his assets.

914
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:30,090
He transferred them
out of his name.

915
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,135
The condo, the car,
investments, everything.

916
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:34,429
You can do that.

917
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:35,929
If you're in the right,

918
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,349
why should you have to pay
anything?

919
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:40,268
When you have nothing,
you get legal aid for free.

920
01:07:40,268 --> 01:07:43,896
Look, everything you need
is right here, alright?

921
01:07:43,896 --> 01:07:45,356
You can request
your bail hearing.

922
01:07:45,356 --> 01:07:47,275
We put over 48 hours, that
will give me enough time

923
01:07:47,275 --> 01:07:49,152
to transfer everything.

924
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:52,155
Unless, of course, there's
someone else you want to name

925
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:53,492
power of attorney.

926
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:58,048
Or they win Nick, you lose.

927
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,341
- It's Nicholas.

928
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:57,405
I'm heading out of town now.

929
01:09:16,405 --> 01:09:17,617
- Detectives,

930
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:21,413
we found the kitchen
knife in the trees.

931
01:09:24,413 --> 01:09:26,252
- Thanks.

932
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:30,462
- You got it open?

933
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:31,462
- Yeah.

934
01:09:31,462 --> 01:09:32,463
- What do you got?

935
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:35,050
Yup, that's the victim's car.

936
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,217
- Nothing inside,
insurance up to date.

937
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:39,054
Only thing I noticed was
an ownership transfer

938
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:41,264
about a year and a
half ago for a dollar.

939
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:42,398
- We'll, follow
up on it. Good Job.

940
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:52,359
- How are you, Nicholas?

941
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:54,444
- Has bail been posted?

942
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,488
- Still nothing.

943
01:09:57,488 --> 01:09:59,252
Are you certain your friend
was going to post for you?

944
01:10:11,252 --> 01:10:13,505
- Mr. Gray, you
have demonstrated absolutely

945
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:15,090
no remorse for your actions.

946
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,675
In fact, you stand by them .

947
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:19,426
Society cannot tolerate
your brand of radicalism.

948
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:21,220
- What the fuck?

949
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,305
- Do you know
what's good for society?

950
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:27,143
You sir, shall be incarcerated
for a period of 18 months.

951
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:29,104
A stand alone restitution
order in favor of

952
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:31,523
Mathis-Miller
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated

953
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:32,365
shall be entered
into the record.

954
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:42,492
- When I first saw
you, for a

955
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,704
second I thought you were
coming for me.

956
01:10:46,704 --> 01:10:48,667
What good would that do, right?

957
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:53,712
Look, here's the deal.

958
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:57,340
You need help, I'm going
to give you that help

959
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,551
because at the end of
the day, guys like us,

960
01:11:00,551 --> 01:11:03,512
we should stick together.

961
01:11:03,512 --> 01:11:09,519
But, we are moving
into a tricky area.

962
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:11,354
So you're going to pay
me a hundred grand.

963
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,731
And we do it my way.

964
01:11:13,731 --> 01:11:15,483
Any idiot can kill someone.

965
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:20,363
The art is in killing
and getting away with it.

966
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,323
I mean, you're the first person

967
01:11:22,323 --> 01:11:25,577
they're going to look at, man,
you've got to send them in
another direction.

968
01:11:25,577 --> 01:11:27,203
I happen to know there's
a policy between you

969
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:29,747
and your old girlfriend, Andrea.

970
01:11:29,747 --> 01:11:32,505
You know I can
change that policy.

971
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:39,844
- She really got
to you, didn't she?

972
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:44,679
- I don't feel
anything about her.

973
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:47,556
That's the point.

974
01:11:47,556 --> 01:11:48,766
I mean, someone's
got to

975
01:11:48,766 --> 01:11:50,601
take the hit,
why should it be you?

976
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,560
Why not her?

977
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,479
I mean, what's the difference?

978
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:55,859
It's the only safe way there is.

979
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:00,403
What else?

980
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:02,167
You're going to let some
jerk off take your spot?

981
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,542
- Thanks, I'll call
you when I'm done.

982
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:19,546
Marsh, I'm in the victim's
condo, and he has a

983
01:12:19,546 --> 01:12:22,425
life insurance
policy and a will.

984
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:24,594
The beneficiary on the
will is Nicholas Gray,

985
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:26,637
the same guy that
used to own the car.

986
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:29,349
But his address is listed
to this same condo.

987
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:30,641
He might be staying
on the sofa bed,

988
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:32,435
I'm going to leave
my card for him.

989
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:35,604
With the policy, the
beneficiary is an Andrea Bially

990
01:12:35,604 --> 01:12:38,233
on East 43rd.

991
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:41,235
I'll come pick you up and
then we'll go see her.

992
01:12:41,235 --> 01:12:42,533
OK, bye.

993
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:50,828
Here's the cash, docs.

994
01:12:50,828 --> 01:12:54,623
From the corner store
so they're untraceable.

995
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:56,284
And in Sara's junk drawer,
like you said.

996
01:13:30,284 --> 01:13:31,454
- Is that blood?

997
01:13:33,454 --> 01:13:34,707
- Hi.

998
01:13:36,707 --> 01:13:40,545
- Mrs. Bially, you don't know
why that knife is missing?

999
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:43,506
According to this policy,
you stand to collect

1000
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:45,800
quite the chuck of money.

1001
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,720
I don't imagine you're
confused by that.

1002
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,889
- And another piece of
bad news is I suspect

1003
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:52,266
we found your missing knife.

1004
01:13:54,266 --> 01:13:54,313
- What?

1005
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,731
Well, I didn't kill anybody.

1006
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:02,524
This isn't, this is wrong.

1007
01:14:02,524 --> 01:14:05,444
I have a paper,
um, and it's pink.

1008
01:14:05,444 --> 01:14:06,456
It's pink.

1009
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,664
Let me look again.

1010
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:19,708
- Calm down, Andrea,
we'll check it out

1011
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,377
with the insurance company.

1012
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:23,381
- Get these fucking
things off me.

1013
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,926
- I have a policy,
Harry Price,

1014
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,512
and beneficiary, Andrea Bailey.

1015
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:34,807
- Bially.

1016
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:36,685
- Yeah, yeah, Bially.

1017
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:37,685
Yeah, what you have

1018
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:38,811
is what we have in our system.

1019
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:40,689
Is she a suspect?

1020
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,356
- She is.

1021
01:14:42,356 --> 01:14:43,024
- Wow, that's another mil
we won't have to pay out.

1022
01:14:44,024 --> 01:14:45,652
My boss will be
happy about that.

1023
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:47,695
- Is there any chance her
name could have been switched

1024
01:14:47,695 --> 01:14:50,657
from one policy to
another by mistake?

1025
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:53,576
- No, no the claims
super double checks

1026
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:55,578
any beneficiary change with
the client, and then enters

1027
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:57,788
in the master files himself.

1028
01:14:57,788 --> 01:14:59,957
- So not everyone has
access to master files?

1029
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:03,545
- Correct, only the
super can make changes.

1030
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,921
- We learned that Nicholas
Gray used to work here,

1031
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:07,800
as a claim super I believe.

1032
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,801
- Yeah, yeah, that's correct.

1033
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:12,554
He was fired.

1034
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:13,595
I'm afraid we don't
really have good things

1035
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:15,347
to say about him.

1036
01:15:15,347 --> 01:15:16,765
Why do you ask?

1037
01:15:16,765 --> 01:15:18,810
- How long ago was he fired?

1038
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,479
- A year and a half ago?

1039
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:23,480
- Before the date when
this paper was generated.

1040
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,859
- Yeah, yeah, I note all
of my changes and nothing

1041
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:28,069
on this file was ever changed.

1042
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:30,739
- Andrea has to be lying.

1043
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:34,375
- Well If I killed somebody,
I'd probably be lying, too.

1044
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,792
- Let me ask you this, Marsh.

1045
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,796
Who takes a cab to murder
someone as the beneficiary

1046
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:49,798
in their life insurance
policy, uses their own knife,

1047
01:15:49,798 --> 01:15:51,426
and then throws it in the trees?

1048
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,636
- Someone like her?

1049
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:56,765
- The thing is, when she
says she didn't do it,

1050
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,807
I believe her.

1051
01:15:58,807 --> 01:16:00,976
There's just something
about people like her,

1052
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:04,451
it's like they don't
know how to lie.

1053
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,037
- Well, everything's legal.

1054
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:21,413
There's no way to forcibly
transfer your assets back.

1055
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:23,707
Now, because the power
of attorney was misused,

1056
01:16:23,707 --> 01:16:25,835
you could consider suing, but...

1057
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:27,878
- I don't care about my assets.

1058
01:16:27,878 --> 01:16:29,631
I wanted to ask you
about something else.

1059
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:33,635
Now I want to start
a new lifestyle.

1060
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:35,136
Do you think the drug
company is going to

1061
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:36,637
try to go after me?

1062
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:39,682
- Civilly? No.

1063
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,475
They allowed the
restitution to be stayed,

1064
01:16:41,475 --> 01:16:42,894
I doubt they have
any further interest.

1065
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:44,729
From the start I think
they just wanted this

1066
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:46,773
whole thing to go away.

1067
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:50,694
I suggest you hang on
to this in case you

1068
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:52,543
change your mind about suing.

1069
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:09,753
- Thanks.

1070
01:17:09,753 --> 01:17:15,844
- You're welcome.

1071
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:16,802
- Yes?

1072
01:17:16,802 --> 01:17:19,680
- Comfortable, Harry?

1073
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,935
- Nicholas,
hey how was prison?

1074
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:27,855
- Lots of time to
read, to think.

1075
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:30,734
- Uh huh, well I'm
afraid I can't let you up.

1076
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:32,569
You down there and me
up here is no less valid

1077
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:34,863
than the opposite, is it?

1078
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:37,948
- A dilettante concerned
with validity,
that's good, Harry.

1079
01:17:37,948 --> 01:17:40,118
- Life can feel like
a punch in the face, can't it?

1080
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:42,078
You felt it that party night.

1081
01:17:42,078 --> 01:17:43,954
You can think me a con man.

1082
01:17:43,954 --> 01:17:45,789
But I didn't lie about
the moral doctrine.

1083
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:47,583
I just don't choose it.

1084
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:50,045
To me, life is a conquest of
the weak, like Nietzsche said.

1085
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:51,755
That's you, Nick.

1086
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:54,506
And on we go, through
history like rats on a wheel.

1087
01:17:54,506 --> 01:17:56,926
- It's very convenient for you.

1088
01:17:56,926 --> 01:17:58,761
- Look around you, Nick.

1089
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:01,597
Exploitation and appropriation,
mostly disguised,

1090
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:03,850
sometimes tied up
with a big red bow.

1091
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,603
And on a practical note,
if you try to sue me,

1092
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,605
I'll spend every dime of
your money on lawyers.

1093
01:18:09,605 --> 01:18:12,192
- I don't care about my
assets, you did me a favor.

1094
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:14,527
I'm going to complete
what I started.

1095
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:18,992
A pure path, a path that
you're too weak to travel.

1096
01:18:20,992 --> 01:18:22,786
- Or you can't admit
that you actually do care

1097
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:24,078
about your assets because
then you'd have to admit

1098
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:25,913
that I won.

1099
01:18:25,913 --> 01:18:28,750
And that burns in you,
doesn't it Nick?

1100
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,085
Losing.

1101
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,170
Isn't that why you
came here today?

1102
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:34,088
To tell me you're going
to best me in the end?

1103
01:18:34,088 --> 01:18:36,800
If not, Nick, why are you here?

1104
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,801
I know what you read in prison.

1105
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:40,177
I know what you thought about.

1106
01:18:40,177 --> 01:18:41,805
You're trying to
change the game.

1107
01:18:41,805 --> 01:18:43,806
But there's only one game,
and we're both playing

1108
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:44,974
by the same rules.

1109
01:18:44,974 --> 01:18:46,975
I know you, and you know me.

1110
01:18:46,975 --> 01:18:49,145
You just don't
know yourself yet.

1111
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:50,021
Because you're weak.

1112
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:53,275
- When I get to where I'm going

1113
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:59,159
I'll be free, Harry, truly free.

1114
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,627
- Hey, Nicholas.

1115
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:13,962
The first thing you'll find out

1116
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:15,851
is that it gets cold
out there at night.

1117
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:32,840
- Persons of vice are doomed
to live with themselves.

1118
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,716
Movincent Glacier?

1119
01:20:00,716 --> 01:20:02,886
I bought the motorcycle
and took it on a trip.

1120
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:04,804
- A little cold for that, now?

1121
01:20:04,804 --> 01:20:06,180
- Not if you do it right.

1122
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,890
- You were there for a week?

1123
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:08,932
- Weekend.

1124
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:10,268
- Did you meet anybody?

1125
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:13,063
Anybody that can
confirm you were there?

1126
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:16,106
- Not really, I could dig
up a few receipts, though,

1127
01:20:16,106 --> 01:20:17,649
if you'd like.

1128
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:18,027
- Can you tell us why

1129
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:20,779
you're the sole beneficiary in
Harry Price's will?

1130
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:23,989
- He hid my assets for
me to avoid restitution.

1131
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:26,076
You're aware that
I was in prison?

1132
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,284
- We are.

1133
01:20:27,284 --> 01:20:31,163
So this condo's actually yours?

1134
01:20:31,163 --> 01:20:33,291
- The will was just a backup.

1135
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:35,251
- Well, when you're planning
on switching the assets

1136
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,753
back into your name?

1137
01:20:37,753 --> 01:20:40,923
- I was going to keep a low
profile for a little while.

1138
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:44,260
I was unsure about any
civil action that might be

1139
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,304
taken for the restitution.

1140
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:49,724
- Do you know why Andrea
Bially was named beneficiary

1141
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:52,101
in Harry's life
insurance policy?

1142
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:53,895
- They used to date.

1143
01:20:53,895 --> 01:20:56,064
- Are you aware of any
problems between them?

1144
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,152
- She had money problems, yeah.

1145
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:03,157
- And she used to date you, too.

1146
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:08,283
- On Sunday afternoon,
a cab dropped Andrea

1147
01:21:08,283 --> 01:21:11,162
near the murder scene
around the time of death.

1148
01:21:11,162 --> 01:21:13,081
She says that you called her,
asked her to meet her there,

1149
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,957
and then didn't show.

1150
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:17,127
She also claims that she's
the beneficiary in your

1151
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:19,337
life insurance
policy, not Harry's.

1152
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:21,046
The names got switched.

1153
01:21:21,046 --> 01:21:23,719
Why do you think she'd
say these things?

1154
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,139
- She must want me to help her.

1155
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:31,890
- Well, she seemed confident
you'd back up her story.

1156
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:34,144
Very confident.

1157
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,186
Makes you wonder if
someone could fake

1158
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:38,148
that degree of conviction.

1159
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:40,900
- It does, doesn't it?

1160
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,819
- What if I were to tell
you that Andrea received

1161
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:46,033
a call on Sunday and it
came from this number?

1162
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:50,159
- Then I would say that it
was Harry that made the call.

1163
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,203
We were both living here.

1164
01:21:52,203 --> 01:21:53,038
Then he met her on the beach.

1165
01:21:54,038 --> 01:21:57,042
- But I don't think that's what
you found in those records.

1166
01:21:57,042 --> 01:22:00,837
If it was me who called Andrea,
I would've called from a

1167
01:22:00,837 --> 01:22:02,384
pay phone, wouldn't I?

1168
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:14,184
- Yes, you would have.

1169
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:17,145
- Mitchell, come
in and have a seat.

1170
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,065
You know detectives
Marsh and Bell?

1171
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:22,025
We've just been having a
rather sordid discussion

1172
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:26,070
about the murder of
one of our clients.

1173
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,988
Harry Price.

1174
01:22:27,988 --> 01:22:29,823
The detectives are
investigating the possibility

1175
01:22:29,823 --> 01:22:32,243
that his policy was altered.

1176
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:33,787
And you're the only person
that could've altered it.

1177
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:35,329
Did you?

1178
01:22:35,329 --> 01:22:38,420
- No, no sir.

1179
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,841
- Fine, the policy
was not altered.

1180
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:49,051
- What, that's it?

1181
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:50,427
- Detectives, we
are a large company

1182
01:22:50,427 --> 01:22:52,055
with an excellent reputation.

1183
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:54,265
There is no internal
fraud or corruption

1184
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:56,100
at Jasper Insurance.

1185
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,228
- Mr. Jasper, we can have
your records subpoenaed.

1186
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:02,064
- You can, but I assure
you that would be a waste

1187
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:04,109
of our time, and yours.

1188
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:05,435
You're not going to find
what you're looking for.

1189
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:40,896
- What
the hell was that?

1190
01:23:42,896 --> 01:23:44,337
And what do we do
about Andrea Bially?

1191
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:48,341
- Right and wrong.

1192
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:54,055
Right and wrong is everywhere.

1193
01:24:57,055 --> 01:25:00,604
In the air, on your neighbor's
face, under your skin.

1194
01:25:05,604 --> 01:25:07,564
And if fate peels back that skin

1195
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:12,195
and you're made to see
yourself clearly in the world,

1196
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:18,993
to then look back can be
the ultimate punishment.
