1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,529
Stop, Howl! It's a trap!

2
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,873
Hold on!

3
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,384
Sophie, sit up here!

4
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,063
Did you have to bring those two with you?

5
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,661
Nice doggie.

6
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,395
I can't believe you work for Suliman.

7
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,199
I guess it's too late to toss him.

8
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,530
Sophie, take the wheel!

9
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:15,175
What?! I can't fly, are you kidding?!

10
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,801
They're gaining on us.

11
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:25,216
I'll distract them. Then, you can fly this thing
back to my castle in the Wastes.

12
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:27,151
How? I don't know the way!

13
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,149
Hey, don't worry.
The ring that I gave you will guide you back home.

14
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,823
All you have to do, is summon Calcifer with your heart.

15
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,486
Calcifer?

16
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:38,925
It's glowing.

17
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:43,204
Just keep following that light
and you should be there before dark.

18
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:46,730
I can't do this!
Why did you make me come here, if you were coming yourself?

19
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:49,210
Knowing you'd be there gave me the courage to show up.

20
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,045
That woman terrifies me,
I can't face her on my own.

21
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,640
You've saved me, Sophie.
I was in big trouble back there.

22
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,177
Don't let go!

23
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,590
- Wow, you're good.
- Are you nuts?!

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,461
We've got a good lead now.

25
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,032
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
so use it wisely.

26
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,840
Howl!

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,340
Good luck!

28
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,919
No, not now.

29
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:38,849
Thank you.
That was the most fun I've had in ages.

30
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:42,297
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

31
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:45,360
I bet his "mother" can help me find him.

32
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:38,982
Almost there,
that's my hometown below us!

33
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:45,352
Don't try to be cute, dog,
I'm still not going to trust you.

34
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:11,352
The castle is coming to meet us.

35
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,555
Sophie! Here!

36
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,154
Markl, help me!

37
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,361
How am I supposed to land this thing?!

38
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,209
Sophie.

39
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,636
Nice doggie.

40
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,650
Markl.

41
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:43,948
I'm home.

42
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,610
Are you hurt?

43
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:47,988
I missed you!

44
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:51,325
I missed you too,
thanks for coming to meet us.

45
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:24,484
Oh, this is bad, you've gone too far, Howl.

46
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,280
I wonder if Howl's back home.

47
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:41,061
Howl?

48
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,293
Howl? Is that you?

49
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,670
Are you in pain?
Tell me what's happening.

50
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,473
Go away.

51
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,200
No, I'm not going away.

52
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,812
I'm going to help you break
the spell that you're under.

53
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:02,113
You... you can't even break your own spell.

54
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:06,918
- But you don't understand, I love you!
- You're too late.

55
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,456
Howl! No!

56
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,133
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

57
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:31,836
Yeah, and he looks terrible.
You better figure out, how to break the spell on us, quick.

58
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:34,440
Howl is running out of time,
I hope you realize that.

59
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:36,979
You mean he'll become a monster, is that it?

60
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:41,046
I can't tell you the details of the curse, lady,
you should know that by now, c'mon.

61
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,989
Do you know what madam Suliman said?

62
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:48,096
She said that Howl's heart was stolen by a demon.

63
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,230
- Tell me now, what do you know?
- I'm so sorry, but that would be confidential information.

64
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,859
What if I dump a bucket of water on you?

65
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,700
If you drown me,
then Howl will die too.

66
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,117
Hi Turnip-head.

67
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:22,364
This isn't gonna be easy.

68
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,593
'Kay! Ready!

69
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:31,102
All right! Calcifer, open it wider.

70
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:34,737
Here we go!

71
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,486
I said move...

72
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:16,983
If I just hang a little curtain here,
maybe Howl won't notice.

73
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,585
Come on in, it's time to eat!

74
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,556
Here, want some more?

75
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,430
Don't feed her, that's the Witch of the Waste.

76
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,236
Oh, she's all right.

77
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,463
She keeps staring at me,
it's freaking me out...

78
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,037
What a pretty fire.

79
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:45,138
- Howl, hello.
- Good morning, everyone.

80
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,508
- Glad you're home.
- Master Howl, we can keep this dog, can't we?

81
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,786
The Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog at my table?

82
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,518
What possessed you to let them in my house, Calcifer?

83
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,787
I didn't let them in!
Sophie crash landed her plane into my face!

84
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,460
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

85
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,600
Looks like we have yet another addition to the family.

86
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,065
You've got a quite nasty spell on you too, huh?

87
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,971
Seems everyone in this family's got problems...

88
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:16,370
What a handsome man.

89
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,037
So! We've got a lot of work to do.
We're moving!

90
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:21,246
Moving?

91
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:24,546
That's good. I'm sick of being stuck out here,
in the middle of nowhere.

92
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:28,420
Madam Suliman is hot on our trail,
so we're gonna have to hurry.

93
00:11:28,524 --> 00:11:32,820
I'm afraid your spell is too strong for this move.
You're gonna have to stay behind.

94
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,492
There, all done.

95
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,498
All right, Calcifer, line her up!

96
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,747
There, that should do it.

97
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:01,446
Sit tight for a second.

98
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,993
Be gentle with me, please...

99
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,658
On my mark.

100
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,942
Moving's done,
you can get down now.

101
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,578
This is great, master Howl,
it's huge.

102
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,613
Oh, what a pretty fire.

103
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:21,869
But this is...

104
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:25,762
I added on a bathroom,
since our family seems to keep growing.

105
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:27,765
Come over here, Sophie!

106
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,440
I added another bedroom, too.
Have a look.

107
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,656
Why'd you... do this?

108
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:51,091
So we'd have a room that suited you.
Do you like it?

109
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,866
Of course.
It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

110
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,972
I got you some new clothes, too,
but you can open them later.

111
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,537
Come on, Sophie!
Look at this!

112
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,678
All Right! A courtyard!

113
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,480
That shop's ours, too.

114
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:08,809
Heen, c'mon!

115
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,680
See that new colour on the dial?
There's a new portal.

116
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:18,822
It's a present for you.
Come see.

117
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:46,143
You like it?
It's my secret garden.

118
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,279
It's incredible.

119
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:52,889
Did you use your magic to make this?

120
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:56,094
Only a little, just to help the flowers grow.

121
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,131
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

122
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,366
It's like a dream.

123
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,561
Sophie?

124
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,898
It all seems so familiar,
yet I know I've never been her before.

125
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:41,275
I feel so at home.

126
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:43,002
- Come with me.
- 'Kay
814
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,366
Look there!

127
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,461
- What a cute cottage.
- That was my secret hideaway.

128
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:04,860
I spent a lot of time here, by myself,
when I was young.

129
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:08,734
You were alone?

130
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:13,035
My uncle, who was a wizard,
gave me this place as my private study.

131
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,876
And now you can come here whenever you like.

132
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:20,737
What's the matter?

133
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,173
It's...

134
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,609
You're scareing me,
I have this weird feeling that you're going to leave.

135
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,585
Howl, tell me what's going on.

136
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,626
Please, I don't care if you're a monster.

137
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:42,762
I'm just setting things up,
so that all of you can live a comfortable life, Sophie.

138
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:47,368
With all the flowers you've got in this valley,
you could easily open up a flower shop.

139
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,007
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

140
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,337
So you are going away...

141
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,007
Please, Howl, I know I can be of help to you.

142
00:16:57,285 --> 00:17:01,385
Even though I'm not pretty
and all I'm good at is cleaning...

143
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,417
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

144
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,293
Well, the nice thing about being old
is you've nothing much to lose...

145
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,378
What is that thing doing out here?

146
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:30,507
- A battleship?
- Still looking for more cities to burn...

147
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:34,055
- Is it the enemy's or one of ours?
- What difference does it make?

148
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:47,928
Those stupid murderers...

149
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,974
We can't just let them fly off with all those bombs.

150
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,423
What's happening?

151
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:16,921
What did you do?

152
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,825
Just messed with it,
it won't crash though.

153
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,201
Howl!

154
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,764
Uh-oh... Here they come.

155
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:39,511
Those things are Suliman's henchmen.
Let's go!

156
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,049
Faster, we need to take off!

157
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,465
All right, you're going in!

158
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,470
No! Don't let go!

159
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,309
Sophie? What happened?

160
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,447
I'm too old to be treated like this!

161
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,095
Good night, Sophie.

162
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:26,595
Good night, Markl.

163
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:33,098
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.
Sometimes, he likes to go away for days on end.

164
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,600
Thank you, that's good to know.

165
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:38,176
- Need anything else?
- No, I'm fine.

166
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,174
Well, good night then.

167
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:41,714
You're in love.

168
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:47,985
Don't deny it,
you've been sighing all day.

169
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:01,429
Just as I thought.

170
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,001
Have you ever in love before?

171
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,039
Of course I have.
I'm still in love.

172
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,410
Strapping, young men are so difficult to deal with,
but their hearts I just adore.

173
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,216
You're terrible.

174
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:19,209
And they're so cute, too.

175
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:24,091
What's that?

176
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,522
It's an air raid siren.

177
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,625
Air raid?

178
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:32,924
It's a long way's off,
but you better not go outside tonight, dear.

179
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,831
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen are looking
everywhere for this place.

180
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:46,037
What a good fire.
He keeps this house so well hidden.

181
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:23,748
Sophie, there's a strange lady in here!

182
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,326
Mother?

183
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,753
Sophie!

184
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,223
Thank goodness you're here!
I searched everywhere for you!

185
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:43,263
Oh my, look at your face, you're so old!

186
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,863
Everyone’s saying it's my fault that you left.

187
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:50,633
You'll forgive me, oh won't you?
Oh, Sophie.

188
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,178
Mother...

189
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,147
I barely recognize the place.

190
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,847
Who is that woman?

191
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,977
Huh? The landlady?

192
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:04,318
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I got married again.

193
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:09,154
He's such a nice man and he's filthy rich, too,
so we can all live together again.

194
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,932
You won't have to work as a cleaning lady anymore.

195
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,627
That's all right, mother,
I actually like living here.

196
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,260
Really?

197
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:18,429
I forgot.

198
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:21,101
I've got a car waiting,
I've got to run.

199
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,872
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

200
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,321
A peeping-bug?
Can't Suliman do better than that?

201
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:45,022
Open wide, Cal.

202
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:56,507
I hope you and your new husband will be very happy.

203
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:59,838
- Thank you, Sophie. Bye.
- Bye, mother.

204
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:06,881
I did what I was told,
now take me to my husband.

205
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,922
Yes ma'am, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be very pleased with your.

206
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:13,923
Forgive me, Sophie...

207
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,398
Oh, look at all of them.

208
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:23,332
If they keep leaving at this rate,
the town will soon be empty.

209
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,901
- Do you want to leave, too, Sophie?
- What?

210
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,901
That lady said she wants you to live with her now.

211
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:32,676
Yes, well...
At least she cared enough to visit.

212
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,514
Don't leave, Sophie!

213
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,882
I love you,
you have to stay...

214
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:43,488
I love you, too, Markl.
I'll stay.

215
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,921
Really?

216
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,417
'Cause we're a family now.

217
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,526
Yes, we're a family.

218
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,398
Thank you, Sophie.

219
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,468
I will never let Suliman
get a hold of Howl.

220
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,387
But the newspaper says we won.

221
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,327
Only idiots believe what they read in the paper.

222
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,994
That's so strange,
I can't get Calcifer going.

223
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:31,468
Do you have to keep smoking that?

224
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,162
It smells terrible.

225
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,310
Don't deny an old witch her pleasures, young lady.

226
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:38,809
Markl, will you crack a window, please?

227
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:45,181
I wouldn't open that window if I were you, dear.

228
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:49,484
Calcifer's too weak right now
to protect this place.

229
00:24:49,584 --> 00:24:51,684
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

230
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,386
Markl!

231
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:15,641
Markl, get back inside,
I'm gonna check on the shop.

232
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:38,596
There are bombs falling on us,
why won't you put out some fires instead?

233
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,894
Howl, no!

234
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:19,079
This is exciting.

235
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,256
Howl!

236
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,995
I'm sorry, Sophie,
I should've gotten here sooner.

237
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,463
You're alive.
Oh, thank goodness.

238
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,479
Master Howl! Sophie!
You're okay!

239
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,216
Calcifer, you hang in there now!

240
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:15,162
Tell me... Was that cigar a gift from Madam Suliman,
by any chance?

241
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:18,595
Howl, she fed me something gross, I feel sick.

242
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,606
Why, if it isn't Howl.

243
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,838
I think you and I need to have a nice,
long, heart-to-heart chat.

244
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,211
There's nothing I'd like more than that,
but right now there's a war going on.

245
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:35,015
How unlike you, Howl,
not running away anymore.

246
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:36,783
Until later, then.

247
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:40,585
Stay here,
Calcifer will protect you from the henchmen.

248
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,793
I'll stand guard out front.

249
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,763
No, wait, Howl!

250
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,494
Don't go out there!
It's too dangerous.

251
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:52,370
Another wave's coming
and Calcifer is too weak to stop the bombs.

252
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,705
Let's run,
don't fight them, Howl.

253
00:27:54,976 --> 00:27:57,701
Sorry, I've had enough of running away, Sophie.

254
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:01,173
And now, I've got something I wanna protect.

255
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:02,741
It's you.

256
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,544
Come back!

257
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,605
There's where we are at the shop.

258
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,472
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

259
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,821
Howl, look out!

260
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,666
What's going on?!
Turnip!

261
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,235
Markl, I need your help!

262
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:11,443
Are you crazy?
I can't move the portals without Howl's help.

263
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:14,944
You have to try, if we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting the hat shop.

264
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,974
I preferred him as a coward.

265
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,641
Okay, we have to go now.

266
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,509
Are we going for a stroll?

267
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:22,689
We can't do that,
it'll make us too vulnerable.

268
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,357
We already are! And if we don't move quick,
Howl doesn't have a chance.

269
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,755
Sophie!

270
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,192
They're about to bomb the hat shop!

271
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:32,166
Quick! Help her get outside, okay?

272
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,236
You coming with us,
hop on.

273
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:40,332
I can't! It's impossible,
no one, but Howl, can take me out of this hearth.

274
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,333
There's no time to lose, Calcifer,
we have to try something.

275
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,138
Don't do this!
No! No! No! Help! Help! Help! Help!

276
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,672
Crazy lady with a shovel! Don't!

277
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,943
If you take me out that door,
the castle could collapse!

278
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:51,849
Good!

279
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,287
- We're ready!
- Okay, step back.

280
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,759
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

281
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:03,491
I don't know what's gonna happen...
but I'm sure it won't be good.

282
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,556
I told you it would collapse.

283
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,592
Rain! Rain! Rain!

284
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,356
That ship's headed for town!

285
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,859
Markl, look after her, okay?

286
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,102
Turnip-head, help me find a way back in.

287
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,538
Don't you worry now, ma'am,
I'm gonna take good care of you.

288
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:52,638
Markl, here's a way in.

289
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,951
Please, oh ple-, uh, watch, the roof is leaking,
don't make it wet.

290
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,654
- Please, don't make it wet.
- Hold on for a second.

291
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,892
It's wet here, Sophie!

292
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:16,331
Too damp, too damp, damp, very damp here,
hu-hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, please.

293
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,574
Markl, hurry, get inside.

294
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,709
The castle's a wreck.

295
00:32:27,848 --> 00:32:31,609
Told you we should have stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

296
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:36,521
We have to tell Howl,
we're not attached to the hat shop now.

297
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,821
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

298
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:40,521
What?

299
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:44,522
I know you can do it,
I've never seen a fire with more spark.

300
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,164
But there's no chim-,
but there's no chimney here,

301
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:50,000
and I keep getting dripped on
and the wood's all damp...

302
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:54,904
They say that the best blaze brightest
when circumstances are at their worst.

303
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:57,472
Yeah, but no one really believes that...

304
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:58,671
Come on, let's be honest...

305
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,113
Uh, what a pretty fire.

306
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:02,476
Why don't you have a seat?

307
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:05,577
All right, I need something of yours, Sophie.

308
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:06,751
Why is that?

309
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:09,378
I can't do it by myself.
How about your eyes?

310
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:10,649
Huh?

311
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,220
How about this?

312
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:20,419
Thanks, Calcifer!
You're fantastic!

313
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,757
Imagine what I could have done with
your eyes or your heart.

314
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,899
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

315
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,095
I found it!

316
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:46,485
I can see Howl down there.
Looks like he's trapped.

317
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:53,387
Calcifer, hurry!

318
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:55,528
No!

319
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,297
Put it back!

320
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,193
Let go!

321
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,001
Howl's heart, it's mine!

322
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:15,081
Put it back, now!

323
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:20,750
- It's hot, hot! Burning me!
- Let go!

324
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:22,979
You're catching on fire!

325
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:26,450
No, it's mine! It's mine!

326
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,050
It's mine!

327
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,034
Sophie!

328
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:50,010
Sophie!

329
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:54,250
Sophie ruined it.
My heart's ruined.

330
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:41,358
Heen, what've I done?
I poured water on Calcifer.

331
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,835
What if I've killed Howl, too?

332
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,062
It's moving...
Is Howl still alive?

333
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,068
Can you lead me to him?

334
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,384
The front door...

335
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:00,673
Heen?

336
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,174
That's Howl...

337
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:58,387
I know where I am,
I'm in Howl's childhood.

338
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,308
Howl!
Calcifer!

339
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:25,106
It's me, Sophie!
I know how to help you now!

340
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:28,421
Find me in the future!

341
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:04,222
Sorry, Heen,
I'm trying to hurry.

342
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:06,450
I just can't seem to stop crying.

343
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:32,248
Howl.

344
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:41,693
I'm sorry...
Did I come too late?

345
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:44,624
I didn't mean to make you wait this long.

346
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:51,863
I need you to take me to Calcifer, if you can.

347
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:55,823
He's dead?

348
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,766
No, Markl.

349
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,605
Howl needs that back now.

350
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:07,238
Don't look at me, I don't have it,
I don't know what you're talking about.

351
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:08,648
Please.

352
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:12,317
Please give it back.

353
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,846
You really want it that badly?

354
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,117
Yes.

355
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,087
- All right then. You'd better take good care of it.
- 'Kay.

356
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:25,962
Here, dear.

357
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:29,497
Thank you, you have a big heart.

358
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:46,983
Calcifer.

359
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:50,717
Sophie, I'm so tired...

360
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:54,424
If I give Howl back his heart,
what will happen to you?

361
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:57,052
I'd be okay, if you do it, I think...

362
00:44:57,131 --> 00:45:01,695
I mean, you dumped water on me
and Howl and I both survived.

363
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:03,602
I'd better try then.

364
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:10,071
It’s so warm and fluttering like a bird.

365
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,571
It's still just the heart of a child.

366
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,372
Please... Help Calcifer live.

367
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:19,742
And please help Howl take back his heart.

368
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:32,565
I'm alive!

369
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,357
I'm alive! Look! I'm free! Free!

370
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:39,557
I'm alive, I tell you!

371
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,740
He moved! See?

372
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,044
I can't steer without Calcifer!

373
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:05,195
Turnip!

374
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:19,176
His pole snapped.

375
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:21,646
Are you all right?
We'll get you a new pole, okay?

376
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:26,085
You saved us, Turnip.

377
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,617
Thank you, Sophie.

378
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:38,924
I'm the prince,
who's been missing from the neighbouring kingdom.

379
00:46:39,065 --> 00:46:41,260
Somehow, I got that blasted spell put on me.

380
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:44,771
I know that spell.
A kiss, from your true love, breaks it.

381
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,199
That's right.

382
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:49,499
If it weren't for Sophie, I would've been
a scarecrow for the rest of my life!

383
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:52,012
My, what a stunning, young man, you are.

384
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:54,974
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

385
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:58,318
I feel terrible,
like there's a weight on my chest.

386
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:01,054
A heart's a heavy burden.

387
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:04,924
Wow, Sophie, your hair looks
just like starlight.

388
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:06,459
It's beautiful.

389
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,857
You think so?
So do I!

390
00:47:11,064 --> 00:47:13,700
Looks like your true love
is in love with someone else.

391
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,503
You should go home anyway,
and tell your king to stop this dumb war.

392
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:19,339
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

393
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:22,632
One thing you can always count on,
is that hearts change.

394
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,578
So as soon as this war is over,
I shall return.

395
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:28,248
I love it, when you talk like that.

396
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:30,984
I'll look forward to your return, big boy.

397
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:41,427
There you are.
You should've checked in earlier.

398
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,461
What on earth were you up to?

399
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:49,002
Howl found his true love.

400
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:50,829
You little traitor.

401
00:47:57,677 --> 00:47:59,579
The game is over.

402
00:47:59,946 --> 00:48:03,404
Get me the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Defence.

403
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:07,675
- It's time to put an end to this idiotic war.
- Yes, ma'am

404
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,088
Hey, it's Calcifer!

405
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:13,222
You didn't have to come back, Calcifer.

406
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:18,963
I kind of missed you guys,
and it looks like it's gonna rain...

407
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:21,524
I missed you too, Calcifer.

408
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:08,679
