1
00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,502
Carroll was convicted in 2004

2
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:05,877
for the murders
of 14 young women.

3
00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:07,299
We need you in Virginia, Ryan.

4
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:08,683
I'm not an agent anymore.

5
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,940
You caught Carroll.
No one knows him like you do.

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,736
So what's my sequel about, Joe?

7
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:14,860
We're gonna
write this together, Ryan.

8
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:16,133
Ohh!

9
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,314
Even though you
slept with my wife.

10
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:22,910
I have so many surprises
waiting for you.

11
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,350
He fancies
himself Edgar Allan Poe.

12
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,891
That was the impetus
for writing his novel.

13
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,210
We got more bodies.

14
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:30,316
He removed the eyes,
Carroll's signature.

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,857
He used this prison guard
to gain access to the internet

16
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:33,965
to create a cult.

17
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,734
Agent Parker's taking the lead.

18
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:37,880
Cults, my specialty.

19
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,745
Ice pick lady, gay neighbors,

20
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,402
and the nanny, how do they
figure into your new plot?

21
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,821
Where is he? Joey?
Where is my son?!

22
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,730
Carroll knows where the kid is.

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,834
He's not gonna tell us.

24
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,181
He might tell his wife.

25
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:53,558
You son of a bitch,
where's my son?

26
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:58,301
"Take thy beak
from out of my heart,

27
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:01,025
and take thy form
from off my door."

28
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:04,125
Quoth the raven "nevermore."

29
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,629
And the raven, never flitting,
still is sitting,

30
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:08,980
still is sitting...

31
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:10,002
If you don't like the piece,

32
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,712
call my editor, scream at him.

33
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,242
It is too early for this crap.

34
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:16,537
You have a nice day.

35
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,354
Lies floating on the floor

36
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:22,170
shall be lifted--
nevermore!

37
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,110
Hey!

38
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,868
Sync and corrections by n17t01

39
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:12,149
Good morning, Claire.

40
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:15,087
Aah!

41
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:25,059
Good morning, ma'am.

42
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,586
Is Ryan Hardy here?

43
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:29,604
No, ma'am.
He left over an hour ago.

44
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,152
How'd you sleep?
That motel they stuck us in sucks.

45
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:47,203
The bed is bricks.

46
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,249
How many fingerprints?

47
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,297
9 in total.
Several were older prints,

48
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,596
but upstairs in the attic room,

49
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:55,715
that is where we found 6 sets.

50
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,131
They're the newest
ones we found.

51
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:00,107
I'm guessing that's where
they gathered most.

52
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:03,847
4 of the sets belong to Emma,
Jacob, Paul, and Jordy.

53
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,292
Yeah. That's 4. The guy with
the Poe mask that attacked me.

54
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:08,137
5.

55
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,058
You really think that this
cult is limited to 6 people?

56
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,563
We weren't supposed to find
their little clubhouse.

57
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,043
I tell you, there's
got to be something here

58
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:19,084
that will tell us
where Joey Matthews is.

59
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,166
Uh-uh. I've been
through every piece of it.

60
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,155
Nothing points to where he
is or why they took him.

61
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,504
I want to understand
what this cult is about.

62
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,181
I mean, what's
Carroll's message?

63
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:31,051
Koresh, Jones, Manson--
they all used mind control

64
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:34,048
to reinforce their message of family
and unity over the individual.

65
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,566
Didn't Manson convince
his family to kill

66
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,114
for his own selfish needs?

67
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,779
Yeah, but he dressed it up in
several different motives at once.

68
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,968
He'd test his followers

69
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,714
with acts of murder in order
to prove their devotion.

70
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,437
He was a brilliant manipulator,

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,597
get anyone to do anything.

72
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:51,510
Joe was a teacher.

73
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:52,937
He was a man of ideas,

74
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,598
and he was brilliant at it.

75
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:55,893
I witnessed him at class

76
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:59,077
he could engage
and inspire his students

77
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:01,779
in ways that I'd
never seen before.

78
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,441
Hester had
broken free from all of that.

79
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:11,177
She had-- she had created
her own moral code.

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,084
Are we not able to break free
and-- and do whatever we want

81
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:23,017
as long as we are willing
to pay life's consequences?

82
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:27,543
What is-- what is
your moral code?

83
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:32,497
Make it unique unto yourself,

84
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,308
and it will bleed
into your writing.

85
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,099
Yeah.

86
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:42,332
Thank you.

87
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,463
How's your bedside manner?

88
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,612
Jordy's awake.

89
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:49,346
Hey, Jordy.
How you feeling?

90
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,253
How am I feeling?
You shot me.

91
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:52,700
Yeah. Sorry about that.

92
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,149
Tell us where Joey Matthews is.

93
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,891
Oh, is that all?

94
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,880
Do you think I'm stupid?

95
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:01,827
I'm not talking.

96
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,973
I think you're looking
at the death penalty.

97
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,174
I'll never make it
to the chair.

98
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,810
I'm a correctional officer.

99
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,033
I won't last a week in prison,

100
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,351
but can I tell you
a little secret?

101
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,876
It was worth it

102
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:19,336
to kill those girls,

103
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,789
to hold them in my
hands while they died,

104
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,327
felt their last breath.

105
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,056
You know I talked
to Joe, right?

106
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,774
He was very upset to find out
that you were still alive.

107
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,343
He wanted you dead.
You failed.

108
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,745
You were supposed to
kill Claire Matthews.

109
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,507
Weren't those the rules?

110
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,281
I know what you're doing.

111
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,865
It's not gonna work.

112
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,432
Come on, Jordy.

113
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:44,012
Where's Joey?

114
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:47,592
♪ La la la ♪

115
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,262

♪ Look at what's
happened to me ♪

117

122

Aah!

123
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,928
- Hey! - Sorry. I slipped.
- You can't do that!

124
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,633
You can't do that!

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,795
Hey! Hey!
No, no, no, no!

126
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,031
Sorry for the shaky cam.

127
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:12,825
- It's from a witness' cell.
- What are we watching?

128
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,335
Street performance
by a man dressed as Poe

129
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,340
early this morning.

130
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:16,484
Recognize the mask?

131
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,579
He was doing this
on the street?

132
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,639
It's very common.
It's the historical district,

133
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,782
and here it comes.

134
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,721
Hey. Wait.
Who's the victim?

135
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,922
Stan Fellows, book critic.

136
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,459
Yeah. Richmond paper.
I know this guy.

137
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:34,690
I interviewed him for my book.

138
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,574
He wrote a scathing review

139
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:38,229
of Carroll's book
"The Gothic Sea."

140
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,121
It was the worst I read.

141
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,066
Suspect threw
confetti on the crowd.

142
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:42,266
It's got writing on it.

143
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:44,263
"Generous Critic
fann'd the Poet's fire,

144
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,220
and taught the world
with reason to admire."

145
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,192
That's Poe.

146
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,578
So Carroll wants his followers

147
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,510
to exact revenge
on his critics?

148
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,330
That could take a while.

149
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,115
The recent string of murders

150
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,988
in the wake of Joe Carroll's
prison escape

151
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,285
is raising all kinds
of speculation.

152
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:00,937
Is this the work of a cult?

153
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:04,595
Hey. The press is
officially calling us a cult,

154
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,970
but the FBI won't confirm it,

155
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,043
so they've issued
a media blackout.

156
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,174
That's because they're
completely clueless.

157
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,723
Have you talked to Emma?

158
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,234
No. No. Why?

159
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,945
Things are weird
between you guys,

160
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:20,460
and to be fair, you haven't
been that nice to her.

161
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,862
Oh. Is that Rick?
Awesome!

162
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:27,184
Look. Here's some
cool footage of the fire.

163
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,477
So-- so torch man's
a hit, huh?

164
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,121
I knew it would work.

165
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,157
If you hate blood so
much, what about fire?

166
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,269
It's flashy.

167
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,817
I don't hate blood.

168
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,880
What about removing the eyes?

169
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,612
You can't do that with fire.

170
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,378
Actually you can, doofus.

171
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:49,283
What Jordy means is the
eyes are Joe's signature.

172
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:52,095
Fire doesn't go
with gouging eyes.

173
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:53,195
You're being literal.

174
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,603
Besides, we're supposed
to find our own voice,

175
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:59,420
not just copy Joe's story,
doofus deux.

176
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:00,892
I like Joe's story.

177
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,401
Then have at it, Jordy.

178
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,432
You do it your way,
I'll do it mine.

179
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,373
Just talk to Emma, okay?

180
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:12,018
You don't see it, do you?

181
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,963
I mean, that girl
wears a lot of faces.

182
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,294
I don't get the Emma you get.

183
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:19,099
What Emma is that, Paul?

184
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,098
Oh, we were just
talking--

185
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,724
Don't cover for him.

186
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,876
If he has something to say...

187
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,664
Forget it.

188
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,181
Hey, guys. We got him.

189
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,295
There's a business owner
downtown with a security camera

190
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:46,725
in an alley two blocks away.

191
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:48,040
Can you get a license plate?

192
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,409
Way ahead.

193
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:50,980
Car's registered to...

194
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:52,854
Rick Kester. He's 29.

195
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,333
120 Churchill.

196
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,383
This room is clear.

197
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,955
Clear.

198
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,163
Hey.

199
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,545
Aah!

200
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,319
Please don't hurt me.

201
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:47,749
We're not gonna hurt you.

202
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:48,913
Who are you?

203
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,802
Maggie Kester.
I live here.

204
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,779
- You know Rick Kester?
- Yes, I do. He's my husband.

205
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:01,744
Thank you for agreeing
to come down and talk to us.

206
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,981
Are you kidding?
I don't want to stay in that house alone.

207
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,940
When was the last time you
heard from your husband?

208
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,597
Last night.

209
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,953
He... called.
I didn't pick up.

210
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:13,403
We're separated.

211
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,413
6 months now.

212
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:17,773
Um...

213
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:22,491
7:15. He didn't
leave a message.

214
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,932
Why were you hiding from us?

215
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,722
I didn't know it was you.
I was scared.

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,044
He still has a key,

217
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:31,470
and he's been bothering me,
calling me,

218
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:32,915
showing up at work.

219
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:37,683
Rick can be... scary
when he wants to be.

220
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:41,326
We pulled your records,
and your story checks out,

221
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:44,702
but I'm curious
about this police report

222
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,573
that you filled out
a couple of years back

223
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,483
in the Emergency Room.

224
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:53,525
Why did your husband
try to kill you?

225
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,721
I asked him for a divorce.

226
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,532
So he took a knife to you?

227
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,390
Unh!

228
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,238
Ugh!

229
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,470
They never pressed charges.

230
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:24,240
I wouldn't testify
because he was sorry.

231
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:28,058
He was. He wasn't...
always like this.

232
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,354
When did you notice a change?

233
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:31,401
He lost his job
and had all this free time

234
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:35,219
and started hanging out
with these new friends.

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,303
Did you ever meet any of them?

236
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,348
No. I didn't want
anything to do with them.

237
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,050
He would come home
with these weird ideas

238
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:42,113
and saying crazy things.

239
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,134
What things?

240
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:44,579
He started talking
a lot about death,

241
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,819
how life didn't matter.

242
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:50,001
He got really dark.
He was depressed.

243
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,220
We're gonna give you protection

244
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,827
till we find your husband.

245
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,273
Excuse me.

246
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,473
So you believe her?

247
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,030
Yeah, I do.
She's tragic and pathetic,

248
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,411
and I know her well.

249
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:11,476
How so?

250
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:12,725
She wants the man in her head,

251
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:14,012
not the one she married.

252
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,302
She's my mother,
my sister, my other sister.

253
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,530
No one ever wants to see
what's really there.

254
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,279
We need to find the husband.

255
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:23,744
He's the closest thing
we have to finding Joey.

256
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,107
Why don't you let me
see Joe again,

257
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,605
see if I can get him to talk?

258
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:27,992
Let me try.

259
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,449
I think it's time
Joe and I met anyway.

260
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,089
What do you want, Paul?

261
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,635
You need any help?

262
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,198
No.

263
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:50,984
Look. I'm sorry

264
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,615
about before
and whatever I've done.

265
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:55,836
We're all in this together,

266
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:58,004
and I don't want things
to be like this.

267
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,658
I don't either, Paul.

268
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:03,675
Can we sort of pretend
that we like each other

269
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,531
and, I don't know, see
where that goes?

270
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,107
Truce?

271
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:17,447
Unh! You bitch!

272
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:19,696
Don't try to turn
Jacob against me.

273
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:21,406
It won't work.

274
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,325
Bitch!

275
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,702
Hi. I'm Agent Parker.

276
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,368
We haven't officially met.

277
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,817
How's your hand?

278
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,611
First of all, awesome job.

279
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,062
I'm very impressed.

280
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,811
How much planning
did all of this take?

281
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,191
Seriously, you are doing
a great job.

282
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,266
Thank you for my book.

283
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,112
You're welcome.

284
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:01,382
Why torch your critics?

285
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,192
That seems a little petty.

286
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,966
Oh, dear. Has someone been
playing with matches?

287
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,674
I like fire, sir.

288
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,998
It started when I was a
kid, and it just stuck.

289
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,402
I'm not good at knives.

290
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,434
I've been practicing
getting better,

291
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,729
but I still prefer fire.

292
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,573
Definitely makes a statement.

293
00:14:21,524 --> 00:14:23,059
Tell me more.

294
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:25,615
Poe often wrote of revenge.

295
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:29,013
I want my chapter
to be about revenge.

296
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,696
I want to target the people
who hurt you professionally.

297
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:37,094
I've done my research.
I know who they are.

298
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,968
I'm not above revenge, Agent.

299
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,331
I think I've proved that.

300
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:45,523
Revenge is primal.
It's a universal theme,

301
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:47,699
and every good story needs one.

302
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,489
Don't you agree, Ryan?

303
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:55,452
Of course, his theme...
somewhat different.

304
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,695
So your acolytes come up
with ways to make you proud

305
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,687
with these little tributes.

306
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:02,321
Is that the way they're
helping you write your book?

307
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,417
Right. Everyone has
a story to tell, Agent.

308
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:11,418
Your little devotee, is he
gonna torch all your critics?

309
00:15:11,548 --> 00:15:14,372
There are really only 3 people
that I hold accountable

310
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:17,618
for my professional
downfall, Agent.

311
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:20,057
Isn't that right, Ryan?

312
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:24,056
I wonder who he holds
accountable...

313
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,613
for his downfall.

314
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,572
Must be very hard for you

315
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:34,233
to be surrounded by the
stench of death again.

316
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:39,617
I know this takes
a terrible toll on you,

317
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,153
and you must be careful,

318
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,982
what with that...

319
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,095
little heart of yours.

320
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,214
What are you doing?

321
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,022
3 people responsible for
Joe's downfall-- his words.

322
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:06,543
That would be me,
the dead critic,

323
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,397
and this guy.

324
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,653
He was a professor
at the university.

325
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,138
I interviewed him.
He was a dean.

326
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:14,760
After Joe's book failed,
this guy denied him tenure,

327
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,156
said that Joe wasn't worthy.

328
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,456
It was a big blow
to Joe's career.

329
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:20,516
Here it is.
Phillip Barnes, Dean of Literature.

330
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:21,959
Do you think he's
still the dean?

331
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:25,092
As far as I know.
This was years ago.

332
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:36,721
May I help you?

333
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,567
Did we have an appointment?

334
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:42,169
Why did you deny
Joe Carroll tenure?

335
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:44,961
I beg your pardon.

336
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,121
I asked you a question.

337
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:47,526
Is this a joke?

338
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:49,907
I'm sorry.
You need to leave.

339
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,397
Ooh!

340
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,399
No. You need to sit.

341
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,795
Why did you deny
Carroll tenure?

342
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,340
Answer me.

343
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:02,207
Unh!

344
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:22,439
I never killed anyone
with a knife before.

345
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,648
Press is using the cult word.

346
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,671
It's out there.
We gonna comment?

347
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,948
No. Let them speculate.
Where's Ryan?

348
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,196
He went outside.

349
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:50,110
There's no way you could
have stopped this.

350
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:51,836
Yeah.

351
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:53,399
I could have.

352
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:55,281
See, that's the point.

353
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:56,580
He's baiting me!

354
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,143
I should have seen it coming.

355
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,066
Why? Because you interviewed
him 8 years ago?

356
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:04,574
Seriously? You know Carroll's
out to torture you.

357
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,306
Well, it's working.

358
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,135
- Professor Carroll.
- Hmm?

359
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,957
Hi. Ryan Hardy, FBI.

360
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:27,556
Oh, yes, yes.
My wife said to expect you.

361
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,941
It's a pleasure, Agent Hardy.
How can I help?

362
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,648
I was hoping to pick your brain
on a case I'm working on.

363
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:36,245
Oh, the murders. Yes. Oh, gosh.
Awful. Poor girls.

364
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,220
No. I'd relish
the opportunity.

365
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,750
"Relish." I don't
mean relish.

366
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,820
I mean, it's not every day
one gets to aid the FBI

367
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,456
in a murder
investigation, is it?

368
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,363
Now a good time?

369
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,726
No. I'm afraid not.
I'm already late for an appointment,

370
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:50,660
but, uh, look.
Just call my office.

371
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm free every night this week.

372
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,008
I'll do that.
Thank you, sir.

373
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,025
Please call me Joe.
Nice to meet you.

374
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,195
All right.
Get in closer.

375
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,511
Smile!

376
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,324
How was it?

377
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,075
I don't like it.
One more.

378
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,424
- Come here. Ohh!
- Ha ha ha!

379
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,305
All right.
1... 2... 3.

380
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,518
Can I call mom now?

381
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:26,424
No, you cannot,
and stop asking me that!

382
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,400
No. We can't
pretend to be gay.

383
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,421
Sarah Fuller has major issues.

384
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,039
She's not gonna warm
up to a straight guy

385
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,717
the way that she
would to a totally

386
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:42,499
nonthreatening gay couple.

387
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,791
Uh, I don't know.

388
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,294
Joe thinks it's a great idea.

389
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,810
But we're straight.

390
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,965
Details. Come on.

391
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,380
Expand your minds.

392
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,453
Let's try.

393
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,632
Kiss.

394
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:01,937
What, now?

395
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,656
Let's see if you
can pull it off.

396
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:08,869
No, no, no.
No way, no way.

397
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,253
You guys are losers!

398
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,927
So what am I gonna tell Joe?

399
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:24,240
Okay. Okay. Let's do this.

400
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:25,394
Come on.

401
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,557
Gay chicken.

402
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,134
What's wrong with him?

403
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:01,405
Hey!

404
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,451
What do you think you're doing?

405
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,756
- Get away.
- Come on, man.

406
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:05,079
Don't do this.

407
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:06,463
Where are you going, huh?

408
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,889
Hey. Your face is all
over the news right now.

409
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:10,273
Don't be stupid.

410
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,677
You're a liar.

411
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:23,257
Authorities
have yet to confirm or deny

412
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,664
any cult activity
surrounding Joe Carroll.

413
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:42,945
So does the coffee work
as an equalizer?

414
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:46,868
That's the idea.
Rick Kester's records just came in.

415
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,418
Take a look at this.

416
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:52,237
Wait.

417
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:55,597
A critic
for the "Richmond Herald"

418
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,308
Stan Fellows is dead.

419
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,606
The assailant, a street performer,
is currently at large...

420
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:01,895
Several eyewitness caught
the incident on camera.

421
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:03,014
Come in?

422
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,944
Excuse me.

423
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:08,259
Claire?

424
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,188
I'm watching the news.
What's happening?

425
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,667
Listen. We have
a suspect.

426
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,297
I need to ask you something.

427
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,037
The man who's
starting the fires?

428
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,101
Right. I've just got
his credit card statements,

429
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,289
and there's a couple of items

430
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:23,053
that I just need
to confirm with you--

431
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:28,839
All Pro sponge ball, Ridley Race
car set, dragon ninja warrior--

432
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,852
Action figure. Yeah.

433
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:34,076
Those are all Joey's favorite toys.
What's going on?

434
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,679
This is good news, Claire.

435
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,810
They bought him toys.

436
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:39,668
Wherever he is,
they're not hurting him.

437
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,882
I want him home, Ryan.
He's not gonna be safe until he's home.

438
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:44,330
I know.

439
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:46,665
I got to go.

440
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:48,530
I'll call you later, okay?

441
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:51,577
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

442
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:56,267
I've been here all day.
Can I go now?

443
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:57,611
Soon.

444
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,639
Any idea why your husband
would purchase toys?

445
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:07,763
I don't know.
It's his credit card.

446
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:09,195
You'll have to ask him.

447
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,448
It's Rick.

448
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,957
Answer it.
Put it on speaker phone.

449
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,289
Rick.

450
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:31,771
Where are you?

451
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:34,981
The FBI came
to the house, Rick.

452
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,609
What have you done?

453
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:39,454
Are you with them now?

454
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:42,217
Y-yes. Yes.

455
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:43,468
They're looking for you, Rick.

456
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:44,644
You're in trouble.

457
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,863
How could you hurt
those people?

458
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,998
Where are you, Rick?

459
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,597
Is Ryan Hardy there?

460
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:59,144
Tell Ryan it was all for him.

461
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,344
He's using the same
setup at their internet.

462
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,370
It's being routed internationally.
We can't trace it.

463
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,476
What do you think?

464
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,073
We try and make contact?

465
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:19,523
I don't know.

466
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:21,780
Take her home, stay with her.

467
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:23,276
I'll send someone to relieve
you in the morning.

468
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,278
I'll go with him.

469
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,000
No. What you're gonna
do, vodka breath,

470
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:28,194
is go back to that dumpy,
little motel the FBI put us in

471
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,158
and get some rest.

472
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:30,247
I feel totally fine.

473
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,468
When was the last time you had
more than an hour of sleep?

474
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,555
You're gonna go, and you're
gonna get some sleep, Ryan,

475
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:36,178
and tomorrow,
we're gonna find Joey.

476
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:37,787
Do you understand?

477
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:41,289
Look. I get it.
You overidentify with the victims,

478
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:43,981
the guilt makes it
personal, you unravel.

479
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,419
I get it.

480
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:00,784
You okay?

481
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:06,287
Not going back to the
hotel to sleep, are you?

482
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:09,559
I think Rick Kester
knows where Joey is.

483
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,749
Well, they gave me
a rental car.

484
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,042
Joey's in his room.

485
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,474
He thinks we got
into a little fight.

486
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:25,757
Paul just needed to
blow off some steam.

487
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:27,975
Our faces are
all over the news.

488
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,338
What if he goes into town?

489
00:25:30,452 --> 00:25:32,700
I know Paul, okay?

490
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:35,587
He's not gonna go into town.

491
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,479
Did you send
that e-mail?

492
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,410
Not yet.
I was waiting for Rick to call.

493
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,428
Why is no one doing what
they're supposed to do?

494
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:45,961
Damn it.

495
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:25,288
Excuse me. Megan?

496
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:26,778
Heh heh.

497
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:28,230
Where would I find the wine?

498
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,198
Oh. We don't sell wine.

499
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:32,878
All we have is beer.
That's the law.

500
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:34,655
Well, I really wanted wine.

501
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,207
Hmm. Heh heh.

502
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:39,363
Uh...

503
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,515
So, uh, red or white?

504
00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:49,421
G-go with the red.

505
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,436
And, uh, what time
do you get off?

506
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,655
Do you really think
he's gonna come here?

507
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:14,476
We just want to keep
you safe, that's all.

508
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,722
Do what you normally do.

509
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,110
Pretend I'm not even here.

510
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:23,343
Um, help yourself
to the fridge.

511
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:29,165
Yo.

512
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:30,764
Okay. Hardy and I
are outside.

513
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:31,914
What?

514
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:33,410
Does Parker know?

515
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,177
Yeah.

516
00:27:40,473 --> 00:27:44,755
Do you really think Kester would
be stupid enough to come here?

517
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,623
He's already
killed two people today.

518
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:49,781
He's escalating,
he's getting bolder.

519
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,272
We'll be outside
if you need us.

520
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:52,629
Yeah.

521
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,386
Does Parker know we're here?

522
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:01,780
She told me to watch you.

523
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,758
Look. I know you march to
your own drum and everything,

524
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,407
and, hey, that's cool.

525
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:09,462
Maybe someday I can, but I'm
the second youngest agent

526
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,905
in the BAU, and people
still look at me funny.

527
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,261
This is my career, sir.

528
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,634
You still live in Brooklyn?

529
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:23,819
Yeah.

530
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:25,538
You ever make it up to Albany?

531
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:29,037
I read your book.
I know you grew up there.

532
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:32,188
Not for years.
No reason.

533
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:37,729
Right. Family.

534
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,832
Sorry. Um, I'm
a military brat.

535
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,928
Was born in San Diego.

536
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,022
I've lived
everywhere--

537
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,570
I'm gonna take a look around,

538
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:46,923
stretch my legs.

539
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,487
Ryan, good to see you.
Come on in.

540
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:05,068
I'm afraid it's
only me tonight.

541
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,345
Claire's out
with the little one.

542
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:07,219
Can I get you a drink?

543
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:08,423
No. I'm fine. Thanks.

544
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:11,378
My God.

545
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:15,945
This is a moment when it
all becomes very real.

546
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,272
Your wife mentioned
Edgar Allan Poe

547
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,986
as a reference for the eyes.

548
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:23,004
Yes. Yes. What makes you
think that your killer has

549
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:24,476
a greater literary purpose?

550
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:27,329
Well, there's a sophistication
to the murders,

551
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,649
the way the bodies are
handled and displayed.

552
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,702
There's a...
romance to it.

553
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:36,073
Poe's eye allegories
would certainly fit,

554
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:42,036
and you'll find his symbolism
full of haunting romance.

555
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:43,132
Here.

556
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:46,089
Wow. Great.
Thanks a lot.

557
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,768
I'll get this
right back to you.

558
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:48,924
No, no, no.
Don't you dare. No.

559
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,610
This has-- this has
been a treat for me.

560
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:56,595
Now please may I
offer you a drink?

561
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:02,313
All right.
Sure. Yeah.

562
00:30:02,424 --> 00:30:03,875
Whatever you're drinking.

563
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:18,367
Hey. I need a breather.

564
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:21,936
And more wine.
Ha ha ha!

565
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,752
Sure.

566
00:30:29,113 --> 00:30:30,817
We're not having sex, okay?

567
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:33,226
Let's just take that
off the table.

568
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:34,722
Okay.

569
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:43,053
Unh!

570
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,550
Wait. No.
That hurt.

571
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,351
Were you just choking me?

572
00:30:46,463 --> 00:30:49,862
No. No. Of course not.

573
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:52,014
We should get going.
It's getting late.

574
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:52,952
But--

575
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:54,930
I need to get home.

576
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,359
- Okay?
- Okay.

577
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,539
Okay.

578
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,317
Wait. Let me get
the door for you.

579
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:08,837
Aah!

580
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:22,563
Don't be so happy to see me.

581
00:31:22,683 --> 00:31:23,986
Will you excuse us, please?

582
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:31,717
I'm not talking to you.

583
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:33,578
Well, you're gonna have to.

584
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:35,540
I need some information
from you, Jordy.

585
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,826
♪ Believe it or not,
I'm walking on air ♪

586
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,124
So I was talking to Joe.

587
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:41,465
♪ I never-- ♪

588
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,605
And he wants to see you.

589
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,194
I want to see him.

590
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:49,569
I can make that happen,

591
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,198
but I can't if you
won't talk to me.

592
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,184
You okay in here?

593
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:01,429
Yeah, I guess.

594
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,677
Are you married, Agent Riley?

595
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,181
Divorced.

596
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,970
Was she a good woman?

597
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,479
She wasn't the problem.

598
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,021
What was that?

599
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,718
Was that inside or outside?

600
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:04,935
Yeah.

601
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,923
- You okay?
- I'm not sure.

602
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,852
There's someone
in the backyard.

603
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,523
I'm coming in.

604
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,397
How do I know you're not lying?

605
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:15,688
What if I tell you stuff and
you don't let me see Joe?

606
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:18,038
Character, Jordy.
I say what I mean,

607
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:19,401
and I mean what I say.

608
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,258
What if I tell you stuff and you
don't like the stuff I tell you?

609
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:22,496
Do I still get to see Joe?

610
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,114
Just talk to me, Jordy.

611
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,236
I'll let you see Joe.

612
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:28,576
I don't know where the kid is.

613
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:29,866
Oh, come on, Jordy.

614
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,253
I don't.

615
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:34,341
We divide the secrets so no
one person knows everything

616
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,576
in case one of us gets caught.

617
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,510
So who has Joey?

618
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,876
Emma and Jacob and Paul,

619
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,385
but I don't know
where they are,

620
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:42,880
and that's the truth.

621
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:44,050
Can I see Joe now?

622
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:45,249
Does Rick know where Joey is?

623
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,754
I don't know,
but his wife does.

624
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:48,027
What?

625
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:50,556
Maggie. She and Emma
planned that part.

626
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,465
Something's up.

627
00:33:57,867 --> 00:33:59,186
Hello.

628
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,806
You lied!

629
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:02,497
It's Parker.
Jordy just told me

630
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,162
Maggie Kester is one of them.
She's lying.

631
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,709
Maggie's one of them.

632
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,495
Maggie, you're
getting a message.

633
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,695
What does it say?

634
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:18,681
It says, "now."

635
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:20,876
What the?

636
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,563
Unh!

637
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,247
Ugh!

638
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,065
Oh, my God.
Baby, are you okay?

639
00:34:45,173 --> 00:34:45,999
You went too deep.

640
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,913
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

641
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,611
You lose.
You suck at games.

642
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,344
He sucks at knives.

643
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,670
All right. Who's next?
Truth or dare?

644
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:54,980
Guys, she needs a hospital.

645
00:34:55,077 --> 00:34:57,445
What? Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm so sorry.

646
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,895
Baby, I'm so sorry.

647
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:01,385
There's no time.
We have to go.

648
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,839
Oh, my God.

649
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,158
Get an ambulance!

650
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:16,427
Here. Hold pressure on this.

651
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:19,234
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hold on. I got it. Okay.

652
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,217
Hey, Troy. Look at me.

653
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,500
You're gonna be okay.

654
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:23,848
Stop!

655
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,715
Stop!

656
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,588
No. Please, please.
He's gonna kill me.

657
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:31,669
I don't think so, Maggie.

658
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:42,870
No! Ah, ah ah!

659
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,660
What is that?

660
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:31,743
What the hell?

661
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,802
Hey, guys.
This is Megan.

662
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,304
Megan, this is Emma and Jacob.

663
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:39,327
Who is she?

664
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:41,288
She's a friend,
and she's gonna be

665
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,135
staying with us for a while.

666
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:46,005
You have lost your mind.

667
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:48,896
Yeah. I'm done
listening to her.

668
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,765
Hey. I'll
take care of this.

669
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:53,507
Go check on Joey.

670
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:57,240
Go.

671
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,937
What are you doing, Paul?

672
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:07,703
I'm tired of being
the third wheel,

673
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:09,975
and now I'm not.

674
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:12,857
I know you're mad
at me right now,

675
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,613
but you can't ruin
things for everyone.

676
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:19,719
Does Emma know
what a liar you are?

677
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:23,027
We promised we wouldn't
tell anyone...

678
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:26,904
especially Emma.

679
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,772
I drank too much.
Sarah's gonna think I'm a drunk.

680
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,719
Are you kidding?
She loves you.

681
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,635
You had a few too many, too.
You know that?

682
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:39,590
So touchy-feely
when you drink.

683
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,148
Hey. It's for Sarah,
all right?

684
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,039
I mean, we go to look
like a real couple.

685
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:44,768
So touchy...

686
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:45,916
Ha ha ha!
Stop that.

687
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,834
- Ohh.
- Ha ha ha!

Look.

695
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:15,537
We can't keep her here.

696
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,193
Look. I'll help you take her
into the basement, okay?

697
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:46,464
That woman fooled me
today, and I am...

698
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,684
mad.

699
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:51,912
Riley didn't have to die.

700
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:01,261
Thanks a lot.

701
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,070
I'll read it right
way, I promise.

702
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:04,706
Well, feel free to hate it.

703
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,419
Everyone else has. Heh.

704
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:07,697
It's not doing well?

705
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,413
I think that's the third copy.

706
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:11,791
Maybe I should give you
20 bucks or something.

707
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,104
Ha ha ha!

708
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,954
Listen.
I really appreciate tonight, Joe.

709
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,086
Well, if nothing else
it's good scotch, huh?

710
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:20,454
It's great scotch.

711
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,222
You know, I've been working
on this case nonstop

712
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,400
for months now.

713
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:28,371
Sometimes I just forget to stop

714
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,328
and turn it off
for a few hours.

715
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:34,425
I couldn't turn it
off if I were you.

716
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,064
Must be hard
with friends and family

717
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:41,555
when you're running around,
trying to chase down the bad guy.

718
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:46,948
I imagine it, uh,
it gets quite lonely.

719
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:52,480
But the payoff, huh?

720
00:39:53,962 --> 00:39:57,165
Helping people, saving lives.

721
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:01,492
You know, I think what you do

722
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,821
is quite remarkable.

723
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:12,295
One more, huh?

724
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,525
Sure. Why not?

725
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:21,225
Joe fooled me.

726
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:24,964
I should have known from
the first time I met him

727
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,248
he was the man
I was looking for,

728
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,969
but he had this power.

729
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,931
I'm sorry, Joe.

730
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:35,233
I'm sorry, Joe!

731
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:39,157
Charmed and seduced.

732
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:42,426
I know what his followers feel.

733
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:49,448

734
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:55,830

735
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,104
They're better
for being near him.

736
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,548
He knows how to give them
a little piece of...

737
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:04,772
what they're missing.

738
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:10,396
I'm sorry, Joe.

739
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,127
I fell for it.

740
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:27,416
And 5 more girls were murdered.

741
00:41:28,674 --> 00:41:34,720

742

743
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:46,009
I got your message.
What is it?

744
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:48,623
I got an e-mail.

745
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:56,954
See? If you catch
the sun just right,

746
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,647
the bug catches fire.

747
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:00,602
Why do you want to kill a bug?

748
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:02,638
Because we can.

749
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,342
See, if you kill the bug,

750
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,529
then it dies, and your
life means a little more.

751
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,614
I-- I don't understand.

752
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:11,980
Look at this little guy.

753
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,990
Whoa! Where did you get
a cute, little mouse?

754
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:15,276
Caught him in a trap.

755
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:16,686
Here. Screw
the lid on.

756
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:18,130
It's got to be real tight.

757
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:19,412
Then it's gonna suffocate.

758
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,476
It-- it will die.

759
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:22,684
Exactly. Here.
Screw the lid on.

760
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:23,995
I don't want to.

761
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,040
It's okay, sweetie.
Go ahead.

762
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:30,120
Then we watch it go
straight to heaven.

763
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:32,336
- There you go.
- Yeah. Good job.

764
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:35,190
I never killed anything before.

765
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:38,123
We're just getting started.

766
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,185
They're teaching him.

767
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:44,261
Claire, we are
going to find him.

768
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,568
Then do it!

769
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:47,652
Claire!
Claire, wait.

770
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:48,822
Joey, can you wave
to the camera

771
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,688
and say, "hi, Ryan"?

772
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,785
Who's that?

773
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,935
He's a friend.

774
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:54,731
Come on.
Just say it for me.

775
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:56,596
Hi, Ryan!

776
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:09,700
