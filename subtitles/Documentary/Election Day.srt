2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,420
I'll help.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,030
Marry me and have three children, too.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,750
Then divorce and you can go.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,750
- What?
- I said, I'll help you.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,720
A life that you can only live once, don't you think it's unfair?

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,970
I don't know who it is, but because she told you to come back after you've been married,

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,880
it doesn't seem like it's the first time for her.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,220
Although that shouldn't be a problem,

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,910
but what she said is correct.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,850
As long as we're living, we should
do everything that's possible to do.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,670
That way we won't have any lingering attachments or regrets.

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,060
Just because everyone else is doing it, should I do it too?

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,210
I should do what I want to do. That is...

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,730
really live the life I want.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,740
Right now,

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,900
are you rejecting my confession to you?

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,830
Is there heavy traffic?

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,370
Mother.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,890
Yes.

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,830
- Should I help you?
- Oh, no.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
It's alright. Go and rest.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Ok.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,460
Then...

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,180
- I'll wash up first.
- Alright.

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,960
Ok.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,350
Yes?

28
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,800
Where?

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,340
Why isn't she answering?

30
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,520
Yoo Ji Ho

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,880
Who is it at this hour?

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,040
Hey, maybe it's the owner of this apartment.

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,340
The rent for this month is paid.

34
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,980
Oh, okay.

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,960
Who is it?

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,410
Da.. Da In.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,550
Da In.

38
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,220
Da In.

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,290
Why are you here?

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,940
Let's go outside. I'll tell you everything once we're outside.

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,890
Tell me here!

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,510
Who you are, and who is the person that's hiding!

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,040
Let's go out. Let's talk outside.

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,670
Jeong Hee Joo!

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,050
Go after hearing me out.

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,350
Let go.

47
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,850
Jeong Hee Joo.

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,530
That's right, you were Jeong Hee Joo.

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,160
- Da In, please.
- Let go.

50
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,200
I told you to let go. Let go!

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,720
Da In, please, give me a chance to explain.

52
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,740
I don't want to hear it! Let go!

53
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,920
Let her go and talk.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,610
What is it? What's going on?

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,100
Liar!

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,820
It was planned from the start, right?

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,090
Everything you've said up to now, your behavior,
everything was a lie, right?!

58
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,460
What exactly was your deception?
Why is Da In like this?

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
I just...

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,230
wanted to be by your side.

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,840
I liked you.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,550
- Da In.
- This jerk!

63
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,230
Who likes who?!

64
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,470
Don't bother with him.

65
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,770
Don't you ever show up in front of me again.

66
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,140
I didn't like you from the start.

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,400
Instead being like this here, let's go to my house.

68
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,670
In Woo probably hasn't eaten yet.

69
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,050
Where is the soup?

70
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,650
Da Jeong.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,540
Leave it!

72
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,250
What are you doing? Hurry and clean it up.

73
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,760
Yes.

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,500
What was that noise?

75
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,930
That's why I told you to go home.

76
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,190
A girl, whose hands have never even
touched a drop of water,

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,100
what kind of work are you saying
you're going to do?

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,580
I can do it.

79
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,360
Mother, So Lee and I will clean this up.
Please go out.

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,240
So Lee.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,090
You should know too, since you heard the story.

82
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,570
Following after your household,
I almost got my throat ripped out.

83
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,310
Here. Give that to me,

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,990
released your attachment, and go.

85
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,680
I told you that I left my home. I have no place to go.

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,830
If you stay at our house like this,

87
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,060
then we're the only one who will be cursed at.

88
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,350
You know very well that your mother is exceptional.

89
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,390
Mother.

90
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,660
Da Jeong, you too, don't let this girl into your house.

91
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,740
Mother.

92
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,280
I really don't have any place to go. I'll do well.

93
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,490
- Mother
- What is it?

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,080
- What are you going to do about So Lee?
- I was kicked out.

95
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
That's why it makes me more mad!

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,840
Why is dating In Woo something to be
kicked out of your house over?!

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,040
- Don't.
- Why?

98
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,140
What are you guys doing?

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,770
Father.

100
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,870
What?

101
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,320
Aiyoo, you should do things properly.

102
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,800
Oh man, I don't what I should do.

103
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,620
In a situation like this, it's best to keep one leg out.

104
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,260
Women's problems should be left for them to resolve.

105
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,800
If you pointlessly butt in, the matter will only grow bigger.

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,590
Then you're saying for me to look the other way?

107
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,550
You saw what I did, right?

108
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,720
When I protected Da Jeong, Mom got more angry.

109
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,860
For now, pretend you don't know.

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,870
Are you passing on your know-how
since you are the older brother?

111
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,330
Aiyoo, don't worry. I won't protest in a tent like Hyung did.

112
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,740
So what are you thinking to do?

113
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,030
I think I'll get married.

114
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,060
Hey, if you're going to get married, you should.
What is with this "I think I'll get married?"

115
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,360
Be certain.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,300
Marriage and Baduk (Korean board game)moves
are things you can't take back.

117
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,720
Seeing as how she packed her things and left her house,

118
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,000
it looks like So Lee's house is against it.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,700
Aiyoo, well, it's because I was indecisive before.

120
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,280
If you give your permission, I will try to convince them.

121
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,200
So...

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,780
is it a sure thing this time?

123
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,060
Don't say anything different later.

124
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,150
You're scarier than Father.

125
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,820
Oh boy.

126
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,330
Honey.

127
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,350
Try dissuading So Lee.

128
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,740
She says that she doesn't need to marry
and that she'll just live in our house.

129
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,750
Then, tell her to live here.

130
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,800
If this big scale wedding didn't work out,
I was going to tell you to give it all up.

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,310
Well... the false bravado is gone and it's good.

132
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,120
How are we going to get them married like that?

133
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,690
There's no reason to waste your energy over the children.

134
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,330
If we've raised them up to this point, they're
supposed to live their own lives as they see fit.

135
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,830
Honey.

136
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,560
I just...

137
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,130
What I did to Da Jeong . . .

138
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,190
I feel like In Woo is getting

139
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,750
it back exactly the same way.

140
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,130
Don't you know by looking at our parents?

141
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,140
As children, what is there for us to do for them?

142
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,630
In the end, there's only the married couple left.

143
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,040
You be good to me.

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,960
But what's wrong with our In Woo that
he should go so quickly and quietly?!

145
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,740
Team Leader Im.

146
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,230
Team Leader Im.

147
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,980
Writer Han.

148
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,660
What is all this?

149
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,290
Who did you drink with? Did you drink alone?

150
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm not alone.

151
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,190
Oh, he left.

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,480
He ran away.

153
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,960
Who did you drink with?

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,620
Nam Goong Yeong.

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,900
The CEO?

156
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,880
I confessed that I liked him.

157
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,720
He left.

158
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,390
Aiyoo, it's so embarrassing.

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,820
Get up. Where is your house?

160
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,530
Writer Han.

161
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,810
The CEO says that there's a woman he likes.

162
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,700
You were so bad (to tell me to date him).

163
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,690
So bad.

164
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,550
She's gone out.

165
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,300
At this time?

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,770
To meet whom?

167
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,910
I don't know.

168
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,060
But why are you calling at this hour...?

169
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,390
I was supposed to call for just a minute,
but she's not answering her cell phone...

170
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,830
So, I was just wondering if there was something wrong.

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,750
Don't worry about my mother,

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,130
since I'm here.

173
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,890
If you have something to tell Mother, let me know.

174
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,520
I will relay it to her.

175
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,590
Oh... well, it's nothing much, but

176
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,070
I wanted to discuss with her... regarding the book.

177
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,210
He has to ask so pointedly in such detail...

178
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,290
When was it the book came out
(that he's trying to use that as an excuse)?

179
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,880
What are you doing, Honey?

180
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,080
Honey, I figured it out.

181
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,980
In Mother's book, the hero of "I can't love."

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,540
Who is it?

183
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh, they fooled us so completely.

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,900
It seems like it's already progressed quite far.

185
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
What?

186
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm your senior when it comes to parental opposition.
If you cry, you'll just lose strength.

187
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,710
Don't cry.

188
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,560
Da Jeong,

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,640
How did it end up like this?

190
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,090
I understand Mother-in-law's heart,
but I'm disappointed and upset.

191
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,720
Didn't you see me do it? You need to endure this much.

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,000
When Mother-in-law only loved you,
I was so jealous and upset.

193
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,950
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,970
I didn't say that to make you apologize.

195
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,120
Go to your house and relieve your parents' hearts.
If you're going to do it, do it properly.

196
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,740
Properly.

197
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,360
Mom and Dad aren't even looking for me.
They aren't calling either.

198
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,710
But don't push them too much at the moment
because they aren't happy.

199
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,710
Take a step back and start again.

200
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,510
I know that Grandma isn't well.

201
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,850
Grandma loved me so much, but I didn't
realize and was just jealous.

202
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,770
Jealous?

203
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,670
Recently In Woo only knows the home and the hospital.

204
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,140
I've already sorted that out.

205
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,330
Now, I know what is the sincerity that
In Woo Oppa talked about.

206
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,010
Help me stay beside him, Sister-in-law.

207
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,190
See, So Lee isn't a bad kid.

208
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,900
Just know that you were lucky enough
to meet a good Sister-in-law.

209
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,850
She still accepted it all even though she has flu-like symptoms.

210
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm not going to live like you when I get married.

211
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,270
Don't be so sure about future matters.
Your sister-in-law has to rest, so,

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,300
take So Lee and go to the house next door.

213
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,440
Don't be like that and let So Lee and Da Jeong
sleep together today.

214
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,350
Tell them to sleep together and you can sleep with me.

215
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,950
Wake up, you.

216
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,760
Da Jeong, let's go up.

217
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,660
I have a fever and I'm cold.

218
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,380
It seems like the flu. My whole body aches and I'm cold.

219
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,030
Where? Where?

220
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,940
Can I ask you something?

221
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,380
What?

222
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,630
Why are you so good to me?

223
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,800
No, maybe it's because I've never received
this kind of treatment before.

224
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,820
It's nice, but sometimes it's awkward and weird.

225
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,020
We're going to live together forever.
I need to take care of you or who else would?

226
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,140
They say that around the 3rd year of marriage,
things wane and dry up.

227
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,630
Don't believe in those things. My grandfather and
my dad lived without knowing those kind of things.

228
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,250
One more . . .

229
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,220
Why did my dad like somebody apart from my mom?

230
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,250
I mean, my mom is pretty,

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,440
and is ten thousand times better than my dad.

232
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:24,200
That's why Father-in-law must be regretting
it a lot even though he can't go back now.

233
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:32,880
If you liked some other girl besides me,
I think I'll just go and die.

234
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,750
What?

235
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,940
That's a bad thing to say. Take it back.

236
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,430
After I got married, I think about my mother a lot.

237
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,250
My mom's heart must have hurt a lot.

238
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,440
"I can't love again,"

239
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,400
I think I know how she felt.

240
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,640
Jeong Da Jeong, has it been one month
or a year since we married?

241
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,420
What do you think you know so much about?

242
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,920
Mom went on a date with Uncle.

243
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,720
Really?

244
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,190
My mom was so pretty.

245
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,330
Omo, Mom, what do we do?

246
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,110
I told you that I'd marry and divorce you, do it all.

247
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,490
What is she talking about?

248
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,150
Let's leave. When someone's drunk, sleep is medicine.

249
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,390
Really.

250
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,740
Where are you going?

251
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,030
It's so embarrassing, really.

252
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,460
Mother,

253
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,820
Oh, you surprised me.

254
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,830
Weren't you sleeping?

255
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,400
There was a call from CEO.

256
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,170
Really?

257
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,770
But why are you whispering?

258
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,610
Because I felt that I had to. After all, who am I?

259
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,340
I'm this house's Son-in-law and head of
the household. I'm the son, Mother.

260
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,490
Well...

261
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,570
Don't think about it weirdly and misunderstand.

262
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,840
He called me about the book.

263
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,920
Go up and sleep.

264
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,250
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

265
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,800
Would it be a misunderstanding?

266
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,050
What misunderstanding?

267
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,190
You're the daebak king of being jealous.

268
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,640
Are you even being jealous over
Mom and Uncle's relationship?

269
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,630
Just saying, what if CEO becomes our father-in-law...

270
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,290
There's not even that much of an age difference . . .

271
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,950
That's because My Honey is so very old.

272
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,700
Da Ae,

273
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,040
should I see if honey's heart is thumping?

274
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,570
Listen to it, listen to it. My heart is thumping.

275
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,070
Then, Hee Joo is your oppa?

276
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,580
Brother? What brother? He's someone
that has nothing to do with me.

277
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,250
No, he's someone that I never want to
meet again in my lifetime.

278
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,130
You also should never again act like you know him.

279
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,370
So shameless, how dare he show up here.

280
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,920
So, that's why he was so good
to you and your family.

281
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,820
Good? How was he good?

282
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,530
Liar!

283
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,630
If we nitpick about it, then Hee Joo never lied.

284
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,550
"My mother's dead. I'm lonely, give me some food."

285
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,680
That's all he said.

286
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,260
If my mother finds out...
I brought him home saying that he was my friend.

287
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,920
But, are we of the type of relationship to be
feeding him and even packing side dishes for him?

288
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,140
He says he's going to the army soon.
Then you won't be able to see him anyway.

289
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,240
I'm so angry. That terrible bastard.

290
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,770
Let go of your anger. Truthfully, Hee Joo is quite pitiful.

291
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,300
What?!

292
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,090
His father two-timing isn't Hee Joo's fault.

293
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,620
Hee Joo is also a victim.

294
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,070
A victim?

295
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,630
How can you say that?

296
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,940
You go too! I don't need anyone.

297
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,700
- Da-in.
- Go!

298
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,940
Hey, I told you to go. Go, go, go!

299
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,030
I told you to go!

300
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Look here,

301
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,880
why did he hit you in the face out of all places?

302
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,750
For a punk that looks all thin and weak, his fist is quite strong.

303
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,380
By now, the whole family will know, right?

304
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,010
What about the family?

305
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,900
That's why I told you not to meet with them.

306
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,810
Where is a man going to use such weakness, being so affectionate.

307
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,290
Here.

308
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,870
Hey, it'll scar. Apply this before you sleep.

309
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,540
Hee Joo.

310
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,390
Oh, I must be crazy.

311
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,680
Why am I here?

312
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,770
You were drunk so my mother brought you here.

313
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,970
I spouted rubbish, right? I was in a bad mood yesterday.

314
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,090
I shouldn't drink at times like that.

315
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,260
No, you just slept.

316
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,940
But where's Writer Han?

317
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,410
How can you leave a drunken person like that?

318
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,170
In front of the cafe, we separated to go home.

319
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,570
- She drank?
- She's at my house right now.

320
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,360
She slept there?

321
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,730
When I asked her address she was so drunk
and carrying on and making a fuss. What was I to do?

322
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,560
Then you should have told me.

323
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,810
I didn't know, so I was worried all night
because you didn't pick up your phone.

324
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,390
Did you not sleep?

325
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,730
I kept waking up.

326
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,770
Did Team Leader not say anything?

327
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,470
No, not really.

328
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,690
Let's meet for now.

329
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,150
Now? Team Leader Im is still sleeping.

330
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,650
Team Leader Im isn't a young child. Just come out.

331
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,040
- Oh, but-

332
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,140
- Mom, why are you here?
- Yes.

333
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes, why?

334
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,820
Team Teader Im is awake.

335
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,870
Oh, okay.

336
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,930
My mom must really be dating

337
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,800
It's so refreshing.

338
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,240
Seeing as how I have this terrible headache,
I must have overdid it yesterday.

339
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,970
Should I buy you medicine?

340
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,910
No, no. If I just have some hangover soup
and sleep deeply, I'll be perfectly fine.

341
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,430
By any chance, did I make any mistakes?

342
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,920
No.

343
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,000
That's a relief. I blacked out so I was a little worried.

344
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,770
Should I go to the sauna and sweat it out?
Do you want to go together?

345
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,400
I have something that I need to do.

346
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,960
You're always busy.

347
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,010
Oh, my head.

348
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:31,640
If it's okay, even if I'm not here, do you
want to take a nap before you go?

349
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,630
Really? Thank you, thank you.

350
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,960
Don't worry about me. Do whatever
you need to do and come back.

351
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,990
Yes.

352
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,670
- Mother
- Yes, are you going out to exercise?

353
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,250
No, I'm going to the pharmacy.

354
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,570
Da Jeong has flu-like symptoms.

355
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,820
Is she really sick?

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,390
You don't need to worry about her; she'll be better after taking some medicine.

357
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,620
Don't feed her medicine carelessly, since she may get pregnant.

358
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,140
A baby?

359
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,460
-Uncle?
-Yes.

360
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Oh, he's had something to discuss with me regarding the book.

361
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes, I'm just popping in because of the book.

362
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,900
Yes. Yes. I'm just popping in to see Da Jeong too.

363
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,550
Then, discuss please.

364
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,280
Why did you have to come now of all times?

365
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,100
Get in quickly before we meet any more of your family.

366
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,620
Aiyoo, I was in such a bad spot.

367
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:49,660
Team Leader Im asked me to marry her, have kids with her, and even divorce her.

368
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,750
So what?

369
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,730
What's "So what?"

370
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,050
No, she's an okay woman. She's young too.

371
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,410
Does that make sense, Writer Han?

372
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,040
Hello.

373
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,820
You're going home?

374
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,550
We were talking about the book some.

375
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,790
Have you read the book?

376
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,080
What are you saying when he's a high school senior test taker.

377
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,950
When your examinations are over make sure to read it.

378
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,360
Yes!

379
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,750
Please speak.

380
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,900
Okay.

381
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,380
I can't do this because my heart is racing. I'll get going.

382
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,620
What do you mean you'll get going?

383
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,340
I haven't finished talking.

384
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,190
Where are you going?

385
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,950
How can I leave you and go to the army?

386
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,290
Han Da In, use this camera to take lots of nice pictures.

387
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,350
Terrible bastard.

388
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,130
Da In!

389
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,970
Why did you come?

390
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,030
In case you were feeling down.

391
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,420
Chocolate!

392
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,170
I came here instead of the library to study together.

393
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,840
It's delicious, right?

394
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,850
But, is there no contact from Hee Joo?

395
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,080
Don't talk about him!
- Shh.

396
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,650
On the way here, I saw your mom.

397
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,720
She was in Hotel uncle's car going on a date.

398
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,900
Why would Hotel Uncle and my mom have a date?

399
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,750
Here.

400
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,830
You said you had something to say, why come here?

401
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,100
Near the house, the kids keep appearing. We're safe here.

402
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,430
This seems to be the best one to see.

403
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,180
But I can't figure out what's what at all.

404
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,940
Aigoo.

405
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,230
It's a headache to have such a big family.

406
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,130
Oh, man. Let's go inside.

407
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,030
It's been years since I've been to a movie.

408
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,970
Aiyoo, here. Eat this.

409
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,200
Writer Han, it's a long time for you too, right?

410
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,300
It's been a few years.

411
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,410
I may get a pair of those.

412
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,890
- Why?
The subtitles look blurry.

413
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,590
Give them to me.

414
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,000
They don't seem to be magnifiers.

415
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,890
When you get to our age we need ones for looking far and near.

416
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,210
Wow, you can see it well.

417
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,410
Excuse me, can you be quiet?

418
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,530
- Sorry
- Sorry...

419
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,270
It's them, right?

420
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,500
Yeong slipped all the way over here.

421
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,380
You don't think that they saw us, right?

422
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,430
So what if they see us.

423
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,800
- Hurry up and give them to me.
- Just a minute.

424
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,440
I'll read you the subtitles.

425
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,880
"It's only that I want to spend a wonderful time together. That's right come here."

426
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,020
Be quiet!

427
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,800
Now he says to come into the room.

428
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,360
She says that she's of an age where she doesn't need her father but me.

429
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,040
Tada. Try them.

430
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,480
Are you all done now?

431
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,000
It's much softer and more delicious than last time.

432
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Hey, it dissolves so nicely.

433
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,440
Thank you.

434
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
Are you done?

435
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,940
Jae Woo, try one. I made it out of rice.

436
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,090
Oh, it's delicious.

437
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,880
It melts in your mouth.

438
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,050
Now we can go, right?

439
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,610
Hey, why do you want to go so much?

440
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,360
I'll tell you when I get back.

441
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,210
For now, I don't see the baby's house yet (amniotic sac).

442
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,900
See, I told you. That's not it.

443
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,530
I think I see it though.

444
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,780
The blood test results show that you're 3 weeks pregnant.

445
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,540
I told you! I could see it!

446
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,740
Are you sure it's a baby?

447
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,460
Yes, in 2 to 3 weeks we'll be able to see the baby's house (amniotic sac).

448
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,910
You can even hear the heartbeat.

449
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,050
The heartbeat...

450
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,560
Jae Woo.

451
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,200
Da Jeong.

452
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,830
Are you crying?

453
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,880
Jae Woo.

454
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,830
He's not normally like this.

455
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,460
Since it's the beginning of pregnancy you have to be careful.

456
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,090
Yes.

457
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,120
Mother?

458
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,410
- Isn't that your phone?
- Mine?

459
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,830
I'm sorry. Aigoo. I'm sorry.

460
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,390
Hello? Huh?

461
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,530
- Da Jeong is pregnant!?
-A Child?

462
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,550
Excuse me

463
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,540
- We're sorry.
- What do we do?

464
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,240
Of course we have to go!

465
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,820
Quickly! Quickly!

466
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,960
Aigoo, what are they doing?

467
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,720
Pregnant?

468
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,060
Hey, Da Jeong. You did well. You worked hard.

469
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,990
Father, now I also will become a father.

470
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,140
Aigoo, good for you, you punk!

471
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,330
Aigoo, really.

472
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,830
Aigoo, aigoo. Our father likes it so much that he can't breathe properly.

473
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,310
Here you go, Mother!

474
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,450
Aigoo, seriously.

475
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,370
- Such an embarrassing thing...
- It looks delicious.

476
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,930
- Aiyoo, hey. If there's something you want to eat tell me. I'll make it for you.
-Yes.

477
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,240
Aigoo, it's only 3 weeks now. What's with all this fuss?

478
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,320
They say that there are people who get morning sickness early.

479
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,700
Of course, of course.

480
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,420
Grandmother, you have to keep making us lots of delicious stuff.

481
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,080
Of course, of course!

482
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,480
Aigoo, that's right. Thinking back now I think my morning sickness was a little fast.

483
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,800
That's something Da Jeong takes after her mother-in-law.

484
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,440
If you're 3 weeks pregnant it's a honeymoon baby, right? It's so romantic.

485
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,280
He's coyly fast at the decisive times.

486
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,370
Aigoo.

487
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,910
Hey, hey, hey. Stop laughing like that. You look like an old man.

488
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,510
- Hey, the stew will cool. Let's hurry up and eat.
- Yes.

489
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,720
Because of you I think Mother-in-law is in a better mood.

490
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,590
Thank you. I'll latch on some.

491
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,650
Eat this. Mom, eat this.

492
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,910
Do well to sister-in-law!

493
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,960
How can I do better from here?

494
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,970
Da Jeong.

495
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,470
Mom!

496
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,260
Our Da Jeong, congratulations.

497
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,940
- You came?
- Sit down.

498
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,070
We had to come when they said that our great grandchild was made.

499
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,130
Jae Woo slipped right properly.

500
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,080
Jae Woo! Aigoo.

501
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,170
You came!

502
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,740
Congratulations!

503
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,310
Thank you.

504
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,910
How did you know to come, Uncle?

505
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,190
Me?

506
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,090
I... I... I... well, um...

507
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,580
Jae Woo. I heard from Jae Woo. Right, Jae Woo?

508
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,060
Me? It wasn't me though.

509
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,870
That person jokes so well.

510
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,730
Ah, it's refreshing! Right, son?

511
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,610
Teacher Jeong told me to buy bean sprouts.

512
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,350
Let's go back.

513
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,890
Yes we're going to buy the bean sprouts.

514
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,450
-Buy some flowers too.
-Eh? Flowers?

515
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,580
Da Jeong is pregnant.

516
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,290
Really?

517
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,390
Wow, Brother-in-law must be happy as a clam.

518
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,490
Why?

519
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,810
Auntie Da Jeong is pregnant!

520
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,310
Yah, you have a dongsaeng now!

521
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,190
Da Ae, why don't we have any children news? We were married first.

522
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,300
What? Eun Chan is...

523
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,230
Yes, I'll go quickly.

524
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,350
Hey, Eun Chan.

525
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,820
Dad, you're really happy.

526
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,320
Of course! Why? Do you not want a younger sibling?

527
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,220
It's good if I have one.

528
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,350
What type of flowers do we buy?

529
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,520
It's so nice being out here in the front yard.

530
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,390
So that Grandmother can comfortably enjoy it, Jae Woo brought it out here.

531
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,650
Thank you, my Puppy.

532
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,910
You have to come often.

533
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,260
Mother, use the massage chair. It's good for blood circulation.

534
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,490
Ah, I'm using that really well. You don't have to worry about it.

535
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,190
How are you? Everyone is gathered here.

536
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,560
You were still in there?

537
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,810
How did you know that I was here?

538
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,870
There is nothing Yeong doesn't know.

539
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,610
Drink some tea.

540
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,810
Yes.

541
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:37,630
Team Leader Im, did you know? Our Jae Woo is going to be a daddy soon.

542
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,910
- Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

543
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,980
Team Leader Im, come and have some fruit.

544
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,260
Yes. Thank you.

545
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,070
Have a seat.

546
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:54,570
Father, don't you think that Jae Woo is going to carry this baby to work with him after it's born.

547
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,020
I can't stand watching because it's eye blinding.

548
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,820
If you're that jealous then you should also hurry to get married and have a baby.

549
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,140
How can I have a child at this age?

550
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,290
What does that matter?

551
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,450
Men can have children in their 60-70's, right?

552
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,320
Isn't that so, Mom?

553
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,530
I think it's more important for him to find someone he loves before children.

554
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,740
Seriously, Mom, but still

555
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,250
he needs to have one child so that he has someone to pass the hotel on to.

556
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,390
Sister-in-law, why did I become the subject of this conversation when we were talking about Jae Woo?

557
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,760
Oh seriously,

558
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,850
I'm just saying that because you are the only one left.

559
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,780
You even caught the bouquet. Hurry up and get married.

560
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,420
I think he would do better than Jae Woo if he got married and had a baby.

561
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,990
She's not here either.

562
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,870
Where's So Lee. Has anyone seen her?

563
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,210
Oh, your posture is good just like this.

564
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,100
See, how you are looking at the ground at 45 degrees?

565
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,310
Oh, you look feminine and pure. You are exactly my style.

566
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,180
Oppa,

567
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,690
What?

568
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,910
Do you want to see your mother?

569
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,640
No.

570
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,100
It's nice being with your family.

571
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,880
Then are you jealous of Da Jeong?

572
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,590
Because she has everyone's attention because she's pregnant?

573
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,890
That's not it.

574
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,520
If that's not it then why are you so serious?

575
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,870
You have me.

576
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,280
It's true.

577
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,130
I feel like I'm going to fly now that I've seen you.

578
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,100
Should I really make you fly?

579
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,830
Alright.

580
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,170
I'm scared!

581
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,430
Stop acting timid. That doesn't work with me.

582
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,520
Let me down.

583
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,630
Isn't this fun?
It's scary.

584
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,210
I told you to go home but I'm going to let you have it since you're not listening.

585
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,310
Stop it...

586
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,700
Da Jeong made this.

587
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,200
Yes.

588
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,770
It tastes like castella cake.

589
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,760
It's soft and nice. It's good. It's delicious.

590
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,010
Thank you.

591
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,400
What did you use to make this?

592
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,450
It was made with rice.

593
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,130
Nobody was asking you.

594
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,610
I thought Yeong was here. Where did he go?

595
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

596
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,440
Why are you here?

597
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,150
You should have stayed with the elders.

598
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,610
What's the matter? Are you sick?

599
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,820
Go back to the other side.

600
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,620
I need to look over Eun Chan's homework.

601
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,780
Eun Chan?

602
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,890
Why is she acting like that again?

603
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,890
Let's go already. I think you over did it today.

604
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,590
Go home and bring me some clothes and my medication.

605
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:34,350
Let's stay a few days since Da Jeong has so many food cravings.

606
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,520
You're so fickle.

607
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,970
Did I put sesame oil or not?

608
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,320
- Do you have some extra energy?
- Days like today I could run around everywhere.

609
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,370
You're going to start running soon.

610
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,630
If In Woo and So Lee gets married, you'll end up seeing lines of grandchildren.

611
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,880
Maybe because it's been so long since we had a baby. Just the thought of one makes me happy.

612
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,680
Grandma, Da Jeong has indigestion. Can she take some medicine for it?

613
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,990
No! There would be big trouble.

614
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,790
Does walking make you feel a little better?

615
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,210
Yes.

616
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,440
Grandma, you need to exercise everyday regardless of how difficult it it.

617
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,010
That way you can raise our baby.

618
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,940
I'll have to.

619
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,370
Make sure you have a baby who looks like Jae Woo. If you do, the baby won't be bothersome to you.

620
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,450
Was he good when he was a baby?

621
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,400
Of course. Even if he cried,

622
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,370
he would fall asleep as soon as I put him on my back.

623
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:37,190
He was a late talker and walker.

624
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,030
I was so worried because he was still crawling on his first birthday.

625
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,910
Jae Woo is a little on the slow side.

626
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,630
Yet he considers himself to be quite fast.

627
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,570
He seems to think so.

628
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,120
He's gotten so talkative lately.

629
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,930
He has learned how to finally talk in his 30's.

630
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,010
That's true. He's totally late.

631
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,360
What is she so happy about to be laughing like that?

632
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:09,280
You said that when there is sadness there is also happiness and if someone is angry there is someone to make them laugh, right?

633
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,050
Da Jeong and I will be the ones to make you laugh.

634
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:21,070
How are things going with your mother-in-law and Uncle Yeong?

635
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,740
They came to the movie theater today.

636
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,440
It does seem that they like each other, but

637
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,050
I can't get involved since it's my mother-in-law's business.

638
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,160
I'm in the process of watching.

639
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,710
Of course. You feel cautious about it.

640
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,630
It's such a waster to see your mother-in-law who is alone.

641
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,820
Also when I see Yeong

642
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,700
I can't tell him to "get married and go." Isn't he still young?

643
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,340
Do you feel like it's a waste for Uncle?

644
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,090
Hm? Who would say it's wasteful.

645
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:02,970
If I thought of him as a son, I can't tell him to get married soon.

646
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,990
Jae Woo, I'm tired.

647
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,840
Let's rest a little.

648
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,280
Grandma must be feeling tired.

649
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,960
You married well.

650
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,120
Ti-tak, dong!

651
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,460
Honey!

652
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,870
By any chance, has good news arrived for us too?

653
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:38,220
No, it's because the Kimchi smell was too strong.

654
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,750
Sister-in-law thought she had a cold but it turned out to be pregnancy.

655
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,040
Let's go to the hospital.

656
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,120
I said I'm not.

657
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,120
By any chance,

658
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,990
are you looking down on me

659
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,980
because I'm too old?

660
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,880
No, you could be pregnant. Why are you insisting you're not?

661
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,220
Hurting my self-esteem.

662
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,050
-It's not that
-Then, go to the hospital.

663
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,240
Let's go.

664
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,090
No,

665
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,930
I take (birth control) pills.

666
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,780
What?

667
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,900
Why do you take pills without even discussing it with me?

668
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,860
Eun Chan will hear us. Let's talk later.

669
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,280
Eun Chan,

670
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,800
what are you doing here?

671
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,990
Eun Chan said he wants a younger sibling.

672
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,820
Then would he say no if you ask him?

673
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,890
Don't say anything to me. It's something I decided before the wedding.

674
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,150
CEO Nam Goong Yeong

675
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,140
All right then.

676
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,230
Then I'll meet you in the front.

677
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,120
- I don't have an afternoon appointment, right?
-Even if there is, we should move it.

678
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,610
Your eavesdropping. I'm going going to let it slide today.

679
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,400
What's wrong with that guy?

680
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,180
Jeong In Sung!

681
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,540
Did you commit a crime?

682
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,360
Why are you surprised to see me?

683
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,300
Is there something wrong at Da Ae's Mom's house?

684
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,390
What problem?

685
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:26,470
Since Da Ae's mother's book is selling well so I was just wondering.

686
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,750
-This doesn't seem to be about that?
- CEO!

687
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,420
What is it?

688
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,380
I'll be leav...yes.

689
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,900
Who is that person?

690
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,020
- Hotel employee.
- He doesn't seem to be just an employee.

691
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,580
Isn't Da Ae's mom Writer Han?

692
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,690
That's really impressive.

693
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,380
What is?

694
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,930
What would make you take the ex-husband

695
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,740
and give him a job?

696
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,680
- Do you by chance have wings?
- Was this because of my wings?

697
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,360
I thought it was my allergy to bad luck that had me so itchy.

698
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,470
What is it?

699
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,750
I'm going to say one thing because I know it's not me

700
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,830
How can a man be like that?

701
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,420
What did I do?

702
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,840
If you like her you should just go for it.

703
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,830
If I do that I'll get slapped.

704
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,530
Writer Han's hands sting. In her youth

705
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,370
she played volleyball.

706
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,630
For someone who took in her ex-husband,

707
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,600
are you afraid of a slap?

708
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,680
Didn't you see Writer Han's expression yesterday?

709
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,010
How can you date if you're so dense?

710
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,310
What am I suppose to do?

711
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,290
How long are you going to stay here?

712
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,830
I don't know either.

713
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,870
I'm not feeling great lately either.

714
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,540
I want to be alone!

715
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,160
Yet you can't feel worse than me.

716
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,160
Do you still have something you want to say?

717
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,570
What are we going to do if you keep opposing this?

718
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,880
Wasn't this in order to set a wedding date for the kids?

719
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,140
That's something we should discuss slowly.

720
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,940
Send out daughter back home.

721
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,520
My thoughts exactly.

722
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,800
It's difficult for us also.

723
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,420
She won't leave even when we tell her to.

724
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,730
It's because you're taking her in.

725
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,940
Then should I put her out on the streets?

726
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,110
Would you like that?

727
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:03,460
They're saying that they like each other that much,

728
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,930
what can we do about that?

729
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,050
While they are going forward with the marriage even if there is an unsatisfactory situation,

730
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,480
please be understanding-
- Climb one mountain then there is another, they say.

731
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,960
Even In Woo's grandmother is ill, I heard.

732
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,770
Ah, yes.

733
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,350
Don't take it the wrong way.

734
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,910
Aren't all the parents' hearts the same?

735
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,580
That's not right.

736
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,830
You should have told us about something like that in advance.

737
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,690
And the matter about the dowry!

738
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,690
I paid that back already!

739
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,480
I came here because So Lee liked us but why do we have to listen to this?

740
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,970
Did we have the engagement because So Lee alone wanted it?

741
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,870
If you think that way, we should end it even more so!

742
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,230
You, stop it already.

743
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,490
I wish things would settle well.

744
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,400
The parents' will is important in marriage matters.

745
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,510
However, we are not the ones who are getting married.

746
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,290
Do you think you can break your only daughter's stubborn will?

747
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,160
She says she doesn't need any dowry.

748
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,410
She knows about the Grandmother's illness yet she wants to become our family member.

749
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,030
At this point, I don't have any means to stop her.

750
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,090
If you are still against it,

751
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,510
I will consider her as my own daughter. Will that be all right?

752
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,440
Honey.

753
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,400
These days, it seems like I am dreaming everyday.

754
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,290
Is it because of the books are selling well?

755
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,440
Some of it is because of that.

756
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,590
It's embarrassing but

757
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,910
at some point I became curious about you.

758
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,310
And I started to feel jealous.

759
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,880
When we date like this,

760
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,980
my heart fluttered.

761
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,570
When we did the interview with the reporters,

762
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,190
I really thought you were Prince Charming.

763
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,470
Well,

764
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,820
as much as Prince Charming?

765
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,470
It was a good dream.

766
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,520
Even when I woke up, I felt good...

767
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,340
CEO, you said I made you comfortable, right?

768
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,760
So, I will tell you everything.

769
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,680
My Da Ae, says that she won't have a baby.

770
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,550
Because of Eun Chan.

771
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,690
I am so frustrated.

772
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,380
I don't know why she would give up having a baby when she can.

773
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,960
So, I am going to try convincing her not to.

774
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,630
So, you're going to

775
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,660
tell me to get married, have a baby and come?

776
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,420
Is that what you're trying to say?

777
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,310
That...

778
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:54,300
I'm not just saying that out of anger, but what I really feel.

779
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,430
I know it makes no sense, but

780
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,450
if that could happen,

781
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,940
I wish it really would happen.

782
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,290
Then every time we meet,

783
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,170
I wouldn't feel sorry.

784
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,180
What is the problem when I'm saying it's fine?

785
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,910
It's me.

786
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,660
Chairman, don't you want to do everything for me?

787
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,710
I feel the same.

788
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,880
However,

789
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,110
no matter how much I think about it, there's nothing I can do for you.

790
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,450
Writer Han!

791
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,680
It was really hard raising Da Ae, Da Jeong and Da In.

792
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,560
Even so, I was really happy.

793
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,430
I would really like for you to experience that happiness.

794
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,060
You should have been a little less good to me.

795
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,640
Then I might have held onto you.

796
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,900
At this age where would I meet Prince Charming?

797
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:12,270
♫ Even if I step closer like this,  ♫

798
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:19,480
♫ My heart beats fast,  ♫

799
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,500
♫ As time flows by,  ♫

800
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:32,130
♫ My heart is falling deeper and deeper,  ♫

801
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:39,440
♫ Do you not know, this heart,  ♫

802
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:48,000
♫ Your other half that heaven has decided,  ♫

803
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:55,490
♫ Although I may be a bit late, slowly, more slowly,  ♫

804
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:03,830
♫ Do you want to open your empty space,  ♫

805
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:11,620
♫ I love you just like this,  ♫

806
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,610
Will it be okay even if I'm not there?

807
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,780
Are you still worried when I said that I'd go instead?

808
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:34,220
Only I know the secret tips to the rice cake.

809
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,420
That's true.

810
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,550
Fine, rest well and you have to make sure to come later in the morning.

811
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,200
Yes!

812
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,280
See, without me the ddeok (rice cake) shop won't function properly.

813
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,080
- Still...
- All right.

814
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,670
- Go and return.
- Okay.

815
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,300
- Go and return.
- Okay. Great.

816
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,060
Let's go inside.

817
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,810
That car, isn't it Uncle's?

818
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:02,990
Oh, you're right.

819
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,680
Uncle!

820
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,910
- What are you doing?
- Something terrible will happen if you sleep here.

821
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,080
I was close by and

822
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,310
I was sleepy and told myself I'd just rest for a bit...

823
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,670
I dozed off.

824
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,650
You should go inside the house.

825
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,660
- Get off.
-No.

826
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,400
I slept well. I'm going.

827
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,260
Well...

828
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,500
I don't like it.

829
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,000
Why?

830
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:55,070
Sister-In-Law, you like Uncle Yeong.

831
00:51:55,070 --> 00:52:02,180
I do like him but if she gets married to him, family structure will get more confused.

832
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,670
What will get confused?

833
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:10,410
Father's last name is Jeong. My last name is Han. And the new Father's last name will be Nam Goong. Isn't that confusing?

834
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,190
Da In. It's not like Mom wants to get married right away.

835
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,310
Let's cheer on Mom and Uncle.

836
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,920
Of course. We are on board.

837
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,180
And, getting married is not that easy a thing to decide.

838
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,640
I know you are having a hard time but do you want Mom to live alone for the rest of her life?

839
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,810
All of you agree, right? Then, you don't have to ask me.

840
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,090
Come on, Sister-In-law.

841
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,280
Why are you acting like that?

842
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,540
I don't know. These days, I don't like anything.

843
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,960
Sister-In-Law.
-Da In.

844
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,520
She's sensitive. Is there something going on?

845
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,700
It's hard to accept the matter of a parent's remarriage.

846
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:03,510
But how did you get the sense about Mom and Uncle?

847
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,640
I'm pretty quick on the uptake.

848
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,190
There is a thing called woman's intuition.

849
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,010
How should we help out?

850
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,080
The lamp post and the wooden bench...

851
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,400
liked each other.

852
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,660
Eun Chan.

853
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,660
Yes?

854
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,430
What are you thinking about?

855
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,990
Nothing. Can you read it to me again?

856
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,700
Do you have secrets that you are keeping from your Grandmother?

857
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,730
Grandmother.

858
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,750
Is it nice to have a younger sibling?

859
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,900
Of course.

860
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,340
You will be getting the best friend of your life.

861
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,660
How is that a friend?

862
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,770
- Da In.
-Mom, just what are you doing these days?

863
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,160
You have no concern about what I am thinking about, right?

864
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,930
Da In. Where are you going, Da In?

865
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,510
Da Ae, why is she like this these days? Is there some sort of a problem?

866
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:17,670
I don't know. She's been strange lately.

867
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,540
Who is it?

868
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,200
Hey. Who is it?

869
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,240
Hey. Where are you going?

870
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,760
Da In was here.

871
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,140
Da In...

872
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,700
I don't think it should end this way.

873
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,670
Hey, Hee Joo. Hee Joo.

874
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,860
So Lee, you really want to become our family member, right?

875
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,520
Yes.

876
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,380
In Woo, you want to marry So Lee.

877
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,000
Right?

878
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,200
Yes.

879
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,210
So Lee, you are going to have to brace yourself. Your Father-In-Law wants to make you his daughter.

880
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,040
What?

881
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,220
- Dad!
-Yesterday, I met with So Lee's parents.

882
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:22,910
If you two want, I will let you have the wedding.

883
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,510
Da In.

884
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,160
Da In!

885
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,290
Da In.

886
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,830
Open the door. Talk to your mom, okay?

887
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,090
Da In.

888
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,510
Da In. Da In?

889
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,610
Han Song Jeong. Da Ae. Da Jeong.

890
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,530
Da In...

891
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,840
Ji Ho is not answering.

892
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,330
I think he has it on vibration mode.

893
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,200
Did she fight with Ji Ho?

894
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,600
Mother, don't you have the keys to the room? Let's just open the door and go in.

895
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,300
Let her be. We can can hear her cry.

896
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,210
Do you know Hee Joo's phone number? Hee Joo must know why she is like that.

897
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,220
- Hee Joo?
-That's right.

898
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,910
Hee Joo said he was going to the military service. Is she saddened by that?

899
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,040
I know his number.

900
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,240
I will try to get in touch with him.

901
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,600
Oh, wait...

902
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,030
Oh, he's here.

903
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,400
= Hee Joo.
-Hee Joo.

904
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,080
Hee Joo, did something happen to Da In?

905
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,330
I'm sorry.

906
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,850
Hee Joo.

907
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,960
What is this?

908
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,430
What I did was wrong.

909
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:42,570
Why are you doing that?

910
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,400
What I did was wrong.

911
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,950
Hee Joo, what did you do wrong?

912
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:01,110
My name is Jeong Hee Joo.

913
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,680
Jeong Hee Joo, you shouldn't come here. Do you know where this is?

914
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,370
I don't want to see you. Get out of here immediately!

915
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,880
Da In.

916
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,160
I have something to give you, Writer Han.

917
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,560
What is this?

918
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,010
My Mother...before she passed away.

919
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,390
It's her will.

920
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,120
But why are you giving this to me?

921
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,400
What I did was wrong.

922
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,360
What I did was wrong.

923
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,320
What is this guy trying to do all by himself?

924
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,320
If I go in, it's going to be a battlefield.

925
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,370
Why is Hee Joo giving his Mother's will to you?

926
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,940
Hee Joo. Are you perhaps...

927
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,820
Perhaps...you're not, right?

928
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,080
Get up, you punk.

929
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,210
Why are you kneeling?

930
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,900
What did you do wrong?

931
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,030
Hey, you punk.

932
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,030
Besides the fact that you are my son, what did you do so wrong?

933
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:13,560
I am the one who did wrong.

934
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,580
I lived the wrong way.

935
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,170
Father.

936
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,520
I'm sorry.

937
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,870
I did wrong.

938
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:47,820
Get up.

939
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,330
Here, Writer Han...

940
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,170
Get up.

941
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,970
Don't show yourself in front of the children this way and get up!

942
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:17,930
♫ Don't you know? ♫

943
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:24,390
♫ This heart of mine. The one that Heaven decided. ♫

944
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,920
Preview

945
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,910
If you had a Father, what did you want to do the most?

946
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,360
Hey, just help me.

947
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,800
Let's marry off Song Jeong. Yeong likes her.

948
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,950
How did you seduce Uncle so that...

949
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,750
What do you mean seduce? He says he likes me even if I am just there.

950
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:43,070
And do I have to live alone for the rest of my life?!

951
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,350
Who are you that you come into my yard all of a sudden?

952
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,800
Grandmother, you don't know who he is?
