1
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,586
Whoo!

2
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:28,152
Yeah!

3
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:23,770

4
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,399
The waltz was revolutionary
in the late 18th century

5
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,568
because it was the first time
couples faced each other

6
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,504
when they danced.

7
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,773
It was a scandalous display

8
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,875
of public intimacy.

9
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:41,143
Public intimacy--
I like it.

10
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,144
Count!

11
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,579
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

12
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,281
He's stepping on me.

13
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,616
- That's not true.
- You just keep

14
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,484
putting your feet underneath
mine when I lift them.

15
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,454
You know where I'm gonna put my foot?
Why are we doing this?

16
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:56,258
Because you need to face each
other and try to work together.

17
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,459
We do work together.

18
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,928
Yes, not always harmoniously.

19
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:01,763
Couldn't we do something like
synchronized swimming instead?

20
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,098
Deeks.
What?

21
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,099
It's just like this,

22
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,434
except for you would be in a bikini.

23
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,301
Ouch!

24
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,402
Sorry.

25
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,271
I was thinking about bikinis.

26
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:10,806
I'm listening!

27
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:11,807
Ready?

28
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:12,841
One, two, three.

29
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,177
Posture, grace,

30
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:16,678
floating as one.

31
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:18,647
It's kind of hard to float
when you're in heels. Ow.

32
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,748
Think of your partner.

33
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:21,049
Well, it's kind of hard

34
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,751
when all she keeps talking about

35
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,653
is high heels and bikinis.

36
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,655
Maybe Kensi should lead.
Isn't that what she's doing?

37
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,689
Really?

38
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:31,026
I would love to teach the two of you

39
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,729
the traditional Viennese waltz,

40
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,464
with each other as partners.

41
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:44,072
She's kidding.

42
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,311
No, she's not.

43
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:50,979
Agent Hanna,

44
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:53,882
take your partner by the waist,

45
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,084
back straight.

46
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,254
Do I need to repeat myself?

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,589
Hetty, you...

48
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,357
Hetty.

49
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,359
Sorry, guys, but approval's

50
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,427
just come in, Hetty.

51
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,696
NCIS has been granted

52
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,765
permission to enter Mexico.

53
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,301
Well, you'll be briefed en route.

54
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,003
Grab your go bags.

55
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,506
Wheels up in 20 minutes.

56
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,207
And make sure to return
the heels, Ms. Blye.

57
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,743
You guys owe me big-time.

58
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,512
Anything you need.

59
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,379
Anytime you need it.

60
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,866
Señor Hector Ramirez.

61
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,596
I.D. matches.

62
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,366
Seaman Brandon Davis.

63
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:20,001
He was reported for
unauthorized absence

64
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,037
from the <i>USS Enterprise</i> six weeks ago

65
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,772
when the carrier was stationed
off the coast of Sudan.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,806
Hmm.

67
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,875
He's a long way from North Africa.

68
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,113
Huh.

69
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:34,783
What makes this guy so special?

70
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,084
The company he keeps.

71
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:37,085
You know him?

72
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,086
Paul Green.

73
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:39,187
He's a British arms dealer.

74
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,723
Sells to Al-Qaeda,
Hamas, Hezbollah.

75
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,159
Motorcycle tracks come from the South.

76
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,795
Looks like they lead north
to the U.S. border.

77
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,633
We're looking for a wooden box

78
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,835
roughly foot-and-a-half long,
a foot wide,

79
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,370
about six inches high.

80
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,009
No.

81
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,645
Box is long gone.

82
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:05,046
Drag marks.

83
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,615
Something heavy.

84
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,584
Case of handguns isn't worth
dragging across the desert.

85
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,259
Got a shell casing.

86
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,929
Choke marks.

87
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:23,131
Green's got them, too.

88
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,667
Okay, so one bike goes down.

89
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:28,169
Green and Davis fight over
who's gonna be left behind.

90
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:30,171
More like who's gonna keep the box.

91
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,575
Davis wins, then somebody
shoots him from over there.

92
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,044
It's got to be over 400 meters away.

93
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,980
7.62 caliber.

94
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,015
Shooter's no knucklehead.

95
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:41,383
He knows what he's doing.

96
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,617
These ATV tracks--

97
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:44,286
they lead north, too.

98
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:45,854
To the U.S. border.

99
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,489
Okay, so what's this all about?

100
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,591
Whatever's inside that box.

101
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,093
Border's four miles away.

102
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,563
Whatever's inside that box
is already inside the country.

103
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,134
You two follow the
shooter's ATV tracks.

104
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:04,706
<i>Gracias.</i>
Okay, you know how

105
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,107
I don't do well over 100 degrees.

106
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,409
I get xerosis.

107
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,476
Deeks, that sounds like an STD.

108
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:09,477
No, no, not an STD.

109
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,279
It's dry and scaly skin.

110
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,514
Like a lizard.

111
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,782
Lizards love the desert.

112
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:18,253
You don't have any sunscreen, do you?

113
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:22,424
Preferably something with, like,
a moisturizer, hypo-allergenic.

114
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,631
I can't believe he's gone.

115
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,600
We were high school sweethearts.

116
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,636
How long were you married to Brandon?

117
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,204
Three years.

118
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,707
Had you heard from
him since he went UA?

119
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,275
No.

120
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,777
I told the MPs this
a hundred times already.

121
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,179
I'm not believing it.

122
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:48,950
Because he went UA,
I don't even get his pay now.

123
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:51,052
Karen, Brandon's body

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,921
was found with an arms dealer

125
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,390
affiliated with several
terrorist organizations.

126
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,460
We think they
were trying to smuggle

127
00:07:58,527 --> 00:07:59,894
something into the country.

128
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,063
It's a matter

129
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,065
of national security.

130
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,600
You don't need
to protect him anymore.

131
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,303
Unless you're involved.

132
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,904
I wasn't involved.

133
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,773
But you do know something.

134
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:21,783
Somebody was paying Brandon
to take a box from Sudan

135
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:25,954
across the ocean on a cargo ship
into Guatemala and up here.

136
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:29,491
He said it was like
private security work.

137
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:32,060
If you're sneaking across the
border, it's not security work.

138
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,796
We had no money.

139
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,766
And... I'm pregnant again.

140
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,698
So, he said

141
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,913
we'd never have to work
another day in our lives.

142
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,339
For bringing one box into the country?

143
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,977
He said he wanted me
to be ready to leave town

144
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,379
and not tell anybody
where I was going.

145
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:56,151
Knowing Brandon,

146
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,853
I think he was going to steal the box

147
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,655
when he crossed the border.

148
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,357
Do you know what was in it?

149
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,528
Everything we'd ever want.

150
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:09,731
All our dreams.

151
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,268
You want to share?

152
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,807
The box was filled with gold.

153
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,675
My cop instincts are
definitely kicking in.

154
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,176
Yeah, what are they telling you?

155
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,511
Something isn't right.

156
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,713
Wait a second.

157
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:43,482
Why'd they stop following us?

158
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,654
Is it 'cause of the wolves?

159
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,519
Yeah? Are there
wolves out here?

160
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,292
Awesome.

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,327
Ever heard of the Chupacabra?
Yes.

162
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:54,596
Body of a bear,
the spine of a stegosaurus,

163
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:57,066
claws like an eagle, lives in
the desert, eats tourists?

164
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,267
You are Shaggy
from <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

165
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,002
No, no, they call this
the Devil's Path.

166
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,236
This area is so dangerous,

167
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,704
the Mexican police
don't even come here.

168
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:06,708
Okay, this area, Deeks,
is the United States of America.

169
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:08,277
What? We're in America?

170
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:09,978
Yes! That's why
they stopped following us.

171
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,413
The border's right back there.

172
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,215
Oh, well, that's fantastic news.

173
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:13,916
Oh, no!

174
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,586
It's a wild boar. Shh!

175
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:20,422
Think it's a feral pig.

176
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,257
No, no, no, don't look at it directly.

177
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:23,592
Show submission.

178
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,627
Just walk away very quietly.

179
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:27,329
Whoa, what the hell?

180
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,898
Whoa.

181
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,467
It's following you.

182
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,936
What does he want?

183
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:36,472
I think <i>she's</i> in love with you.

184
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,075
Oh. Well, of course she is.

185
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,310
You want to know why?

186
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,445
Because <i>she</i> has fantastic taste.

187
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:44,780
Here, pretty girl.

188
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,515
Huh? What's your name?

189
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,616
You come to the desert often?

190
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:48,917
I bet you do.

191
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:49,918
You keep it toned?

192
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:51,620
You look good.

193
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:52,688
Hey, Deeks.

194
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:55,157
Think I found something.

195
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,625
All right, you stay here.
Don't go changing.

196
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,659
I got cop work.

197
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,161
What do you got?

198
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:02,030
ATV tracks stop here,

199
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,133
but the truck tracks start there.

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,934
There could have been
a ramp right here.

201
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,737
Looks like he put the ATV in
the back of a pickup truck

202
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,572
and headed north to the highway.

203
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,174
Hang on, baby.

204
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,577
<i>¿Señor Deeks, cómo está?</i>

205
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:17,880
Eric, I'm sending some pics
to my skydrive.

206
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,249
<i>Bueno.</i>
See if you can I.D. the tracks.

207
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,550
All right, pork chop, can you describe

208
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,985
the bad guys in the truck?

209
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,419
Can you describe them?

210
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,388
Uh-huh. And what about the other one?

211
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,525
Ah, Kensi, I-I think,
I think she saw one of them.

212
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,426
All right, got a match.

213
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:35,397
BF Goodrich 245/75R17.

214
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:38,100
Comes standard
on six different trucks.

215
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:41,103
But only one with dual rear wheels.

216
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:43,372
Ford F-350.

217
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,706
Eric, also take a look at the tapes

218
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:45,874
from the cameras on Interstate 8.

219
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:47,176
It's the first highway north of here.

220
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:48,410
And go back about 24 hours.

221
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:49,511
Will do.

222
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:50,979
Thanks.

223
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,514
You going to put lipstick on that pig?

224
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,549
Don't you listen to her.

225
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,883
She's just jealous.

226
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:56,518
Don't make promises you can't keep.

227
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:58,420
I'll see you soon.
You're beautiful.

228
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,489
I'll miss you.

229
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:03,458
See, I know how
to let a girl down easy.

230
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:05,194
With respect and honesty.

231
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:06,929
Yeah, you change your
cell phone number.

232
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:08,897
That's why I don't give them
my home address.

233
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:10,265
Aha.

234
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,201
That's why she likes you.

235
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,535
Why is that?

236
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:15,537
Same species.

237
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,272
<i>You get the ballistics report</i>

238
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,241
on the round taken
from the dead seaman?

239
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,542
Coming in now.

240
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,311
The ammo was a custom load.

241
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,745
Shooter's a pro.

242
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,515
Somebody knew the box
was coming across the border,

243
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,750
sent the shooter
to kill the two couriers.

244
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,018
And take the gold.

245
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,820
Nell, how much gold
are we talking about?

246
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,388
Well, from the cell phone video,

247
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:37,626
the box was roughly nine
by 16 inches, six inches tall.

248
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,661
That would make it about 300 pounds,

249
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:41,763
for a value of...

250
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,968
Looks like someone
has a secret admirer.

251
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,006
Uh, we're somewhere in the ballpark

252
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,841
of eight-and-a-half
million dollars.

253
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,209
Whoa.

254
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:55,544
Arms dealer?

255
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,312
Bringing it in to buy more weapons?

256
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,248
Or it could be a payment from a sale.

257
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:01,216
Why take a chance with all that money,

258
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:03,518
taking it across open desert?

259
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,354
So, working off the
estimated time of death

260
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,957
of seaman Davis, there's only
one Ford F-350 with dual wheels

261
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,259
heading west on Interstate 8.

262
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:12,527
I traced the license plate
to an auto repair shop

263
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,396
in east L.A.,
and according to L.A...

264
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,598
Nice flowers.

265
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,166
Eric.

266
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:20,202
Sorry.

267
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,338
Uh, according to LAPD, um, the shop

268
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:26,008
is owned and operated
by members of the La Masa

269
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:28,043
Mexican drug cartel.

270
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:29,811
Address is on your phones.
Thanks, Eric.

271
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,851
Happy Birthday.

272
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,886
Not my birthday.

273
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,788
I actually knew that.

274
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,891
Uh, so the flowers are for...?

275
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,793
No occasion.

276
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:48,730
So somebody sent you flowers
just because.

277
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:50,032
Uh-huh.

278
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:54,202
So somebody did send them.

279
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,772
No, they just grew there.

280
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:59,741
Why are you so surprised

281
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,510
that somebody would send me flowers?

282
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,113
I'm actually not surprised.

283
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,051
At all.

284
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,718
Shooter's truck.

285
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,354
License matches.

286
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,690
What do you guys want?

287
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:50,559
Federal agents.

288
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,028
We got a couple questions
about that truck.

289
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,763
We can't answer any questions.

290
00:14:57,633 --> 00:14:58,700
You got a carry permit for that?

291
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,035
Yes, I do.

292
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:01,236
You just answered a question.

293
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,771
You answer questions very well.

294
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,473
You shouldn't underestimate yourself.

295
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,742
So why don't you give us
the key to that truck,

296
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,577
or we can all wait
around here for a warrant.

297
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:10,779
If that happens, who knows
what else we'll find here?

298
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,214
I'm pretty sure
you know the drill.

299
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,783
One phone call-- hour
and a half, tops.

300
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:16,385
It's all done electronically now.

301
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,487
You'll have a dozen agents
crawling all over this place.

302
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,255
Well, you do what you got to do.

303
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:22,324
But I'm asking you to leave...

304
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,359
Now.

305
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:43,712
They got drugs or cash
on this property,

306
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,981
and they're not going to
want to lose it to a search.

307
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:48,583
Guess they're not going
to let us drive out of here.

308
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,052
You got them?
Yeah, I got them.

309
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,994
You okay?

310
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,329
Yeah.

311
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:35,697
You?

312
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,733
- Excuse me.
- Little help here.

313
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,409
Hi.
What's your name?

314
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,410
Jaime.

315
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:49,711
I don't got a gun.

316
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:50,912
You okay?

317
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,380
I'm great.

318
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,915
I just can't breathe.

319
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,685
You don't realize how heavy

320
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:58,520
a car is until you're under it, huh?

321
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,423
Yeah, I guess not.

322
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,628
Clear?
Yeah.

323
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:08,864
Come on.

324
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,069
You good?
Yeah.

325
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:16,171
You guys know
I wasn't shooting at you, right?

326
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,405
For that, we thank you.

327
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:18,707
Can we ask you a question?

328
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:20,242
I'm not supposed to talk to cops.

329
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,843
Well, don't think of us as cops.

330
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:23,678
Think of us as the guys
who just saved your life.

331
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:24,980
Means you owe us, Jaime.

332
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,448
Who owns that red truck?

333
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,016
My boss.

334
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,251
Where's he?

335
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,453
Been in Mexico for the last week.

336
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:34,456
Did you maybe lend that truck
to someone, say,

337
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,957
day before yesterday?

338
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:37,359
Come on, guys.

339
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,860
Do you have any idea

340
00:17:38,928 --> 00:17:42,430
how horrible it would have been
to be crushed under this truck?

341
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:44,099
Your insides would
have squirted out like

342
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,400
a broken toothpaste tube.

343
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,135
Who'd you lend the truck to?

344
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:50,272
My boss was hired by somebody--

345
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,874
I don't know who--
to steal some box.

346
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:54,543
So he sent his guy.

347
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,044
Name?

348
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:57,746
Hey, you got to understand,

349
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:00,115
nobody trusts me
with important information.

350
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:01,583
And that's their mistake.

351
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,552
They're clearly not a
good judge of character.

352
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,022
Your boss sent his guy who...?

353
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,357
He does the, you know, the...

354
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:10,392
hits for him?

355
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:11,626
Yeah.

356
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:14,563
So one might call him a hit man?

357
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,364
Yeah.

358
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:19,668
He went down to the border
to kill these two guys

359
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:23,638
and take the box in exchange
for half of the contents.

360
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,407
Thank you, Jaime.

361
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:27,242
Now we have to cuff you.
With handcuffs?

362
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,679
Uh, most likely.

363
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,614
I still owe you guys?

364
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:35,483
Jaime, we saved your life.

365
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,420
That's a big debt to pay.

366
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,822
Where did your boss hide the gold?

367
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,991
Gold? What gold?

368
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,092
From the box.

369
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,827
There's no gold in the box.

370
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,332
You remember what was in it?

371
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,467
Of course I do.
I'm not stupid.

372
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,070
We don't think you're stupid.

373
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:56,204
Jaime,

374
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:58,440
we're your biggest fans.

375
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,108
Now, what was in the box?

376
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,477
Brown heroin.

377
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,579
We're a drug cartel, homes.

378
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,414
Damn, you guys don't know nothing!

379
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:10,518
I guess we don't.

380
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,633
So he does hits for the cartel.

381
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,535
Picks up the car for the job

382
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:25,655
and then he drops it back
with you at the garage.

383
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,674
Yeah. I only saw the guy
maybe four times.

384
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:31,109
What's he look like?

385
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:33,045
He looks full-on Indian.

386
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:35,213
But I heard he was part Mexican.

387
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,616
If he wasn't part Mexican,
he don't work for us.

388
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,484
Are we even yet?

389
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:40,952
Close.

390
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,220
Is there anything else

391
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:43,789
you can tell me about him?

392
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:44,790
Anything at all?

393
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:48,160
Slick, dresses nice,

394
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,028
makes very good money killing people.

395
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:52,898
There's always work
when you got skills.

396
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,132
Truth.

397
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,202
Jaime, I don't want
you to hurt yourself,

398
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,171
but I want you to try

399
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,540
really hard to think about
what he looked like.

400
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,311
He wore red cowboy boots.

401
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,046
And he had these

402
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:11,516
badass wristbands with
a monkey on it, held bullets.

403
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,352
Eric, there's a shop
called red monkey;

404
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,686
they do leather work for bikers

405
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:15,687
and rock stars.

406
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,255
You should check it out.

407
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,827
Very low-level
encryption.

408
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:23,595
Give me a minute to break it.

409
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,063
And logo's coming

410
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,132
to your phone.

411
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,236
That's it.

412
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:32,904
Badass, right?

413
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,506
Badass as Matthew Broderick.

414
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:36,608
Who's Matthew Broderick?

415
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,210
A badass.

416
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:39,644
I'm in.

417
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:42,180
Looking at the Internet
sales orders for red monkey.

418
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:44,783
Looks like the wrist bandoleros

419
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,585
were custom orders.
Hmm.

420
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,019
They only made three.

421
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,022
One went to Florida,
the other to Europe...

422
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,792
And wouldn't you know it, one
has an address in downtown L.A.

423
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,061
Coming to your phones.

424
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:59,064
You know what, Jaime,
I think we're even.

425
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,867
My debt for you
saving my life is paid?

426
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:02,701
Yep.

427
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,636
Oh, that's great.

428
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,605
'Cause I don't think
I know anything else.

429
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,306
About anything.
Yeah.

430
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,307
Thank you.

431
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,308
Thanks.

432
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,943
It's been real.

433
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:14,112
Yeah.

434
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,547
Hey, you guys are cool.

435
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,616
So are you.
Huh.

436
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,662
Hey, guys!

437
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,165
Little help here!

438
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,699
So you in a thing now?

439
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:39,738
Like, uh, with another person.

440
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:40,739
Like, a relationsh...

441
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:42,974
<i>Don't</i> say the r word.

442
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:46,344
I don't have to be in a...

443
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:48,747
In a R word.

444
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,515
...To get flowers.

445
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,184
No. No, of course not.

446
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:53,952
You could-- I mean,
you could get flowers

447
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,620
for a lot of other reasons.

448
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,022
A lot of other reasons.

449
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,290
Like if I was...

450
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:00,025
Like if you... die.

451
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:01,326
There you go.

452
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:04,229
Mm-hmm. Or if you
have major surgery.

453
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,864
There's another one.

454
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,333
Have you had major surgery?

455
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:10,769
I have not.

456
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:13,505
And you are clearly not dead.

457
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:15,774
Well...

458
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,977
So that, uh, leaves the "R" word.

459
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,212
Uh-huh.

460
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,280
I have to go talk to Hetty.

461
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:35,060
Wow.

462
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:37,195
- Penthouse.
- Somebody's getting paid.

463
00:22:37,263 --> 00:22:39,364
Yeah. Look at this place.

464
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,358
Federal agents!

465
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,462
I got a body.

466
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,696
Bedroom's clear.

467
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,765
- Clear.
- Clear.

468
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:17,903
He's dead.

469
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,338
Slightly warm.

470
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,507
Red cowboy boots, wristbands.

471
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,243
No obvious cause of death.

472
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:28,413
Anybody else noticing
a reoccurring motif

473
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:29,781
in all these paintings?

474
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:32,150
Rifle's a 7.62 caliber.

475
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,519
High-powered scope.

476
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:37,022
Probably the weapon
that killed Brandon Davis.

477
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:39,758
He's got some kind of powder
around his nose.

478
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:41,192
We got powder here, too.

479
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,963
Looks like he might've
taken a taste and died happy.

480
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,101
Eric.

481
00:23:52,104 --> 00:23:55,373
Eric!

482
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:58,810
Comms are down--
too much steel.

483
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:00,445
What's up, G?

484
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,583
Where is the box?

485
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,519
Couple hundred pounds--
that's like moving a safe.

486
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:09,487
That's not exactly
a one-man job.

487
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,655
Uh...

488
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:12,791
Somebody used a dolly.

489
00:24:12,858 --> 00:24:15,093
Indents lead straight out the door.

490
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:21,633
Let's check the building
security cameras.

491
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:28,640
That's our box.

492
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,442
It's the same floor as the shooter.

493
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:34,512
I recognize that.
What?

494
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,981
Can you zoom in on his face?

495
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:38,016
On this guy.

496
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,620
Sudanese tribal scars.

497
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,122
So someone from Sudan

498
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,925
pays Davis and Green to
bring a box into the U.S.

499
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,460
They think it's gold.

500
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:50,395
Then somebody pays a Mexican drug gang

501
00:24:50,463 --> 00:24:52,998
to steal it
because it's really heroin.

502
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:55,800
But then the Sudanese
steal the box back.

503
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:57,669
Something's still missing here.

504
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:00,205
Is this a live feed?

505
00:25:00,272 --> 00:25:02,173
Yeah.

506
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,877
He's working the lock.

507
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:07,545
Could be one of the Sudanese.

508
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:08,813
Maybe they're coming back.

509
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,148
Maybe they forgot something
in the apartment.

510
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:15,620
Kensi, Deeks.

511
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:18,223
Comms are still down.

512
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:42,981
Hey, Sam?

513
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,416
Kensi, you've got company.

514
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:45,450
Kensi...
Hang up.

515
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:48,119
Please, don't make a sound.

516
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:50,755
Are you digging the art
in this place as much as I am?

517
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:53,558
I mean, it's bold, and it's cool.

518
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,560
I mean, why isn't there
more cool art, you know?

519
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:57,696
Oh, there's another one.
I want to show you this one.

520
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,097
This is my favorite

521
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:01,800
'cause it's the perfect
combination of girls and guns.

522
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:05,470
Let me make this perfectly clear:

523
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:06,805
If you harm her,

524
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:08,440
this is going to be
your last day on earth.

525
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:09,974
Who are you?

526
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,509
Federal agents.

527
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,578
Drop your weapon.

528
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:15,880
Agent Sam Hanna.

529
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,248
Turn around,

530
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:19,284
slowly.

531
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,459
Michael.

532
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,364
So this is Michael Saleh?

533
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:34,566
Nice to finally meet you.

534
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:36,134
And you, too,
agent G. Callen.

535
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,535
You know what this is?
This is warm and cuddly,

536
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:39,671
but we're forgetting he nearly
just killed my partner.

537
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:43,508
Meet CIA operations officer
Michael Saleh.

538
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,710
Wish I could say it was a pleasure.

539
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:46,878
Sorry about that.

540
00:26:46,946 --> 00:26:49,914
Wait, and you guys
know each other how?

541
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,349
Michael and I have been working
undercover in Sudan

542
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,618
on the CIA task force for over a year.

543
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:54,819
Over a year?

544
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:56,588
Oh, so that's what those

545
00:26:56,655 --> 00:26:57,889
long-weekend dive trips were.

546
00:26:57,957 --> 00:26:59,891
When you went to Cancun
with my SEAL buddies.

547
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,426
It actually makes me feel
a lot better,

548
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,627
knowing why I wasn't invited.

549
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:04,262
That's not why you weren't invited.

550
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,597
Uh, uh, don't speak 'cause right now

551
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,332
I'm feeling really good
about our friendship.

552
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,667
So... this is Deeks?

553
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:11,402
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, this is...

554
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,537
Wait, what did he tell you about me?

555
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,738
Nothing.
No, come on.

556
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,807
Well, he once mentioned something

557
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,442
about falling in the canal in Venice.

558
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,844
The cana...the canal. That was...

559
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:21,045
You remember that.

560
00:27:21,113 --> 00:27:22,313
That was a good time.
Yeah.

561
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,149
Phew.
Good time.

562
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:28,319
I've been tracking this box
since it left the Sudan,

563
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,854
into Guatemala and into Mexico.

564
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,157
They kill him?

565
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,826
My guess is, he snorted the heroin.

566
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,060
He snorted it?

567
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:39,597
There was no heroin in that box.

568
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,733
So, what was in it, then?

569
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:47,272
He died from radiation poisoning.

570
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,540
The box wasn't filled

571
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,375
with gold or heroin.

572
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,462
The box was filled with uranium.

573
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,521
Sudan contains the third-largest
supply of uranium in the world.

574
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,257
The uranium ore was shipped from Sudan

575
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,427
to Iran, and returned to the
Sudan in a highly refined state.

576
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,129
Looks like powder-- that's why
the shooter snorted it.

577
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,530
So Al-Qaeda hired others

578
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,132
to transport
the uranium-filled box

579
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,434
because constant exposure
to the uranium will kill you.

580
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,836
Everybody that gets close to it dies?

581
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,938
No, they were carrying it close
to their bodies for weeks;

582
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,408
short-term exposures
won't hurt you.

583
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,410
Everybody was told there was
something else in the box.

584
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,346
Their greed motivating them
down the garden path.

585
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,348
You recognize any of these guys

586
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,716
from the elevator surveillance tape?

587
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,284
They stole the box
from the shooter's apartment.

588
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,653
No. They don't look like

589
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,689
any known Al-Qaeda operatives
from the Sudan.

590
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,390
They could've come
to the U.S. years ago.

591
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,593
They may have green cards
and citizenship by now.

592
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,962
So, what are we looking at here,
a dirty bomb?

593
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,531
From the residue on the table
I don't think so.

594
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,132
The powder was too fine,

595
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,201
the dispersal pattern would be small.

596
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,402
Then what's it for?

597
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,242
Oh, look at that.

598
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,911
Oh, yeah. A little-little gift.

599
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,245
Hmm.

600
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,915
Did you have a surgical
procedure in the last hour?

601
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,249
Uh, no.

602
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,819
And I am not dead,
in case you were wondering.

603
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,454
See, 'cause that's funny

604
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,457
that we both got flowers
on the same day.

605
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,625
It's odd, isn't it?

606
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,626
It's a real coincidence.

607
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:23,794
It's weird.

608
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,129
It's very weird.
Mm-hmm.

609
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,764
You might say.

610
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,775
Okay, I sent the flowers to myself.

611
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,144
Oh.

612
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,546
I really like flowers,

613
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,815
and no one has sent them
to me in a long time,

614
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,484
so I sent them to myself.

615
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,086
That's great.

616
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,855
Why is that great?

617
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,022
No, it's not great.

618
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,557
It's, um...

619
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,962
It's sad... it's sad that you
sent them to yourself.

620
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,830
Like you did?

621
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,165
I...

622
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,134
I didn't send anything to my...

623
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,269
I don't...
Okay.

624
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,404
Okay...

625
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,974
I gave the flower to myself.

626
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,909
I'm shocked.

627
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,045
I mean, I know why I sent
the flowers to myself,

628
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:18,883
so... what's your excuse?

629
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,153
When I saw that someone else
had given you flowers, I...

630
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,621
I-I felt...

631
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,855
Um...

632
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,690
Competitive?

633
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,726
Competitive.
I felt competitive.

634
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:29,927
Competitive with you.

635
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,495
That's a good word for it.

636
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:36,167
So, I took the flower
from Hetty's desk.

637
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,835
You took a flower from Hetty's desk.

638
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,236
Yeah.

639
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,238
She cuts them herself.
It's a big bunch.

640
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,706
Hetty will never miss it.

641
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,542
Hm-hmm.

642
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,445
I'm doomed, aren't I?

643
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:56,420
You sacrificed yourself
to compete with me.

644
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,226
Facial-recognition

645
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,195
got a hit on one of the guys
from the elevator.

646
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,730
He's got a Sudanese passport.

647
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,499
Samir Abbas.

648
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,168
Samir Abbas.

649
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,504
I have a home address
and work address.

650
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,006
Currently working at Anderson & Kirk's

651
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,776
Technical Services.

652
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,111
So, what's going on?

653
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,881
I'm pretty sure my cover
in the Sudan was compromised.

654
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,384
How?

655
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,920
There may be a leak inside the agency.

656
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,222
Any idea who?

657
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,857
I don't know.

658
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,260
You're not CIA...

659
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,229
I believe your cover is still safe.

660
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,931
But I can't go back to the Sudan.

661
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,766
Of course not.

662
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,202
It means

663
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,737
when you return,

664
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:50,641
you're going to be on your own there.

665
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,710
Sorry.

666
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,315
I think it may be time for me
to get out of the field anyway.

667
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,319
I'm sure your wife
would appreciate it.

668
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,054
Oh, more than you know.

669
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,290
Oh, believe me, I know.

670
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,360
Eric found one of them.

671
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,700
Kensi, Deeks, take the back.

672
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,170
Federal agents.

673
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,139
We're looking for this man--
Samir Abbas.

674
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,140
He works here.

675
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,441
I got him.

676
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,779
Federal agents! Freeze!

677
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,617
Both hands where I can see them.

678
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,353
Both hands!

679
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,063
Clear.

680
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,333
Ah, that was noisy.

681
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,974
It's the uranium.

682
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,176
There should be a lot more than this.

683
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,245
Where's the rest?

684
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,546
What is this place?

685
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,814
What do you do here?

686
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,516
We service large
air-conditioning systems.

687
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,185
They're building an RDD.

688
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,688
A what?
A radiation dispersal device.

689
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,957
The uranium has been processed to a fine powder.
They're gonna

690
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,692
put it in an air-conditioning
system somewhere.

691
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,026
Thousands of people could ingest it

692
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,394
before anyone even knew it was there.

693
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,896
It could render
buildings uninhabitable

694
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,230
for a millennia.

695
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,833
The CIA calls it
real estate acquisition.

696
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,205
It's 9/11 without knocking down
buildings.

697
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,771
There's still two guys
out there with the uranium.

698
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:29,707
The attacks are going down right now.

699
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,929
But where?

700
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,759
37 air-conditioning companies

701
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:43,884
that are big enough
to handle large structures.

702
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:45,463
2,500 employees.

703
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,526
Bringing up the company's ID photos.

704
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,602
Running facial-rec now.

705
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,671
Got one.

706
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:55,139
Oh, actually, I got two.

707
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,810
All right,
Saif Molla and Hafiz Hussein.

708
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:00,178
Chapman Point Heating and Air.

709
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,613
- Address?
- On your cell now.

710
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:04,415
I'm going to try to get into
the company's cameras,

711
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:06,117
see if I can find Hafiz Hussein

712
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:09,020
and Saif Molla.
Okay,

713
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,421
I'll check their work schedules.

714
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:16,627
Sam, according to the work schedule,

715
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:19,464
Saif Molla and Hafiz Hussein
are at work right now.

716
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:27,071
I cannot find Molla or Hussein

717
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,639
on any of the company's cameras.

718
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,441
I don't think they're there.

719
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:35,179
They're not there 'cause Molla
and Hussein have a work order.

720
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:36,881
Molla and Hussein
are not in the building.

721
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,549
They're out on a job site.

722
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:40,017
Where?

723
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:42,587
Looks like they're taking
some old units to be recycled.

724
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:44,355
That's clearly not the target.

725
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:46,924
It's going to be somewhere big,
somewhere public.

726
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:49,593
Okay, got the last one.

727
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,230
Jonathan Debaki,

728
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:53,931
Lamont Heating
and Air-Conditioning.

729
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,299
Got it.

730
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:59,637
That's him.
That's Debaki.

731
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,607
Federal agents!

732
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:04,909
Don't do it!

733
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,178
Freeze! Hands against the truck.

734
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:22,460
He's got the uranium.

735
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,762
Where were you going?

736
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,131
Huh? Where's the target?

737
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:29,700
I don't know what
you're talking about.

738
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:30,935
Callen, Sam,

739
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,904
they're targeting
the convention center.

740
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:36,974
Get me LAPD-- they need
to evacuate the building.

741
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,843
LA Gamer Expo going on right now.

742
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,145
There's 30,000 people in there.

743
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:47,452
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

744
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:53,157
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

745
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,696
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

746
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:03,134
Eric, check the schematics
and get me to the AC system.

747
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,603
You need to get to the other
side of the main lobby.

748
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:09,407
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

749
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:14,212
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

750
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,850
Keep going straight ahead.

751
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:24,589
Remain calm
and please exit the building.

752
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:26,557
Go down the stairs
directly in front of you.

753
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:33,531
Halfway down the hallway,

754
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,966
there's a door on your left.

755
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,834
That leads to the maintenance area.

756
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,203
Federal agents! Freeze!

757
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,575
I got him!

758
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,409
Drop it.

759
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:54,412
I said drop it.

760
00:37:58,951 --> 00:37:59,984
Praise Allah!

761
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:05,923
Sam, stay back!

762
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:10,595
Stay back.

763
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,200
We're going to get you to a hospital.

764
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:21,639
Eric, I need an ambulance and a
radiological decon team, fast.

765
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,408
Sam, it's in the air;
you shouldn't stay here.

766
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,477
There's no point, my friend.

767
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,112
There's no point. Go.

768
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,313
Please, Sam.

769
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,082
Stay here.

770
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,184
Stay here.

771
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,630
Federal agent!

772
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:48,566
Step out where I can see you!

773
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:49,533
Don't do it!

774
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:00,077
G.
Clear.

775
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:05,049
Where's Saleh?

776
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:15,926
I should've stayed with him.

777
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:28,205
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:35,379
Any idea where he went?

779
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:38,015
I picked him up on a camera

780
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:41,052
exiting the building, but...
then he disappeared.

781
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,620
How long does he have left?

782
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,256
Maybe a few months.

783
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:47,825
Depends on how much
uranium he's ingested.

784
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:51,996
Saleh is a trained CIA operative.

785
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,564
If he doesn't want us to find him...

786
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:56,534
Michael has a wife
and a seven-month-old baby.

787
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:58,002
He might've gone to be with them.

788
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,404
I just spoke with
a friend at the agency.

789
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:02,907
The CIA made sure

790
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:06,243
Saleh was decontaminated,
as best they could.

791
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,045
So where is he now?

792
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:11,215
He didn't want his wife
and child to watch him die,

793
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,184
so he's returned to Sudan

794
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:15,986
to continue his work with the CIA.

795
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:17,788
He thought he was compromised.

796
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,725
It's not safe for him there.

797
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,860
It doesn't matter anymore.

798
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:24,628
He's using

799
00:40:24,696 --> 00:40:28,332
what little life he has left
to defend the United States.

800
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,938
Then I'm going there, too, Hetty.

801
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,573
Of course you are, Sam.

802
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,110
There's a gulfstream five
fueling and preparing

803
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:43,314
to take you to the naval air
station in Sigonella, Italy.

804
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:44,849
From there,

805
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:47,752
transport will be arranged
to take you to Sudan.

806
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:02,833
You know I should be with him.

807
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:06,203
For now, it's a CIA task force.

808
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:12,076
I don't have to tell you to be ready.

809
00:41:13,111 --> 00:41:15,479
No, you don't.

810
00:41:15,547 --> 00:41:17,848
Of course not.

811
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:46,143
