1
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:27,605
Gonna stick a knight
here. He takes it off.

2
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,254
He takes the bishop.

3
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,754
So, he took it
off this bishop.

4
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,864
And he's threatening his pawn.

5
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:42,753
Pulling took his right away,
because he played here first.

6
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:46,127
Now he took the bishop.

7
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>Bobby Fischer
is one of the greatest,

8
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:50,716
<i>perhaps the greatest
chess player in the world.

9
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>Bobby Fischer, United
States, World title contender.

10
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,585
Now, uh, black
surprises him with this move.

11
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,545
<i>Bobby Fischer
is an isolated man.

12
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:08,853
<i>Bobby Fischer's a strange man.

13
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:11,016
<i>People think that there's something
wrong with the man.

14
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:14,934
The king moves,
takes the queen.

15
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,574
<i>The great Bobby Fischer
is here tonight.

16
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,924
<i>A child, not a champion.
His social life is a vacuum.

17
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:25,314
<i>The most arrogant man
you're ever likely to meet.

18
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:26,693
He takes back,
he gets checked.

19
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,487
<i>Looking
for Bobby Fischer...

20
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,116
<i>What ever happened to
Bobby Fischer? Reclusive.

21
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,816
Threaten his pawn,
and then that's game.

22
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,877
<i>Bobby Fischer
is searching for asylum.

23
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:37,796
<i>It's really Fischer
against the world.

24
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:39,124
And here
white resigned.

25
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,835
Bobby
Fischer Interview.

26
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:57,195
All right.
Try not to tense up.

27
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:04,813
Bobby, uh, you've given virtually
your entire life to the world of chess.

28
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:10,203
What about Bobby Fischer,
the Man? What's he like?

29
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:13,406
I don't know, it's pretty, uh,
chess and me, you know, it's like...

30
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,546
It's hard to take
them apart, you know?

31
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:19,196
It's just like my alter ego,
you know? I don't really...

32
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,835
But there are times when you
get away from that chessboard.

33
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:23,705
What do you do?

34
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:25,925
I don't do too much, at the most. I'm
really, you know, tied up in chess.

35
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:29,425
I intend to expand, but first I've got
to get the title. That's basically...

36
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,984
Bobby, what does it take
to make a good chess player?

37
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:45,193
Well, talent, skill, patience.
You have to study a lot and work.

38
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:54,667
What would
your ultimate aim be?

39
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:59,876
Well, I'd like to be, uh, world
champion and keep it for...

40
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:02,205
Maybe, 20 years or so.

41
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,425
Twenty years?

42
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:12,605
Fischer is to chess, what
Muhammad Ali is to boxing.

43
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,134
Bobby! Bobby!

44
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,354
Can Fischer beat the Russian?

45
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,563
Yes, Fischer will
beat the Russian.

46
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:25,613
Do you honestly think that you probably
are the world's greatest chess player?

47
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,604
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:34,922
In the 18-month period, in the run
up to his challenge to Boris Spassky,

49
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,265
Fischer, had beaten,
and in some cases,

50
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:43,596
destroyed, some of the
best Soviet players.

51
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:48,285
Fischer was wiping away
his opposition, like flies.

52
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,660
He went on a 20-game
winning streak,

53
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,157
which was unheard of
in championship chess.

54
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:00,934
Bobby Fischer was exciting, the, not
only the chess world, but the world.

55
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,354
There's trouble
in Northern Ireland.

56
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:09,454
Henry Kissinger is shuttling
to and from Vietnam,

57
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:13,772
and against that competition,
the chess dominates.

58
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:14,551
In Moscow today,

59
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:17,974
the Soviet Chess Federation called
an angry news conference,

60
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,827
to denounce Bobby Fischer.

61
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,786
General Motors recalls 500,000
Chevrolet Vegas, and Bobby Fischer...

62
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,326
Bobby Fischer, true to his
recent erratic behavior...

63
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,826
Finished off Tigran Petrosian
of the Soviet Union,

64
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:30,565
a former world champion...

65
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:32,501
It was the best news story
of the day.

66
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:36,175
The victory gave Fischer the right
to play the world's champion,

67
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,173
Boris Spassky,
another Russian, next spring.

68
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:45,814
We all had hopes. We all wanted
him to be World Chess Champion.

69
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:49,394
The one person he was yet
to beat, was Boris Spassky.

70
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,930
You've said it's your title
the Russians are holding.

71
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,753
You don't like the Russians?

72
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:01,531
The Russians have cheated at chess.

73
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,893
They've tried every way
to avoid me,

74
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,385
to avoid giving me
a chance for the match.

75
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,924
And they have slandered my
name, and, uh, you know.

76
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,123
They just, and they just...

77
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:14,320
They're afraid of me
and they have been for years.

78
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:17,305
That's the true story.

79
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:18,763
And now you're gonna get them?

80
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:21,314
Well, now I'm going to try
and get them, yeah...

81
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,654
The Soviets had
been winning these tournaments

82
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:31,893
and I thought it would be good
for America, for Democracy,

83
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:36,023
uh, to have an
American winner.

84
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:46,255
The stakes really couldn't
be much higher, politically,

85
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:50,455
popularly. In people's minds,
you know, these were two enemies,

86
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,425
who were not fighting
a real war,

87
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:56,765
but were trying to out-do one
another strategically all the time.

88
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,885
<i>We will not tolerate
being pushed around.

89
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:03,754
<i>We have the desire and the material
assets to deal with the Soviet Union.

90
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,763
This little thing with me and
Spassky, it's, you know, with...

91
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:15,453
bombs, having it
out over the board.

92
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:20,574
One of the Soviet powers,
the Soviet Union...

93
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:25,763
had made chess
it's national sport.

94
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:30,496
They had spent
unlimited amounts of money.

95
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:33,915
They had hundreds
of Grand Masters.

96
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:39,805
They won every tournament,
every Chess Olympiad.

97
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,854
For a Communist Regime,

98
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:55,974
keeping the crown was very
important, uh, ideologically.

99
00:06:55,994 --> 00:07:00,524
This communist state took over
chess to use it as proof...

100
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,762
of intellectual superiority
over decadent West.

101
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:09,922
Everybody knew that the crown
has to remain in the Soviet Union.

102
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:30,603
In the Soviet Union,
everybody of talent was

103
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:35,444
cultivated, was given
financial help, coaching.

104
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:38,813
All the top players were
privileged people.

105
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:42,482
In the United States, we
didn't have any of that.

106
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:46,691
Every single one of
us was on his own.

107
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,962
And here came
this lone American,

108
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:53,914
combating the might of
the Soviet chess machine.

109
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:57,974
National prestige
was at stake.

110
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:01,895
Fischer recognized that he was
representing not only him...

111
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:04,765
but the entire free world.

112
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:07,734
I think there was just too
much on his shoulders.

113
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,573
Could you tell us how old
you are and where you're from?

114
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,243
I'm 15, and I'm
from Brooklyn.

115
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:24,062
He is 15 years old and he
is from Brooklyn, all right?

116
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:30,363
Will you show your headline to
camera three and to Dick Clark?

117
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,251
Because we'll make him
go to work on you.

118
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:36,401
It says, "Teenager's Strategy
Defeats All Comers!"

119
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:40,266
This strategy, did it
involve, uh, finances? -No.

120
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,465
- Did you have any help?
- No.

121
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,713
You did it all by yourself.
Did it make people happy?

122
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,104
It made me happy.

123
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,645
This young man's name is
Bobby Fischer, and already

124
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:56,474
he is the United
States Chess Champion.

125
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,282
He is 15 years old, and he
has defeated the masters.

126
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,062
He is the United States
Champion in chess.

127
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,652
I met Bobby when I was
14, and he was eight,

128
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,592
in one of the chess
clubs in Manhattan.

129
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,804
He was the youngest
kid around. He was unassuming.

130
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:22,835
He was well-mannered.
He was a nice kid.

131
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:29,174
His mother, Regina, she was a woman
who had to work two jobs, single mom,

132
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:33,044
supporting two children,
Bobby and Joan.

133
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:38,273
Regina was really
the genius of the family.

134
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:43,793
She spoke quite a number of
languages, including Russian.

135
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:48,533
She worked as a telegraph
operator, a nurse, a welder.

136
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,752
She actually got a PhD
in Hematology as well.

137
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:56,352
She was an activist,
she was a Communist.

138
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,752
And the FBI files on
her are quite extensive.

139
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:04,514
His mother was hounded
by the FBI, because...

140
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,764
they thought she was
possibly a Soviet spy.

141
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:12,833
This was a period when Jew
and Communist were equated,

142
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:17,722
so his mother denied
his Jewishness.

143
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:19,773
His mother told him if he
would be sitting on the stoop

144
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:21,893
at 560 Lincoln Place,
Apartment 4Q, and

145
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,783
somebody would come up to
him and ask him a question,

146
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:26,433
he would say, "I have
nothing to say to you".

147
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:29,472
That was the proper answer
that his mother told him to say.

148
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:35,862
You're from
Brooklyn originally?

149
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:39,331
Chicag... Well, born in Chicago,
moved to Brooklyn when I was about six.

150
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,501
- So, lived on the coast...
- Were you playing chess by then?

151
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:44,881
No, I learned in
New York, yeah.

152
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:46,534
At what age?

153
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,474
Six.

154
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,174
When did you start to
get serious about chess?

155
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:55,714
About when, I was maybe seven.

156
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,602
If you can think back to your
childhood and all the things you did

157
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:02,904
after school, and on the weekends. And,
imagine just filling all that in with

158
00:11:02,934 --> 00:11:07,813
chess study, chess lessons,
chess practice, chess competition.

159
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:18,522
Sure, Bobby Fischer starts
with a very exceptional mind.

160
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:23,252
But genius is not only about a
particular innate gift for "X".

161
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:26,711
Genius is about a
desire to do "X".

162
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:29,365
It's about a willingness
to sacrifice.

163
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:33,204
It's about an ability to develop
that kind of obsessive interest,

164
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,903
in perfecting one's
ability to do some task.

165
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:40,974
People who studied expertise have
looked at classical music composers,

166
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:44,013
and surgeons and
chess players...

167
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:48,732
interested in figuring out, what
do high achievers have in common?

168
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:51,952
They have always,
almost without exception,

169
00:11:51,982 --> 00:11:54,652
put in 10,000 hours of
deliberate practice first.

170
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:14,873
That love component is such an
enormous part of the achievement,

171
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,673
of any kind of genius...

172
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:21,813
Because if it's dutiful, there is no
way you can be that obsessive about it.

173
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,213
There was nothing else
he would rather do.

174
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:31,493
I started playing, uh,
games with myself.

175
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:35,862
I would make the white moves
and the black moves.

176
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,055
Play through the whole game
and eventually I would

177
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,840
checkmate the other guy.

178
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:41,848
I almost always won.

179
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,741
Then my mother started to
get worried that, you know,

180
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:51,541
it wasn't healthy to be, you know,
playing chess by myself all the time.

181
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,933
<i>Now, uh, black surprises him
with this move.

182
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:59,854
Regina was so worried that she
decided to take him to a psychiatrist.

183
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,473
And the psychiatrist said,

184
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:04,353
"Don't worry, there are worse
things to be obsessed by then chess".

185
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:14,982
Everybody said
to him, "What happened?"

186
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,252
And he said, "One
day I just got good".

187
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:20,452
He was suddenly out of
everyone else's league.

188
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:22,622
And everybody knew it.

189
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:26,491
Fischer would open a chess
magazine, okay, like this.

190
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:30,181
He would open it like this, he
would say, "Hmm, okay here...

191
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,921
"Let's see here...

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,224
"Okay here, okay here".

193
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,973
Now, it looks like he's just, like,
looking at the pictures, right?

194
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,734
That's what you
think he's doing.

195
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,513
No, he's not doing that.

196
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:48,273
He's playing through the entire
game, in his head, in a few seconds.

197
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,373
Every move.

198
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:53,042
He went from being
my peer in chess

199
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:58,581
to being the United States
Chess Champion, a quantum leap.

200
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:04,253
That's when he first
became famous. This was 1958.

201
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,911
No chess player ever made
much money in those days,

202
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,631
and my father basically arranged
an exhibition tour for him.

203
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,139
In which, he went
from city to city, playing

204
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,021
anywhere from 40 to 80 people
at a time.

205
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:26,093
And I don't know how much he got
then, maybe $5 dollars a board.

206
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:46,612
Regina decided that this
was a way to the big time.

207
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:49,660
She'd call me up and say...

208
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:53,581
"I want Bobby to go on
Channel Two on Sunday.

209
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:58,051
And he won't do it if I ask
him, so I want you to tell him".

210
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:03,122
He just wanted to learn the game and
she really wanted him to get publicity.

211
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,813
Fame is definitely a mixed
blessing, and almost everybody

212
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:14,322
would admit that, at some some point in
their life, they've wished they had it.

213
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:18,813
Once it starts it's fun, and
the fun quickly wears off...

214
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:22,993
when you want to be alone, private
and public, if that's ever possible.

215
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:26,732
But also, it's horrendous
on the psyche for the young.

216
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:29,101
It totally distorts
their world.

217
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:34,811
He had all these people around
who really wanted a piece of him,

218
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:39,041
if they only wanted
to be in his glow.

219
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:43,130
And, people have all kinds of
motives, not always in his favor.

220
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,210
They're trying to make money
out of him.

221
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:46,556
They're trying to be
associated with him.

222
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:47,949
They're talking behind his back.

223
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,781
You know, I mean
he couldn't stand any of that.

224
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,046
Particularly,
he couldn't stand the press

225
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,701
because he was such an individual.

226
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:58,153
He was an ideal object
for caricature.

227
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,113
You
watch television?

228
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:11,212
- No. Not much. Very rarely.
- Why?

229
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,962
I don't know. I read that you could
get a little radiation from it.

230
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:15,424
I don't know.

231
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:18,274
I've talked with a few scientist
friends of mine, they say you...

232
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:20,903
You do, you do, it's a fact,
you do get a little bit.

233
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,197
They don't think it's dangerous.

234
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:23,970
What kind of magazines
do you like?

235
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,560
My favorite magazine is Confidential.

236
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,890
I read that all the time.

237
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:30,092
Why do you like that?

238
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:35,433
They've got a lot of the inside
stories on things like water pollution.

239
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:38,272
It's pretty interesting.
I like to read up on that.

240
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,662
A lot of things that the government
is concealing, you know?

241
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:46,491
Fischer looked at the
world his own way. I mean,

242
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:50,552
Bobby was not socialized,
the way the rest of us were.

243
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:56,321
Every idea he had, virtually, he had
to come to, through his own thinking.

244
00:16:56,351 --> 00:17:01,881
In these days, he was unusual. But,
he hadn't gone off the deep end yet.

245
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,922
Boxing champions have been coming
to the Catskill Mountains of New York

246
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,144
for almost half a century
to get in shape.

247
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:17,062
But does a chess champion
need to train physically?

248
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,431
Take a look behind that window,

249
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:23,057
into the training headquarters
of Bobby Fischer.

250
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:31,272
<i>Championship chess is a
physically exhausting game.

251
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:33,534
<i>More than just a test
of mind and will,

252
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:36,274
<i>it is a contest
of physical endurance too.

253
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:43,171
<i>Bobby is 29, and he lives
virtually a monastic life.

254
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,406
<i>He lives alone,

255
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:48,885
<i>always in hotel rooms that seem
barely larger than chessboards.

256
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,759
<i>A lot of the time he won't
even answer his telephone.

257
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:56,733
<i>The television set is his window on
the world, exercise is part of it.

258
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,652
I'm a world class
Olympic-level coach.

259
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:03,102
I'm also a world champion
in the bench press

260
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,392
and I've trained a lot of celebrities.

261
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:10,692
But no one can match the
fabulous Bobby Fischer.

262
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:15,121
He was interested in the
human body, how it performed...

263
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,701
and how it could be more productive.

264
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:22,672
He said "I want you
to work on my grip.

265
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,671
"You see this dynamometer?

266
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:27,841
I want to squeeze this thing
all the way to the end".

267
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,351
I said, "The world's strongest man
has not squeezed 100 kilograms".

268
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:36,141
He said, "I'll squeeze
105". I said, "Why?"

269
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,842
"When I shake that little Russian's
hand, I want him to feel it!"

270
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,694
I started him off
with a little swimming,

271
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,743
racquetball,
which we were quite good at.

272
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,589
A little weight training.

273
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:52,587
I said, repeat this after me,

274
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:57,643
"I'm a winner! I'm a champion!
I'm not a loser!"

275
00:18:59,164 --> 00:18:59,943
And he says,

276
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:02,597
"Why'd you put the loser thing
in there? You know I'm a champion".

277
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:09,949
Bobby is probably the most interesting
person I've ever photographed.

278
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:14,981
There he is.
There's Bobby.

279
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:20,152
"I decided to hold my
breath like this, and... "

280
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:24,202
You know, it was good
for his training.

281
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:26,842
He was in training
for Spassky.

282
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,311
He asked me what
other jobs do I do?

283
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:35,611
And I told him, I'm, I've just
finished one on the New York Jets.

284
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,281
"Jets?" He thought
that was marvelous.

285
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:40,521
He thought... He wanted
to hear all about it.

286
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:43,291
How they train, and he said,

287
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,420
"You know, I've got to
train like that as well".

288
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,730
And he didn't
mind anything I did.

289
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:03,592
But it could have gone either way.
He treated everybody else quite awful.

290
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,192
<i>Bobby Fischer
is a stubborn young man.

291
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:10,061
<i>Sometimes he fights for principal,
more often just for himself.

292
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,102
<i>He'll refuse to play a match
because his special terms aren't met.

293
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:15,726
<i>And for the past month...

294
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,488
<i>he's been giving fits
to the International Federation too.

295
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:23,630
<i>Not enough money for the winner
of the world title, he says.

296
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
There was
bidding on the match.

297
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,801
And Iceland got it, I guess
because they put up the highest bid.

298
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,140
And Bobby didn't want to play.
He said the country's too small.

299
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,920
They don't have facilities,
they don't have communication.

300
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,138
The International Chess Federation

301
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,276
wants word by tomorrow morning
from Fischer

302
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:42,089
on whether he's agreeable
to 24 games in Iceland,

303
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,929
and Fischer is taking his time
answering.

304
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,981
You, as President
of the Icelandic Chess Federation -

305
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,252
are there times where you have
been tempted to say,

306
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,483
"Let's forget all about it"?

307
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,822
As you know, we are
organizing a chess match,

308
00:20:54,861 --> 00:21:01,670
and our only wish is to enrich
the chess world.

309
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,505
They had all these lawyers

310
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:07,471
and they were raising demands
all the time.

311
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:08,990
But at the same time,

312
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:14,350
it was never clear whether Fischer
would come to Iceland.

313
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:19,132
The stumbling block, the
principal one was the prize money.

314
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:23,799
And I said, we have already
settled the money question.

315
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,289
And we will not be
ready to discuss that.

316
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:34,852
There was a real possibility that
the match wouldn't take place.

317
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:40,351
One has to remember with Fischer, that
he dropped out of tournaments before.

318
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:43,861
This was no bluff
necessarily.

319
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:48,240
He's going, he's not going, and
then he told me he was going.

320
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,200
He moved quietly, put his
hands on my shoulders, and says,

321
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,970
"I'm going to Iceland,
Harry". You know, it was...

322
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:01,020
So, and the next thing I would read
in the paper would be, he's not going.

323
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,352
But, Bobby wouldn't sign it.

324
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:16,971
And then Bobby disappeared.

325
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,231
<i>Boris Spassky,
the world chess champion,

326
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:29,871
<i>came to Iceland twelve days before
the match, scheduled to start Sunday.

327
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,620
<i>Spassky said he wanted time
to get used to the place,

328
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,080
<i>without, incidentally, being
constantly molested by newsmen.

329
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,579
<i>Bobby Fischer was also sensitive
about being photographed.

330
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,969
<i>Sensitive to the point that
he kept not showing up.

331
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:57,612
He was sitting in Pasadena,
California, and my job,

332
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:03,041
my personal mission, was to
get Bobby to go to Iceland

333
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,861
and play the World
Championship Match.

334
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:12,601
But I didn't see any activity.
I didn't see any plane ticket.

335
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:17,970
I said, "Bobby, I have to go
to New York. My dad is sick.

336
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,119
Let's travel together. You'll
be that much closer to Iceland".

337
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:27,809
He said, "Yeah, I think that's a
good idea, travel with a friend.

338
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:30,460
Yeah, okay".

339
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,068
I was getting him closer
to where he had to go.

340
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,462
We took him to
Kennedy airport.

341
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:43,481
We were headed for the
Icelandic Airlines counter.

342
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:49,371
Somehow a Daily News
photographer spied him.

343
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:54,790
And Bobby started running. He wasn't
just running, he was sprinting.

344
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,190
I turned around, and I stopped, and I
put my hands up. I didn't say anything.

345
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,779
And Bobby kept running,
right out of the airport

346
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,499
to the curbside limousine, and
got in, and left the airport.

347
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:15,168
Where to? Nobody knew.

348
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:20,901
It was only three days before
the scheduled start of the match.

349
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:23,851
Chess history was
in the balance.

350
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,540
I said, you can stay at my parents'
home in Douglaston, Long Island.

351
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,370
I don't think
the bell works.

352
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,590
It works.

353
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,588
Hi,
where are you?

354
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,008
Oh,
I need to know...

355
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,563
Bobby was staying at Saidy's house

356
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,175
and Saidy's father
was dying of cancer at the time.

357
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,120
I don't know whether he told
you that, and they were...

358
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:22,461
they were trying their best to get
Fischer on that plane to Iceland.

359
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:28,379
At one point Saidy said, "You
know, uh, my father's dying".

360
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:31,049
And Bobby says,
"That's okay, I don't mind".

361
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,068
They could not dislodge
him from that house.

362
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:37,019
This was probably the most
stressful week of my life.

363
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,258
<i>- Are you Dr. Saidy?
- Yes I am.

364
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,858
Mr. Fischer made it clear that he
would try to go to Iceland tonight.

365
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:45,870
Did he express these thoughts
to you? -Made it clear to whom?

366
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:49,101
We had talked to a few people, and
they had the impression he was going.

367
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,863
Well, everybody can
have impressions,

368
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:54,245
but the only person who knows
what Bobby Fischer is going to do

369
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,716
is Bobby Fischer.

370
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,280
That's about all
I really want to say.

371
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,751
- I see...
- I want you to all keep cool.

372
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:05,501
At one point, during
his stay at our home...

373
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,919
he simply said, "It's
over, I'm not going".

374
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,009
Still no
sign of Bobby Fischer.

375
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,929
Today, the International
Chess Federation

376
00:26:15,959 --> 00:26:18,850
postponed by 48 hours the start
of the match, but it said...

377
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,649
if Fischer is not in Iceland by noon
on Tuesday, he will be disqualified.

378
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:27,438
Mr. Thorarinsson,
if I may ask, are you worried?

379
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:31,952
No.

380
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,250
And, I just wondered if
you've ever seen Mr. Fischer,

381
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,700
if you have any proof
that he actually exists?

382
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,590
That's a good question.

383
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,060
Yes, I think, gentlemen, we can agree
on the point that Mr. Fischer exists.

384
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,929
We were losing
the whole thing.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,218
We had to get Fischer
to come to Iceland.

386
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,421
The Soviet Union had the feeling that

387
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:03,918
the World Chess Champion
was humiliated.

388
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:09,818
They wanted to call Spassky
back to the Soviet Union.

389
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:15,720
Boris said to me, "This
is a very severe situation.

390
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,331
You have to solve this
on a higher level".

391
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,080
Gudmundur Thorarinsson,

392
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,750
I think he asked the Prime Minister
of Iceland to call Kissinger.

393
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,032
Fischer was very reluctant to go

394
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:36,074
and I placed a call to him
and I said to him... go.

395
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,829
The United States of America

396
00:27:39,273 --> 00:27:43,855
wanted Bobby to go there
and win the world title.

397
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:49,067
By that time, James Slater,
the British multi-millionaire,

398
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:51,467
had already
doubled the purse.

399
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:57,511
So, Fischer's answer to Kissinger
was, "Yes, I've decided to play".

400
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:02,500
What finally did
make you decide to go then?

401
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,300
I feel that the prestige of
this country is at stake.

402
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,170
Some people have suggested
this was psychological warfare,

403
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,680
against Spassky on your part.

404
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,409
- Mmm.
- Did that figure into it?

405
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:15,079
No, huh-uh.

406
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,098
I don't believe in psychology,
I believe in good moves.

407
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:26,309
<i>Bobby Fischer
left New York for Iceland,

408
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:31,148
<i>and what a scene that was on
the morning of July the 4th.

409
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:34,318
Nothing like this has ever
happened in Iceland before.

410
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:38,100
You try to describe the impact
on the citizens here at Reykjavik,

411
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:41,040
is probably about the same as
if the promoters of the next,

412
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,396
Joe Frasier-Muhammad Ali
prize fight,

413
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,816
decided to stage their
international extravaganza

414
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,780
in Butte, Montana.

415
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,000
One observer said the chess match
was turning into the biggest thing,

416
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,170
to hit Iceland,
since Eric the Red.

417
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,259
Though some people were
still mad at Fischer,

418
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,729
others approve of his
hold-out for more money.

419
00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:02,800
Well, he was fighting for all the chess
players of the whole world, I think.

420
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,898
He's tedious, he's arrogant,
he's inconsiderate.

421
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:10,138
Uh, basically, people think that
there's something wrong with the man.

422
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,349
I became
his private bodyguard.

423
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:42,190
It was a big moment
for me, you know.

424
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:45,519
I was more of his
friend than a bodyguard.

425
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,608
He was quite a
character, you know.

426
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:55,528
He could be gentle, but he could
be like a volcano sometimes.

427
00:29:55,568 --> 00:30:00,038
And it was better to know when to
speak and when to keep quiet, actually.

428
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:06,031
Finally Bobby
showed up in Iceland.

429
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,999
Now, is he gonna really play
for the World Championship?

430
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,799
It's been a long
road for Fischer to this game,

431
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,590
and it'll be a long match
at the end of that road.

432
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,039
Both he and Spassky
have to play 24 games.

433
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:27,328
The match could last up to two
months, each game runs to five hours.

434
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:31,478
The most intellectually exhausting
battle known to the mind of man.

435
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:33,438
The World Chess Championship.

436
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:42,657
We had the Icelandic Government,
the Icelandic President,

437
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:48,170
the Ambassador of the Soviet Union,
the Ambassador of the United States,

438
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:50,400
and many foreign guests.

439
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,569
The theatre was full.

440
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:56,580
<i>Regularly scheduled programs
will not be seen at this time,

441
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,428
<i>so we may bring you the
following sports special.

442
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:03,769
<i>ABC Sports presents the World
Chess Championship Match,

443
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:07,767
<i>between Boris Spassky, the defending
champion from the Soviet Union,

444
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,228
<i>and 29-year-old Bobby Fischer, the
challenger from the United States.

445
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:13,858
It was the Super Bowl.

446
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:18,477
The audiences were gigantic.
People stayed home from work.

447
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,268
People were lining up in front
of TV sets at department stores.

448
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:23,938
There were chess groupies.

449
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:29,759
In Time Square, they were showing
the game live. It was that important.

450
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:31,190
<i>Let's find out from you Larry...

451
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,136
<i>If there are any
late-breaking developments.

452
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,042
<i>They might fuss around
with the chess pieces

453
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:36,864
<i>and the size of the board
and the lighting,

454
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:41,448
<i>but I'm fairly confident
the match will start on time.

455
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:47,289
Boris Spassky, the world chess champion
was there with all his assistants.

456
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:52,298
But, Fischer was not here.

457
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:58,298
<i>The clock has now been started. It
was officially 5:00 in Reykjavik.

458
00:31:58,318 --> 00:32:02,408
<i>Spassky is obviously anxious about
the whereabouts of Mr. Fischer.

459
00:32:05,247 --> 00:32:08,147
Bobby was
nowhere to be seen.

460
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:12,029
And all of us despaired.

461
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:15,200
<i>If Fischer doesn't show up by
the time one hour has elapsed,

462
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,590
<i>he forfeits the
game automatically.

463
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:24,329
<i>Oh, there he goes now. He's
just played one pawn to queen 4.

464
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,599
<i>You saw Spassky make his move,
then he touched his clock,

465
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:33,008
<i>which turns his clock off, but
turns his opponent's clock on.

466
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,229
<i>So Fischer's time
is now ticking.

467
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:50,167
There was no certainty, that even
though this was the biggest match,

468
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,957
of his life, he would
actually show up.

469
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:58,129
See, many people think that his
antics were designed to upset Spassky,

470
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:02,029
to discombobulate
Spassky, which they did.

471
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:04,088
But I don't think
that was their intent.

472
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:07,418
I don't think any of this
was directed against Spassky.

473
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:10,379
It was his own inner
demons that he was fighting.

474
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,378
<i>Unpredictable
Bobby Fischer.

475
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,978
<i>Nobody really knows why Bobby
Fischer does or does not do anything.

476
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:21,548
<i>The most individualistic,
intransigent, uncommunicative,

477
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,717
<i>solitary chess
master of all time.

478
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:25,438
<i>He has no permanent home.

479
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,327
<i>Fischer is a nomad.
Speaks to almost no one.

480
00:33:27,357 --> 00:33:30,077
<i>No contact with his
family. Troubled childhood.

481
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,828
<i>He hasn't seen
his mother in over 10 years.

482
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,696
Is your
mother still living?

483
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:39,039
Yeah. -Do you get a chance
to see her very much?

484
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:40,569
Haven't seen her in
a few years, yeah.

485
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:43,960
- What about your father?
- No, I don't see him. No.

486
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:49,078
Are they living
together? -No, her, her...

487
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,548
"I never talk
about my father".

488
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:54,247
That's what Fischer would say,
"I never talk about my father".

489
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:55,868
This is what led me to realize

490
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,536
that there was something special
about Fischer's father

491
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,291
that nobody else knew.

492
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:04,657
Regina Fischer
has a 900-page FBI file.

493
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:09,196
And, one of the things it reveals
is that Bobby Fischer's father,

494
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:12,936
was not Gerhardt Fischer
as it had been supposed,

495
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:16,656
and as the family had
allowed to be known.

496
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:21,549
In fact, Bobby Fischer's father
was a man named Paul Nemenyi.

497
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,888
Gerhardt Fischer, who is officially
listed on the birth certificate,

498
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:27,689
never came to America.

499
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,388
Regina and Paul Nemenyi met
at a University near Denver,

500
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,137
and they had an affair.

501
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:38,398
Regina moved on and took
the baby, Bobby, with her.

502
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:42,568
Regina, often, because she
was destitute, and needed help,

503
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:47,156
would go to social service
agencies, and ask for help.

504
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:50,977
Paul Nemenyi would show up, and
consult with the social workers,

505
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:53,778
because he was very
concerned about Bobby.

506
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:58,167
He said that Bobby, even at a very
young age, was a very upset child.

507
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:02,038
He was afraid that he
wasn't being raised right.

508
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,788
Later, when Bobby
moved to New York City,

509
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:08,458
Paul would come and take
him out to restaurants,

510
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:12,258
and would admonish him for
having bad table manners.

511
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:16,299
And would basically act towards
him in the way that a father would.

512
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:24,228
One day, Bobby asked
his mother, "Where's Paul?

513
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:27,698
Why isn't he coming
around anymore?"

514
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:33,737
When Nemenyi died, that's when his
mother told him he was his real father.

515
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:37,187
He learned about it only about
the time he was 9-years-old.

516
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:44,506
Chess to him
was the ultimate escape,

517
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:47,379
his single obsession.

518
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,927
<i>Well,
Spassky's waiting.

519
00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:08,388
<i>Right, and it, uh, waiting and wondering
whether Bobby will show or not show.

520
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:12,488
<i>And there is absolutely
dead silence in the hall.

521
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:17,157
<i>Spassky is pacing,
he's nervous and...

522
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:18,697
<i>Wait!
Here comes Fischer,

523
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,947
<i>coming onto stage, saying
that he was caught in traffic.

524
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:25,916
<i>And, uh, I think Spassky
is visibly relieved.

525
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:28,759
<i>And also
perhaps pained.

526
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:33,749
It didn't look like this match would
happen, but finally it happened and...

527
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,299
it was phenomenal.

528
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:38,268
How do you spell
relief, okay?

529
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:41,718
<i>Now, for the first time, we're
looking at Bobby Fischer, the man that

530
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:45,058
<i>eight times has won the United
States Open Championship.

531
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:47,108
I remember saying on TV
at one point during the match,

532
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,137
I said, "You know,
we're really lucky...

533
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:53,276
to be alive, at this moment, when
Bobby Fischer's playing Boris Spassky".

534
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:06,546
<i>There's the first move. One knight
to king bishop 3, very noncommittal.

535
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,795
<i>Now watch, see Fischer
turn around here? -Yeah.

536
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,780
<i>He's checking to see
that camera location.

537
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:19,288
<i>And now, uh, he goes over to
protest those cameras being there.

538
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,757
<i>There's Lothar
Schmid in the background.

539
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,460
Bobby said,

540
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:28,866
"I feel disturbed.
I cannot have that, please".

541
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:38,238
<i>Spassky remains serene and
imperturbable throughout all this.

542
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:46,986
The first game started out with
some minor psychological games,

543
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:49,456
in the opening, but
then it calmed down.

544
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:52,376
And the position that we reached
after 28 moves,

545
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:55,298
seemed like a complete draw...

546
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:57,401
It seemed like they were gonna
agree to a draw shortly

547
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,615
and move onto the next game.

548
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:03,187
All the pieces were traded.

549
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:07,336
They got into an endgame. Each side
had a bishop and a bunch of pawns.

550
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:09,507
It was a very easy...
It was a dead draw.

551
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:13,357
The position reached very even
position, virtually symmetrical.

552
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:17,477
And Fischer went haywire.

553
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:23,156
He did something that hardly anyone
would do except a rank amateur.

554
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:27,357
He grabbed a pawn, allowing
his bishop to be trapped.

555
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,945
He made a colossal
beginner's blunder.

556
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,277
He took a pawn which allowed
Spassky to trap his bishop.

557
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,650
We couldn't believe it.

558
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:38,968
This looks like an error, but
this is Fischer playing the move.

559
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:40,968
There must be more
to it than that.

560
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,032
There must be an explanation.

561
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:46,066
There must be some deep
combination that we've missed.

562
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:08,667
Bobby saw six moves ahead
here, when he made the move.

563
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:11,186
He just didn't see
seven moves ahead.

564
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:15,705
White can interpolate a move.
You can play bishop to queen 2.

565
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:19,645
Notice that that cuts
off the escape square.

566
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:23,178
And then all that white has to do on
the next move is play king to knight 2,

567
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:26,168
and the bishop is lost.

568
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,767
That was the shot
heard around the world.

569
00:39:29,807 --> 00:39:33,057
It was inexplicable.

570
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,608
I still don't know
how that happened.

571
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:41,516
Spassky
won the first game.

572
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:50,236
You had to get to 12.5
points, the best of 24.

573
00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:55,425
A win is one, a loss is zero,
and a draw is one half.

574
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:02,559
He had an agreement
that the cameras be quiet

575
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
and Bobby said they aren't quiet.

576
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:07,807
And, uh, they disturb me.

577
00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:13,798
He claimed that the noise
from the machines...

578
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:20,687
was so high that he couldn't, you
see, he couldn't think or concentrate.

579
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,357
I believe that, by the way.

580
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:27,157
I think that he
had hyperacusis,

581
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:32,616
a medical condition characterized
by excessive sensitivity to noise.

582
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,816
Fischer said he would
boycott the match,

583
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:38,315
until hidden movie cameras were
removed from the playing hall.

584
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,485
The promoters said the entire
financial structure of the match

585
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,825
depends on recording
and exhibiting the play.

586
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:59,007
He asked to put
the camera away.

587
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:08,847
He wanted me to clear the
cameras out of the hall.

588
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:13,787
And I said, "No".

589
00:41:25,064 --> 00:41:29,118
You have
to start in time.

590
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:35,957
If a player is not present, you have
to, as the arbiter, press his clock.

591
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:46,827
Fischer had been known to
quit matches over trivia...

592
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:50,946
So, we were afraid that, uh,
he would just, you know,

593
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:54,177
run back home, and that
would be the end of it.

594
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:59,616
Bobby did not show up.

595
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:03,256
I had, as the arbiter,
to forfeit him.

596
00:42:03,285 --> 00:42:09,744
And, for a moment, I thought,
"Did I make the right decision?

597
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:14,967
Was it fair? Was it correct?"
But it was necessary.

598
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:17,207
There was no other way.

599
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:23,697
This, uh, night I remember that I
had been woken up by tears in my eyes.

600
00:42:23,726 --> 00:42:29,316
That I, as an arbiter,
had to destroy a genius.

601
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,825
He was now
trailing two nothing.

602
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:42,555
It's very hard to make
that up in a 24-game match.

603
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:47,365
Half the world thought,
"That's it, the match is over".

604
00:42:47,395 --> 00:42:49,285
"He'll never come back".

605
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:50,735
"Why would he even
bother trying...

606
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,299
to come back from such
a difficult situation?"

607
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:06,806
During the match, he would
knock on my door about

608
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:12,226
one or two in the morning, and
we would just walk and walk.

609
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,285
And we would sit, and
look at the animals.

610
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:31,704
He loved animals.

611
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:39,808
And he would talk, but he didn't
like to talk about his childhood.

612
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,617
It was a bad subject.

613
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:48,927
He did tell me that, like, from the
age of 2 or 3 he was left alone...

614
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,297
all day with his sister.

615
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:55,066
The loneliness.

616
00:43:55,096 --> 00:44:00,405
Regina, for all of her gifts,
was not a traditional mother.

617
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:04,826
She was a person who moved her
kids around from place to place,

618
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:08,545
you know, even every few months
when they were really little.

619
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,855
There was obvious conflict between
Regina and Bobby from an early age.

620
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:17,835
He didn't like to
have his mother around.

621
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:20,578
She would end up having
to send his sister, Joan,

622
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:22,988
abroad with him on tournaments.

623
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:25,826
He wouldn't play
if his mother was along.

624
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:32,606
Regina moved out of the apartment
that he shared with her...

625
00:44:32,657 --> 00:44:35,736
in Brooklyn, when he
was only 16 years old.

626
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:41,916
He told his mom to leave, I don't
know how politely, and she left.

627
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:47,406
In a way, he rejected her
because she was so like him.

628
00:44:47,415 --> 00:44:53,545
So pushy, so self-centered,
so goal-directed.

629
00:44:53,575 --> 00:44:59,025
Maybe he was splitting
off part of himself.

630
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:06,107
In 1960, Regina went to
Europe to get her M.D. degree.

631
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:10,197
And Bobby would have still been living
on Lincoln Place in Brooklyn then.

632
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:16,096
I went to his apartment a couple
of times, and it was roach-ridden.

633
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:18,096
It was a walk-up tenement.

634
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,317
He had chess books
all over the place,

635
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:23,456
and it was just in a
complete state of disarray.

636
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:27,944
The fact is,
his mother left him.

637
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:32,614
Think about yourself. If,
suddenly, your father wasn't there,

638
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:37,414
and your mother disappeared,
said, "Goodbye".

639
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:42,484
How would you feel? What
would have happened to you?

640
00:45:45,124 --> 00:45:46,797
Bobby is all chess.

641
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,346
I don't play chess, and I don't
pretend to speak for Bobby.

642
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:52,966
But I feel that
whatever I do here,

643
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:57,576
whatever I say, to help make the
Vietnam come to an end more quickly,

644
00:45:57,606 --> 00:46:01,196
will help every son, every
daughter in the whole world.

645
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:05,365
One, two, three, four,
sign the treaty, end the war!

646
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:09,536
One, two, three, four, sign
the treaty, end the war!

647
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,436
One, two, three, four, sign
the treaty, end the war...

648
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:17,455
<i>Well, you're not gonna believe this,
Sir, but I'm inside of a wind tunnel

649
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:32,686
Fischer said, "Well, I'll
continue but the third game,

650
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:37,516
has got to be away from the
auditorium inside a sealed room".

651
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:40,236
There's a little ping-pong
room at the back of the stage.

652
00:46:40,286 --> 00:46:43,156
And Spassky agreed.

653
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:45,889
You can't change the location
without both sides' permission

654
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:48,475
once the match has started.

655
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:51,796
He could have claimed
the match on a forfeit.

656
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,375
He didn't have to
play in that back room.

657
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:55,484
If he hadn't...

658
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:57,026
Fischer would have not played

659
00:46:57,996 --> 00:47:00,581
and the match
would not have continued.

660
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:03,804
Bobby started
again to quarrel.

661
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:07,373
"No! Not this one and
not that," etcetera.

662
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:10,513
And Boris said
in this moment...

663
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:16,097
"So, I retire, I do not want
this. This is too much for me. I...

664
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:20,505
If so, we end
the match".

665
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:24,724
The two boys were standing
together at the table.

666
00:47:24,744 --> 00:47:30,995
And I took them here, both, and
pressed them down in the stools.

667
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:33,614
Now, will you play?

668
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:39,025
Boris automatically
made his first move.

669
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:47,164
The game could still be watched
by a close-circuit TV camera.

670
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:54,687
The audience was in the hall and they
could follow the game move by move.

671
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:12,235
In game three, Bobby played an opening,
a defense he had never played before.

672
00:48:12,275 --> 00:48:17,444
The Benoni, which
means "Son of Sorrow".

673
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:23,415
It is so risky, so
fraught with danger,

674
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:28,974
that whenever you play
that, you're simply saying,

675
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:30,852
"We're not gonna make a draw.

676
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,536
This is win or lose.
This is a fight to the death".

677
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,194
Bobby moved his knight
to the edge of the board.

678
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,936
There's a saying in chess...

679
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:45,775
"<i>Ein springer am
rand bringt kummer am shand</i>,"

680
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:48,526
"A knight on the side,
I will not abide".

681
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,365
It was against principle.

682
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:51,915
It's not considered a good idea

683
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:54,079
because the center of the board,
typically,

684
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,986
is the most important
battle ground.

685
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:58,869
And that's where we want
to position our pieces

686
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,336
or at least in a way that our pieces
attack the middle of the board.

687
00:49:03,388 --> 00:49:05,310
Not only did he move the knight
to the side of the board,

688
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:06,738
but also it could have
been captured by a bishop,

689
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,173
and he would have had
a very ugly-looking...

690
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:12,664
double pawn way over on
the side of the board, which,

691
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:15,183
it was very
unaesthetic, let's say.

692
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,774
<i>Uh, Frank, I can see Spassky.

693
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:29,065
Uh, more tense than
you've seen him? <i>-Yes.</i>

694
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:34,074
He may be... what?

695
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,376
I see.

696
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:51,583
Spassky did not find
the best continuation,

697
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:55,673
and was consistently
outplayed...

698
00:49:55,703 --> 00:50:01,714
until Fischer won his first
game of his life against Spassky.

699
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:02,933
He was on the scoreboard.

700
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:11,995
What do you think
of Bobby Fischer?

701
00:50:12,026 --> 00:50:13,745
I like him.
I like his style.

702
00:50:13,775 --> 00:50:15,866
- Are you following the games?
- Yes I am.

703
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:18,284
The American chess players
are behind Bobby 100%,

704
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:22,534
and they're all anxious to see him
get in there, and win the championship.

705
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:25,585
Do you think that Fischer

706
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:28,180
will win for the first time
over the Russian champion?

707
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:31,174
I think Fischer will win,
because he's playing for $200,000,

708
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:32,390
but if Spassky wins

709
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:35,138
most of the money will go
to the Russian government.

710
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:39,803
People sat in bars betting on what
the next move was going to be...

711
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:43,473
the way people bet on whether there is
going to be a hit in a baseball game.

712
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:45,573
That's when chess really exploded.

713
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:55,615
Tell me what, what, you know what
turns you on about chess. -What?

714
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:57,786
Do you hope to be as good
as Bobby Fischer one day?

715
00:50:57,826 --> 00:51:01,704
Well, I'd hope to, but I
doubt if I would be. -Why?

716
00:51:01,744 --> 00:51:05,464
Well, I just think Fischer's just
about the best player in the world,

717
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,745
and not very many people can
get to be as good as he is.

718
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:15,224
We're watching the looming presence
of Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer,

719
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:20,174
as sketched by Leroy Neiman, noted
artist and familiar face to Wide World.

720
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:23,005
Leroy is here with me
at the Wide World studio in New York

721
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:24,946
and he's going to be

722
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,213
sharing some of his artistic
impressions with us, in just a minute.

723
00:51:28,237 --> 00:51:29,090
Larry,

724
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:30,769
I thought going up there
to that chess match

725
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:32,376
would be like watching
the grass grow,

726
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,984
but it was far more exciting
than I ever expected it to be.

727
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,806
Well, I thought it was
pretty exciting too.

728
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:40,164
It was just like the
Ali-Frasier fight all over again.

729
00:51:40,194 --> 00:51:43,584
This is Bobby Fischer leaving
the hotel for the fight,

730
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,874
like a matador leaving the
Palace hotel in Madrid.

731
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:52,294
On stage, the tension is
developing, it's a real "prizefight".

732
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:54,424
That's when Fischer...
That's when he's a fighter.

733
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:58,184
This right hand is, like it
struck and drew blood on Spassky.

734
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:19,504
The score was even. Two
and a half, two and a half.

735
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:22,835
Spassky
was not himself.

736
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:27,544
All these shenanigans had
affected him adversely.

737
00:52:27,574 --> 00:52:30,684
He was not playing
his true game.

738
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:16,754
They believed that
the chairs had been wired,

739
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:22,163
and the lighting fixture, to
destabilize Boris' concentration.

740
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:24,002
That's when Boris cracked.

741
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:31,723
Spassky complained that
there was some radiation...

742
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:33,563
which was affecting him.

743
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:38,146
During the match I felt myself
quite unusually like before.

744
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:42,905
So, that was reason to be for
myself... I'm not a suspicious man...

745
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:45,254
to become suspicious.

746
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,724
There might be something
in the chair.

747
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:52,074
There might be something
on the surface of the chair.

748
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:54,914
There might be
something in the light.

749
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:05,223
They inspected the
chairs and the lights to see

750
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:09,343
whether the Americans were up
to some kind of "hanky panky".

751
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:12,933
They found two dead
flies, and that was it.

752
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:25,195
Games 6 is very celebrated.

753
00:54:25,245 --> 00:54:31,114
It is probably the most reprinted
game of the entire match.

754
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:36,205
It was like... a symphony
of placid beauty.

755
00:54:39,054 --> 00:54:41,014
Right on
the first move...

756
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:46,342
Bobby Fischer came up with a
major surprise to the entire world.

757
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:50,382
He almost always starts
the game, with moving

758
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:54,772
the pawn in front of his
king, two pawns up, with E4.

759
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:13,745
And in this game,
everybody's shocked.

760
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:18,444
He started with the English
opening by playing C4.

761
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:21,754
Spassky's preparation
was out the window.

762
00:55:23,224 --> 00:55:26,474
I'm sure he prepared for
many things, but not this.

763
00:55:27,843 --> 00:55:30,713
Fischer did not
play his usual game.

764
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:32,498
He played a different kind of game,

765
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:37,384
a placid, positional,
slowly building up game,

766
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:43,553
where he deprived
Spassky of mobility.

767
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:49,695
Pushed him back where his
pieces could not do anything.

768
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:53,784
It was just a, just
a beautiful game...

769
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,713
I don't know what more
can be said about it.

770
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:57,962
It's just a model of precision.

771
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:01,175
It was such a beautiful game,

772
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:05,844
that when the crowd applauded
at the end of the game,

773
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:12,462
Spassky, himself, stood up
and applauded Fischer.

774
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:15,404
On his way back to
the hotel, Fischer said,

775
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:16,903
"Did you see what
Spassky did?"

776
00:56:16,943 --> 00:56:20,242
He said "That's a sportsman.
He's a real sportsman".

777
00:57:27,673 --> 00:57:31,215
Game 21
reached move 40,

778
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,682
the move at which the game
was adjourned,

779
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:36,873
for the two players to go
and study it.

780
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:57,075
<i>This is NBC nightly
news, Friday September 1st.

781
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:57,801
Good evening.

782
00:57:58,025 --> 00:58:00,783
We'll have more on the developments
in the Watergate Bugging case.

783
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:02,457
We'll hear George McGovern

784
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:05,813
talking about tightening up
his campaign organization.

785
00:58:05,837 --> 00:58:08,091
And we'll have a look at the new
unemployment figures,

786
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:09,818
but first Bobby Fischer.

787
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:14,003
Today was the day when Fischer and
the Russian champion, Boris Spassky,

788
00:58:14,043 --> 00:58:18,012
were to have finished the 21st
game of the World Championship,

789
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:19,869
a game they started yesterday.

790
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:22,998
But Spassky, after what must
have been an agonizing night

791
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,859
spent analyzing his position,
didn't even show up to play.

792
00:58:31,372 --> 00:58:35,812
I was going to photograph
Spassky in the morning.

793
00:58:35,841 --> 00:58:39,344
He comes straight over to
me, shook my hand, and said,

794
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:42,403
"There is another
world champion.

795
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:46,523
His name is Robert
James Fischer".

796
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:50,045
I went back to the loft
later to Bobby's room,

797
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:54,393
and I told him
Spassky just retired.

798
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:58,962
And I want to be the
first to congratulate you.

799
00:58:59,012 --> 00:59:02,683
Congratulations, how you feel,
babe? Tell us how you feel about it!

800
00:59:02,723 --> 00:59:04,602
You said you were gonna do it.

801
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:06,893
Listen, would you
talk to us, Bobby?

802
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,391
Bobby, roll the window down!

803
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:14,701
Bobby wanted
to get away...

804
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:17,452
'cause they're all banging
on the door and all that,

805
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,854
just to beat it
out into the hills.

806
00:59:23,924 --> 00:59:29,593
Someone brings up The New York Post,
and it says, "Bobby is the Champ".

807
00:59:46,855 --> 00:59:48,589
His mother had said to him,

808
00:59:48,738 --> 00:59:51,322
when she saw she couldn't
separate him from chess.

809
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:54,285
She said, "Okay, go play chess.

810
00:59:54,854 --> 00:59:56,752
"When that's over, you
can start your life.

811
00:59:57,438 --> 00:59:59,361
You can do something important".

812
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,664
<i>NBC news correspondent Dick
Schapp was in Iceland today...

813
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:07,674
<i>and here's what Fischer said.

814
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,824
How does it feel now, you
have the World Championship.

815
01:00:09,843 --> 01:00:13,153
You're the best in the world at
what you've devoted your life to.

816
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:15,422
How does that feel inside?

817
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:18,593
It feels pretty good, yeah. I mean,
my goal now is play a lot more chess.

818
01:00:18,634 --> 01:00:20,684
I feel I haven't played
enough chess.

819
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:37,282
How did it feel... all this
between the mayor and all...

820
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:38,861
Did you ever thought
of anything like that?

821
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,821
No, I never, you know, thought
this was gonna happen...

822
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:45,241
You know, with chess. I just
hope, uh, this keeps on.

823
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:50,964
I just had a premonition that something
awful was going to happen to him.

824
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:53,583
I didn't know what it would be,

825
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:56,033
but I didn't feel
good about it.

826
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:59,748
One of Fischer's problems
was that after the match,

827
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:04,843
he was, supposedly, better known
by the population of the world,

828
01:01:04,923 --> 01:01:07,563
than anyone, except for Jesus Christ.

829
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:11,491
And, he was a guy who
treasured his privacy.

830
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,032
He had a problem.

831
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:29,051
<i>The entire world knows the
name Bobby Fischer by now.

832
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:34,923
Was it a letdown after it
was all over Bobby? I mean...

833
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:36,953
Well, there must have
been a tremendous, uh...

834
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:40,842
There was. I woke up the day
after the thing was over and...

835
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:43,793
I just felt different. Like...

836
01:01:43,853 --> 01:01:46,413
something had been
taken out of me.

837
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:05,022
He didn't really, after he won, know
what he wanted to do with his life.

838
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:08,241
He, uh, he reached an end
point, when he was 29.

839
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:12,213
He's 29 years old, and
he hadn't had a childhood.

840
01:02:17,604 --> 01:02:24,253
Is it not true that, um, the
chess masters are always young men,

841
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:27,223
and that they...
they don't last?

842
01:02:27,263 --> 01:02:30,463
Uh, that's been true, generally
speaking, but there are exceptions.

843
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:33,461
Steinitz, he was 63 when
he was world champion.

844
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,762
But, you're in a fortunate
position, because...

845
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:39,681
most of us in life, no matter
how successful we think we are,

846
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:43,402
we still have to do what other people
want us to do, just to hold jobs.

847
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:46,661
But, you don't have to hold a job...
You're on your own. -That's right.

848
01:02:46,691 --> 01:02:48,081
It's a unique position.

849
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:50,280
That's right, you can't say
"Well, if Fischer won't come,

850
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,370
we'll get some other chess genius,
uh, who's the best in the world".

851
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:01,013
Bobby Fischer, the world champion
chess player,

852
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,633
has until midnight tonight

853
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,554
to decide whether to abide
by the international rules of chess,

854
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,212
or give up his title.

855
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:11,502
If Fischer defaults, the title
would go to the challenger,

856
01:03:11,522 --> 01:03:14,801
Soviet grandmaster,
Anatoly Karpov.

857
01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:20,271
He wanted probably to play
the kid from Russia, Karpov,

858
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:24,281
and beat him. I mean, it
would be an easy task.

859
01:03:24,311 --> 01:03:30,282
On the other hand, part
of him knew he could lose.

860
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:33,450
And, that's death to Bobby.
He didn't want to risk that.

861
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:39,463
So, what came out was a series
of new demands on the rules.

862
01:03:39,493 --> 01:03:42,912
First of all, I like to
play matches without draws.

863
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:46,803
And, uh, they're gonna have to increase
the prizes, if they want me to play...

864
01:03:46,843 --> 01:03:49,173
Well, if I get a title... They want
me to play a match for the title.

865
01:03:49,203 --> 01:03:52,543
I'm not gonna just play for
what their minimum prizes are.

866
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:57,852
Accepting all of Fischer's
demands, was unacceptable

867
01:03:57,882 --> 01:04:00,353
politically for the
Soviet Chess Federation.

868
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,821
<i>Barring a very unlikely last-minute
change of heart by Fischer,

869
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:07,551
<i>Anatoly Karpov becomes the
new champion by default.

870
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:11,732
The world chess body gave him
about 95% of what he wanted,

871
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:15,960
but that was it. He
didn't defend his title.

872
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,073
I think he was unable to cope
with his own invincibility.

873
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:25,542
He got more or less
scared to sit down again,

874
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:29,042
in front of the board,
and risk losing.

875
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:33,952
But only he who never
plays, never loses.

876
01:04:35,532 --> 01:04:39,442
We all felt disappointed
that he let chess down,

877
01:04:39,472 --> 01:04:42,141
he'd let the American
masters down.

878
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,480
Yeah, we all felt
kind of a betrayal.

879
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:50,711
<i>Whereas others
could suffer from a...

880
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:52,822
<i>depression after such debacle.

881
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:56,701
I went out to California
on a job, phoned Bobby,

882
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:58,017
picked him up in Pasadena,

883
01:04:58,176 --> 01:05:02,500
where he was staying,
some cult place he was staying.

884
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:06,538
<i>I've had so many bad experiences...

885
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,895
And, he would talk
about nuclear disarmament,

886
01:05:10,802 --> 01:05:14,171
our capabilities, ICBMs, and that.

887
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:18,642
You know? And that would go on
for about an hour and a half.

888
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:22,181
<i>Just what is, the
Worldwide Church of God?

889
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:26,580
Bobby had been involved with
the Church of God, since 1962.

890
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:30,741
And after he won the Championship, the
church was providing him with a place.

891
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:33,021
The Worldwide Church
of God was a...

892
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:39,159
a group of people that believed in
fundamental principles of the Bible.

893
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:41,780
Some people would probably
call us fundamentalists.

894
01:05:41,821 --> 01:05:44,080
That will bring on
the great tribulation!

895
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,842
And that will end in the
second coming of Christ,

896
01:05:46,872 --> 01:05:48,874
the end of this
present civilization!

897
01:05:48,922 --> 01:05:53,092
Basically, a sense that there
was an impending coming Christ,

898
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:56,462
and we need to prepare for
that particular second coming.

899
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:58,283
I told him,
"It's all a bunch of hooey".

900
01:05:58,805 --> 01:06:02,430
But, uh, that's what he chose to do.

901
01:06:02,622 --> 01:06:06,791
<i>I've warned you may be living
in the time in which you will see...

902
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:09,431
I went to his apartment
in Pasadena.

903
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:11,701
It seemed to me pretty hopeless.

904
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:16,271
He was extremely depressed.

905
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:19,380
We would get into these long
discussions about the Bible.

906
01:06:20,716 --> 01:06:22,114
"Why are we here?"

907
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:25,610
"What are we doing
here? What is life?"

908
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:31,082
That's when he
started to go haywire.

909
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:34,642
He, uh, felt that he was being
influenced by these Russians,

910
01:06:34,672 --> 01:06:40,122
and he also was scared of the
Mossad, Israeli Secret Police.

911
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,432
He felt that he could be easily
spied upon through radioactivity.

912
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:50,721
And through other
means, fillings...

913
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,850
He thought maybe the Russians
could send signals there.

914
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:54,440
Phones...

915
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:57,361
Tinfoil, over
the windows...

916
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:02,511
Media... Radioactive...
This is paranoia.

917
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:11,790
We tried as church members to bring him
in to a little more of a normal life.

918
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,742
I think he turned against
the Worldwide Church of God,

919
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:20,662
when one of its prophecies
patently did not come to pass.

920
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:22,430
<i>But in the last days,
that these times

921
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:26,141
<i>right now, in which we are
living, perilous times shall come!

922
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:28,141
Fischer felt betrayed.

923
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:32,230
He wrote a pamphlet attacking the
church and Armstrong, its leader,

924
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:34,849
saying that, "Nobody should
ever control your mind".

925
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,211
<i>I was never a member
of the Church of God,

926
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,450
<i>absolutely not
true, it's a lie.

927
01:07:39,481 --> 01:07:43,290
As he denied
God, he began to get worse.

928
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:51,449
He started
to go astray.

929
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:56,452
He started reading, The
Protocols of the Elders of Zion,

930
01:07:56,504 --> 01:07:57,386
which he mentioned to me

931
01:07:57,424 --> 01:07:59,742
and I said "That book is a forgery,
and it's a hoax.

932
01:07:59,766 --> 01:08:03,612
And it's a bit of anti-Semitic
propaganda that even Hitler used".

933
01:08:03,642 --> 01:08:08,402
<i>Protocol Number 1. What has
restrained the wild beast we call men?

934
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:10,100
He got into
all these doctrines.

935
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,220
<i>What has influenced them
heretofore?</i> -The Illuminati...

936
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,752
All these different people that
were gonna take over the world.

937
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:19,360
<i>Protocol Number 9, Merciless
revenge and bitter hatred.

938
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:22,480
<i>From us emanates an
all-embracing terror.

939
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:27,780
We began to see less of Bobby because
we didn't want to expose our children,

940
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:32,669
to the famous uncle who had
become a fulminating anti-Semite.

941
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:35,910
<i>Hitler said in Mein Kampf, that
the Jews are not the victims,

942
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,013
<i>but they're the victimizers!

943
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:40,912
We could be having dinner and he
would suddenly start thinking about,

944
01:08:40,952 --> 01:08:43,102
"The Jews did this,
and the Jews did that".

945
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,651
And in our house it
was just unacceptable.

946
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:49,220
<i>They're actually making things
happen, and causing revolutions,

947
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,221
<i>and killing people
all over the world...

948
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:55,032
<i>You start mixing fish with
humans, and anything is possible.

949
01:08:55,062 --> 01:08:58,360
His mother was Jewish.
His real father was Jewish.

950
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,761
It's complete madness.

951
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:06,070
The question is how could a
Jewish kid become an anti-Semite?

952
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:10,409
Paranoid psychosis.

953
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:16,800
He had false fixed ideas of a very
widening conspiracy against him.

954
01:09:18,269 --> 01:09:23,093
It was as if he were
at war with himself.

955
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:29,141
He became a recluse. Fischer watchers
refer to it as the "wilderness years".

956
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:39,221
Where's Bobby these
days? -Oh, Bobby's at home.

957
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,440
- Where, in New York?
- Well, I...

958
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,441
I don't think that I want to
get on the subject of Bobby.

959
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:47,080
You know how Bobby feels
about it. -Yeah.

960
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:53,349
The last conversation
we had, enraged him.

961
01:09:53,379 --> 01:09:57,190
"If you don't play chess...

962
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:03,489
there will soon come a time when
no one will ask you to play chess".

963
01:10:03,627 --> 01:10:06,493
He thought that was unacceptable

964
01:10:08,065 --> 01:10:10,429
and that was the end
of our relationship.

965
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:17,841
If you look
throughout history,

966
01:10:17,911 --> 01:10:20,780
there have been a disproportionate
number

967
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:22,879
of extremely talented
chess players,

968
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:26,697
who have also had serious
psychological issues.

969
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:30,570
You are putting yourself
in a world that is infinite.

970
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:32,985
It's abstract.

971
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:36,518
You are, in essence,
reshaping your mind.

972
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,328
If you understand that in the
first move of a chess game...

973
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:44,639
each player has 20
possible moves.

974
01:10:44,669 --> 01:10:47,551
If you multiply 20 by 20,
that means there are 400

975
01:10:47,591 --> 01:10:52,262
different possible chess
positions, after the first move.

976
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:57,851
The tree becomes with a
lot of branches, you know.

977
01:10:57,901 --> 01:11:02,021
That, you start with one move and that
one move there are several options...

978
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,899
Then all of the sudden
it becomes a jungle.

979
01:11:03,951 --> 01:11:05,618
The number of all positions that

980
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,291
theoretically can occur
in the game of chess...

981
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:12,104
is something like
ten with 45 zeros.

982
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:16,979
It's like the number of atoms
in the solar system.

983
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:20,998
You're trying to anticipate
what your opponent might do,

984
01:11:21,038 --> 01:11:22,619
and you don't know
what he might do.

985
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:25,758
So, you are thinking of all
the different possibilities.

986
01:11:25,788 --> 01:11:29,762
A good chess player is
paranoid on the board.

987
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:36,001
But then, if you take that paranoia
to real life, it doesn't play so well.

988
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:42,310
You end up seeing your real world,
according to the confines of chess.

989
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,811
There were some
that came to a sad end.

990
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:54,189
I mean, we like to think that chess
didn't cause that, but maybe it did.

991
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:02,029
An individual with
an unbalanced tendency,

992
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:08,029
by becoming a chess monomaniac,
will throw himself over the brink.

993
01:12:08,049 --> 01:12:13,591
Yeah, we have some examples where
people of, um... exceptional abilities,

994
01:12:13,682 --> 01:12:17,680
were infected by this,
uh, mental illness.

995
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:22,351
Victor Korchnoi claimed to have
played a match with a dead man.

996
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:25,600
He even provided the
moves. -Rubenstein...

997
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,190
Rubenstein jumped out the window,
because the fly was after him.

998
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,159
Wilhelm Steinitz.

999
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:32,190
Steinitz was in an institution.

1000
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:33,509
Steinitz, in late life,

1001
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:38,996
thought he was playing chess
by wireless with God Almighty.

1002
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,289
And, had the better
of God Almighty.

1003
01:12:43,338 --> 01:12:47,339
Carlos Torre took all
his clothes off on a bus.

1004
01:12:49,739 --> 01:12:54,768
And, the probably greatest name, the
greatest impact on the game of chess,

1005
01:12:54,798 --> 01:13:00,671
uh, in the 19th century, belonged
to an American player, Paul Morphy.

1006
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,211
Unfortunately, there is some
resemblance with Fischer.

1007
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,052
Paul Morphy was an
American player

1008
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:10,453
who stunned the world
with his chess play.

1009
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:15,040
And then at age 26 he wandered
the streets aimlessly.

1010
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:19,459
He muttered to himself. He
became a paranoid schizophrenic.

1011
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:25,379
His tour in Europe in 1858, 1859 was
one of the most unforgettable events,

1012
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:30,998
in the history of chess, and
then Morphy stopped playing chess.

1013
01:13:31,048 --> 01:13:34,387
There are many similarities
between Morphy and Fischer.

1014
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:39,141
People are always gonna, uh,
equate their names together.

1015
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,431
They both gave up the game
at the height of their powers.

1016
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:43,175
And disappeared into a...

1017
01:13:44,804 --> 01:13:48,613
world of neurosis, of psychosis.

1018
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,449
<i>Where did Bobby Fischer go?

1019
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,109
<i>What happened to Bobby Fischer?

1020
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:01,751
<i>We spent countless hours
prowling the streets,

1021
01:14:01,781 --> 01:14:03,780
<i>where he's been known to roam.

1022
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,700
<i>Looking for him at chess clubs
where he's been known to play.

1023
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:11,658
<i>Ultimately, the now investigation was
successful. We found Bobby Fischer.

1024
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,007
<i>The quest paid off.

1025
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:20,618
In 1990, he shows up in Pasadena,
little on the heavy side.

1026
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:23,690
He hands me this letter.

1027
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:29,262
"Mr. Fischer, you are the
Mozart of the chess world.

1028
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:33,060
I want you to get
back into chess".

1029
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,969
Her name was Zita.

1030
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,519
"I wonder what she
looks like, Harry".

1031
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:43,240
All of a sudden, he's
romantically entwined.

1032
01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:46,381
She got him off all
of his rationalizations,

1033
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:48,732
why he couldn't play chess
anymore.

1034
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:52,498
And... and she set
up the tournament.

1035
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:57,598
After many false alarms, it was a
19-year-old Hungarian chess player,

1036
01:14:57,638 --> 01:15:03,058
Zita Raycsanyi who brought
Fischer back to chess.

1037
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,011
Do you think he's
still as handsome now?

1038
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:08,321
What do you think?

1039
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:12,741
As a result of their meeting, Zita
rushed off to arrange Bobby's comeback.

1040
01:15:12,771 --> 01:15:18,329
<i>The chess world was shaken today
with news that an old legend lives,

1041
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,280
<i>apparently ready to risk
himself in public again.

1042
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:24,499
<i>Headlines around the world
announced he'd signed a contract,

1043
01:15:24,529 --> 01:15:29,199
<i>to play a rematch, with his old Russian
rival form Iceland, Boris Spassky.

1044
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,460
I was in the chess world. Everybody is
waiting for him to play for 20 years.

1045
01:15:32,509 --> 01:15:36,008
I mean, month after month, year
after year, there were these stories.

1046
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:38,878
He's negotiating this. You know,
someone's trying to raise this for him.

1047
01:15:38,908 --> 01:15:41,208
He wouldn't play,
finally he plays!

1048
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:44,768
He was playing, uh, uh, in
Yugoslavia against Spassky.

1049
01:15:44,798 --> 01:15:48,920
It was trumpeted as a return
World Championship Match.

1050
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:55,259
This is a typical question, uh, from
Mr. Roger Cohen of The New York Times.

1051
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,260
"If you
beat Spassky...

1052
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,268
will you go on to challenge
Kasparov for the World Championship?"

1053
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:05,709
Well... can he read what
it says behind here?

1054
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:15,778
The match took place in Yugoslavia
during the middle of the Yugoslav war.

1055
01:16:15,798 --> 01:16:21,668
And by participating, Fischer
broke a U.N. backed embargo.

1056
01:16:21,717 --> 01:16:23,757
The U.S. government sent
him a letter, and said...

1057
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,758
"Don't play, if you do
you're going to go to jail".

1058
01:16:26,788 --> 01:16:30,350
This is my reply to their order
not to defend my title here.

1059
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,231
That's my answer...

1060
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:41,289
The match of '92, in my
view, had no chess relevance.

1061
01:16:41,329 --> 01:16:45,778
They played very decent chess,
but it was chess of 1972.

1062
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:52,788
It's like watching two old boxers come
back into the ring for one last payday.

1063
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:59,428
A slightly sad affair where both
players are clearly past their best.

1064
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:03,959
Both Fischer and Spassky are
shadows of their former selves.

1065
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:10,467
He won, and won several
million dollars,

1066
01:17:10,497 --> 01:17:15,610
but was declared a criminal for
having taken part in the match.

1067
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,361
Today a federal
grand jury here in Washington,

1068
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:23,399
charged Robert James "Bobby"
Fischer with a criminal violation,

1069
01:17:23,449 --> 01:17:27,999
of the United States imposed sanctions
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

1070
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:32,239
Fischer faces up to 10 years in
prison, and the millions of dollars

1071
01:17:32,279 --> 01:17:37,848
of proceeds of the chess match, are
forfeitable to the United States.

1072
01:17:37,878 --> 01:17:43,588
Bobby Fischer, like anyone else, should
be held accountable for his actions.

1073
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:45,308
The cost was very high.

1074
01:17:45,337 --> 01:17:48,217
I mean, he lost his country. He
couldn't come back. He was indicted.

1075
01:17:48,257 --> 01:17:52,058
A lot of people questioned the validity
of this indictment, but it was a law.

1076
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:55,821
So, Fischer broke the law.

1077
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:59,770
He couldn't come back into the
country. They were out to arrest him.

1078
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:02,159
So, he became
an expatriate.

1079
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:19,338
I saw him in Yugoslavia,
but it was pointless.

1080
01:18:21,908 --> 01:18:26,828
You know, he was gone,
it was no longer a story.

1081
01:18:26,858 --> 01:18:33,337
I knew Zita. I knew her
personally, and she was a nice girl.

1082
01:18:33,367 --> 01:18:35,967
But, who knows
what he did there?

1083
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:50,618
Joan had
gone to Hungary,

1084
01:18:50,648 --> 01:18:56,459
in 1995, to visit Bobby, when
he was staying in Budapest.

1085
01:18:56,489 --> 01:18:59,498
That's the last of our
family who had seen him.

1086
01:19:01,498 --> 01:19:04,198
Regina died in '96.

1087
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:08,718
And my wife, Joan,
died in 1998,

1088
01:19:08,788 --> 01:19:14,058
from a cerebral hemorrhage,
no forewarning at all...

1089
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:18,097
Died... within
a half a day.

1090
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:22,140
It was a tragedy. His mother
dies, his sister dies.

1091
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:28,309
Bobby was stripped of any family
support that he could hope for.

1092
01:19:28,329 --> 01:19:33,859
And when he was a man without a
country, he got worse and worse.

1093
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:40,589
<i>This is all wonderful news.

1094
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:44,088
<i>It's time for the fucking U.S.
to get their heads kicked in.

1095
01:19:44,129 --> 01:19:47,012
<i>It's time to finish off
the U.S. once and for all.

1096
01:19:47,064 --> 01:19:50,655
<i>This just shows you that
what goes around comes around.

1097
01:19:50,868 --> 01:19:52,590
<i>Even for the United States.

1098
01:19:55,717 --> 01:19:58,051
He felt that he was above politics,

1099
01:19:58,509 --> 01:20:00,306
and could say whatever
he wanted to say.

1100
01:20:00,637 --> 01:20:04,459
And George Bush says, "No, you're
not. I can grab you, wherever you are".

1101
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:10,279
United States citizen,
Robert "Bobby" Fischer,

1102
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,150
has been detained
by Japanese authorities

1103
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:15,399
on alleged immigration law violations.

1104
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:21,488
I got a collect phone
call from Japan.

1105
01:20:21,528 --> 01:20:26,118
"From who?" I said, or
he said, "Bobby Fischer".

1106
01:20:26,148 --> 01:20:30,298
Twenty-two years I haven't
heard from him, not anything.

1107
01:20:30,337 --> 01:20:34,137
But, he must have kept me
in the drawer or something.

1108
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:38,306
So, I was not completely
forgotten when he needed me.

1109
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:42,647
And, I went to Japan to
get this man out of jail.

1110
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:56,750
When I saw him there,
it was on his birthday.

1111
01:20:56,779 --> 01:20:59,668
He asked me if I could
help him out, you know.

1112
01:21:00,748 --> 01:21:03,898
I said "I will see
what I can do".

1113
01:21:17,296 --> 01:21:23,308
Iceland has stood up and
offered him residency.

1114
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:27,586
Iceland has stood up
and given him passport.

1115
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:33,399
At the end, we, this small
nation of 300,000 people

1116
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:39,368
intervened, and went against
the United States and Japan,

1117
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:43,038
the two strongest
economies in the world.

1118
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:45,559
And got him to Iceland.

1119
01:21:59,757 --> 01:22:03,258
Bobby Fischer!

1120
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:06,477
Welcome to Iceland, Mr. Fischer,
how does it feel to be home?

1121
01:22:06,516 --> 01:22:08,096
Great, great.

1122
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,236
You're getting quite a hero's
welcome, did you expect this?

1123
01:22:10,267 --> 01:22:12,306
No I didn't. -We've got
a car waiting for you.

1124
01:22:12,317 --> 01:22:16,139
This is your, uh, first time in
Iceland in quite a few years...

1125
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,345
You weren't that thrilled
the first time around.

1126
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:19,895
Think it will be better this time?

1127
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:23,420
That is not true, I never...
You mean...

1128
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,819
You mean, I didn't want
to play here originally?

1129
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:26,707
Well... Yeah.

1130
01:22:26,849 --> 01:22:30,761
I explained all that. That was all a
CIA setup. I'll explain that someday.

1131
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:32,815
We look forward to that.

1132
01:22:32,839 --> 01:22:35,087
Bobby Fischer, welcome to Iceland,
and thanks for talking to us.

1133
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,598
Have a good night.

1134
01:22:59,068 --> 01:23:01,398
Sorry for
keeping you waiting.

1135
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:03,489
How does it
feel to be a free person?

1136
01:23:03,519 --> 01:23:05,488
Oh, it feels great.

1137
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:11,408
You got a wonderful country,
wonderful fresh air, very fine people.

1138
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:16,388
Um, excellent food,
uh, plenty of room...

1139
01:23:16,418 --> 01:23:18,167
What's next, Bobby?

1140
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,417
I still want to do a
book showing how the...

1141
01:23:21,477 --> 01:23:26,397
1984-85 Karpov-Kasparov match
was pre-arranged, move by move.

1142
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:27,809
They all say, "Oh, Fischer...

1143
01:23:28,328 --> 01:23:30,170
didn't write the book he said
he was going to write".

1144
01:23:30,227 --> 01:23:33,846
Yeah! But they don't say that
they stole all my file on it.

1145
01:23:33,886 --> 01:23:39,028
They don't say that they stole
several big moving boxes full of books,

1146
01:23:39,058 --> 01:23:40,909
that took me years
to accumulate.

1147
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,829
- What is your name?
- Jeremy.

1148
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:44,358
- Jeremy, what?
- Schapp.

1149
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:46,798
Your father was Dick Schapp,
you were telling me last night?

1150
01:23:46,828 --> 01:23:49,337
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah, I knew him, yeah.

1151
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:51,087
He rapped me very hard.

1152
01:23:51,118 --> 01:23:53,909
He said that, I don't have
a sane bone in my body.

1153
01:23:53,918 --> 01:23:56,288
I didn't forget that.

1154
01:23:56,338 --> 01:24:00,098
His father many, many
years ago befriended me.

1155
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,376
Took me out to see, I
don't remember what...

1156
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,546
- Knicks games.
- Knicks games, and...

1157
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:08,687
You were 12. -Acted kind
of like a father figure...

1158
01:24:08,717 --> 01:24:12,106
And then later, like a
typical Jewish snake,

1159
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:14,556
he had the most vicious
things to say about me.

1160
01:24:14,586 --> 01:24:16,647
- I have to object, Bobby.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1161
01:24:16,697 --> 01:24:20,696
Did you read the article where he said,
I don't have a sane bone in my body?

1162
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:23,768
Honestly, I'm not sure if I read
it, but I know that he said it.

1163
01:24:23,788 --> 01:24:26,439
- Yeah.
- And, and, honestly...

1164
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:28,474
I don't know that you've done
much here today, really,

1165
01:24:28,913 --> 01:24:31,158
to disprove anything he said.

1166
01:24:45,928 --> 01:24:50,056
I met Bobby
after he came to Iceland.

1167
01:24:50,096 --> 01:24:53,026
His existence was
a very lonely one.

1168
01:24:55,066 --> 01:24:58,423
He gradually, in Iceland,
like everywhere else,

1169
01:24:58,522 --> 01:25:00,990
he alienated people with his behavior.

1170
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:04,579
I had two...
I had one huge safe...

1171
01:25:04,609 --> 01:25:08,198
We just walked around the pond,
downtown Reykjavik, and we talked...

1172
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:10,998
and we had coffee
together, and...

1173
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:15,168
Then, I met him a few times when I
ran into him in restaurants, etcetera.

1174
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:19,327
The U.S. didn't give a damn
what their opinions were anymore.

1175
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:20,692
Their role was over.

1176
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,514
Now the bomb belongs to the
government, you understand?

1177
01:25:23,538 --> 01:25:25,767
- This is... This is...
- And, and they were...

1178
01:25:25,797 --> 01:25:28,047
And they were shocked.
They didn't believe it.

1179
01:25:28,097 --> 01:25:31,466
Listen to me, if we are going to
have a fucking conversation... -Okay.

1180
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:35,975
All right? Then this cannot
be a monologue. -Yeah, okay.

1181
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:37,771
He, uh, could not...

1182
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:42,722
tear himself from the topic
of the evil nature of the Jews,

1183
01:25:43,495 --> 01:25:45,661
and the evil nature
of the United States

1184
01:25:45,806 --> 01:25:48,357
or the evil nature of nuclear power.

1185
01:25:48,618 --> 01:25:50,568
He talked about this relentlessly.

1186
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:53,658
And, you couldn't... really couldn't
pull him out of that discussion.

1187
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:57,328
It was not just that he
was talking about it.

1188
01:25:57,358 --> 01:26:04,198
It was also the obsessive-compulsive
nature of the discussion,

1189
01:26:04,217 --> 01:26:05,757
the relentless nature of it.

1190
01:26:05,807 --> 01:26:08,837
You don't see how fucked up the
world is, that's a form of insanity.

1191
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:11,475
The last
time I ran into him...

1192
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:17,897
I turned him away from my table,
because I had gotten enough of him.

1193
01:26:17,936 --> 01:26:23,566
Most of us, think within
relatively narrow boundaries.

1194
01:26:23,606 --> 01:26:27,736
But, an occasional individual
manages to get outside of the box.

1195
01:26:27,776 --> 01:26:30,015
Those are the people
who make new discoveries.

1196
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:31,822
Those are the creative people.

1197
01:26:32,028 --> 01:26:36,838
But, occasionally, it is
difficult to get back into the box.

1198
01:26:36,867 --> 01:26:40,037
<i>The king moves,
takes the queen...

1199
01:26:40,067 --> 01:26:47,048
His genius and his illness
are joined at the hip.

1200
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:51,877
I don't think that Bobby could have
been as creative, as extraordinary,

1201
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,937
without being extraordinary
in other aspects.

1202
01:26:54,967 --> 01:26:57,267
And that aspect,
we call a disease.

1203
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:06,097
I don't consider
myself to be...

1204
01:27:06,116 --> 01:27:08,525
a genius at chess.

1205
01:27:08,565 --> 01:27:12,938
I consider myself
more to be, uh...

1206
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:17,157
a genius who just happens to
play chess, you understand?

1207
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,407
So, I could be doing any...

1208
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:23,418
I could have done, and I can do any
number of other things, you know?

1209
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:25,587
You know, I always wanted
to write some songs.

1210
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:29,137
I was telling Evans, uh, Larry Evans.
This was back in the 60's, I remember.

1211
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:32,427
I said, you know, I listen to all these
songs. I wish I could write them...

1212
01:27:32,457 --> 01:27:35,126
But, I try to write something.
I try to think of something,

1213
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:37,676
and, I guess,
nothing comes out.

1214
01:27:37,726 --> 01:27:41,266
And, he says, "Yeah, because
you haven't lived... "

1215
01:27:41,296 --> 01:27:44,315
And I started
thinking about it, he's right.

1216
01:27:45,656 --> 01:27:50,105
My chess library, all my
other regular library...

1217
01:27:50,136 --> 01:27:53,075
All my personal correspondence,
all my chess sets...

1218
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:58,819
All kind of stuff, everything
just stolen. Everything...

1219
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:00,988
He died from his
psychiatric illness.

1220
01:28:00,998 --> 01:28:05,488
He did not want to accept treatment
for benign prostatic hypertrophy.

1221
01:28:05,508 --> 01:28:08,326
He refused dialysis,
I understand.

1222
01:28:08,346 --> 01:28:12,047
Probably could have prolonged
his life, if he had taken it.

1223
01:28:12,077 --> 01:28:16,516
I was able to get him a photograph
of Regina and Joan to have with him,

1224
01:28:16,546 --> 01:28:20,466
which is what he had with him
in the hospital when he died.

1225
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,126
Reportedly, Fischer's
last words were...

1226
01:28:25,156 --> 01:28:28,156
"Nothing is so healing
as the human touch".

1227
01:28:36,566 --> 01:28:41,038
The Former World Champion of
Chess, Bobby Fischer has died.

1228
01:28:41,078 --> 01:28:43,998
His career reached its height
during matches with his

1229
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:47,077
nemesis, Boris
Spassky, back in 1972.

1230
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:49,188
<i>American chess superstar,
Bobby Fischer, has just died.

1231
01:28:49,217 --> 01:28:51,997
<i>Former World Chess Champion
Bobby Fischer has died.

1232
01:28:52,037 --> 01:28:55,117
<i>Considered by many as the
greatest chess player of all time.

1233
01:28:55,157 --> 01:28:59,027
<i>Bobby Fischer dead
at the age of 64.

1234
01:29:04,566 --> 01:29:07,046
Just his games,
that's his monument.

1235
01:29:08,685 --> 01:29:10,715
His games.

1236
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,634
If you love an art...

1237
01:29:15,607 --> 01:29:18,304
Let's say, you love painting.

1238
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:22,768
Imagine if Picasso had died
after only five years of work,

1239
01:29:22,798 --> 01:29:25,566
and all the rest of his
works had never appeared.

1240
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:30,537
This was a tragedy for
the whole chess world.

1241
01:29:33,377 --> 01:29:35,456
He did it all by himself.

1242
01:29:37,596 --> 01:29:42,906
He penetrated the secrets of chess,
in this shabby Brooklyn apartment.

1243
01:29:46,436 --> 01:29:48,936
He was the best player
who ever lived.

1244
01:29:50,556 --> 01:29:53,526
Bobby Fischer.
Sound Roll 3.

1245
01:29:54,926 --> 01:29:56,565
Right.

1246
01:29:58,455 --> 01:30:00,115
Speed.

1247
01:30:01,034 --> 01:30:02,705
Bobby, uh...

1248
01:30:02,735 --> 01:30:04,737
You've been playing this game
since you were 6 years old.

1249
01:30:04,777 --> 01:30:08,797
And, playing it very seriously
since shortly after the age of six.

1250
01:30:08,827 --> 01:30:12,967
Did all this concentration, to the
exclusion of other activities...

1251
01:30:12,997 --> 01:30:17,466
Did this bother you? Do you think this
deprived you of anything growing up?

1252
01:30:17,506 --> 01:30:20,887
Maybe, yeah, yeah,
to some extent, yeah.

1253
01:30:20,927 --> 01:30:23,006
Like what?

1254
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:25,396
Well, it would have been better,
you know, a little more balanced...

1255
01:30:25,426 --> 01:30:29,646
Yeah, maybe, you know, a little
more rounded, but what can you do?

1256
01:32:55,247 --> 01:32:58,547
