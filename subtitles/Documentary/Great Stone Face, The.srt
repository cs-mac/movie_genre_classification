00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,660
I know she'll be here that Professor McGonagall

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,010
Good evening Professor Dumbledore

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Do not know rumors are not true anymore?

5
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,020
I am also very worried professors Ã  On the good and evil

6
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,480
- And the baby, why? Hagrid is bringing it to

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,660
Instruments that wise to trust Hagrid with something important like that?

8
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,660
My whole life is to trust Hagrid

9
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,060
Dear Professor Dumbledore Professor McGonagall

10
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,150
- No matter what I believe Hagrid instead? Well okay

11
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,820
Just having a little trouble only fly over Bristol

12
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,070
Do him the province.

13
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,990
It then.

14
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,920
How specific do you think it's safe to leave it with these people?

15
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,420
I think this whole thing has held true evil is so amazing

16
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,590
The family that the boy live

17
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,810
The boy would become famous. He will not forget what the name implies

18
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,770
Yes

19
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,270
He better let it grow up away from the thing ...

20
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,440
until it is ready

21
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,960
It's not goodbye, but

22
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,470
Good luck ...

23
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,480
... Harry Potter

24
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,120
Bloody

25
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,170

26
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,270
Get up guy cousin, we go the park

Birthdays come and boys. Happy birthday son Nhe

28
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,710
Why you do not get baked bread for breakfast and try not to burn anything there

29
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,920
I want everything to be perfect

30
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,050

They are great not hard ha?

33
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,230
All how many?

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,690
Last year was the 37th of that

35
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,740
- A number larger than this number of children a year. I do not care how big they

36
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,490
This is what parents will do

37
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,080
My parents would buy you two new outfits Nhe

38
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,380
Would have a beautiful day in the park. Mother excited too.

39
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,760
Now I warn you

40
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,510
if there is any action that weird

41
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,770
you will have to starve in a week

42
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,270
Of the following graph:

43
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,860
Make it away

44
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,240

45
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,950
cows go. It is sleep that

46
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,700
Animals boring

47
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,630
Sorry. It was liking that.

48
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,880
... see the ugly face swim

49
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,300
You can hear the game I mean?

50
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,810
I never ever talk to both solid

51
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,730
Do you ...

52
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,070
... Or talk to people?

53
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,490
You come from Burma, right? Nice but where?

54
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,990
You lose family?

55
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,580
Tao also be full. I never saw their parents again

56
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,800
Dad, here. Dad will not believe the snake is doing what

57
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,860
Thank you !

58
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,530
Ko nothing

59
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,790
Snakes!

60
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,600
Mommy save me

61
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,970
How did you fall in there?

62
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,560
What was her child and that this creep? There are no snakes?

63
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,740
Department Pets okay! Mother take me instead of wet suits.

64
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,410
- What happened?
- I swear is not known which

65
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,500
The mirror has disappeared like magic it

66
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,710
There is nothing magic here is the kid

67
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,270
Laughter does.

68
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,490
Vernon, watching him watch. I can not believe it.

69
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,200
In another week the boy will attend Smeltings.

70
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,370
Release of Smeltonia. That is most proud of in our lifetime!

71
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,250
I have things to wear that?

72
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,670
- Why? Smeltings you to attend?
- Ha!

73
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,010
Do not be stupid. You will attend Stone Walling, where with you.

74
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,720
You will wear this stuff after I dyed it.

75
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,930
But it is Dudley's old uniform. I would like elephant skin loss disguised.

76
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,690
Will fit only you.

77
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,230
Go get the mail out, quick!

78
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,100
Marge sick from eating a snail's funny.

79
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,520
Harry is a letter.
- Return to me, that's me

80
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,480
Who wrote that for you baby?

81
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,260
Will not have any letters any more by the mailbox

82
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,280
Wishes him a happy working

83
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,870
Go

84
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,680
Beautiful Sunday

85
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,980
As we are the best of the week. Why Dudley Huh?

86
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,560
Because there will be no mail on Sundays? That's right Harry

87
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,570
Ko messages from all

88
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,900
Today will not be cursed letters

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,410
Ko is a letter to all hell

90

Well now!

93
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,280
What's the mother?

94
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,040
Give me the letter

95
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,420
Put me out

96
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,340
They are her letters, throw me out

97
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,140
We will go away from here

98
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,480
Away from here, where they can not find!

99
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,980
Does not he is insane?

100
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,180
For a treaty to which Harry

101
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,330
Someone?

102
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,920
Sorry

103
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,390
I want him to leave immediately. He is broken into my house there

104
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,070
Hey, im Offers listening, Mr. Dursley?

105
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,820
I have long not seen since she was a baby

106
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,580
She looks bigger than it sounds. especially in the song there

107
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,580
I ... Harry's not

108
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,170
A nephew.
- Well of course she then

109
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,550
This is what I ne

110
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,350
I just fear that has sat on it but not much flavor is fine.

111
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,270
I made cake, both written and all disabilities.

112
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,860
Thanks Uncle

113

Of course I know a little about Hogwarts instead. Ko a

117
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,150
I do not want to know why my parents are learning here?

118
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,770
Ko to ache

119
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,530
You're a witch there

120
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,780
She is something of a? A Witch

121
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,030
and I need to be trained a little

122
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,160
Make Your wrong. Italian children, I can not ...

123
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,330
... As a witch is

124
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,790
I just ... Harry

125
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,840
was only Harry. I've done anything that upset yet?

126
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,760
anything that I can not explain why when I was angry or scared

127
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,020
Hm.

128
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
Dear grandson Potter we are here to inform me that

129

She has received education at Hogwarts school of magic and magic

130
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,870
It will not go there we'll stop this silly stuff

131
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,340
Uncle knew without telling me?

132
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,630
Of course I know. How do you not rather have?

133
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,550
Sister completeness of the tao.

134
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm very proud parent when it received a letter like this

135
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,100
We're a witch in the family miracle baby?

136
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,980
Only you I see how it is

137
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,900
Monsters!

138
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,110
When it encounters a hand Potter and generate you ...

139
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,040
... I know you also like only. strange and unusual

140
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,250
And when it exploded four that I stuck with you.

141
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Explode? The people who say her parents died in a car crash

142
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,010
A car crash that killed Lily and James Potter are u?

143
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,140
It is insulting and shameful

144
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,770
It will not go anywhere,

145
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,350
A fat like his Muggle name, but ask to speak back?

146
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
Muggle?

147
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Who have no magic. He had the right since it was born

148
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,950
You will learn best in magic schools

149
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,120
operated by the principal talent never thayt at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore particular.

150
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,120
I WILL NOT PAY FOR LABOR penny idiot straight wire POTTER What are evil!

151
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,880
Never insult Albus Dumbledore tools ...

152
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,130
... Before me

153
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,280
Uncle would appreciate if you do not tell this to anyone at Hogwart

154
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,620
- We are not the magic,
- Yes

155
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,910
Your only task is to make

156
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,300
Of course if you do not want to stay here

157
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,400
First year students need three sets of robes to practice ...

158
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,440
... A wand. "

159
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,610
A few essential items that Harry.

160
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,660
"A pair of leather gloves dragon."

161
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,780
Hagrid, that they are really a dragon?

162
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,240
They have no intention penguins right? Ha

163
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,370
- Crikey, I like a dragon.
- Uncle like dragons?

164
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,130
Just as people do not understand the beast only, Harry.

165
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,960
Confused.

166
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,510
"All students must be equipped ...

167
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,680
... A cauldron a size 2 or maybe more if you like ...

168
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,690
... With an owl, cat or toad. "

169
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,530
we can find all U in London?

170
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,110
If you find the right place.

171
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,850
Ah, Hagrid! As usual, but still

172
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,930
No thanks Tom I'm performing for Hogwarts

173
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,230
Helping Harry to school supplies shopping.

174
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,020
Chai Oh! It was Harry Potter!

175
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,740
Welcome me back, Potter.

176
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,330
Doris Crockford. I can not believe I finally met.

177
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,040
It's hard to describe the joy of it, Harry Potter.

178
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,750
Hello professor, I do not see him here

179
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,010
Professor Quirrel teacher would be against the Dark Arts Room of the child.

180
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,590
Pleased to meet me

181
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,970
Feeling awful appeal

182
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,770
We have to get going Potter

183
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,900
There are many things to buy

184
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,860
Welcome him.

185
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,120
Son of the famous, that does not
- A famous child star?

186
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,790
All they do know who she is?

187
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,790
Your Uncle is not sure the right person to tell you about it

188
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,600
Welcome to the Xeo Alley.

189
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,460
Here you will earn echidnas and ink.

190
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,630
There are all sorts of distortions to describe magic pi.

191
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,690
Flying broom class.

192
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,820
Look it behold the new Nimbus 2000

193
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,370
it is the fastest flying broom

194
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,670
Uncle Hargid me how to pay for this? I do not have money

195
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,210
Kia is her money, bank Gringotts wizards

196
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,970
Unable to secure. Except Hogwarts.

197
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,610
What exactly are they that?

198
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,080
They are the goblins, but is not the most friendly creatures.

199
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Follow any Uncle

200
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,920
Mr. Harry wants to withdraw assets.

201
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,340
So Mr. Harry Potter is the key graph:

202
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,510
Wait a minute do I get it

203
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,190
It took a little bit difficult

204
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,270
and also something more

205
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,860
Professor Dumbledore gave me this

206
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,950
Get a bag he know it's out of the cellar

207
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,250
Very good

208
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,300
Ham 687

209
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,470
Please lamp

210
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,310
The key

211
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,510
Think that parents do not leave her anything, right?

212
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,510
- Ham 713
- Something in which a

213
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,930
Can not tell me the service was top secret at Hogwarts to

214
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,720
Back to back

215
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Do not mention this to anyone Nhe Harry

216
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,140
I'm still missing a wand again

217
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,770
Wand u? In stores Olivanders No place better

218
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,570
Why not me in there and wait, your a few other things to do

219
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:23,220
Hello?

220
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,020
I wonder when I see, Mr. Potter.

221
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,030
just like only yesterday ...

222
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,120
... Father and mother here to buy the wand of their first

223
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,090
It then

224
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,220
Let's try it waved

225
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,230
It seems not to

226
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,860
Sometimes ...

227
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,660
This ...

228
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,380
No definitely not no problem ...

229
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,180
I wonder

230
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,710
Weird.

231
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,840
Yes, very strange

232
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,180
Sorry but what is he a weird?

233
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,180
I remember carefully one by which we sold to them

234
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,140
Phoenix has feathers ...

235
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,060
make her wand, has a different feather.

236
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,570
for someone else

237
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,070
It is strange as I was pre-fixed with this wand

238
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:55,040
As his wand of it causing it to scar me

239
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,080
And who owns a wand that?

240
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,340
We really do not want to say his name out

241
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,260
Wands often take a witch

242
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,510
Not always clear why

243
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,390
But I think clearly

244
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,520
that we can expect great things when the baby

245
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,980
after all he has done

246
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,900
Great

247
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,110
Horrible

248
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,780
but great

249
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,500
Harry

250
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,250
Happy Birthday Nhe

251
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,800
You're right

252
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,890
It seems longer shy

253
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:58,810
He did not kill my parents a right? Who left me this this?

254
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,650
Uncle said that Hagrid would say I know Uncle

255
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,110
First, your understand this because it is very important

256
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,820
Not all wizards are good

257
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,580
One of them had degenerated

258
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:21,790
A few years ago a wizard has become extremely cruel. And of his name is ...

259
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,630
- His name is ...
- Your can write it

260
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,670
Your spells do not know where

261
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,180
Well ... Voldemort

262
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,800
Shh.

263
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,350
It was a dark period Harry

264
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,810
Voldemont review and set those who follow him

265
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,360
bring them to the Dark side

266
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,860
Anyone who is against both died

267
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,070
Parents to have to fight them

268
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,080
No one saw the murderer

269
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,040
None

270
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,630
Except for me both

271
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,720
I u? Voldemont tried ... I kill u?

272
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,390
And then he left a cut on her forehead

273
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,400
It is the result of an evil curse

274
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,230
What happened to him?

275
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,740
Some say he died

276
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,410
Your guess he is still out there

277
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,870
Too weak to continue

278
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,040
but one thing is of course completely

279
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,670
about things that I have challenged him in the evening

280
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,170
That is why her popularity. That's why everyone says that to me

281
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,260
She is the baby still alive

282
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,360
She looked about?

283
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,110
By now it u?

284
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Your grandchildren must break up, there is more work assigned to Uncle Dumbledore

285
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,410
The train will depart in 10 minutes

286
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,960
Her ticket here. Hold a good time. It is important to Gil

287
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,090
"Ga 9 Â¾"?

288
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,090
But Hagrid, make any mistakes. This is the platform 9 Â¾ where

289
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,640
What is the platform that

290
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,740
here?

291
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,000
Excuse Notes

292
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,750
Why?

293
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,790
can pay for me to know the platform 9 Â¾ where not a

294
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,510
The platform 9 Â¾, you do not think it was a joke silly game?

295
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,090
MRS. Weasley: It's the same every year, packed with muggles.

296
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,930
Go to the platform 9 Â¾ this way

297
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,770
Percy child before going

298
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,950
Fred continued to do

299
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,870
- It's not Fred, I here of that.
- In the only other time we recognize

300
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Sorry George

301
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,550
Con only a joke, but I was Fred

302
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,970
Sorry Uncle

303
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,850
Uncle told me how ...

304
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,560
how in the station right? Where not hard

305
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,270
Ron gambler is it the first time to Hogwarts there

306
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,400
All I do is go through the wall of the station was between 9 and 10

307
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,070
- Just try to run if you do not worry.
- Good luck

308
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,930
Hello. Are you afraid ... All the seats were packed and

309
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,350
No problem

310
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,850
Oh by the way his name is Ron

311
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,730
I was Harry Potter

312
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,150
Oh so that's true then

313
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,150
I mean he really is ...

314
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,620
- What?
- Scar was

315
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, yeah.

316
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,000
It's cruel

317
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,630
- There is not anything like the love child?
- No thanks, I already have all gone

318
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,970
They will take me a lot

319
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,010
Whoa.

320
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,480
- Among them is something that
- It's hard to say, chocolate and mint, the name Betty Bott, and gum meet you, very much

321
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,280
These frogs do not have it right?

322
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,320
It is just magic

323
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,700
Besides, each packet has a picture of a famous magician

324
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,710
- There is no real frog?
- The time is the mantra. which require the card.

325
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,390
Each package has a witch or a famous magician. I then earned a 500.

326
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,180
Look

327
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,980
We did not catch them where their

328
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,740
- I have the tools ne Dumbleore.
- I have something like 6 then

329
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,070
Specifically it was gone!

330
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,740
How could he want them to be around forever in it right?

331
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,500
This is Scabbers, you have permission or do with it

332
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,870
Little bit.

333
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,420
First you can prop it charm and turn into yellow hair. Not want to see?

334
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,670
 

335
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,050
Has anyone seen a toad ko?

336
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,100
-There is a boy named Neville has lost it
-No

337
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,020
`Ah you're doing magic Let's see how

338
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,400
<i>As sunshine and daisies, butter yellow bile and melon</i>

339
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,740
<i>Please turn yellow</i>

340
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:57,120
Are you sure that real magic is not there. Not very effective, right?

341
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,580
I became familiar with the simple stuff like that then

342
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,420
But it all works out

343
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,090
For light enough

344
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,260
Argounous Repairo ("Fix")

345
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,970
Does not get better right?

346
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,060
He is Harry Potter?

347
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,820
I was Hermione Granger. And you are?

348
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,780
- Ron Weaseley.
- Very pleased

349
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:35,070
You should also change clothes to uniforms. Maybe we'll get there soon

350
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,670
Well you can add a stain on the nose. You know, this place

351
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,830
Right there.

352
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,980
In one go this way.

353
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:06,360
How do the most embarrassing years. How Fast.

354
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,370
- Hey, baby, Harry.
- Hello Hagrid.

355
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,620
Whoa.

356
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,790
Take it any way. The children follow me.

357
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,030
Wow.

358
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,250
Data too!

359
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,700
Welcome to Hogwarts games

360
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,910
Just a little more time they will walk through this door join the party with classmates

361
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,170
Before sitting down to his seat, they must be classified in the House

362
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,460
Having the Griffindor, Hufflepuff, ...

363
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,180
Ravenclaw and Slytherin ...

364
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,640
When the children here, the house will look like child's family is so

365
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,770
Achieve good results, they are awarded points

366
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,110
Any violation of what the rules are penalized

367
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,610
At the end of the school, which earned the most points will win the Cup

368
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,150
Trevor

369
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,710
Sorry

370
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,840
Sorting ceremony will take place only for a moment longer

371
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,510
That's true. What I said was on board

372
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,590
Harry Potter went to Hogwarts

373
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,220
Harry Potter?

374
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,520
This is Crabbe and Goyle

375
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,020
And I was Malfoy

376
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,690
Draco Malfoy

377
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,230
Interesting name you think I do? Do not forget to ask you

378
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,240
Red hair that may coat your hands? You must be under the Weasley

379
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,200
He will earn the family witch blocks rather than bags.

380
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,210
He did not want to be friends with those who like but

381
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,540
I can help

382
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,630
I think I may find yourself kind of person who does bad

383
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,470
We are ready and now all I think

384
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,580
The ceiling is actually a witch by the prop to make it look like the sky outside

385
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,790
I've read about the history of Hogwarts

386
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,890
They wait in rows along the slide

387
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,100
Before we begin

388
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,570
Professor Dumbledor want to say a few words

389
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,570
I have a few notes to inform

390
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,070
The first year as we know it ...

391
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:31,370
... Students were banned entirely in the Black Forest

392
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:37,130
and he also supervised his Flich reminds me to remind the game

393
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,960
Third floor corridor on the right

394
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,470
is limited to those who do not wish pain or death

395
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,810
Thank you !

396
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,650
When we call someone names, please step forward

397
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,480
I will put my hat on top of em Classification

398
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,900
and they will be assigned to the

399
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,740
Hermione Granger

400
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:10,620
Oh, oh leisure travel.

401
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,370
What is the shortest I told him there

402
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,670
Now only time is now

403
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,510
Griffindor

404
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,110
Draco Malfoy

405
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,860
Slytherin!

406
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,700
It is not the team that asked its hat into Slytherin and

407
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,490
Susan Bones.

408
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,880
Ah!

409
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,170
Harry what?

410
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,130
Ko stars, their fine

411
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,800
Let's see ...

412
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:12,390
Hufflepuff

413
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,560
Ronald Weasley

414
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:35,410
Another Weasley boys home. I know what to do with him

415
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,410
Griffindor

416
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:47,090
Harry Potter

417
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,190
Very difficult

418
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,370
Courage is redundant

419
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,870
not a trivial mind if do not want to talk about talent

420
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,910
and desire to assert itself

421
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,290
but put him where to now

422
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,380
Slytherin's not sure he has not?

423
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,260
Slytherin's not sure he has not?

424
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:33,300
You'll really want to know. It's all in his head

425
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,890
And Slytherin will make him great

426
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,810
U did not hesitate

427
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,820
If the better ...

428
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,980
... Gryffindor!

429
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,300
Note that

430
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,060
We started the party but only pediatric

431
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,190
Wow.

432
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,540
Ã themselves as witches.

433
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,000
Father is a Muggle. She is the shaman

434
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,710
Bit of a nasty shock for him When he found out.

435
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,510
He asked me, I sat next to his teacher Professor Quirrel is Ireland?

436
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,970
It was Professor Snape Slytherin Chairman

437
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,090
He taught what a?

438
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,890
Potions, like four things that he knew it was his passion

439
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,730
Hi, how I

440
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,360
Hello children to Griffindor

441
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,920
It's the Bloody Baron!

442
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,380
A summer of fun but

443
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:39,010
Once again our request to join Ma-takes-first Assembly rejected

444
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,930
You know, he is the first Nick must be narrowly-lost-a ko?

445
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,940
I would rather call me than if I was not afraid Nicholas

446
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,650
Almost-lost-investing, how he almost lost the first?

447
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,940
This like this

448
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,790
Griffindors Followers

449
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,290
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

450
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,920
This is the path leads directly to living room

451
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,300
Keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change.

452
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,230
Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on.

453
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,110
The picture is moving

454
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,820
RON: Look at ÄÃ³ one. HARRY: I think she fancies you.

455
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,910
GIRL 1: Look! GIRL 2: Who's that girl?

456
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,660
Welcome to Hogwarts

457
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,420
Someone?

458
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,270
Password

459
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,520
Marsh mallow

460
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,810
Wow.

461
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,160
They follow me. Follow up quickly

462
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,290
We gather here

463
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,290
Welcome you to the living room of Griffindor

464
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,880
Men upstairs room on the left and women on the other side

465
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,260
They will find their belongings on it

466
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,080
How Fast!

467
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,710
You can imagine her face when McGonagall into class late ko?

468
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,920
- It's terrible.
- Thanks for that assessment of the role, Weasley.

469
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,430
Perhaps it would be better if we turn into a Potter game and watches affordable?

470
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,850
- And then maybe the game will arrive on time more.
- We would get lost.

471
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,810
So be sure to bring a map. I believe the role of households do not need anyone to find your place again.

472
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:29,660
There are no foolish wand waving a magic or stupid in class.

473
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:33,500
Of course, we do not expect the game

474
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,460
understand and appreciate the science and art as well as the preparation of this poison bottle.

475
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:40,750
On the few who choose

476
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:45,010
Ownership of the special formula.

477
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,970
We can teach the game to spell on the mind

478
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,100
and feeling trapped.

479
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,850
You can tell the game to hear how the reputation, or gain glory

480
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,980
and even death to those who give our block.

481
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:12,910
And again some people just to Hogwarts

482
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:19,040
live in their belief that qualified and confident to be able to ...

483
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,210
... Not focus!

484
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,800
Potter games.

485
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,850
Another popular new character.

486
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:43,820
Tells us that if we will be crushed into powder Arsedel roots?

487
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,490
Games not know Ã ? Let's try again.

488
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,330
Games will find games where if we ask for a piece of diamond?

489
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,000
I do not know sir.

490
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,080
The difference between the poppy and oak beams?

491
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,920
I do not know a.

492
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,260
Unfortunately.

493
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:14,220
Clearly, fame is not all ...

494
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:15,930
Potter ko ... right?

495
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,930
Sure, Hermione said.

496
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,850
It seems a shame to not ask her.

497
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,770
Silence.

498
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,750
Put your hands down, the little silly,

499
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,290
Information for the game, Potter ...

500
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,380
... And spread wormwood Nhat Quang create powerful sleeping drug ...

501
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,840
... Be known as: The pain of death is life.

502
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:53,050
There is a gravel crushing bezoar from the stomach goat ...

503
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
... Can explain most of the toxins.

504
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,350
Hats priests and a wolf ...

505
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,600
... Also known as aconite.

506
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,690
That's it ...

507
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:09,940
... They are now waiting for what is not recorded on the file go?

508
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,830
The Gryffindors ...

509
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,500
... Will be deducted five points ...

510
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:30,300
... Because of the sassy.

511
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,030
<i>Rabbit eyes, stuck tight. Turn water into rum.</i>

512
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,740
Rabbit eye ...

513
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,740
Gregory is doing with a glass of that?

514
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,750
<i>Turned into rum.</i> Actually, he had to do it yesterday before ...

515
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,380
This letter.

516
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,620
I want now? Thanks.

517
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,750
Look, Neville get the ball a small packages.

518
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,470
I've heard of it. When the smoke turns red, that is something you forget.

519
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,140
Only problem is, I can not remember what I forgot.

520
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,890
Someone broke ne Gringotts bank. Listen.

521
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,770
Suspect this is caused by a sorcerer or magician Dark made anonymous,

522
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,740
The goblins at Gringotts while admitting responsibility rules, also emphasized that not all things will be lost.

523
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:21,660
Basement of 713 was actually almost empty before.

524
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,120
That is where my basement and Hagrid arrived.

525
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:38,800
- Welcome the class.
- Hi Ms. Hook.

526
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,800
Hi Amanda.

527
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,560
Welcome them to fly first class.

528
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,690
Also waiting for? People step on the right hand side of the broom handle any

529
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:55,480
Any hurry. Right hand raised them above the broom. And said: "What Up."

530
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,650
"Up"!

531
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,200
Soaring
- Up.

532
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,490
Up. Up!

533
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
Feel.

534
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:08,960
Up!

535
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,870
- Up. Up.
- Up. Up.

536
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,460
Up! Oh!

537
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,510
Harry stopped going.

538
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,390
Now, when they had learned the broom and she wants you to ride on it

539
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,600
Hold tight to it. You will not want to slip off the first broomstick.

540
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,900
When she whistled, she wanted each of you foot down on the ground

541
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,980
Hold brooms in the air, hovering a few laps,

542
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,490
then practice flying in a straight line gently, and then landed.

543
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,870
According to the flute of light, 3, 2, 1.

544
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,660
I Longbottom.

545
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,170
Longbottom!

546
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,630
Studies with!

547
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,010
Ground quickly!

548
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,440
Games Longbottom!

549
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,870
Whoa!

550
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:32,790
Ow!

551
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,380
People get out of that!

552
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,090
Play it right?

553
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:49,140
Well, the broken wrist and then. What's go.

554
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:55,100
They stand at the push while I put games Longbottom went to the hospital wing.

555
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,980
Me yet? If she saw a broom on no ...

556
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:04,450
c, the person must, but leave Hogwarts before being expelled.

557
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,570
This guy is the face of it.

558
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,620
Maybe it will have caps out there. Who will not remember this stuff for hours baby.

559
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,330
Return it right, Malfoy.

560
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,830
No way. I think I'll hide it somewhere for Longbottom to find.

561
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,510
On the roof, why baby?

562
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,510
How so, Potter? Beyond the right?

563
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,850
Harry, do not wait. He heard her say it that hooch.

564
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,980
Besides, he was not even flying.

565
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,190
What an idiot.

566
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:48,030
Put it here if not I will kick you off flying broom there.

567
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,370
Really?

568
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,830
So then how do you?

569
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:32,200
Beautiful, Harry. Look, Harry!

570
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,410
Harry Potter!

571
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,410
Follow me.

572
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,340
The waiting game then.

573
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:58,390
Professor Quirrell, Sorry. Wood can I borrow at one time is not?

574
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,440
Oh, of course.

575
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:11,870
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, she has found for you a range manually.

576
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,450
She has heard of Harry Potter is the new range of Griffindor not?

577
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,920
I always knew that boy made good.

578
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:24,420
Why the U? But in the first year is often not selected for team players.

579
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:29,470
- He surely is the youngest Quidditch player in 100 years.
- According to her McGonagall.

580
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,970
Doing well, Harry. Locking Wood just told him.

581
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,640
Fred and George are also in the team. The recovery there.

582
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:38,600
The mission of four he was not sure I dropped off the broom.

583
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,480
Arduous sport, Quidditch.

584
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:45,650
Violence. But no one died over the years. A few people have an accident.

585
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,610
But they still come back after one or two months.

586
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:54,490
Come on, Harry. Quidditch is a great thing. He will be great.

587
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,910
What I have never played Quidditch all. What happens if I'm an idiot?

588
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:03,120
No, you will not mistake any where because it was ingrained in his blood then.

589
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,010
Whoa.

590
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,510
Harry, he never told his father he is also a range of game players?.

591
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,520
I do not know that.

592
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:27,650
I'm talking to him there, it's spooky. He knew more than what you know.

593
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,150
Why not?

594
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,200
What's happening?

595
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:37,620
The stairs are moving. Remember?

596
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,540
- Let's go this way.
- Before moving the ladder again.

597
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,560
Does anyone think that we should not here?

598
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:00,970
We do not intend to here that.

599
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:05,060
This is the third floor there. It is not allowed.

600
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,860
Come on.

601
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,940
- That he Filch's cat.
- Run.

602
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,080
Quick fast. Hide behind that door.

603
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:27,250
- It's locked then!
- Like that.

604
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,590
Stay away!

605
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,710
Alohomora.

606
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:35,510
Go inside.

607
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,840
Alohomora?

608
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,600
Basic Books Mantra, Chapter 7.

609
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,180
There is not anyone here?

610
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,440
Come on.

611
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,860
- Filch he left.
- So I think the door is locked.

612
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,620
- It was locked.
- For a good reason.

613
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,810
What schools are you doing? Keep things like that one in a store like that

614
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,650
Ã Do not pay attention? You do not see what it was standing above him?

615
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,070
I do not look at his feet. Then you're looking at first.

616
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,160
Can you not clear, it has three consecutive head!

617
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,040
It was standing on a trapdoor, that is not coincidence that it is there

618
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,790
- It's guarding something.
- Guard?

619
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:52,960
That's right. Now if you are no longer two anymore, I go to sleep.

620
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:56,800
Before the two he went to a wise idea that we almost lost their lives.

621
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,140
Or worse, stripped of magic.

622
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:07,640
He needs to reassess itself there.

623
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:16,480
Quidditch, easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players.

624
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:22,370
Visit the 3, 2 Tan players, a goalkeeper, and a systole. Chinh em there.

625
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,620
There are three different types of balls. This is called Quaffle.

626
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:37,800
The bird left the Quaffer Access and trying to throw it through three other golf circles.

627
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:42,390
Keeper, is he here, defending the stakes golf. No questions too?

628
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,060
I think so. What are a few other things?

629
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:51,520
You should try this.

630
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:04,370
Be careful, it is coming back.

631
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,580
Not bad, Potter. You may be the best attack there.

632
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,840
Uh-oh.

633
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:33,520
A. What is that?

634
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:38,020
Blugger ball.

635
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:41,740
But she is withholding.

636
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,910
The only thing that I want you to worry about is this.

637
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,660
Golden Snitch ball.

638
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:55,880
- I like it.
- Knowing that you like

639
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:00,090
But wait. It flew so fast and hard to see.

640
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,260
What are you doing with him?

641
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,720
I caught it before the Games the other teams do.

642
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:08,430
Did you get it, the game will end.

643
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,600
Did you get it, Potter, and we won.

644
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,480
Whoa.

645
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:26,990
The primary skills, magic spells of witches.

646
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,160
That spells Bay. They make objects fly.

647
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:33,790
They have feathers yet? That's good.

648
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,170
Do not forget the gentle smooth motion when we practice.

649
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,710
Just wave the wand and tap it. What the children.

650
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:48,850
Waving and tapping. Good.

651
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,850
- While waving your chopsticks they shouted: "Le-vio-sa wingardium"
- They do go.

652
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:03,690
Wingardium Leviosa.

653
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:08,110
Stop, stop. You're making people pay attention there.

654
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:14,330
Furthermore did you even read the wrong mantra. Pronounced "Le-vio-sa," not by "Le-vio-sar"

655
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:19,130
If you understand how then do it. See how.

656
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,460
Wingardium Leviosa.

657
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:36,560
Doing good. Do not you see? She is done already!

658
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:38,480
Excellent!

659
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,230
Very good.

660
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:50,570
I think we need a different feather sparse professor.

661
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,330
Must be "Le-vio-sa," not by "Le-vio-sar"!

662
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:06,920
She was a nightmare, really there. No wonder how it did not have friends.

663
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,090
I think he heard it there.

664
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:40,870
Hermione then what?

665
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,210
I hear a girl saying he was not out of the female toilets.

666
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,460
It says he's in there throughout the afternoon, and cried.

667
01:11:52,930 --> 01:12:00,140
Monster rose from the cellar!

668
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,310
Everyone should know.

669
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,990
Any order!

670
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:20,660
The game is not lost.

671
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,920
Now ...

672
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:27,670
... The chief Huynh will lead them to living room

673
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,180
Teachers follow me to the basement.

674
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,400
Griffindors, held every entrance and alarm for each

675
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,360
How the hell is that place?

676
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:54,700
Monsters are often stupid. Sometimes these people are joking we should.

677
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:58,950
- What?
- Hermione, he knows not!

678
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:14,300
I think that monster out of the tunnel.

679
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,350
And going to female restrooms.

680
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,760
Hermione, run away!

681
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:01,260
Help!

682
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,350
Hey!

683
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,620
Studies with!

684
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:23,870
Whoa!

685
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,550
Ugh.

686
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,140
What to do instead!

687
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,560
- What?
- Whatever!

688
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,610
- Quick!
- Loans and tap!

689
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,150
<i> Wingardium Le-vio-sa</i>

690
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,080
Or much.

691
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,320
It's not dead baby?

692
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,440
I do not think so, sure it only fainted.

693
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,040
Dirty monster.

694
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,080
God. Explain to us to see. Both of em!

695
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:57,880
It is the fault of the children sparse Professor McGonagall.

696
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,300
Ms. Granger U?

697
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,220
I went looking for giant monsters, you already know about it. I thought I could catch it.

698
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,350
But I was wrong.

699
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,230
If Harry and Ron do not come and find me ...

700
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,610
... I would have died.

701
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:20,150
This was an extremely foolish act

702
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,990
She had hoped that a rational action of the children. I make her disappointed, Granger.

703
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,250
5 points will be deducted from the Griffindor ...

704
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:33,000
... By the lack of consideration of children.

705
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,500
Both of you, too ...

706
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,130
... She hopes they clearly see how lucky you

707
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,760
Not many first-year students could take down a monster so mature

708
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,550
and holding it until the last minute.

709
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,260
5 points ...

710
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,770
will be awarded for each child.

711
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:57,400
So good luck that weird.

712
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:06,780
They should go away. It can wake up there.

713
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,840
Fortunately, because we both have from the former Ministry of trouble.

714
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,340
I saved it that.

715
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:25,180
Small will not be saved if we are not locked up.

716
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,890
Friends to do what?

717
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,520
Making only a few bread crumbs.

718
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:36,940
You need to have good health today

719
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:39,360
I do not hunger that

720
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:45,570
Good luck Potter, Quidditch Morning

721
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,950
A game to prove himself, but is not the easy job

722
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,290
Especially against Slytherin

723
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,380
Tumor samples?

724
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,930
Listen, last night I guess Snape used the attack tactic

725
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:10,810
in fact for him to come to the dogs

726
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,770
but it was biting him again. That's why his legs go limp so

727
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,230
Why would anyone want to come near the dog that?

728
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,150
The day that you and Hagrid went to get it out of the basement material

729
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,610
Uncle said that it is duty of Hogwarts. Inscrutability

730
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,940
So you're going to say ...

731
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:29,660
That is what the dog is guarding the game. It's something Snape wants

732
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,760
- Do you own brushes Ã 
- I never had a whole

733
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,840
They open it yourself

734
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,270
A broom

735
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:05,190
Not where ordinary brushes. It is a Nimbus 2000 broom effect propulsion

736
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,700
But who-?

737
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,850
- Fear not Harry?
- A little

738
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,720
He also has such a feeling before the first match

739
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,390
- What happened to a?
- I do not remember anymore

740
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:43,400
He wrapped a bandage on his forehead

741
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,400
and woke up in hospital a week later

742
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,010
Welcome to the first match of the season at Hogwarts

743
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:16,600
Slytherin match today against Griffindor

744
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:23,600
Gryffindor!

745
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,670
The players take their position ...

746
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,680
... To be able to start the game

747
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:57,220
and I want a nice game

748
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,270
from all children

749
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,320
The Bludger flew up, then the ball Snitch.

750
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,240
Remember the ball will bring 150 points Snitch

751
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,240
Why do players catch the Snitch ends the game

752
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,500
And the game starts

753
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:48,980
10 points for Griffindor

754
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,490
Very good

755
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,450
Good!

756
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:05,540
Slytherin back position

757
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:40,370
10 more points for the Griffindor

758
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:56,050
Give it to me!

759
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,120
You to side!

760
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,090
Whoa. Whoa!

761
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,840
What happened to Harry's broom that?

762
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,980
It was Snape. Lao had charms broom prop

763
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:38,530
- Peer charms U? We do?
- For it yourself

764
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,880
How quickly, Hermione!

765
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,730
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

766
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:29,870
Austria behold he fires

767
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,890
Go, go, go, go!

768
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,230
Looks like it was how he

769
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,780
He caught the Snitch

770
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:51,070
Harry Potter gained 150 points for home team

771
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,950
Griffindor win

772
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:59,080
Oh, no.

773
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,130
Yes!

774
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:40,790
How badly? Why the concept curse Snape to Harry's broom instead?

775
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,880
They know me. So why did he try to pass the three-headed dog in a Halloween night?

776
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,550
Who told the children about Fluffy?

777
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,390
- Thursday, including a name?
- Of course it has a name and it's Uncle

778
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:56,180
Uncle brought it on last year. After that doctor would allow it to Dumbledore to guard ...

779
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:57,390
Yes?

780
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,730
Do not ask any more questions anymore. That's a secret

781
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:06,320
But I have Fluffy matter what Snape is also trying to steal it

782
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:09,990
Professor Snape is a school teacher Howarts

783
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:15,580
The teacher or not. I have seen his magic and

784
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,370
He kept looking at him and focused on not blinking at all

785
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,830
Exactly

786
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,250
All three of us listen

787
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:30,130
The children are desperate to intervene in what the children are also not known. It is very dangerous

788
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:35,430
The dog guarding the only things that Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel knew

789
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,060
Nicholas Flamel?

790
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:42,770
I should not mention her last name to

791
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:47,070
Who is Nicholas Flamel that?

792
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,280
I do not know.

793
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:10,960
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

794
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,970
Ring the Hogwart bell âª â«

795
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,970
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas

796
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,140
Cast a spell Christmas âª â«

797
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:37,070
E knights box 5

798
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,920
The queen cell E 5

799
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:53,970
It was brutal

800
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:58,140
This is the witch that flag. I have seen him arrange luggage

801
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,800
I see you are not

802
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:05,310
Change of plans that he, his parents decided to go to Romania

803
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,360
to visit his brother, Charlie. He is researching the dragon there

804
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,940
We will find in the library of information on Nicholas Flamel

805
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:16,660
We have searched 100 times

806
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:22,540
Restrict area where it is not. Happy Christmas

807
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:27,670
I think we can influence him there

808
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:34,550
Harry rose and

809
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:47,730
- Merry Christmas Harry.
- Ron Christmas fun

810
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,150
What are you wearing?

811
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:54,400
His mother may it there. Looks like he has one

812
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:57,990
I have a gift Ã 

813
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:07,500
it is here

814
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:22,010
<i>My father asked me to keep taking this before he died</i>

815
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,390
<i>It is time we give it to you Use it for good</i>

816
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:46,910
- What?
- Velvet mantle that

817
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,120
He even go into any

818
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,340
Whoa!

819
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:56,840
People disappeared and

820
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,630
I know this stuff. It's an invisibility cloak

821
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,090
His invisible

822
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,970
Why give this person again for his children?

823
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:13,230
There is no sender's name. It says only use for good

824
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:47,180
Where Mr. Nicholas Flamel?

825
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:53,190
Someone?

826
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,960
Who?

827
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:25,720
Lo away

828
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:36,860
Quiet.

829
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:25,400
I ...

830
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:29,950
He does not want me to be his enemy but, Quirrell.

831
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:34,870
- What is your Italian?
- You know what I mean ten thirty that.

832
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,310
We will talk together soon.

833
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,980
For a time he should consider his loyalty anywhere.

834
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:05,650
Professor. I found this in the restricted areas.

835
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:11,240
It is still hot. That means students have still to bed.

836
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,170
Mommy?

837
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,420
Daddy?

838
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:30,130
Ron, you really have to see this stuff! Go see it!

839
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:34,800
Ron, go do. Out of bed!

840
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:38,640
- Why?
- There are some things you need to see, go!

841
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:49,650
At this point, see my parents go!

842
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:53,070
I only see them yourself that.

843
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:56,660
Looking directly at. Standing here goes.

844
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:02,790
- That he saw them, right?
-It was his!

845
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:05,620
Huynh his head is! I'm holding the Quidditch Cup!

846
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:10,000
And can not imagine! I was Quidditch captain, too!

847
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:13,630
I looked great.

848
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:18,090
Harry, do you think the mirror will tell the future we do not?

849
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:23,270
No way? Lost both his parents then.

850
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,410
- He loves his gifts than Ron?
- Portuguese Christmas will be here the whole game?

851
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,990
Indeed it is.

852
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:46,790
Ron? Ron?
- I'll be right back.

853
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,390
Play chess instead?

854
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:03,100
- No.
- Visiting Hagrid not?

855
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,770
No.

856
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:08,810
Harry, I know you are thinking, but do not ...

857
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:12,400
There is something wrong with the mirror.

858
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,510
Return eh, Harry?

859
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,100
We see the same with many previous

860
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:52,480
also discovered the joy that brings Mirage mirror

861
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:56,980
He believes that children will recognize the things that it brings.

862
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,820
To see an example for children.

863
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,490
The happiest man on Earth if you look in the mirror

864
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:07,080
will see only his own image,

865
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,620
exactly what he

866
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:14,880
Therefore, the mirror shows us what we desire Anything we do not want to correct a

867
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:17,840
Yes. And wrong.

868
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:21,340
It does not add or take from us anything

869
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:27,520
except where the deepest and desire, the desire of my heart tremendously.

870
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:32,440
Now children, Harry, had never known his family.

871
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:36,520
So I see them standing beside me.

872
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,150
But remember, Harry,

873
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:45,280
The mirror is not put back a little knowledge

874
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,620
Where does the truth or

875
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:54,630
People will be wasted if one stands before it. This may even be that insane.

876
01:40:55,670 --> 01:40:59,800
That's why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home

877
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:01,920
And he reminded the

878
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:06,800
Do not go looking for it again.

879
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:10,640
It's not good if you leave it tame dreams,

880
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,100
Harry, forget it and live it.

881
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,700
Hi, Hedwig.

882
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:17,330
Watch the pile of cards to play with the other. Vapor.

883
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,170
Coming final test there and then.

884
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:22,800
I ready. Ask away.

885
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:26,840
The three most important components of drug What is Neglect?

886
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:28,890
Forgot it.

887
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:31,970
So he would do if it is in the upcoming test?

888
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,230
- Watch the tigers away?
- No.

889
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:36,520
Besides, said Professor McGonagall ...

890
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:40,400
... They found their special kind of porcupine quill to fraud.

891
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:43,940
It's insulting! They do not believe us!

892
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:46,400
Both Dumbledore again.

893
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:54,620
- Curse tied rolls.
- Malfoy.

894
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,920
Bo said to resist it but, Neville!

895
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:06,800
How? I do not want more problems.

896
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:08,970
I will practice allows the curse.

897
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:10,340
No, what I need is ...

898
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,600
lakeshore his knees into the fire.

899
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:17,060
I do not appreciate what implies, Longbottom.

900
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:20,400
Besides, if anyone is interested ...

901
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,440
then his eyebrows grow back completely.

902
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,780
Found it.

903
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,320
"Dumbledore is really popular ...

904
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:35,790
... For having defeated the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 ...

905
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:38,080
- Come on.
- ... by the discovery of 12 uses of dragon's blood and ...

906
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:42,630
... thanks to the work of composing tools of alchemy with Nicolas Flamel is the collaboration?

907
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:46,130
I know a name like that. I have read while on the train.

908
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,010
According to her.

909
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:56,140
Wait, how much you go?

910
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,940
What about the curse allowed?

911
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:08,400
I asked the boy looking in the wrong place then. Could I so stupid baby!

912
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,780
I was tracking back the atmosphere much thinner than last week.

913
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,990
It looks thin children?

914
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:21,000
Of course! Here it is.

915
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:25,170
Nicholas Flamel is known to be the only one who did the Sorcerer's Stone

916
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:26,670
What?

917
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,300
Really, why not read his two go?

918
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:35,010
Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with amazing strength.

919
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:37,850
It turns any metal into pure gold,

920
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:42,020
... Help people to increase life. And that he becomes immortal.

921
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:44,400
- No U? That means he will never die

922
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:46,730
I know!

923
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:52,360
The unique stone exists currently is owned by Nicholas Flamel particular,

924
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:57,700
who last year was celebrated birthday of his 655.

925
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:01,250
That is what the guard on the third floor Fluffy

926
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:04,420
That is what lies under the door down. Sorcerer's Stone.

927
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:27,020
Sorry, do not want rude, but Uncle did not have time where the children entertained.

928
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:29,940
They grandchildren about the Sorcerer's Stone.

929
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:32,570
Oh.

930
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:39,790
- We I think Snape is trying to steal it.
- The child is still how u hate him?

931
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:42,790
Hagrid, Snape I know they stand behind the story of rock, but do not know what that reason only.

932
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:47,330
Snape is one of the teachers are protected rock. He can not steal it.

933
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:48,630
What's wrong?

934
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:52,260
The children hear and there. Come on, we are not free today.

935
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:55,130
Wait. One of a teacher?

936
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:59,220
Of course! So is there other things not to protect a rock?

937
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:02,060
Magic spells.

938
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:05,350
That's right. Ask us, only time-consuming.

939
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,650
No one to step through all the Fluffy.

940
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:11,480
No one knows how. Except for artillery and Dumbledore.

941
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:15,320
Uncle said it but should not children.

942
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:34,300
- Hagrid, so that's exactly what a?
- It's ... It is a ...

943
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:36,510
I know.

944
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:39,390
But Hagrid, how it silver?

945
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,020
Ta winning it from a stranger met in a bar.

946
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:47,310
He seemed glad to be liberated it is only common sense.

947
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,710
It is ...

948
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:13,710
A ... a dragon?

949
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,340
Not only time where dragons. It is bat witch Novigem.

950
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:21,430
His brother Charlie are working on it in Romania.

951
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:26,520
It looks really nice. Alas. Look, it realized there mother.

952
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,940
Hello, Norbert. Norbert?

953
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:33,570
It also needs a name, right?

954
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,740
Not true, Norbert?

955
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:46,870
It should also be trained a little, of course.

956
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,840
Who is it?

957
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:56,590
Malfoy.

958
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,760
Heaven and earth.

959
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:05,260
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Uncle was always going to say that when you see your first time.

960
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,560
It's crazy. Worse than that, Malfoy had said.

961
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:13,860
- I do not understand, that's not good game?
- Bad bad there.

962
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,280
Good evening.

963
01:48:19,950 --> 01:48:22,870
I repeat, students do not have permission

964
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:26,620
roam the school at night.

965
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:31,710
So the penalty for acts of the game, 50 points will be deducted.

966
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:34,250
50 U? Everyone.

967
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,630
And to make sure it's not happening again ...

968
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,220
... All four games will be subject to Gansu.

969
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:45,100
Sorry professor. Are not you heard wrong.

970
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:47,640
I heard her say "four" we.

971
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:50,310
No, the game was there to hear exactly Malfoy.

972
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,560
It deserves the intention of the game. Games have done something outside the bedroom for hours ha.

973
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:58,980
Games will be subject to Gansu with you.

974
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:14,170
Not a bad penalty.

975
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:19,130
Gansu will take better around the basement there.

976
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,170
Lord, we do not hear the screams of the game.

977
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,010
The game will be banned tonight sufficient to Hagrid

978
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:33,560
He has a little work to do in the Forbidden Forest.

979
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:38,610
Unfortunately, when the North to take it, Hagrid.

980
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:45,070
Good place, he will no longer be with the dragon damned right?

981
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,370
Nobert gone. .

982
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:53,500
Dumbledore gave it to Romania. Let it live up to the pack.

983
01:49:53,790 --> 01:49:57,040
Good right? It will stay with the same type.

984
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:59,550
If it's not like Romania, why?

985
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:04,010
What happens if the other dragons field it desertion? Ultimately it's still just a baby.

986
01:50:04,630 --> 01:50:09,890
For the sake of God, come together to remember all that boys and girls.

987
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,470
The structure will go into the woods. and think about their work.

988
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:18,360
U forests? I think it is only a joke instead. We can not go through that is.

989
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:22,400
Students are prohibited. And there are both ...

990
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,400
The Wolf!

991
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:29,160
Strange land over which there are many people around here Wolf.

992
01:50:29,370 --> 01:50:32,040
The game can know for sure.

993
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,410
Black night. Yes.

994
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,840
We go.

995
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,460
Hagrid, what that?

996
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:25,050
We are here because this here. Not found?

997
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:30,930
This is the blood of the Centaurs. I found a few weeks before death.

998
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:36,060
And it was important that someone is causing injury.

999
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:49,320
So the task is to find the monster was pitiful.

1000
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:52,660
- Ron, Hermione, along with your.
- Yes.

1001
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:56,410
Harry, I go with Malfoy.

1002
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,960
Okay, so I will get the Fang.

1003
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:05,840
Good, but you need to know it is pretty shy animals there.

1004
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:14,510
Fishing with you dad I'll know. It is true that the work of slaves!

1005
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:18,680
If I know this will be bad, Draco, I think you're afraid then lower.

1006
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,190
Fear of U, Potter?

1007
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:24,520
You do not hear?

1008
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:28,530
Come on, Fang.

1009
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,240
Scared!

1010
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,390
What is it, Fang?

1011
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:13,260
Harry Potter, I should leave. Many organisms are known her here.

1012
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:17,470
This forest is not safe now. Especially with children.

1013
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:20,430
But he has nothing to save her from that?

1014
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:25,980
A strange evil creatures. Killing a Sagittarius is a disgusting crime.

1015
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:31,730
Drink the blood of a Sagittarius will help us maintain a temporary life. Even when he was dying.

1016
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:36,990
But the price paid in disgust. If I kill something so pure pure

1017
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:42,080
every moment I touch the blood that she is living through.

1018
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,080
A cursed life.

1019
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:48,250
- Who to choose such a life?
- I do not think anyone u?

1020
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:53,420
Do you mean, guys that killed the Centaurs, drinking its blood,

1021
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:57,680
U is Voldemort?

1022
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:03,010
I know what he was looking every day of ko Potter?

1023
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:05,430
Sorcerer's Stone.

1024
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:08,770
Harry!

1025
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:13,860
Hello, Firenze. I saw him live with you boy Potter.

1026
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:16,190
But I'm okay, Harry?

1027
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:21,660
Harry Potter, it is time to go.

1028
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:26,370
Now she was safe. Good luck.

1029
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:38,130
Ke-you mean that well-know-who-who-is-out-there are other woods, right?

1030
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:41,140
But his weakness, he lives by the Centaurs.

1031
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:44,220
You guys do not you see? We were wrong.

1032
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:48,850
Snape did not want to take the rock to him. Which is to Voldemort.

1033
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:53,570
There is more life, Voldemort will be stronger again.

1034
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,400
He will reappear.

1035
01:55:55,570 --> 01:55:57,360
If his back ...

1036
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:01,570
... You do not think to kill him but does he?

1037
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:06,080
I think if he had the chance, he could kill me right tonight.

1038
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:09,920
And then worry about his Potions exam last year.

1039
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,710
Wait. We own forgotten something.

1040
01:56:14,090 --> 01:56:18,970
Who was the only wizard Voldemort always binary?

1041
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:24,850
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around here, Harry, he was safe.

1042
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:29,100
Dumbledore as long as he will not be touched him.

1043
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:40,280
I always do the test so bad last year. But I found very interesting.

1044
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:44,120
Go ahead and rhetoric. Why so, Harry?

1045
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:49,540
- Scar. It aches.
- It was not true then.

1046
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:52,420
- Not like this.
- Maybe you should see a doctor.

1047
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:56,130
I think it is alarming. means that the danger is imminent.

1048
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,220
- Of course.
- What?

1049
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:10,140
You do not feel a bit weird u? Hagrid best thing to a dragon.

1050
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:13,480
And when strangers are present, he has an Uncle?

1051
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:16,310
I mean, how many people are wandering with a dragon egg in their pocket?

1052
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,820
Why did not realize before the baby?

1053
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:27,910
Hagrid, who gave the middle dragon? How he looked a?

1054
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,830
Uncle do not know, Uncle guys ever face. He was holding the hood.

1055
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,670
Even stranger, the Uncle has talked to him but

1056
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:37,790
He wanted to know about the creatures that Uncle nursing

1057
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,010
Uncle told him that Uncle Fluffy is child care. A dragon egg is also not a problem.

1058
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:46,680
He is excited when talking about Uncle Fluffy ko? Of course he loves Fluffy.

1059
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:51,270
I have a dog step by step through the first three before? Even if this is an exchange

1060
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:57,110
But Uncle said to him, stories about monsters, the underground exchange every time.

1061
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:02,780
Get Fluffy the example slightly. Just walk up music, it will fall asleep immediately.

1062
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:07,120
We ought not to say that.

1063
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:09,580
The children going?

1064
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,340
We need to see Dumbledore. Immediately Asia.

1065
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,380
Ta e Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1066
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:26,890
Specifically he received emergency service from the Ministry of magic and then immediately to London.

1067
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:32,430
Specifically it go already? But the important thing. It is the Sorcerer's Stone.

1068
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:37,980
- How will the game know ...
- There are people trying to steal it.

1069
01:58:38,610 --> 01:58:43,820
I do not know how these kids know about rock, but we make sure the game is perfectly protected.

1070
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:48,320
Now the game should go on living room a quiet way

1071
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,420
It would not be a stranger at all.

1072
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:02,250
This is Snape, which means he knows how to beat Fluffy.

1073
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:06,380
- As soon as Dumbledore is gone.
- Hi.

1074
01:59:08,430 --> 01:59:11,510
3 children home Griffindors

1075
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,060
are now huddled do here?

1076
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:24,360
We just ...

1077
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,860
Be careful. People will think the game ...

1078
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:33,870
... Are attempting something.

1079
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:46,170
Now I do?

1080
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:50,140
We will come to shutter it. Tonight.

1081
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,320
Trevor.

1082
02:00:05,690 --> 02:00:09,110
Trevor, go away. You should not here.

1083
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:14,780
You guys should look like. The back of his hiding out right?

1084
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:18,960
- Do not know.
- No, its not allowed!

1085
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:23,790
You guys will again make the Griffindor trouble. I will ... fight with him.

1086
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,300
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.

1087
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:40,020
He sometimes terrible baby. You know that.

1088
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:43,940
Great, but it was terrible.

1089
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:46,650
We go.

1090
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:51,110
Sorry. So it is good for you.

1091
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:00,500
I stomped my feet. Sorry.

1092
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,380
Alohomora.

1093
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:21,020
Wait.

1094
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:24,400
It is right here.

1095
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:32,400
Snape was here before. He was cast onto the other harp.

1096
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:37,030
Visit its breath.

1097
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:41,700
- We must pull his feet away.
- What?

1098
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:43,330
Come on!

1099
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,420
Then, pulling away.

1100
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:16,240
I will be down before. Do not jump in until his fame lightly.

1101
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:21,450
If something bad happens, you take yourself out of here.

1102
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:25,710
Sao seems to quiet the baby?

1103
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:28,250
Harp!

1104
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,630
It stopped playing then.

1105
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:37,430
Ugh. Yuck!

1106
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,810
Jump away!

1107
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:56,240
Whoa.

1108
02:02:56,990 --> 02:03:00,620
May be this is the trees.

1109
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:03,080
Whoa!

1110
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:18,130
Do not move. This is a trap, vines of Satan.

1111
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:22,010
You guys have to relax. If not it will kill you more quickly.

1112
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:27,270
U Kill us faster? Now you can give up!

1113
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,860
Hermione!

1114
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:35,190
We're going to do? Just ignore them it!

1115
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:39,950
- Hermione, Where is he?
- Follow what I say! Just trust yourself!

1116
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:45,950
Harry!

1117
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,380
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, their health.

1118
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:53,630
- He not sit still, right?
- It looks like that.

1119
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,380
- We must do something yourself.
- No. What?

1120
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:59,510
I remember reading about them in the book Herbalists.

1121
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:04,220
Satan vines, they cause death ...

1122
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:08,810
... But will disappear when the sun rises. Itself! Satan vines photophobia.

1123
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:11,060
Lumus Solem.

1124
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,740
- Not right?
- Yeah.

1125
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:26,950
May we not be confused.

1126
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:31,210
May is a hard subject Hermione Herbalists it.

1127
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:34,340
What is it? Do not know.

1128
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:38,210
Sounds like wings.

1129
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:54,860
Curious fact, I have never seen birds like this.

1130
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:58,690
We do not have to birds, which are key

1131
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:02,360
And I bet some of them open the other locks.

1132
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:10,460
- All this is what?
- I bear.

1133
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,380
Too.

1134
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,090
Alohomora!

1135
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:26,300
Well, worth trying to make.

1136
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:29,770
What do we do? There must thousands of keys here.

1137
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:33,900
We will find what looks to which was obsolete. Maybe it rusted so hold.

1138
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:37,520
There they are, I see it. Bay with yellow wings.

1139
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:43,450
Not wrong, Harry?

1140
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,820
It's simply too much.

1141
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:50,790
Go away, Harry. If Snape can catch the key on the broom, then he can.

1142
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,540
He is the youngest range in this century.

1143
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:14,350
It is only slightly more than a little trouble.

1144
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:37,580
Catch the key!

1145
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:43,880
Quick!

1146
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:21,090
I do not like this much. Absolutely not.

1147
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:24,420
Where are we? Ã graveyard?

1148
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:27,430
This is not the cemetery.

1149
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:37,890
Which is a chessboard.

1150
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:51,780
In the other door.

1151
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:05,300
Now what?

1152
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:09,800
Clearly then right? We'll play chess to pass this room.

1153
02:08:10,430 --> 02:08:14,180
Okay, Harry, he stood on the empty squares away.

1154
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:18,730
Hermione, you will be queen statue standing army.

1155
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:22,980
In his own troops would be knights.

1156
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,910
Now what happens?

1157
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:35,700
Well, go ahead and white army.

1158
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:37,790
Then ...

1159
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,790
Our turn.

1160
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:56,430
Ron, he is not for this ...

1161
02:08:56,680 --> 02:09:00,230
Wizard is a real game instead?

1162
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,520
Other troops, cell D5!

1163
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,750
're Right, Hermione.

1164
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:25,040
I think it is exactly a game going on really.

1165
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:33,470
Statue cell E4!

1166
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:39,390
To cell C3!

1167
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:28,020
Wait. You know why it there, Harry.

1168
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:32,940
I just moved, my queen will begin immediately.

1169
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:35,950
Then he will compare general comfort.

1170
02:10:36,110 --> 02:10:38,870
- No, Ron, no!
- What?

1171
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:44,120
- He shall sacrifice myself!
- No, he can not! There must be another way than!

1172
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:48,130
You guys want to stop Snape or not get it rock?

1173
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:51,920
Harry, the boy must be doing it!

1174
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:55,130
Not her, not Hermione. Which he is.

1175
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:08,350
Knights cell H3.

1176
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:31,290
Checkmate.

1177
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:02,200
Ron!

1178
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:08,210
No, do not move! Do not forget we are still playing there.

1179
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,560
Checkmate.

1180
02:12:44,530 --> 02:12:47,040
Caring for Ron lightly. Then please leave.

1181
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:51,080
Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron was right.

1182
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:53,210
I have to keep time.

1183
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:59,590
He'll be fine, Harry. He is a Great Wizard. Really like

1184
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,340
How are you using.

1185
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:08,020
I u? I shall only be per-intelligent and avid reader only. There are more important things.

1186
02:13:09,230 --> 02:13:14,860
That friendship and courage. Now, Harry, take care of.

1187
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:54,600
As a teacher u?

1188
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:59,230
No, impossible. Snape, he ...

1189
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:02,490
He's new look seems to be what guys are scams right?

1190
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:05,820
Beside him, one would suspect Quirrell pitiful teacher

1191
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:09,950
to speak also stuttered as we here?

1192
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:15,540
But the day is going Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me that.

1193
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:18,540
No, boys, is one who tries to kill mi.

1194
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:23,170
Information we go, if Snape does not stick to interrupt fire and reciting the mantra of our eyes,

1195
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,630
Then we have success.

1196
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,850
Even if Snape used raw.

1197
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:31,270
Snape tried to save me?

1198
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:36,810
I know mi would become very dangerous. Especially after Halloween.

1199
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,280
- And then he released the monster?
- Judging this level.

1200
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:44,490
Ko may Snape did not naive at all.

1201
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:50,030
When others fled, they dragged him up the third floor and one outside.

1202
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:54,460
He, of course, never believe me again.

1203
02:14:55,460 --> 02:15:00,710
He has isolated us. But he do not understand.

1204
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,970
I was never alone at all. Never.

1205
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:09,220
Now, the mirror has a role?

1206
02:15:10,850 --> 02:15:12,970
We see what we desire.

1207
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:17,900
We realize that we are holding this rock. But how to get it?

1208
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:20,310
Use him.

1209
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:25,030
Come here, Potter! Right now!

1210
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:41,130
Tell mi hear What was that kid?

1211
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:08,700
What is it, what you see?

1212
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:14,080
I'm Dumbledore waved his hand. I won the House Cup.

1213
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:15,790
It lied.

1214
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:20,040
Tell the truth! Do you see anything?

1215
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:24,630
- Let us tell it.
- Sir, that is not strong enough.

1216
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:28,880
One powerful enough to do this.

1217
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:49,950
Harry Potter ...

1218
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,490
... We meet again.

1219
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:54,120
Voldemort?

1220
02:16:54,330 --> 02:16:58,290
Yes, and you saw me there and become something.

1221
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,120
I have seen work to do to survive.

1222
02:17:02,330 --> 02:17:06,460
Living behind a human body

1223
02:17:07,130 --> 02:17:10,470
Human blood will maintain a code of life.

1224
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:14,340
But it can not give us one of their own body.

1225
02:17:14,510 --> 02:17:18,100
But one thing it can.

1226
02:17:18,310 --> 02:17:23,980
Something that has enough strength lies in people's pockets.

1227
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:25,860
Block it!

1228
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:33,700
Do not be so stupid.

1229
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:37,330
Why suffer the death

1230
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:41,160
while mi can follow me and live?

1231
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:42,460
Never!

1232
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:49,250
Very brave. Parents you have things.

1233
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:53,300
As we listen, Harry,

1234
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:57,390
you may want to look back at my parents again ko?

1235
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:59,770
Together ...

1236
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:02,520
... We can take them back.

1237
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:07,650
All we require is.

1238
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:17,490
It is there, Harry.

1239
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:22,250
No angel or devil at all.

1240
02:18:22,410 --> 02:18:25,420
Only power.

1241
02:18:25,670 --> 02:18:29,800
And the other guys were too weak to have it.

1242
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:35,510
Together, we can make something extraordinary.

1243
02:18:35,930 --> 02:18:38,180
Just take us to rock only.

1244
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:41,930
You lie!

1245
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:44,310
Catch it!

1246
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:13,130
- What magic?
- Get the colors rock!

1247
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:00,950
Hi son, Harry.

1248
02:21:03,070 --> 02:21:07,580
- Gifts from those who admire you.
- Admire?

1249
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:13,750
What happened between you and Professor Quirrell in the basement is a complete mystery.

1250
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,760
So naturally the whole school knows.

1251
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:24,760
He saw Ron has helped reduce the problem by eating

1252
02:21:24,970 --> 02:21:27,760
This dish is chocolate frogs.

1253
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:31,020
Ron here? He is so not him? What about Hermione?

1254
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:36,110
Medicine. Both of them are healthy kids.

1255
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:39,480
- Rock like already?
- Relax take any son.

1256
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:42,610
Stone has been destroyed then.

1257
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:47,120
You see Nicholas and he had a little chat

1258
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:51,290
and agreed that it is the best way.

1259
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,290
But that detail would not be a death?

1260
02:21:57,380 --> 02:22:02,880
Instrument was able to arrange everything for you.

1261
02:22:03,090 --> 02:22:06,300
But right then he will die tool.

1262
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:08,970
How did you get the rock they found?

1263
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:11,730
First few minutes I just stared at the mirror, then ...

1264
02:22:11,930 --> 02:22:16,020
Only those who want to find rock,

1265
02:22:16,310 --> 02:22:20,230
find it, not use it,

1266
02:22:20,490 --> 02:22:25,030
can get it.

1267
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:29,490
That is one amazing teacher ideas.

1268
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:34,750
This is a secret of our own two.

1269
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:41,420
That means if I lose Stone, Voldemort will never be able to return to A?

1270
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:43,970
He e is ...

1271
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:49,430
... He was still way back.

1272
02:22:50,140 --> 02:22:52,680
Harry, I know

1273
02:22:52,930 --> 02:22:56,940
why Professor Quirrell can not let you touch him not?

1274
02:22:57,150 --> 02:23:01,780
That's because there mother. She has sacrificed himself for me.

1275
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:05,530
He left the magical protection for children.

1276
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,530
No, it is not visible.

1277
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:14,660
- It exists in each of the muscles in children.
- So what is a?

1278
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:19,210
Love, Harry. Love.

1279
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:31,390
Bertie Botts, full flavored candy favorites.

1280
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:36,310
He unfortunately when youth do not enjoy them.

1281
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,860
He then again ... He no longer interested in them.

1282
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:43,400
I will not fine.

1283
02:23:43,650 --> 02:23:46,030
With a delicious hard candy.

1284
02:23:48,740 --> 02:23:51,660
Hm, alas!

1285
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:54,490
Indeed. This is the wax!.

1286
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:12,890
- It's all rather, Ron?
- Very good. And you?

1287
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:16,730
Good. Hermione?

1288
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:19,230
Could not be better.

1289
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,450
One year has passed again.

1290
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:42,790
Now as we know, the Cup should be awarded.

1291
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,630
In order of total points of the.

1292
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:51,640
Ranked as the Griffindor Wednesday with 312 points.

1293
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:59,270
Location Tuesday, Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1294
02:25:04,570 --> 02:25:06,320
Second place ...

1295
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:11,320
... Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1296
02:25:16,990 --> 02:25:18,750
The head ...

1297
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:24,500
... With 472 points, is the Slythetin.

1298
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:32,300
Nice one, mate.

1299
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:40,230
Well, Slytherin.

1300
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:44,770
However, some recent events should also be calculated more.

1301
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:49,940
And I have some points in the last minute.

1302
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:56,030
Hermione Granger for her.

1303
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:59,040
Because the ability to apply great speculation.

1304
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:02,040
50 points.

1305
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,250
Good job.

1306
02:26:11,970 --> 02:26:18,010
Monday, the game Ronald Weasley.

1307
02:26:18,510 --> 02:26:23,770
Because the past has won a rare game at Hogwarts, 50 points.

1308
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:30,400
And Tuesday ...

1309
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:33,860
... Is game Harry Potter.

1310
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:38,370
Because the clear spirit and courage special.

1311
02:26:38,910 --> 02:26:43,830
I reward the more Griffindor 60 points.

1312
02:26:52,090 --> 02:26:54,050
We in the House of Slytherin then.

1313
02:26:54,260 --> 02:27:00,260
And finally, we need more courage to confront the enemy.

1314
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:04,350
But will need more when we must stand up to prevent his own friends.

1315
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:07,520
Therefore, I award 10 points ...

1316
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:10,940
... To play Neville Longbottom.

1317
02:27:24,290 --> 02:27:27,710
I am confident that my calculations are correct,

1318
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:32,460
So I believe we need to change the layout a bit here.

1319
02:27:37,470 --> 02:27:40,890
Griffindor won the Cup!.

1320
02:27:42,970 --> 02:27:45,270
Yes!

1321
02:28:00,570 --> 02:28:02,160
We won!

1322
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:22,260
Board the time, hurry up. No games will be too late.

1323
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:26,770
Any hurry

1324
02:28:32,190 --> 02:28:35,480
- Up time, Harry
- One minute.

1325
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:45,490
Although I have not left a goodbye.

1326
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:50,540
This should still be her.

1327
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:09,430
Thanks Uncle, Hagrid.

1328
02:29:15,230 --> 02:29:19,690
Well go away. Listen, Harry.

1329
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:24,570
If the guy of her cousin, the Dursleys, Dudley guy was, cause me any trouble,

1330
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:27,490
... I take every threat it for Uncle ...

1331
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:30,580
... That it will be commensurate with his ears tail in him.

1332
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:35,880
But, Hagrid, we are not allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts.

1333
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:40,670
Uncle said. But he is not their child, correct?

1334
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:49,270
Strange feeling when you go home, right?

1335
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:51,600
I do not go home.

1336
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:53,730
Really are.

1337
02:30:51,770 --> 02:35:53,730
