1
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,415
- okay.

2
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,252
- I'm ready.

3
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,211
- jacquiese, stand up.

4
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:40,170
Jacquiese whelchel is not
guilty of false imprisonment,

5
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,781
attempted false imprisonment,

6
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,524
terroristic threats,
or battery.

7
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,743
Sit down.

8
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,834
The judge is gonna tell you

9
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:55,316
that if the state fails
to prove their case,

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,578
it is your duty;

11
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:59,494
you must acquit.

12
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,801
That's the beauty
of this system.

13
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:07,545
It's set up to give people
the presumption of innocence,

14
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:11,723
to give them an opportunity
to not just be heard

15
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,030
but hold the state accountable.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,686
You want to take my liberty,
you got to do it right,

17
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,731
and if you don't, acquit.

18
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:23,996
The fifth amendment to
the united states constitution

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,521
guarantees it.

20
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,524
As I've made my objections
throughout this trial,

21
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:34,224
it's to make sure that this kid
gets a fair trial.

22
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:37,271
It's not a big case,
is what they say.

23
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,839
They are saying that they have--
they have the gall to say

24
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,755
that this is not a big case.

25
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,584
There are huge consequences.

26
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:50,153
This boy will become
a convicted felon.

27
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,981
That's the reality of it.

28
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:55,724
That's what
this case represents.

29
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,291

state of georgia versus
jacquiese m'shawn whelchel,

40
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,840
we, the jury,
find the defendant not guilty

41
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:12,279
this second day
of november 2011,

42
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:15,456
count one, jury foreperson.

43
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,729
- my goal is
to fill this wall up,

44
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,252
and then once
I fill this wall up,

45
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,384
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

46
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,909
Hopefully, like,
my whole office

47
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,954
will just be covered
in acquittals.

48
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,655
I decided,
since the wins go on the wall,

49
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,309
the losses have to go somewhere,

50
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,919
and I'ma tattoo--

51
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,747
uh, I don't have any tattoos,

52
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,270
so I'm gonna get the last name
of every case I've lost

53
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,185
tattooed on my back.

54
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,274
Right now it's only five,
and hopefully it won't get--

55
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,145
hopefully I won't fill
my back up.

56
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,756
That's the goal.

57
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,410
But since the wins
go on the wall,

58
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,325
I decided the losses
have to go somewhere,

59
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,674
and they'll go on my back,

60
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,154
'cause they're gonna be
with me forever.

61
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,289
- when you work
as a public defender,

62
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,421
you say to somebody,

63
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,161
"oh, I'm a public defender,"

64
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,207
and then they're like,
"well, what does that mean?"

65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,470
"i defend people who are charged
with committing crimes,"

66
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:14,776
and then they'll say,

67
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,126
"how can you defend
those people?"

68
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,911
I tell them the truth,
and the truth is,

69
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:23,350
it's about the sanctity
of human liberty

70
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:26,266
and the cost of it
if you want to take it.

71
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,498
- hi.

72
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,065
- I'm well.
How are you?

73
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:49,027
Trying cases
is an adrenaline rush,

74
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,812
and when you win,
there's a high.

75
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,598
But that is not the average day
of a public defender.

76
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,449

diversion program.

I am so excited for him.

80
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,375
Ah, if only we can get him out.

81
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,552
If we can't get him out,
it's pointless

82
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,380
if his mom can't buy him out.

how are

office in clayton county.

I got a letter
from the d.a.'s office today

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,875
indicating that they have
referred him

89
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,572
to the pretrial
diversion program.

90
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,052
Are you familiar
with that at all?

91
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:02,274
It will allow him
to have his charges dismissed.

92
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:05,234
Now, in order to get him in
the pretrial diversion program,

93
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,410
he's gonna have
to get out of jail.

94
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,718
You think you'll be able
to do that?

95
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:27,212
I know it's a lot,
miss howard.

96
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,518
I know.

97

Okay.

101

Your mom has 500.
How much do you have?

102
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,109
You don't have anything.

103
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,417
Is his--

104
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,993
all right.
I'll talk to you soon.

105
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,082
Bye-bye.

He's gonna have to choose

- being a public defender,

109
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,596
you realize very quickly

110
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,771
the reality is,

111
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,686
90% of the people
or 95% of the people

112

with something

113
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:54,082
plead guilty
to something, right?

114
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,738
Because the system is designed
to force them to plead guilty,

115
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,871
and it punishes
their failure to comply.

116
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,657
This is the way it really works.

117
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,093
You go to jail.

118
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,182
You're charged with an offense

119
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,663
based upon what a police officer
thinks you did.

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,014
They set a bond,

121
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:15,669
and if you're poor
and you can't make the bond,

122
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,627
you don't get out.

123
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,543
so you sit

124
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,153

125
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,546

all the things that could happen

if you were summarily plucked
from your life.

131
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:45,089
You have so much tremendous
pressure to plead guilty.

132
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,875
It's all about
lessening the penalty.

133

aerial depictions

138

that I've collected.

139
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,556
This guy was charged with, like,

140
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,515
38 counts of burglary,

141
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,605
and it took--it took forever
to close the case,

142
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,739
and I just kept
the blowups from it.

143
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,654
There's really nothing
to see in the house.

144
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:30,439
It's next door to the office.

145
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,788
That's my favorite thing
about it.

146
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,485
It's next door to the office.

147
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,837
All I do is this.

148
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,229
I don't do anything else.

149
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,231
I don't have a wife and kids.

150
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,320
I do this.
I do this for a living.

151

You know,
in a given case,

152
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,629
if I don't do
all I need to do,

153
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,327
somebody's gonna become
a convicted felon,

154
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,590
and they go to prison.

155
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,636
They can't vote.
They can't get a job.

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,814
Like, I think about that
every case.

157
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,090
the job is just emergencies.

158
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:16,659
Everybody's
in an emergency state.

159
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,315
Everybody's in jail

160
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,709
or charged
with child molestation

161
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,580
or getting beat up

162
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,060
or something crazy is going on.

163
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,801
It's just--it's just chaos.

164
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,177
- judge, this is
case number 2011cr252-c,

165
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,484
the state of georgia
versus branden lee mullin.

166
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,357
On the incident date,

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,490
the defendant was
with cody campbell,

168
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,842
and they discussed
ordering a pizza.

169
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,758
They did discuss
robbing the pizza man.

170
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,847
Cody campbell made the call,

171
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,241
and the car was approached
by mr. mullin,

172
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,027
who put the knife
to mr. wrengle's throat

173
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,380
and told him to freeze
and to give him the money.

174
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,688
The investigation
progressed from there.

175
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,092
- when I get a case,

176
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,269
I'm more like an investigator
than a lawyer.

177
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,490
I really consider myself
a lot more like matlock

178
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,144
than f. lee bailey.

179
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,847
- uh, just--just a statement.

180
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,110
Yeah, slightly incriminating.

181
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,765
You know, "i was there.
I saw this guy jump out.

182
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,854
I didn't know
what was going on."

183
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,770
- no. no.

184
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,293
I believe
he just happened to be

185
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,904
at the wrong place
at the wrong time

186
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,036
hanging with
a bunch of dummies.

187
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,560
But it ain't lookin' good.

188
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,129
But, oh, man,
it'll break my heart

189
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,740
if this kid gets convicted.

190
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,786
Ten-year mandatory minimum,
day for day.

191
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,483
- yeah, 19.

192
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,356
- and our kid
is a cute little white guy.

193
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,838
He's gonna have a rough time
at the big boy prison,

194
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:35,406
'cause that's where they're
gonna send armed robbers.

195
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,279
He's gonna have a rough time.

196
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,672
He probably won't live
to see the ten years.

197
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:41,804
If he does, when he gets out,

198
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,545
I would hate to see him.

199
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,897
For 96 bucks.

200
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,247
All this shit over $96.

201
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:06,742
♪

202
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,808
- all rise.

203
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,947
- mr. mardell,
you were charged with driving

204
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,602
after being declared
an habitual violator.

205
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:43,518
Upton, you were charged
with aggravated assault,

206
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,955
with terroristic threats,
and battery.

207
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,739
Mr. rawlings, you were charged

208
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,872
with violation of the georgia
controlled substances act.

209
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,006
This plea form has a written
statement that indicates

210
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,703
that you wish to plead guilty.

211
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,923
How do you wish to plead
to these charges?

212
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,012
Not guilty or guilty?
- guilty.

213
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,970
- how do you wish to plead
to these charges?

214
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,059
Not guilty or guilty?
- guilty.

215
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,365
- guilty.

216
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,106
- so is there anything further
from the state?

217
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,455
- no, your honor.

218
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,935
- anything further
from the defense?

219
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,024
- no, your honor.
And that's all I had.

220
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,417
May I be excused?
- yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:25,038
- these are the new clients
that you need to see.

222
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,692
Here's the file
that I was just asking about.

223
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,912
- oh.

224
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,610
thanks. okay.

225
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,917
- miss wright,
how are you doing?

226
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,353
Um, I talked to the prosecutor.

227
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:39,748
She'd be willing to go up
on the bond, $10,000,

228
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,097
and then give him a curfew.

229
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,230
But I want to make sure
that it's not gonna, like,

230
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:46,537
increase your amount that you
have to pay every two weeks

231
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:49,584
by more than $100.

232
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,368
Okay.

233
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,110
You're welcome.
I'll talk to you soon.

234
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:56,591
She's behind
on all of her bills,

235
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,810
and they're about
to take her car.

236
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,074
This kid is in high school.

237
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,989
He's so smart,

238
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,948
so incredibly smart.

239
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,646
That's him.

240
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,691
He's 17.

241
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:13,042
He was arrested
for armed robbery.

242
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,915
This is--i can't even believe
that they arrested him for it.

243
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,307
I really don't believe it.

244
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,136
And it's a ten-year minimum
mandatory sentence.

245
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,966
And win, lose, or draw,

246
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,663
tears will fall,

247
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:28,188
because this kid is--

248
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:30,494
I don't think he's guilty.

249
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,541
I don't.
I think he's innocent.

250
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,991
- when they arrested me,

251
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,340
I was scared.

252
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,473
I didn't know what was going on.

253
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,913
- why don't come on in
and help me get decorated?

254
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,090
There's some meatloaf and
cabbages in the refrigerator.

255
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,360
Throw that trash out.

256
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,976
- it was december 9, 2010.

257
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,937
Me and my family was sitting
in the living room watching tv,

258
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,374
cooking, you know,
just a normal family night.

259
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,552
All of a sudden,
we hear a big knock on the door.

260
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:30,511
So my mom go to the door
and open up.

261
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,643
They say
it's the college park police.

262
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:35,559
- I unlocked the door,
twist the knob,

263
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:39,041
and didn't even get a chance
to open the door all the way.

264
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,651
As soon as it cracked--

265
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,088
I guess they heard me
twist the knob--

266
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:44,133
they just pushed the door in,

267
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,830
pushed me back,

268
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,703
they spinned me around,
pushed me on the floor,

269
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,445
rushed in,
pushed my daughter on the floor.

270
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:55,057
They all had guns and
flashlights to all our heads

271
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,276
on the floor.

272
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,408
They rushed in the living room,

273
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,367
yanked my son off the sofa,

274
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,411
throw him on the floor,

275
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,065
put the handcuffs on him,

276
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,849
and just took him outside.

277
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:09,202
I cried.

278
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:13,206
It's a unexplainable feeling,
situation,

279
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:17,036
for someone to come in
to your home,

280
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,429
whether it's been
the police or whomever,

281
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,736
and take your child away.

282
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,523
Demontes was a very good baby.

283
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,614
This is when he became
kind of challenging.

284
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:34,096
He would take his toys apart
and put 'em back together,

285
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,012
and I bought him
one of those razor motorcycles.

286
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,405
You would never believe it.

287
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:41,060
He took that thing apart
and re-rigged it up

288
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,323
to run faster.

289
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,281
- when they arrested me,
I was 16.

290
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,023
Then they--they held me
at a juvenile detention center

291
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,590
until I turned 17,

292
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,113
and then they took me
to the county,

293
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,593
which is adult jail.

294
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,986
I was scared,
but I knew I couldn't--

295
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,510
I couldn't really
let it get to me,

296
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,033
'cause I knew
I had to be strong,

297
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,252
'cause at the time,

298
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,383
I was gonna be there
to be there,

299
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,516
so I couldn't really
stress myself.

300
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,257
It'd make the situation worse.

301
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,128
I already knew
I couldn't afford a lawyer,

302
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,217
so I was expecting
a public defender.

303
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,219
I was just praying
on a good one,

304
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,308
and god answered my prayer.

305
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,963
- armed robbery
is a maximum life penalty.

306
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,791
A judge could sentence you
to life for it.

307
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,010
You understand what that means?
- yeah.

308
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:23,102
- it's hard to understand
a life sentence when you're 17.

309
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:26,496
But those are things
that you have to think about.

310
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,152
I know a man.

311
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,546
He was sentenced
to life in prison

312
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:35,331
for a crime
he did not commit.

313
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,463
You have to think about that.

314
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,160
I know that you're young,

315
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,597
and it's easy to want to run
the streets with your friends

316
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,859
and do what you see on tv

317
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,558
and get tattoos
and so on and so forth.

318
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,342
That's real cool,
and it's great,

319
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,866
and it's wonderful
while you're 16, 17 years old.

320
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,868
But when you're 25,
who's gonna hire you

321
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,523
with tats on your neck
and all down your hand?

322
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,222
That make sense?
- yeah.

323
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:10,410
♪

324
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,353
- so welcome back to birmingham.

325
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,403
all right.

326
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,319
I--i don't know
if everyone knows,

327
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,366
but--but, um, just this month

328
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:56,107
we had three more lawyers
leave their offices,

329
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:59,633
three more s.p.d.t.c. lawyers
leave their offices.

330
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:01,983
It's not a surprise, right?

331
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,377
I mean, you guys are doing
the most difficult work

332
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,422
in the most difficult places.

333
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,207
But as I've talked
to some of you

334
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,297
who haven't left but maybe
have been considering it,

335
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,387
I know one issue
is certainly money.

336
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,216
But another issue is

337
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,435
that it's just too hard.

338
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,482
"i feel defeated."

339
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,615
I think that that's what
this community is about.

340
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,881
- I closed
over 500 felonies last year,

341
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:36,104
and I have 165 pending cases
right now that are all felonies,

342
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,368
and i--i cannot be
an effective attorney

343
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,848
at those numbers.

344
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,546
- without this group,
I would've quit a long time ago,

345
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,592
because, as you said,
it's a hard job,

346
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,898
and when you've got nobody
that's helping you,

347
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,640
and when you've got
everybody telling you,

348
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,773
you know, "you work too much.
You should"--

349
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,818
that are actually ordering me
out the door

350
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:58,082
and ordering me not
to work the hours that I work.

351
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,823
- the summer after I graduated,

352
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,348
a young lady by the name
of alice stamps was like,

353
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,827
"june, you've got to come work

354
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,221
for the hinds county
public defender's office."

355
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,396
I was like, "no.

356
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,571
"y'all got to pay me.

357
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,312
"i got six figures
in educational debt.

358
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,879
What are you say"--

359
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,533
"june, all of that's
gonna work out, baby.

360
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,230
Don't even trip on it."

361
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,407
- there was a case.

362
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,496
It was a sex case,

363
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,500
and the client
was accused of, like,

364
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:27,503
raping his 12-year-old daughter.

365
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,113
So I go to talk to him,

366
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,638
and I'm expecting him
to tell me

367
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:34,075
why he didn't do it
and, you know,

368
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:37,165
help me to establish
a defense for him,

369
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,256
and he starts to tell me

370
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,215
how he raped his daughter,

371
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,479
and he's proud of it.

372
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:49,351
And I literally had to, like,

373
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,353
stop myself from vomiting.

374
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,574
Something clicked in me
that said,

375
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,751
"some people
are just bad people.

376
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:01,711
Some people just do
evil things."

377
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:06,368
That, to me, is not what
a public defender should--

378
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,370
like, I don't feel like
I should think those things

379
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:12,548
about my clients.

380
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,550
And I feel like I'm doing them
an injustice

381
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,727
because I think those things
about a lot of them.

382
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,382
And I feel like people
like travis

383
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:23,298
who I respect
very, very highly--

384
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,647
I look up to travis--

385
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,171
and I feel like
I'm letting travis down

386
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,784
in being this person
that I've become.

387
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,397
Real talk.
You can't--

388
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:39,401
you can't really look
for the same thing

389
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,881
to motivate you
per client.

390
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,883
Like, some people are just--

391
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:46,539
everybody has--every case
has a redeeming quality to it--

392
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,497
not every person necessarily.

393
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,892
Don't necessarily focus on
the folks sometimes, you know?

394
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,676
Like, it would make you
feel good to, like,

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,462
do right for people
when they right.

396
00:22:56,505 --> 00:23:00,030
But, shit, I want to do right
for people when they wrong too.

397
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:04,731
- what I've seen from doing it
for 15, 16 years is,

398
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,951
the ones who last at this,

399
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:09,736
they do what travis
is talking about.

400
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,608
Sometimes it's just good
to fight the system

401
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:16,438
and just be a warrior
and just go to war,

402
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,440
and they find that balance

403
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,050
that helps them
get through the times

404
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,444
when one of those
isn't working for 'em.

405
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:25,404
- when you go back
to your offices,

406
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,623
you will forget
what you feel like right now,

407
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,842
and it's understandable,

408
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,931
'cause you're going
back to hell.

409
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,150
Some of you are
going to hell, right?

410
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:35,457
And you're gonna feel like
you just can't make it,

411
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,546
and work is too hard.

412
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,593
You all know people who chose

413
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,596
to go to firms
to make a lot of money.

414
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,815
They're gonna drive cars
nicer than you,

415
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,731
live in houses nicer than you.

416
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,343
But they're not gonna
make a difference.

417
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,302
Let me say this to you, though.

418
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,913
This will be a battle
that will be won,

419
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:59,481
and your children
will look back on this,

420
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:03,616

from this injust, cruel,

take, for example,
statutory rape cases--

452
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,414
my clients
just don't seem to know

453
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:50,157
that consent is not
an essential element.

very much like a woman,

um, and it may not cross
the young man's mind that,

had escaped from custody
here in georgia,

511
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:05,787
and she took on an alias name

512
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,311
in order to avoid detection,

513
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:10,357
and her alias name--
the last name was williams.

514
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,274
That was--one of her aliases
was jackie williams.

515
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:17,973
And so she gave birth to a child
under that alias name.

516
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:18,974
And that child was me.

517
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,371
She fled to florida,

518
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:27,983
and she just dropped me off
with my grandmother

519
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:31,639
and took off.

520
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,946
And so I don't know
who my father is.

521
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:45,174
♪

522
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,011
- I collapsed in court
last week.

523
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,103
My knees kind of gave out,

524
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,410
and the prosecutor
had to catch me.

525
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,110
I was so stressed.

526
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:09,677
I was having anxiety attacks

527
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,027
and getting really upset.

528
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,073
My hair was falling out.

529
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:16,727
So the doctor suggested
that I take a week off.

530
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:22,995
I had a client
charged with murder

531
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,650
who apparently
was planning my murder.

532
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,525
I had a couple
of other clients warn me

533
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:34,136
that he had been bragging
in the jail

534
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,228
that he was gonna end my life
if we lost at his trial,

535
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,709
that he had a "plan"

536
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,189
on how he was gonna do this

537
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:45,234
and that he had nothing to lose

538
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,323
because if he was convicted
of murder,

539
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,630
you know, he was gonna get life
without parole.

540
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:52,894
So from what I was told,
let's do it big.

541
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:57,638
Take out a lawyer
in open court.

542
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:00,510
Go down in history.

543
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:05,820
I worked my ass off
for this client.

544
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,040
I went to the jail
every time he called

545
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,216
and said he needed somebody
to come and see him.

546
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:12,044
He wanted to talk to me,
but I knew he didn't have

547
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:15,047
anything to tell me
that was new or helpful.

548
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,918
That he just wanted
to see somebody's face.

549
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,921
That was me.
I was going out there.

550
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,402
I was the person
staying up at night

551
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:28,408
because I didn't know
what was gonna happen to him

552
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:31,193
or if I was even good enough.

553
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:34,370
That was me,
and you're planning my murder?

554
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:39,941
It's a part of the job.

555
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,728
that's what I'm told.

556
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,078
I don't think it is.

557
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,602
I don't think
it's part of the job.

558
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,960
- yes.

559
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:07,099
- I remember the speech

560
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:10,058
at, like--i guess
it was maybe the last day

561
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:13,105
where you said, "some of you
are going back to hell."

562
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,283
because it's true.

563
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,981
I'm serious.
It's so true. it's so--

564
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,983
- what would it take
to have someone like you around

565
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,811
in ten years?

566
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:26,205
- you don't want somebody
like me around in ten years.

567
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,990
- I'm just very jaded now.

568
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,992
'cause now I'm like,
I can't save everybody,

569
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:34,082
and then I see these clients
coming back and back and back,

570
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:38,086
and I want to be able
to tell the story

571
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,654
about the client
that was saved

572
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:43,700
and how the police,
like, tricked him.

573
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:48,009
But a lot of the cases
are not that.

574
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,446
Most of 'em are not that.

575
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,187
- but, brandy, you can't--

576
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:56,626
I mean, if you define success
as victory in every case,

577
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,715
right, where in fact
the evidence is overwhelming,

578
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,979
it doesn't matter
where you practice.

579
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,023
You're gonna feel defeated.

580
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:05,113
The fact that you recognize

581
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:07,855
that this is a job
that causes you

582
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:12,033
to sort of lose your humanity
and your sensitivity,

583
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,469
the fact that you recognize that

584
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,645
means you still have the ability

585
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:19,258
to sort of correct it
and push forward.

586
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,477
Right, like, you come home,
and you're like--

587
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,044
in the heat of the moment,

588
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,437
"i am insensitive,"

589
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,265
and you come home,
and you feel badly about that.

590
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,266
- I do.
I feel like--

591
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,181
- which sets you apart.

592
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,356
That sets you apart

593
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,271
from so many people
who do this work.

594
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,881
All right, that is why
we would want

595
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,014
someone like you around
in ten years.

596
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,885
But look, right?

597
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,453
I mean, if you're trying
to rescue people from hell,

598
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,150
you do have to go to hell
to do it, right?

599
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,543
- yeah.

600
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,502
- and if you don't,
you won't rescue anyone.

601
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,076
- you're wearing your hat.

602
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,121
- yep.

603
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,905
You know,
I wrote all the appeals

604
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,560
that I wrote that I won,
I wrote wearing this hat.

605
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,692
Not this hat,
but a marlins hat.

606
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,087
- yeah.

607
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:10,483
- rachel is a girl
I met a few months ago,

608
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:14,095
and we've been dating
for most of that time period.

609
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,187
- how much longer
are you gonna be?

610
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,102
- just a few more minutes.

611
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:27,239
Obviously, my work habits

612
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:32,157
are not helpful
to a relationship.

613
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,204
So we're trying to come up with
certain rules for us to follow,

614
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:38,076
a contract of sorts

615
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,207
that I'm gonna draw up

616
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,513
and we're both gonna sign.

617
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,516
- do you want me
to really draw up a contract?

618
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,300
- yeah, we really are
gonna draw one up.

619
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,693
Maybe tonight.

620
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,651
We need to actually
put this in writing,

621
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:51,306
because I've got an issue
with the contract.

622
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,351
- this is the thing.

623
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:54,570
We have a contract
that on nights

624
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:57,269
when I don't have my son,

625
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,272
he's supposed
to leave the office when I do.

626
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:03,101
And as you can see,
I'm off of work,

627
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,538
and he's still going for it.

628
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,279
- no, no, I'm down with that.

629
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,454
I'm not saying I'm against that.

630
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,890
- but you're just--
you just told me

631
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,196
you needed to make
an amendment.

632
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,546
- no, I mean--i do.
I do.

633
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,243
And that's the real issue.

634
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,332
I need to make an amendment.

635
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,335
- I'm all ears.

636
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:25,384
- why don't I just
come back later?

637
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:28,387
Let me go home and get
some stuff done, and can i--

638
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,215
I'll just come back later.
Is that good?

639
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,260
- okay.

640
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:33,479
- that works.

641
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:44,707
♪

642
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,808
- thank you, everyone,
for coming.

643
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:00,506
I want to thank

644
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,509
certainly
congressman lewis

645
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:06,207
who organized freedom summer.

646
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,209
I thought about a quote
that says,

647
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:10,472
"our lives are not our own.

648
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:13,867
They belong to those
who need us desperately."

649
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,653
Congressman lewis,
you've lived that quote.

650
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,787
- I'm delighted to be here.

651
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,571
You know,
I got arrested a few times.

652
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:25,400
I went to jail 40 time

653
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,228
during the '60s.

654
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:29,578
And it was lawyers,

655
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:34,931
unbelievably courageous men
and women of the bar

656
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,542
that came to my rescue.

657
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,372
They defended us.

658
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,026
They filed briefs.

659
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,115
And if it hadn't been
for the lawyers

660
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,813
during that period,

661
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:50,643
I don't know where we will be
as a nation and as a people.

662
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:54,951
So I want to thank
this wonderful organization

663
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,866
for getting in the way,

664
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,262
for defending those that have
been left out and left behind.

665
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,090
Thank you.

666
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,269
- life in clayton county--

667
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,880
I dare not speak for all of the
public defenders in georgia--

668
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,448
but life
in clayton county, georgia,

669
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,797
is a different beast.

670
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:17,539
The average bond
in clayton county

671
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,280
on a theft by shoplifting

672
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,064
is $40,000.

673
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,023
- wow.

674
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:26,766
- my clients
cannot afford that bond.

675
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,117
So they sit
for four to eight months

676
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,162
waiting to be indicted.

677
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:35,644
I've wanted to leave
so many times.

678
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,864
I think I've lost count
at this point.

679
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,562
And I know lots
of other people

680
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,260
who have wanted to leave
as well.

681
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:47,439
It's only s.p.d.t.c.,

682
00:37:47,482 --> 00:37:50,572
and particularly
jonathan rapping,

683
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:53,009
that keep me here.

684
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,403
So I hope
that I've given you all

685
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:59,364
a small glimpse of my world
in clayton county.

686
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:02,410
It is not fun at all.

687
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:06,153
But it's a necessary evil.

688
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,372
Thanks.

689
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,378
speaking in front
of the congressman,

690
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,162
that was really surreal.

691
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:18,339
It won't hit me until, like,
two months from now.

692
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:22,474
When I met him, he said,
"thank you for your service."

693
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:24,693
I was like, "oh.

694
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:28,175
"really, congressman john lewis?

695
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:29,829
"you're thanking me?

696
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:31,439
I feel special."

697
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:33,354
I felt very special.

698
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:44,234
- it's important, I think,
for the clients to see us,

699
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:47,847
and kind of keep their morale up
and know that we have,

700
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,240
you know,
their best interests at heart.

701
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,853
I know in particular with me
how I interrelate

702
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,202
with my clients.

703
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:58,423
I see them as cousins
or brothers,

704
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:02,383
some uncles,

705
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,602
just because it--

706
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,387
the face
of the black community is,

707
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,693
so many of them are locked up,

708
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:11,653
and of course,
I'm having to work against

709
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:14,439
their initial impression
of public defenders

710
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:17,093
because their first
public defender

711
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,227
somewhat screwed them.

712
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,229
Hi, miss lewis.

713
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:23,448
Good.

714
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:25,972
Maybe if you could
sit over here.

715
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:27,190
How are you?

716
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,583
- I'm doing fine.
- good. good. good.

717
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:30,193
Good to see you.
- you too.

718
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,021
- two days in a row.
It's freezing outside.

719
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:35,416
- it really is.

720
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,201
So you know why I'm here.

721
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:39,507
I'm here to...
- yeah.

722
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,769
- kind of get
a better understanding

723
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:44,599
of what took place
when you were arrested.

724
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,297
But let's kind of

725
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:52,564
go through some of
your biographical information.

726
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:55,044
What do you do?
- I'm a certified mechanic.

727
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:56,568
- you're kidding me.
- no kidding.

728
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:59,571
- okay. certified mechanic.
Wow.

729
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,268
How long
have you been a mechanic?

730
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:02,878
- about 15 years.

731
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,885
- okay.

732
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,801
So once you're released
and you go back to your norm,

733
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:16,239
you'll go back
to working on cars and such?

734
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,590
- I'ma try,
'cause since I've been in here,

735
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,939
I've lost my house.

736
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:22,681
They've broken in
and stole all my tools.

737
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:24,204
- oh.
- so I'ma have to, like--

738
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,641
- start from scratch.
- start from scratch.

739
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:27,947
I'm have to--i'ma leave here

740
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,340
and go into a shelter
and start from scratch.

741
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:31,907
- okay.

742
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:34,388
- but after my landlord
found out I was incarcerated,

743
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,435
he filed eviction notices
against me.

744
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,482
- my mom said she went
to go get it the other day,

745
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,788
but he had the lock on the door,

746
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,267
'cause I had court

747
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,661
that he put an eviction notice
on my door,

748
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:47,923
and I had court,

749
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,795
and I told three guards here

750
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:51,884
that I was supposed
to be in court.

751
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,234
Okay, nobody took me to court.

752
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:57,019
So the court, they ruled
in the landlord's favor.

753
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:58,020
- wow.

754
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,674
It's default judgment.
Mm-hmm.

755
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:02,503
- yeah, so that caused me to be
really evicted from my house,

756
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,723
but she said she called
the court to let 'em know

757
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,682
that I was incarcerated.

758
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:08,683
- mm-hmm.

759
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,511
- but she said that

760
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,731
they haven't really did
the eviction yet,

761
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,646
so he just, like,
holding my stuff.

762
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,777
- okay, wow.

763
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:18,998
Thank you
for letting me know that.

764
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:24,003
So you were convicted of cocaine
possession back in 2004.

765
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:26,353
- yeah, I admitted to it.
Yes, I did.

766
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,094
I really pled
to get out of jail,

767
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:30,705
'cause I had never
been in jail before.

768
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:34,535
It was just my public defender,
and me and her had problems.

769
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,537
And she told me
when I took that plea--

770
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:40,889
she told me that I wouldn't be
considered a convicted felon.

771
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:42,630
I've been screwed around
the first time

772
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,066
by a public defender,

773
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,068
and when they told me
I had another one,

774
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,636
I figured my life
was completely over.

775
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,857
- your sentence
was two years suspended,

776
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,120
two years on probation,
and you're right.

777
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,991
Since you were
a first-time offender,

778
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:58,428
you should've been eligible
for a nonadjudication.

779
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,822
I'm not sure what happened,
and I apologize that--

780
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:02,302
- I don't either.

781
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:03,390
- that that took place.

782
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,087
But it's not
the end of the world.

783
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,480
It's not the end of the world.

784
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,568
We can definitely fix it.

785
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:08,874
- it's the end of my world,

786
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,571
'cause that messed up
a lot of stuff for me.

787
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,747
- but we can--we can come--
we can rebound from it.

788
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,748
I'm sure we can.

789
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:14,923
I'm gonna, you know,

790
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,577
ask about
the different eyewitnesses.

791
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,100
Where were they standing?

792
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:19,667
Were any of them
under the influence?

793
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,321
I mean,
'cause it could've been anything

794
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:25,630
that clouded maybe their vision
or their vantage point,

795
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:28,371
their perception
of what took place.

796
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:29,677
All right?

797
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:31,679
So I will see you on monday.

798
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,072
Thank you so much.
- thank you.

799
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:35,248
- you're welcome.
You're welcome.

800
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,653
- branden's trial date
is coming up.

801
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:53,919
So far, neither side has come up
with any conclusive evidence.

802
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:57,966
The person who committed
the robbery was disguised,

803
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,230
so the victim
can't accurately i.d. anyone.

804
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,714
I was looking through
branden's file a few days ago,

805
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:09,151
and that's when I remembered
the fingerprints.

806
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,157
- the driver drives in.

807
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:19,597
He's looking for essentially

808
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,729
that apartment, I believe.

809
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:23,688
I believe he's looking
for that apartment.

810
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:28,388
Somebody comes out
and puts a knife towards him.

811
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,784
Now, what happened is,
the robber, no gloves,

812
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:35,613
put his hand
certain places on the car.

813
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:38,920
The state lifted prints
from the hood,

814
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:40,443
but they never tested them.

815
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,098
I wanted to test the prints,

816
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:44,926
but unfortunately
we don't have the resources

817
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,885
to make that happen.

818
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,803
So I have to trick the d.a.
Into doing it.

819
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:54,066
So I filed a motion in court

820
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,416
saying that I wanted to ban
all fingerprint evidence

821
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,113
from the trial.

822
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,680
This made the d.a. think
that I was scared

823
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:02,770
of the fingerprint evidence,
and they tested it.

824
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:04,990
We got the results back,

825
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:07,688
and they didn't match
branden or cody.

826
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:11,823
This backs up what branden's
been saying the whole time.

827
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:13,563
Neither of them
committed the crime,

828
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:15,174
so we're going to trial.

829
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,178
- branden mullin.

830
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:24,923
- waiting for
the state's announcement.

831
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,012
- um, I'm--i'm--

832
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,449
I guess we'll be ready
subject to a plea.

833
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:30,493
We're, um--

834
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,713
- well, a plea
was a possibility,

835
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,889
but that's not gonna happen.

836
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:37,239
We're ready for trial.

837
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:39,720
- all right.

838
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:40,808
We'll mark it as ready.

839
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,288
- and, sir,
just out of curiosity,

840
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,986
where will that case be
on the trial calendar?

841
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,814
- it looks like it's number two.

842
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:50,513
- and so we would be number two
on the january 9th calendar?

843
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,428
- number two
on the january 9th calendar,

844
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,647
probably number one--

845
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,084
Yes, sir.

846
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,137
- okay, we're gonna go
over the evidence

847
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,748
that the prosecutors have.

848
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:11,796
Officer brennan says
that on december 3rd,

849
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,406
he responded
to an armed robbery.

850
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,757
A black in color
automatic handgun was used.

851
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:20,979
They handed over
around $300 worth of cash.

852
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:22,763
They said
that they know the person

853
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:25,374
as being a frequent customer
in the pizza shop.

854
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,421
"i, officer brennan,
initiated an arrest warrant.

855
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:30,423
"upon officer searching
the room of the offender,

856
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:32,468
"they found a yellow
in color cardboard box

857
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:35,602
with 13 winchester .25
auto bullets."

858
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,909
According to you, they are--

859
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,780
they match a revolver, right?

860
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,173
- yeah, a .22.

861
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:43,871
- I mean, it can be.

862
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:47,222
They got .22 automatic,
and they got .22 revolvers.

863
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:48,049
- okay.

864
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:49,572
So would bullets to a .22

865
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:51,792
match the same bullets
to a 9

866
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:52,967
- oh, not at all.

867
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,273
.22 bullet like this small.

868
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,710
9-millimeter, they medium-sized.

869
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,886
- okay.

870
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,235
All they have is testimony.

871
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:03,499
They don't have
any fingerprints,

872
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:07,199
any pictures, 'cause they
didn't have a camera in there.

873
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:10,855
I wish I could say that we were
gonna go in and win this case.

874
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,465
I just don't know,

875
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:14,075
and that's
the god's honest truth.

876
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,817
I can tell you that I will give
everything that I have

877
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,819
to getting you
out of these charges.

878
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,256
I've maintained that throughout
my representation of you.

879
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,954
But at the end of the day,

880
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:25,870
you just never, ever know
what a jury is gonna do.

881
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:27,436
Ever.

882
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,570
So--and the stakes
are really, really high,

883
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:31,745
because if we lose,

884
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,923
it's day for day
at least ten years,

885
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,012
day for day,

886
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:39,666
no parole.

887
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,015
If you're found guilty,

888
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:44,279
they're gonna take you
into custody that day.

889
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:47,848
So even if we put sentencing off
until a later time,

890
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:52,026
they're not gonna let you leave.

891
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,811
Anything else?

892
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:57,771
- do you have another copy
of the discovery packet?

893
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,903
- yeah.

894
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,295
- what'd you do
with the one I sent you?

895
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:01,775
- I still got it,
but it got wet.

896
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,863
I had got tea on it.

897
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,343
- I'll make you a copy.

898
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:33,894
- I don't know.

899
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,467
I don't know either.

900
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:49,997
You ain't got no questions?

901
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:55,176
You got to have
some kind of questions.

902
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:09,277
- I have huge student loan debt.

903
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,627
After I pay
my student loans and my rent,

904
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:17,677
I have probably $300 a month
to pay extra bills

905
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,071
like gas and the car,
all that kind of stuff,

906
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:22,769
groceries.

907
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:24,205
But I don't see
how you can do this work

908
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:25,728
for any period of time

909
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,687
and not begin to love it.

910
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,603
If you don't, then it'll just
drive you insane.

911
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,825
Either you--either this
is your cause, or this ain't.

912
00:48:42,702 --> 00:48:44,008
- student loans.

913
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:49,013
Bank of america telling me
that I overdrew.

914
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:52,320
student loans.

915
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:56,368
Seriously, most of these
are student loan bills.

916
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:03,723
And that is why I'd prefer
not to look at them.

917
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:06,856
It's depressing.

918
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:16,954
this is all the money
I have in the world right now.

919
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,086
My gas light is on.

920
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,740
And so I'm getting $3 in gas,

921
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:24,613
and hopefully that will
take me home

922
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:29,531
and back to work
in the morning

923
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:31,664
and then back home
in the afternoon,

924
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:33,405
because I don't get paid
until friday.

925
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,847
- money pressure
is like any other pressure.

926
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:45,243
It takes something out of you
to deal with it,

927
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:47,941
and this job takes
a lot out of you

928
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,248
just to do the job.

929
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:54,513
That can be a significant burden
on a person.

930
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:58,082
But it's just something
you have to come to live with.

931
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,606
It's something
you have to accept.

932
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,830
- in the last year,

933
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:11,530
three public defenders
left the office.

934
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,798
It's rough financially.

935
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:21,931
So it takes--it takes
a certain kind of person maybe

936
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,282
to continue to, you know,

937
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:28,721
work under the circumstances.

938
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:33,117
- I'll probably leave here
about 2:00, so...

939
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,249
- yeah.

940
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:36,250
- let's go upstairs.

941
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:37,904
- all right.

942
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:44,389
- I am gonna make you
some homemade alfredo sauce.

943
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:46,478
- when I met travis,

944
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:50,264
he told me he originally moved
to georgia to find his dad

945
00:50:50,308 --> 00:50:52,092
but hadn't found his dad yet,

946
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:56,401
and then he finally got
the courage

947
00:50:56,444 --> 00:51:01,275
to ask his birth mother,

948
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:05,192
you know, for a name and stuff.

949
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:08,152
And now he's about to go
meet this guy.

950
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:28,824
we're on our way to meet up

951
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,349
with my biological--

952
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:33,525
potentially
my biological father.

953
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,744
Had a conversation
with him the other night,

954
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:39,574
and he seems to think
that I'm his son.

955
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:42,055
Said he always wanted a son.

956
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,491
I never wanted a father.

957
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:45,232
In fact, I don't want one now.

958
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:49,149
I just want to close
this chapter in my life.

959
00:51:52,196 --> 00:52:00,117
♪

960
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:11,824
Well, we sat down, and I hit him
with a few questions,

961
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,521
just, you know,
"do you think I'm your son?

962
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:16,176
"how do you know
my biological mother?

963
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,178
What was y'all
relationship like?"

964
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,180
You know, and he kind of
answered the question

965
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:24,837
as to why he never tried
to make contact,

966
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,319
that he had no way
to get in contact with her,

967
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:30,190
which was true.

968
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,326
Which was true.

969
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:38,851
But I don't know.

970
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,853
As a person that never takes no
for an answer,

971
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:41,984
I was just--

972
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:44,422
that wouldn't have been enough
for me.

973
00:52:58,958 --> 00:52:59,741
I don't know.

974
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:02,222
I guess I was just hoping

975
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,442
that somebody wanted me.

976
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,191
- today is my 30th birthday.

977
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,285
Whoo-hoo!
I'm so glad you made it!

978
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,941
- my dad came up from florida.

979
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:28,248
I've been in atlanta
for about 2 1/2 years,

980
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,380
and he's never come.

981
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:32,339
So it's amazing.

982
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:33,601
Okay, that's good.

983
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:36,343
Danielle, I need one
with me and my daddy.

984
00:53:36,387 --> 00:53:39,955
Okay, go.

985
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,043
- turn it the long ways.

986
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:42,567
You got to get
my figure, danielle.

987
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,568
Come on.

988
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,312
- all right, one, two, three.

989
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,187
- at any point you get nervous,

990
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,407
and you feel like you want
to hold on to something,

991
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,017
grab your harness right here.

992
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,061
- right here.

993
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,846
- yeah,
just don't grab my hands.

994
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,717
- okay. 'cause then
we can't pull the parachute.

995
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,589
- 'cause--yeah,
then I can't open the parachute.

996
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:06,591
- don't you worry.
I won't grab your hands.

997
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:11,030
you gonna scream, daddy?

998
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:13,511
- yeah.

999
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:15,556
- now I'm nervous--

1000
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,166
excited but nervous.

1001
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,516
- oh, yeah.

1002
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,263
My hope for my daughter
is to be happy.

1003
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,971
I look up to her

1004
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:43,149
because she believe
in helping people.

1005
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,938
And when you got a person
that believe in helping people,

1006
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:51,244
you cannot fail.

1007
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,029
I don't care how much
you feel like you fail.

1008
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:09,523
Failure is when
you stop dreaming.

1009
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,743
She never stopped dreaming.

1010
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:38,726
- I found out yesterday
that branden's friend cody,

1011
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,902
the one he got arrested with,

1012
00:55:40,946 --> 00:55:44,123
has become a witness
for the prosecution.

1013
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:47,996
He is gonna say that he
committed the crime with branden

1014
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,738
in exchange
for a lesser prison sentence.

1015
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:54,438
This is probably
the most damaging evidence

1016
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,048
the state could have.

1017
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,268
Even with
the fingerprint evidence,

1018
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:02,663
it's gonna be hard to walk
branden out of that courtroom.

1019
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,239
Me and the prosecutor
have agreed

1020
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:17,635
that the charge of armed robbery
is gonna be dismissed.

1021
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:20,420
Branden will plead
a robbery by intimidation

1022
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,335
with a cap of five years,

1023
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,382
so he can't get any more than
five years to serve in prison.

1024
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,255
I think him pleading guilty
is the right decision

1025
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:34,173
only because the risk is great.

1026
00:56:34,216 --> 00:56:36,131
You can get life in prison
for armed robbery

1027
00:56:36,175 --> 00:56:37,698
in the state of georgia.

1028
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:40,222
We had a chance at prevailing,

1029
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:43,487
but if the jury believes
that it was--believes cody,

1030
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,578
we--our chance of winning
goes to zero.

1031
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:03,942
- cody was like a brother,
you know?

1032
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:07,424
I've known him
since I was ten years old.

1033
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,469
Life's not fair.

1034
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:13,168
I could either
take the chance

1035
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:16,650
of going to trial
and losing

1036
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:21,438
and having to serve
the whole time,

1037
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,701
or I could take this deal

1038
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:27,879
which is less time
and maybe still get, you know--

1039
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,403
get out
and do what I got to do.

1040
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:45,592
There's--there's nothing--

1041
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:47,594
there's no way around it.

1042
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,466
There's no running from it.

1043
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:52,207
It's just something
you got to handle.

1044
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,471
You got to--you just
got to take care of it.

1045
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:04,132
- when you're a public defender
with clients, you know,

1046
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:07,527
it's--it's--
it's a very close relationship.

1047
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,876
It's you and this other person,

1048
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,706
and you're having
a legalized war,

1049
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,229
you know, with the state,

1050
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,623
and you're, you know,
planning together,

1051
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:17,972
and you're working together,

1052
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:20,584
and you meet their family,
you know.

1053
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:22,629
So losing a case
with a friend

1054
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:26,285
and having that friend cuffed,

1055
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,809
and you might've been able
to do something about it,

1056
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,463
and maybe you didn't do it.

1057
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,638
Maybe you missed something.

1058
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:32,770
And those are the things

1059
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:36,600
that keep rolling around
in your head,

1060
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:37,905
really, forever.

1061
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,559
That's what it's like.

1062
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,126
It's awful.

1063
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:51,049
- today is branden's plea day
and sentencing.

1064
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,572
Even though
we aren't having a trial,

1065
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,748
we're still going to be able
to make an argument

1066
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,794
that branden
should get less time.

1067
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,148
In this case, the amount
of time is very important.

1068
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:06,717
If he gets two years,
which is what we're asking for,

1069
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,980
he will likely go
to a medium security prison

1070
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:11,765
or hopefully
a boot camp program.

1071
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:13,941
If he gets five years,

1072
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:16,857
he'll probably go
to a maximum security prison

1073
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:21,427
where people get sexually
attacked and assaulted.

1074
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,864
You know, it's anal rape prison.
It's the real deal.

1075
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:25,692
It's not a game.
It's not a joke.

1076
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:30,697
Branden,
how are you doing today, man?

1077
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:31,916
- good.

1078
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,747
- we have to go over
the plea petition

1079
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,402
and all the rights
that you give up.

1080
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:41,795
It's branden lee, right?

1081
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,188
- yes, sir.

1082
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:48,976
20?

1083
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,630
How far did you go in school?

1084
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,589
- um, sophomore.

1085
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,681
- you've seen the discovery
and everything.

1086
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,421
You understand what
you're charged with, correct?

1087
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:00,771
- yes, sir.

1088
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:01,815
- all right.

1089
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,251
The sentence you'll get

1090
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:04,688
is solely a matter
for the judge to decide,

1091
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:05,993
especially in our situation.

1092
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:08,605
Do you understand?
- yes.

1093
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:16,656
- and did you commit
the acts as

1094
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,181
- um, I mean,
I was there.

1095
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:24,098
- so when the judge asks you--
the judge is gonna ask you,

1096
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:26,666
"did you commit the offenses
as charged--

1097
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,886
commit the offense as charged?"

1098
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,671
And that'll be either yes or no.

1099
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:42,726
it is something
I got to say yeah to, huh?

1100
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:44,466
- it's not something
you have to say yeah to.

1101
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,687
I can have us answer the plea
to say that

1102
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,820
"although
I'm not admitting guilt,

1103
01:00:49,863 --> 01:00:52,083
"i do recognize
that the evidence is sufficient

1104
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:54,172
to authorize a conviction."

1105
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:55,347
- yes.

1106
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,131
Something like that.

1107
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:02,920
- all right.

1108
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:03,877
Now, you give up
some important rights

1109
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:04,835
when you plead guilty.

1110
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:06,358
I'ma go over those rights.

1111
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:07,838
If you don't understand
any of 'em,

1112
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,274
just stop me
and I'll explain 'em.

1113
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:10,971
You waive
your fourth amendment rights

1114
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:12,843
against illegal
search and seizure.

1115
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,453
By waiving those rights,

1116
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:15,976
you can be searched
by law enforcement

1117
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,152
or your probation officer

1118
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:21,590
at any given time
for no reason at all.

1119
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:23,201
You give up the right
to plead not guilty.

1120
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,724
You give up the right
to have a trial.

1121
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,901
You give up the right to make
the state prove your guilt

1122
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:29,686
beyond a reasonable doubt,

1123
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:32,340
and you give up the right
to appeal your conviction.

1124
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:34,386
Your conviction
may negatively impact

1125
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:37,519
your ability to obtain
or maintain a driver's license,

1126
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,870
obtain or maintain employment,
vote,

1127
01:01:39,913 --> 01:01:41,741
and there may be
other consequences

1128
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,351
which you cannot anticipate.

1129
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:46,441
You understand those rights?
- mm-hmm.

1130
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,530
- and do you still want
to plead guilty?

1131
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,754
Yes?
- yes.

1132
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,974
- all right, today is the...

1133
01:01:57,017 --> 01:02:00,412

the state of georgia versus
branden lee mullin.

1145
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:52,176
The defendant
is entering a plea

1146
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:55,614
to the offense
of robbery by intimidation.

1147
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,095
- all right, mr. williams,

1148
01:03:58,138 --> 01:03:59,574
any evidence
you wish to present?

1149
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,881
Any comments you have
about the sentence?

1150
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:02,926
- yes, sir.

1151
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:04,318
What we would ask
for this court

1152
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:05,798
to sentence mr. mullin to

1153
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,104
is a ten-year sentence

1154
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:09,367
with two years to serve
at the prison work camp.

1155
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:14,067
Our contention at trial would be
that he was not the robber,

1156
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:17,114
and there were several people
at the house--at least four.

1157
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:19,159
The robber was disguised.

1158
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:22,162
We contend that that person
was one of the other guys

1159
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:23,772
that was at the house.

1160
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:27,776
Also branden has taken this time

1161
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,778
since this incident

1162
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:32,259
to improve himself greatly.

1163
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:36,916
Branden is lucky enough to have
encountered people lately

1164
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,744
that care
a great deal about him,

1165
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:40,615
that are interested
in his well-being

1166
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:43,314
and have a vested interest
in his success.

1167
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:46,970
That's not something
he's ever had before in life.

1168
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:50,930
Branden has had
a tough go-around.

1169
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:53,324
Branden has had people

1170
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:56,936
that are supposed to care
the most about you not care.

1171
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,243
Personally,
I can empathize with that,

1172
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:04,378
and it hurts my heart
to understand that this kid,

1173
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:08,382
this child, is potentially gonna
be thrown to the wolves.

1174
01:05:08,426 --> 01:05:14,127
And so we would just ask
the court for grace

1175
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:16,042
in the sentence
that the court renders.

1176
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:26,139
- all right.

1177
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,141
Mr. mullin,

1178
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:30,143
you got to understand

1179
01:05:30,187 --> 01:05:32,537
sort of where this all sits.

1180
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,367
I have heard
about your history,

1181
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,760
and I empathize with you
about that.

1182
01:05:38,804 --> 01:05:42,851
It sounds like you've had
a rough go of it here,

1183
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:47,204
and perhaps points out some
of the failings of the system

1184
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:50,337
regarding our children

1185
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:54,037
that are in foster care
and that sort of thing.

1186
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,344
But you also have to understand

1187
01:05:57,388 --> 01:06:00,391
that somewhere along the lines

1188
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:03,611
when you start putting
other folks at risk,

1189
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:08,573
then the scales
start to change,

1190
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:11,924
and holding a knife
to someone's throat,

1191
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,100
that just can't be tolerated
by our society.

1192
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,797
Our society has to be protected

1193
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,451
from folks who would do
those things.

1194
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:19,845
And I do believe
that you have potential.

1195
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:24,458
I mean, you appear to be
a smart kid, smart guy.

1196
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,199
You got folks
that are supporting you,

1197
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:30,421
and they have built trust in you
and given you opportunities,

1198
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:33,990
and you've proved yourself
worthy of those opportunities.

1199
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:35,252
So I hope you understand

1200
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:39,169
this is not a condemnation
of you personally,

1201
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,954
but it's a condemnation
of your actions.

1202
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:48,004
It appears that the state has
given you a tremendous break,

1203
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,919
because the mandatory minimum
sentence for armed robbery

1204
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:52,269
is ten years in prison,

1205
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:56,142
and the evidence would point
towards supporting

1206
01:06:56,186 --> 01:06:58,971
an armed robbery charge.

1207
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,104
But they've reduced it
to robbery by intimidation

1208
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:04,107
and essentially cut
the sentence in half,

1209
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:07,545
and so the sentence
on count one

1210
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:10,461
is gonna be ten years with
five years to serve in custody,

1211
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:12,811
the remainder to be served
on probation.

1212
01:07:12,854 --> 01:07:16,119
But I'm gonna remand you
to custody this year.

1213
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:17,990
- thank you.

1214
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:36,269
- love you.

1215
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:51,023
♪

1216
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:02,121
- he is eligible for parole.
- yeah.

1217
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:03,992
- that's not five years
to serve.

1218
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:06,125
- it's--it's five years
to serve,

1219
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,127
but he's parole eligible.

1220
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,043
He is parole eligible.

1221
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,698
- and the violent crime
that he's gonna serve,

1222
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:14,829
how much of it?

1223
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:16,875
- probably 65% to 90%.

1224
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:18,050
Probably.

1225
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,498
- the whole time
it never felt real to me.

1226
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,065
I grew up with him.

1227
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,806
He was my best friend.
You know what I mean?

1228
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:36,286
Branden may not care
about anybody in the world,

1229
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:39,245
but he loved me.

1230
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:42,640
I still love him
with all my heart.

1231
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,122
And I wanna just...

1232
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:47,210
I can't.

1233
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,037
- that's enough.
Come on.

1234
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:18,284
- I got to do another
guilty plea in a few minutes.

1235
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:19,981
Ain't no different

1236
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:22,288
than what I see
every other day, so...

1237
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:26,858
It all takes a toll on me.

1238
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,294
It's not easy.

1239
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:32,385
I'll never get used
to people going to prison.

1240
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:34,126
I'll never get used to that.

1241
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:56,931
- this case is different from
most others that I've tried,

1242
01:09:56,975 --> 01:10:00,848
because I don't have
any witness statements.

1243
01:10:00,892 --> 01:10:04,504
So I don't know what these
people are gonna testify to.

1244
01:10:04,548 --> 01:10:07,942
I have no idea,
because we're in georgia,

1245
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:11,685
and I don't have the pleasure
of taking depositions,

1246
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:13,557
because money is not at stake,

1247
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,515
because somebody's liberty
is at stake.

1248
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:16,777
So I don't get a deposition.

1249
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:22,305
And because of that,

1250
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,351
it's really kind of difficult

1251
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:28,615
to come up with a solid defense,

1252
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:31,314
'cause it--they could spin it.

1253
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:36,275
Based on
what the police have said,

1254
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,103
my defense is going to be that

1255
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:41,541
the person that they identified
was not mr. wright.

1256
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:43,543
It was just a mistake
in identity.

1257
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,505
Young mr. wright had braces
at the time of this incident.

1258
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,333
There is no mention
by the police

1259
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:53,814
of the victims telling them
that the person had braces.

1260
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,381
They say that they know
for a fact

1261
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:56,991
that it was young mr. wright,

1262
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,863
because they're familiar
with young mr. wright

1263
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:01,735
because he frequents
the pizza parlor.

1264
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:04,347
So they should know
that he was wearing braces,

1265
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,350
and they should know
that he has tattoos

1266
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:10,744
from here down
and from here down to his hands.

1267
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:14,400
Like, he has tattoos
on his hands.

1268
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:20,363
I'm hoping that those braces
are our savior.

1269
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:21,886
I'm hoping.

1270
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:24,062
I have his orthodontist
under subpoena,

1271
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:26,847
and even though
he does not want to come,

1272
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:28,327
so help me god,

1273
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,416
I will drag him into court
kicking and screaming

1274
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,723
in handcuffs

1275
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:36,248
because he is our out

1276
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,510
as far as I can tell.

1277
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,425
Now, again,
they may flip it on me

1278
01:11:39,469 --> 01:11:42,341
and say that the person
had braces all of a sudden,

1279
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,169
and then I'm kind of screwed.

1280
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:46,954
I mean, I don't know what
I would argue at that point.

1281
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:49,217
Hopefully,
they leave that out.

1282
01:11:55,398 --> 01:12:03,580
♪

1283
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:13,720
- all right, you got your ball.

1284
01:12:13,764 --> 01:12:16,506
Bottled water is in the car.

1285
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:18,769
Got your shin guards.

1286
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:27,821
I left
the public defender office.

1287
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:32,826
The main reason was the pay.

1288
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:38,354
I was struggling to take care
of raha and myself.

1289
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,316
All right.

1290
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,449
Have a good game.

1291
01:12:53,543 --> 01:12:56,241
I can remember
writing a check for groceries

1292
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:58,548
knowing that I didn't have
enough money

1293
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:00,376
in my checking account.

1294
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:06,425
More and more,
I was just disgusted.

1295
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:09,515
How dare this system

1296
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:13,563
treat public defenders
like this?

1297
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,739
We matter this much,

1298
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:17,741
that after I get paid
once a month,

1299
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:20,396
I have $20 left to my name?

1300
01:13:23,224 --> 01:13:25,966
I am still in jackson.

1301
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,579
I'm still doing, in my mind,
public defender work.

1302
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:32,364
I still get
court-appointed cases.

1303
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:36,499
I'm still representing
indigent clients.

1304
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:41,504
So though I'm not in a full-time
public defender capacity,

1305
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:44,507
I will forever be
a public defender,

1306
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,639
and it's an honor.

1307
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:55,735
- we always deal with people

1308
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:57,650
in our profession

1309
01:13:57,694 --> 01:14:00,523
who like to bitch and moan about

1310
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:02,568
how tough they had it
getting through law school

1311
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:04,483
and this and that,
but they had it easy.

1312
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,616
Things were handed to 'em.

1313
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,574
Things were there for them.

1314
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:09,836
Travis had none of that.

1315
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,317
Travis came up hard.

1316
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,145
Travis grew up without a father.

1317
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:19,672
He grew up without a mother
that he could rely upon.

1318
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:23,502
Nothing was handed
to this young man.

1319
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:27,506
He struggled his entire life.

1320
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,204
He's a fighter.

1321
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,511
One of the highlights
of travis' career so far

1322
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:35,166
has been the trial
of a man accused of

1323
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:37,298
all sorts of felony obstruction
at the jail.

1324
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:39,823
In that case,
what happened was,

1325
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:42,434
the client ended up
being convicted

1326
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,741
of a misdemeanor affray charge.

1327
01:14:44,784 --> 01:14:47,570
That's a win.
We all know that's a win.

1328
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:49,267
But he didn't stop there.

1329
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:53,489
Travis appealed
the misdemeanor affray charge

1330
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:55,839
and reversed it on appeal

1331
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:58,624
and walked his client scot-free.

1332
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:01,497
That's a public defender,
folks.

1333
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:09,505
So because you are
such a good example,

1334
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:13,552
because you are such
an outstanding illustration

1335
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,598
of what it means
to be a public defender,

1336
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:17,904
we decided that,
travis williams,

1337
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:19,558
you, this year, are

1338
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:21,952
the assistant public defender
of the year.

1339
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:23,475
Come up here and get your award.

1340
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:32,266
- thank you, mr. dunn.
Thank you.

1341
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:38,185
So much of our job goes unsung,

1342
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:41,449
and to have any sort
of recognition

1343
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:44,931
is a true honor.

1344
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:48,239
Just this week, a young client
of mine went away to prison,

1345
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:52,678
and so this award, in some ways,
is bittersweet.

1346
01:15:52,722 --> 01:15:54,462
Every day, my goal is to be

1347
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:56,552
a better man
and a better public defender,

1348
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:58,205
so thank you.

1349
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:15,875
- the stakes are as high
as they could possibly be.

1350
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:17,660
I mean, we have cases
that haunt us.

1351
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,096
This case will haunt me.

1352
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:21,751
If we--if we lose,
it'll haunt me.

1353
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:26,886
He is a kid,

1354
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:30,934
and he's facing a lot of time.

1355
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:32,805
If he's found guilty,

1356
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:35,460
it will break him.

1357
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:39,377
Mentally and emotionally,
he'll be broken.

1358
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,820
I can't fathom--
I cannot fathom

1359
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:49,953
turning around to his mother

1360
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:52,346
after a jury has said guilty,

1361
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,002
and I've told her he's gonna get
ten years at least, at minimum.

1362
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:59,353
She says he's done, like,
a complete 180.

1363
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:00,180
He has a job.

1364
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:02,443
He's working on his g.e.d.

1365
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:06,056
Apparently he has
this girlfriend, so...

1366
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:09,668
I think that
he's been scared straight,

1367
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:13,019
assuming he gets
a not guilty verdict

1368
01:17:13,063 --> 01:17:15,108
and is allowed
to live his life.

1369
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:17,633
And here's hoping
that that's the end result.

1370
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:20,679
And we don't see
happily-ever-afters very much

1372
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:25,118

a happily-ever-after.

1378
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:13,384
Let's bring the jury in.

1379
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:21,087
All right, members
of the jury, good morning.

1380
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:23,655
At this time,
we'll hear opening statements,

1381
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,353
and, uh, miss owens,
the state may proceed.

1382
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:27,790
- ladies and gentlemen,
you're here today

1383
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:31,228
because on december 3, 2010,

1384
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:34,797
this defendant decided to dress

1385
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,886
in dark clothing,

1386
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:39,889
enter into a pizza shop that
he'd visited many times before

1387
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:41,717
with a gun--
the testimony will show

1388
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,197
that it's an automatic weapon--

1389
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,330
and took the money
out of the cash register.

1390
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:50,073
We'll ask that you find
this man, demontes wright,

1391
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:52,423
guilty of all the crimes
alleged in the indictment

1392
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:54,381
which include
aggravated assault,

1393
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:56,079
armed robbery,
and possession of a weapon

1394
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:57,689
during the commission
of a crime.

1395
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,951
Thank you.

1396
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:01,954
- on december 3, 2010,

1397
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:05,784
young mr. wright
was 16 years old.

1398
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:09,483
16.
He was not a man.

1399
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:11,790
He was a boy.

1400
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,139
And on that day,

1401
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:16,099
super crown pizza was robbed.

1402
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:18,536
We don't disagree with that
at all.

1403
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:22,758
It was not young mr. wright
that robbed that store.

1404
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:25,761
Now, let me be very clear.

1405
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:28,676
We don't have to prove
anything in this case.

1406
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,809
We have no burden.

1407
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:33,681
It's the prosecutor's burden.

1408
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:35,553
They have to prove beyond

1409
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:40,732
and to the exclusion
of every reasonable doubt

1410
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,431
that that boy

1411
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,869
committed the crimes
that they've charged him with.

1412
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:48,740
It's a high burden.

1413
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,221
Hold them to that burden.

1414
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:55,138
- the state may call
its first witness.

1415
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:58,141
- the state calls assim sadik.

1416
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:01,622
Can you tell us
what exactly happened?

1417
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,676
- "i was cooking in the back,

1418
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:13,721
"and then I heard some noise,

1419
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:14,940
"so I came in front.

1420
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:17,029
"one man came,

1421
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:19,162
and he was holding a gun."

1422
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:21,947
- what was he doing
with the gun?

1423
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:26,909
- "he was--he had pointed it
to my brother.

1424
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:29,868
He asked for money."

1425
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,870
- are you certain the person
that you saw that night

1426
01:20:31,914 --> 01:20:34,090
is the same person
you see here today?

1427
01:20:39,486 --> 01:20:40,574
- 100%.

1428
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:41,837
- "yes, yes, 100%."

1429
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,882
He is always around our store,

1430
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:45,014
so we always see him.

1431
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:47,451
- thank you.
No further questions.

1432
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,501
- you said that young mr. wright

1433
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:57,417
comes into your pizza parlor
regularly.

1434
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:04,729
yes.

1435
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,209
- we just see his face.

1436
01:21:06,252 --> 01:21:09,995
We don't see admitting in detail
what he has or not.

1437
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:13,956
- okay.
Have you ever seen his arms?

1438
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:16,523
take off the jacket.

1439
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:21,485
- I don't look at people
in that detail.

1440
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:25,054
- you don't look at--you don't
see details with people.

1441
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:28,840
- it's rude to look at people

1442
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,104
if we look at them
in detail like that.

1443
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:34,802
- okay.

1444
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:36,413
I'm sorry.
I wasn't sure I heard you.

1445
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:38,067
So I'm just gonna
repeat it to make sure.

1446
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:40,983
You said that it's rude
to look directly at people--

1447
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:44,943
- it is rude to look at people
in detail like this.

1448
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,423
- okay.

1449
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:49,339
Having seen young mr. wright
so many times,

1450
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:51,036
even though
you don't see detail,

1451
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,170
can you say whether or not
at any time he wore braces?

1452
01:21:59,175 --> 01:22:01,090
- "no, I don't remember."

1453
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:04,049
- no further questions,
your honor.

1454
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:05,790
- the witness may step down.

1455
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:09,054
Members of the jury,
we'll take morning recess now.

1456
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:10,099
Take a 15-minute break,

1457
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:12,492
then we'll resume.

1458
01:22:12,536 --> 01:22:15,104
- I just don't think
it's going very well,

1459
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:16,366
'cause the--the problem is

1460
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:18,368
that they were just so sure
that it was him

1461
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:19,804
even though they're like,

1462
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,980
"we don't pay attention
to detail,

1463
01:22:22,024 --> 01:22:23,982
"and we don't know
what he looked like,

1464
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:25,636
"if he had the tooth,

1465
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,377
'cause we don't pay attention
to that."

1466
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:30,293
jesus, mary, and joseph.

1467
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:33,122
I think it's a good thing

1468
01:22:33,165 --> 01:22:35,080
that they don't pay attention
to detail,

1469
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:38,388
but we better pray
that your doctor's gonna say

1470
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:39,737
that you had those tattoos.

1471
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:44,568
and if he doesn't remember

1472
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:46,222
whether or not you had 'em,

1473
01:22:46,265 --> 01:22:49,007
that's gonna hurt us,

1474
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:52,924
because it'll be like, "oh,
the doctor doesn't remember.

1475
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,928
"then they can't hold
the witnesses to any standard

1476
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,669
if they don't remember."

1477
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:08,026
Hey, where is your investigator?

1478
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,985
She has her phone
going straight to voice mail,

1479
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:13,031
and I'm in the middle of trial.

1480
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:14,511
Can you please get ahold of her

1481
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:17,818
and tell her I need the dentist
to send--to bring along

1482
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:20,299
the picture
that he took of demontes wright

1483
01:23:20,343 --> 01:23:22,388
after he took his braces off?

1484
01:23:22,432 --> 01:23:25,217
I've got to run back into court.

1485
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:29,569
- did you ever learn what type
of weapon was used in this case?

1486
01:23:29,613 --> 01:23:31,702
- yes, ma'am,
a semiautomatic weapon.

1487
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:33,138
- okay.

1488
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:36,837
Can you tell us what exactly
is located in that box?

1489
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:42,843
- it's a .25 auto 50 grain
fmj winchester box.

1490
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:47,109
There's currently 13 bullets
full metal jacket

1491
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:49,154
inside the box.

1492
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:50,590
- you found those bullets,
you say,

1493
01:23:50,634 --> 01:23:52,244
under young mr. wright's bed,
correct?

1494
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:53,854
- that's correct.

1495
01:23:53,898 --> 01:23:55,291
- but you don't know
how they got there.

1496
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:56,857
You don't know
who put 'em there.

1497
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:57,858
- no, ma'am.

1498
01:23:57,902 --> 01:23:59,208
- all automatic weapons

1499
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:01,688
don't take the same bullets,
do they?

1500
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:02,776
- no, ma'am.

1501
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,343
- so you can't say
if those bullets

1502
01:24:04,387 --> 01:24:06,693
go to the gun that was used

1503
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:09,609
in the robbery
at crown plaza pizza?

1504
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:12,134
- I do not have
an exact make and model

1505
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:13,700
of the weapon that was used.

1506
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:16,094
All I have
is a brief description.

1507
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:19,097
- correct.

1508
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:22,274
- okay, you indicated
that you didn't take

1509
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:24,450
any fingerprints
in the store.

1510
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:27,323
- at the time,
there was nothing touched

1511
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,673
that the victims had told me.

1512
01:24:29,716 --> 01:24:33,024
And I assumed
that there was gloves used

1513
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,286
at that time.

1514
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:36,027
- you assumed
that there were gloves used.

1515
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,247
So when you wrote in your report
that gloves were used,

1516
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:39,987
that wasn't something
someone told you;

1517
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:41,250
that was something you assumed.

1518
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:42,947
- that there was
gloves used, yes.

1519
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,035
- okay.

1520
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,558
Do you often assume things

1521
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:47,169
and put them
in your police report?

1522
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:48,213
- no.

1523
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,999
- so this was just
a onetime thing.

1524
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,176
Do you usually put things
in your police report--

1525
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:55,612
- no, ma'am.

1526
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:57,657
- no further questions,
your honor.

1527
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,792
- state actually rests
at this time.

1528
01:25:02,923 --> 01:25:04,664
- you may call
your next witness.

1529
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:08,320
- the defense would call
dr. barry clower.

1530
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:11,454
Are you familiar
with demontes wright?

1531
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:13,195
- uh, yes, ma'am, I am.

1532
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,677
- he was a patient of mine
for 3 1/2 years.

1533
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:20,158
- I sure did.

1534
01:25:20,202 --> 01:25:22,204
- and can you tell me the exact
date that you did that?

1535
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:26,295
- his treatment started
in may of 2007

1536
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:30,429
and concluded
in december of 2010.

1537
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:33,040
- when you put braces on people,

1538
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:34,172
do you take a before picture?

1539
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:35,478
- yes, ma'am.

1540
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:37,306
- do you take pictures
of your patients

1541
01:25:37,349 --> 01:25:39,308
after you've removed
their braces?

1542
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:40,657
- absolutely.

1543
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,225
- is this the picture
that you took

1544
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,748
prior to putting
the braces on?

1545
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:46,532
- yes, ma'am, it sure is.

1546
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:50,319
- and does young mr. wright
have a tattoo in that picture?

1547
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:53,322
- uh, yes, ma'am,
both sides of his neck.

1548
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:57,239
- and is this the picture
that you took after

1549
01:25:57,282 --> 01:26:00,503
you removed the braces
on december 6, 2010?

1550
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:01,895
- yes, ma'am, it is.

1551
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,549
- and does he have tattoos
in that picture?

1552
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:05,203
- yes, ma'am.
- okay.

1553
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:07,597
I have no further questions,
your honor.

1554
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,251
- no questions from the state.

1555
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,427
- all right, we'll hear closing
arguments at this time.

1556
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:14,212
The state has the right
to open and conclude.

1557
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:16,214
- thank you, your honor.

1558
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:17,389
Ladies and gentlemen,

1559
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:18,825
the defense
would like you to believe

1560
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:20,262
this is more complicated
than it is.

1561
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:22,133
This is an open-and-shut case.

1562
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:25,397
Atif and assim knew who entered
into their store.

1563
01:26:25,441 --> 01:26:27,269
They know him.

1564
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:28,748
It's this man,
demontes wright.

1565
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:31,098
There was a lot of fuss about,

1566
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:33,579
"oh, these guys don't remember
this, that, and the other."

1567
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,842
Well, let's talk about
what they do remember.

1568
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:39,063
They remember that this man
entered into their store,

1569
01:26:39,106 --> 01:26:42,501
that throughout
the whole entire incident,

1570
01:26:42,545 --> 01:26:48,028
this man had a automatic handgun
in their face,

1571
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:50,509
terrifying them.

1572
01:26:50,553 --> 01:26:52,729
They sat here today

1573
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:56,254
and said, a whole year later
and a new look,

1574
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:58,604
"that man, demontes wright,

1575
01:26:58,648 --> 01:27:02,260
"is the one who entered my store
on december 3rd,

1576
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:03,522
"stole money from me,

1577
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:06,221
"put a gun to my head,

1578
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:09,180
"and waved a gun at my brother

1579
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,138
and took my money."

1580
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:12,401
Ladies and gentlemen,

1581
01:27:12,444 --> 01:27:13,619
I submit to you
that we have in fact

1582
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:16,448
proved our case
beyond a reasonable doubt,

1583
01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:19,930
and I ask you to find
this defendant,

1584
01:27:19,973 --> 01:27:22,019
demontes wright,

1585
01:27:22,062 --> 01:27:25,152
guilty of all the crimes
in the indictment:

1586
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:26,502
two counts of armed robbery,

1587
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:28,286
two counts
of aggravated assault,

1588
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:29,853
and two counts
of possession of a weapon

1589
01:27:29,896 --> 01:27:31,289
during the commission
of a crime.

1590
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:32,812
Thank you.

1591
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:38,644
- I want you to think of
the criminal justice system

1592
01:27:38,688 --> 01:27:41,647
as a really long road, okay?

1593
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:45,347
And at the beginning
of that road is a charge,

1594
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,697
where they charge someone
with a crime.

1595
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:52,179
At the end of that road
is a conviction.

1596
01:27:52,223 --> 01:27:56,271
Now, before the state can get
to the end of that road,

1597
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:58,882
before the prosecutors can get
to that conviction,

1598
01:27:58,925 --> 01:28:02,538
they have a big brick wall
in front of 'em.

1599
01:28:02,581 --> 01:28:05,976
That brick wall
is called reasonable doubt.

1600
01:28:06,019 --> 01:28:08,979
Atif sadik
said a number of things.

1601
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:10,415
But it's what he didn't say

1602
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:12,504
that I want you to focus on.

1603
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:13,810
It's what he didn't remember

1604
01:28:13,853 --> 01:28:16,160
that I want you to focus on.

1605
01:28:16,203 --> 01:28:19,468
What I found really interesting

1606
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:21,383
is that he said
that young mr. wright

1607
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:23,559
comes in his store
three to four times a week

1608
01:28:23,602 --> 01:28:25,082
for the last two years.

1609
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:28,215
I was an english major.
My math is terrible.

1610
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:30,348
But from what I gathered,

1611
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:32,350
that's about 342 times

1612
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:34,396
over the course of two years.

1613
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:40,402
But he didn't remember
whether or not

1614
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:43,013
he had braces.

1615
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:46,146
And he didn't remember
whether or not he had tattoos.

1616
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:49,367
I had braces.

1617
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:50,847
They were terribly embarrassing

1618
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,414
because every time
you open your mouth,

1619
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:55,068
the very first thing
that people see

1620
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:57,680
are those braces.

1621
01:28:57,723 --> 01:28:59,769
And when he's coming in
three times a week,

1622
01:28:59,812 --> 01:29:03,381
three to four times a week,
for two years,

1623
01:29:03,425 --> 01:29:06,950
you would know
that he was wearing braces.

1624
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:10,780
And since they say

1625
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:13,260
he didn't always come in
with long sleeves,

1626
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:15,959
they knew that he had tattoos.

1627
01:29:16,002 --> 01:29:18,527
But the person that
they described to the police

1628
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:20,442
did not have braces,

1629
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,531
and he did not have tattoos.

1630
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:27,753
Reasonable doubt.

1631
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,280
We would ask

1632
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:37,502
that you find
the only just verdict

1633
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:39,678
of not guilty.

1634
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,419
- members of the jury,

1635
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:42,768
you may now go to the jury room,

1636
01:29:42,812 --> 01:29:44,204
but do not begin
your deliberations

1637
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,989
until you've received
the indictment,

1638
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:48,165
the evidence,
and the verdict form.

1639
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,645
Thank you.

1640
01:30:20,502 --> 01:30:22,504
- remain seated.
Come to order.

1641
01:30:27,683 --> 01:30:29,685
- would you bring
the jury in, please?

1642
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:43,481
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1643
01:30:43,525 --> 01:30:44,961
- yes, we did.

1644
01:30:45,004 --> 01:30:47,398
- will you read
that verdict to us, please?

1645
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,534
- in the superior court
of clayton county,

1646
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:53,796
state of georgia,

1647
01:30:53,839 --> 01:30:56,451
the state of georgia
versus the defendant,

1648
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:58,670
demontes regary wright,

1649
01:30:58,714 --> 01:31:04,459

1650

verdict, count number one:

1651
01:31:07,157 --> 01:31:08,854
we, the jury,
find the defendant

1652
01:31:08,898 --> 01:31:13,250
not guilty of the offense
of aggravated assault.

1653
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:14,599
Count number two:

1654
01:31:14,643 --> 01:31:16,514
we, the jury,
find the defendant

1655
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:20,779
not guilty of the offense
of armed robbery.

1656
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:22,781
Count number three:

1657
01:31:22,825 --> 01:31:24,696
we, the jury,
find the defendant

1658
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,785
not guilty...
