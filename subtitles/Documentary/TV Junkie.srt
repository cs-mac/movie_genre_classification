1
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:09,274
She's the person I told you about...

2
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:10,474
back then.

3
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:13,604
Then you mean...

4
00:00:14,874 --> 00:00:18,244
she's the person you love?

5
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:19,874
Yes.

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:22,604
The live-in helper...

7
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:25,004
who has a child?

8
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:28,004
Yes, you're right. That's her.

9
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:35,734
Why are you so shocked?

10
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:39,574
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:43,304
Then her husband.

12
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:45,734
Is he dead?

13
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,334
That's what I heard.

14
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,474
I see.

15
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:56,474
Why did you ask about her?

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,550
Sorry. I just blurted out a few questions.

17
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,474
I apologize if I offended you.

18
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,604
No, it's fine.

19
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:11,334
Are you both leaving for Japan together?

20
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,404
No, I'm going alone.

21
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,004
Aren't you two getting married soon?

22
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:19,544
Well...

23
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,734
We aren't able to get married.

24
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:29,234
Some things don't happen
however hard you try.

25
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:45,304
But there is someone I love.

26
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:46,874
Is there?

27
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,234
Will you marry her soon?

28
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,234
I would like to,

29
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:53,804
but it's one-sided at the moment.

30
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:56,134
She doesn't know I like her yet.

31
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,204
I plan to tell her soon.

32
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:04,133
Who's the young lady that you were with?

33
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:07,334
She's the person I told you about...

34
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:08,574
back then.

(CEO Jung Jae Man)

36
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:20,944
Come in.

37
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:23,704
Dad.

38
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:27,004
Se Young. Are you back from class?

39
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:30,274
Yes. Is Jeong Wook out meeting a buyer?

40
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,634
Didn't you see him?

41
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:36,474
He went to Shinchon so
I told him to see you.

42
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:40,404
Did you? I didn't see him.
Maybe I just missed him.

43
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:41,774
Maybe.

44
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:45,404
Dad, about our wedding.

45
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:49,104
Se Young, we'll talk about that at home.

46
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:50,674
I'm working now.

47
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:07,974
Se Young.

48
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:09,934
You're home.

49
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:11,733
Are you going out?

50
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,574
Yes, to the bank.

51
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:17,674
Did you ask Dad about my wedding?

52
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:21,974
I practically begged him yesterday,

53
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,503
but he won't budge. Wait a little longer.

54
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:29,234
How much longer? We've been
engaged for four years.

55
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:33,003
Your dad needs time to think.

56
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,074
What's there to think about?
It's my wedding, not his.

57
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,734
If he won't give permission,

58
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:40,533
I really will leave home.

59
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:43,133
We'll move out and register our marriage.

60
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,704
Will you stop it?

61
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,774
Okay, Se Young.

62
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:50,974
I'll talk to your dad once more.

63
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,604
Don't say that again, okay?

64
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,904
My goodness.

(Daehan Bank)

66
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,734
I can't believe I have...

67
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,534
a bank account in my name.

68
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:11,404
I never thought this day...

69
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:13,834
would ever come.

70
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:16,573
How can you live without an account?

71
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:19,033
I didn't have time to open one.

72
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:21,503
I always lost the money I earned.

73
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:23,474
You can be so silly.

74
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,104
From now on, save up your monthly salary...

75
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:28,834
and don't waste it.

76
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:33,804
Okay. Let's see how it feels to save up.

77
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:39,034
Ever since I met you,

78
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:42,304
I think I was born again.

79
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:44,974
I'm yours now.

80
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:47,974
What's he doing over there?

81
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,033
- I'm your parasol.
- I'm fine.

82
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,203
Your arms will hurt.

83
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,604
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

84
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:58,804
Did that fool just give away his money?

85
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,474
What should I do with him?

86
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:07,904
Man Pyo.

87
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,934
Do you want to talk to me?

88
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,433
You and that Seol Hee woman.

89
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,434
What were you two at the bank for?

90
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,404
Did you give her money?

91
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:22,034
I did not.

92
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:25,934
She said I needed a savings
account if I wanted to save up.

93
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,134
She helped me open one.

94
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:33,073
You fool. Don't you see
she's waiting until...

95
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:36,133
you save up so she can take it?

96
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:39,273
Seol Hee's not that kind of person.

97
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,234
I bet she is.

98
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:45,474
Did she tell you I gave her money?

99
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:49,834
Do you know she took it and
agreed to break up with you?

100
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:51,604
Money?

101
00:05:52,774 --> 00:05:54,004
Do you mean this?

102
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:57,604
Why do you have it?

103
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,404
Seol Hee said you dropped it
when you visited her cafe.

104
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:05,834
My goodness. Did you try to...

105
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,934
pay her off to leave me?

106
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,174
Here, take it.

107
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,404
I didn't touch a bill. It's all there.

108
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,474
Don't doubt Seol Hee.

109
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:24,674
I'm really embarrassed for you now.

110
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,734
How could you do that?

111
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,403
I'm not doing this for me.

112
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:32,173
It's for your sake.

113
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:37,074
Sook Hee, when in my life did
I ever open a bank account?

114
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:41,174
Here. See for yourself.

115
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,704
Thanks to Seol Hee, I own a bank account.

116
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,434
I'm becoming a decent person.

117
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:53,304
Can't you appreciate Seol Hee a little bit?

118
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:05,803
Honey, are you really
trying to torture Se Young?

119
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:10,234
She hasn't been eating. She might faint.

120
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,174
Go and bring her over.

121
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,834
Right now? What for?

122
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,334
What will you say to her?

123
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:22,204
Just go and get her.

124
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,974
Sit down.

125
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:49,934
You two can get married.

126
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:54,934
Do you mean that?

127
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:59,734
Yes. The children always win in the end.

128
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:03,074
Thank you, Dad.

129
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:04,904
Thank you.

130
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:08,904
Se Young, why are you crying?

131
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:12,374
Because I'm happy. I'm so pleased.

132
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,834
What's that look about?

133
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,734
You got permission to marry.
Are you not pleased?

134
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,574
I am.

135
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,004
Thank you, Father.

136
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:33,734
Let's hold the ceremony soon since
that's what Se Young wants.

137
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,774
Call your family.

138
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,304
Yes, I will.

139
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,174
We're getting married at last.

140
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:51,904
It doesn't feel real yet.

141
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:54,674
You're right. It doesn't.

142
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:58,304
Leave all the preparations to me.

143
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,204
You're busy. My mom and I
will take care of things.

144
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,174
Okay. Why did you cry earlier?

145
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,234
I told you. Because I was happy.

146
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:14,034
I was really afraid Dad
wouldn't let us get married...

147
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,604
for a while longer.

148
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,274
Were you in the Shinchon area?

149
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:25,604
Dad said you'd come to see me.
Why didn't you?

150
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:30,204
I couldn't because my meeting ran late.

151
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,434
Did it?

152
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:35,474
Yes. You must be tired.
You should go downstairs.

153
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,104
Okay. Sleep well.

154
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:03,404
Then her husband.

155
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:05,704
Is he dead?

156
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,204
That's what I heard.

157
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,004
Who's he?

158
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:11,674
My son.

159
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,804
You look smart. What's your man?

160
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,034
Ji Hoon.

161
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:31,474
Soo In's son's dad is dead?

162
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,434
(Shinchon Cafe)

163
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,304
Why did you want to see me?

164
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:48,134
I met Chungil's Mr. Kim yesterday.

165
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,874
You and his relationship. I had
no clue even when I saw you...

166
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,304
in Madam Cho's office.

167
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:00,774
I'm not sure you know, but Taesan...

168
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,003
has done business with Chungil for years...

169
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:06,174
and for many reasons the
companies work closely together.

170
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,304
So what?

171
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:12,603
I'd heard that Mr. Kim was
upsetting his grandmother...

172
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:16,534
because he wanted to marry the
live-in helper who had a child.

173
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,580
I just can't believe that woman was you.

174
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,574
How could this be?

175
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:29,534
What is it you want to say?

176
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,774
Se Young thinks you're
married to a rich man.

177
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:34,534
What happened?

178
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,604
She got the wrong idea.

179
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,174
She saw me with Mr. Kim...

180
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:43,204
and assumed that we were married.

181
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,734
Your son.

182
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,674
Who's his dad?

183
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,534
Why do you ask?

184
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,734
Why should I tell you that?

185
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:57,304
Is he...

186
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:00,674
my son?

187
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:05,604
- He isn't.
- Are you sure?

188
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,104
Yes. He isn't yours.

189
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,903
Then tell me who his dad is.

190
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,434
Who's the dad?

191
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:16,334
He's dead.

192
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,974
He's dead? Is that the truth?

193
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,734
Yes.

194
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:25,134
If the child's dad really is dead,

195
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,734
why did you live in hiding for so long?

196
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,910
Why didn't you come to Incheon?

197
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,933
Wasn't that because your son is mine?

198
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:36,034
How many times must I say he isn't yours?

199
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:43,704
I don't think we have a
reason to keep meeting up.

200
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,934
You and I broke up long ago.

201
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:50,904
Don't come here ever again.

202
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,604
If the child's dad really is dead,

203
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,234
why did you live in hiding for so long?

204
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,403
Why didn't you come to Incheon?

205
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:15,304
Wasn't that because your son is mine?

206
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,873
Soo In, where were you?

207
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,734
Who came to see you?

208
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,804
Ms. Baek said she'd never seen him before.

209
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:34,073
It was someone I used to know.

210
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,504
Was it?

211
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,104
Are you okay?

212
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,434
You don't look good. Are you sick?

213
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,274
No, I'm fine.

214
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:48,104
Jung In, I'd like to take Ji Hoon home.

215
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,604
Home?

216
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:51,874
To Incheon?

217
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:53,674
Yes.

218
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:57,403
You're doing the right thing.

219
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,233
Everyone knows about Ji Hoon now.

220
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,074
There's no reason you can't visit.

221
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:08,374
Ji Hoon must be pleased he
gets to visit his relatives.

222
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,004
You should go now.

223
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:12,774
I will.

224
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:36,404
Find out about Soo In and her child.

225
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:41,274
She was born in 1953. When
was she married and to whom?

226
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,104
I want to know everything.

227
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,604
As soon as possible.

228
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,403
Really? She's bringing Ji Hoon to visit?

229
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:03,974
Okay, okay.

230
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:07,434
Soo In's visiting home?

231
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:11,003
Yes, today, with her son.

232
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:14,874
That's great news. How long
has it been since she left?

233
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:16,733
Four years?

234
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:18,533
Yes, something like that.

235
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,833
I'd been missing my grandson
and was thinking of...

236
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,334
visiting Seoul. I'm glad they're visiting.

237
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,373
Mr. Bang. Can I leave early today?

238
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:30,704
Of course you can. Go and
welcome your grandson.

239
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:34,903
Don't worry about the store.
Go and enjoy the boy's antics.

240
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:36,834
I will. Thank you.

241
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:43,974
10 receipts each for 10,000 equals 100,000.
Please check.

242
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,474
It's all there. I checked.

243
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,334
Did you get the money?

244
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,974
Yes. Thank you so much
for your help, Mr. Jung.

245
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:12,574
Well done.

246
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,474
I was afraid he'd suspect something.

247
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:20,304
It all worked out because you
have an amicable relationship.

248
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,374
He's in no position to suspect anyone.

249
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:26,904
He needs to grab onto whatever
lifesaver he can find.

250
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,274
I guess so.

251
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:31,874
I'm glad we're off to a good start.

252
00:16:32,174 --> 00:16:34,534
Our next target is Director Jung.

253
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,374
Madam Cho filled the board
with people she trusts.

254
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,474
It won't be easy to find a weakness.

255
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,974
If I can't find one, I'll make one.

256
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:50,374
That's the way. I trust you will do well.

257
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:53,274
Do whatever it takes to set something up.

258
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,104
Yes, sir.

259
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,304
This is the budget for the Japan office.

260
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,774
Tell me what you think.

261
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,474
Okay, I will.

262
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:11,434
You haven't been back for long
and you calculated the budget?

263
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,004
You're really quick.

264
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:18,773
Once the office opens,

265
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:23,204
we'll have to live apart for a few years.

266
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,604
I don't quite like the idea.

267
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:27,834
I won't be away too long.

268
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:31,204
Once the office is up on track,

269
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:33,304
I can leave someone else in charge.

270
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:36,043
I promise I'll visit you often.

271
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:40,904
I see. I said something I
shouldn't have and upset you.

272
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:42,934
It's okay.

273
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,474
We both get off work early.

274
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,934
How about we have dinner at home together?

275
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:53,234
I was planning just that.
We can go home together.

276
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:58,074
Good. It's been a while since
we left work together.

277
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,174
Did you pass the budget to Madam Cho?

278
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,544
Yes, I just did.

279
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,203
Mr. Jang.

280
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,604
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:17,974
I thought about how I'd decided to
take you to Japan to work with me.

282
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:21,604
I think I should take Mr. Han instead.

283
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,504
He can help me open the new office.

284
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,374
What do you mean?

285
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,704
Did I do something wrong?

286
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,474
No. I'm just worried about Grandma.

287
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:37,474
She'll be alone once I leave.

288
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:41,704
I'd like you to look after her.

289
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:45,704
Right. I understand what you mean.

290
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,434
I won't be able to fill your empty place,

291
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:54,274
but I will do my best to
care for her and her health.

292
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,304
Don't worry, sir.

293
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,974
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

294
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,933
There's so much shopping to do.

295
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,703
- Isn't there?
- You silly thing.

296
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,603
Why did you have to rush things?

297
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,373
There's barely enough time...

298
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:12,404
to get our head around what we must do.

299
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:14,573
Don't you get sick of saying that?

300
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:18,173
Can't we enjoy doing
what we must do anyway?

301
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,804
You always know what to say.

302
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:25,573
I'll drop by to see Hee Ja.

303
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:26,934
You head home first.

304
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:28,433
Why do you want to see her?

305
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,703
She recently married off her daughter.

306
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,473
She'll know which stores to go to.

307
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,504
- See you later.
- Okay.

308
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:49,834
Mom, where is your house?

309
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:53,303
It's just up ahead. Why? Do your legs hurt?

310
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:54,734
No, I'm okay.

311
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:58,104
Then let's go. We're almost there.

312
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,774
"Mom"?

313
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:08,004
Is that little boy her son?

314
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,404
She should be here by now.

315
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,234
I should have gone to pick them up.

316
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:25,404
No. She's visiting for
the first time in years.

317
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,274
Instead of treating her like a visitor,

318
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:31,574
we should let her find her own way back.

319
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:33,904
I see what you mean.

320
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:38,373
Seeing that Soo In decided
to bring Ji Hoon over...

321
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:40,604
makes me think she made up her mind.

322
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:44,204
Right. It can't have been easy.

323
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,734
I think she's very determined.

324
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:53,204
I was actually more
worried about Dong Chul.

325
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:56,273
I thought he might ban
Soo In and Ji Hoon...

326
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:59,374
for fear of what the neighbors would think.

327
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:01,774
I wonder why he hasn't made a peep.

328
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,850
I think it's because of Ji Hoon.

329
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:09,974
He doesn't show it, but he adores Ji Hoon.

330
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:13,544
Why wouldn't he? Ji Hoon's
his first grandson.

331
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,673
Hello.

332
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,203
- Welcome.
- You're here at last.

333
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:21,074
We were wondering where you were.

334
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:23,134
Hello, Ji Hoon.

335
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,404
Hello.

336
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,704
- Are you well?
- Yes.

337
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,104
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

338
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,674
Okay. I'd like to go out after that.

339
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,904
Where do you want to go?

340
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:38,104
To Mom's grave.

341
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:40,333
Oh, of course.

342
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:43,304
I'll look after Ji Hoon while you're gone.

343
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,050
Okay.

344
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:48,673
You haven't been in a while
because you were busy here.

345
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,274
Go and visit Soon Ok with Soo In.

346
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:53,834
Okay, I'll do that.

347
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,474
Se Young. Se Young.

348
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,374
What's wrong?

349
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:12,404
Do you know who I just saw?

350
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:15,873
What's this about? Who did you see?

351
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:18,274
Tell me the truth.

352
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:21,104
Did you know that Soo In has a child?

353
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,450
Who told you that?

354
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,234
Did you know already?

355
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:27,703
Who told you?

356
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:31,674
No one did. I just saw
them with my two eyes.

357
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:34,674
What? Where did you see them?

358
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:37,010
In the street after we parted.

359
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,304
She's visiting with her son.

360
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:42,903
What? Soo In's in Incheon? Is that true?

361
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,603
Now talk to me straight.

362
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:49,034
Why didn't you tell me Soo In had a child?

363
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,374
It's not important.

364
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:53,434
Why isn't it important?

365
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,350
You'd been acting strangely.

366
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,573
You yelled at Jeong Wook...

367
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,774
and wanted to rush the wedding.

368
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:02,903
Isn't that all because of Soo In?

369
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,674
It's not. What are you talking about?

370
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:09,933
Are you sure? Does it really
have nothing to do with Soo In?

371
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:11,473
It doesn't.

372
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:15,274
Then tell me who's the father of her child?

373
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,103
I told you that Soo In's
married to a rich man.

374
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:21,803
Are you sure that man fathered her child?

375
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,604
How many times must I say yes?

376
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:36,574
I need to check for myself.

377
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:37,934
This won't do.

378
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,674
You're so good at drawing.

379
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,704
Who is this?

380
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:47,234
Mr. Kim.

381
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,534
Mr. Kim?

382
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:52,534
Do you mean Seon Woo?

383
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,173
Yes. I want to see him,

384
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:58,534
but he won't come to see
me so I'm drawing him.

385
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,234
- Ms. Hong.
- Hello.

386
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:08,734
What are you doing here?

387
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:14,204
I came out to do some shopping
and dropped by for some soup.

388
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,574
Who's this little boy?

389
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,134
Hello.

390
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,904
Hello there.

391
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:29,304
Grandma, I'll draw Mom now.

392
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,004
Okay.

393
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:37,404
"Grandma"? Do you have a grandson already?

394
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:42,274
Is this Soo In's child?

395
00:24:42,574 --> 00:24:43,574
Yes.

396
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:47,004
Is she married?

397
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,374
Yes.

398
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:54,133
Why did she get married so secretively?

399
00:24:54,134 --> 00:24:55,874
I had no idea.

400
00:24:56,604 --> 00:25:00,704
Is Soo In visiting you?

401
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,034
Yes. For a short while.

402
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:09,604
Did her husband come with her?

403
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:11,674
No.

404
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:17,734
The boy's quite big. How old is he?

405
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:23,203
Hey, how old are you?

406
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:25,833
Ji Hoon! Ji Hoon.

407
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,003
You're early.

408
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:30,134
I came straight over here to see Ji Hoon.

409
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:33,434
Look who's here.

410
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,574
You're Taesan's Ms. Hong.

411
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:38,674
Are you here to have some soup?

412
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,534
Well... Yes.

413
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:45,873
Honey, can you take Ji Hoon home?

414
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:49,073
I'm having trouble serving
customers with him around.

415
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,534
Okay then.

416
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:53,603
Ji Hoon, let's go home with Grandpa.

417
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:56,504
Come along now.

418
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:09,473
Jeong Wook. Jeong Wook.

419
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:11,704
What's the matter, Mother?

420
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,534
Are you... Are you...

421
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:16,734
What?

422
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:22,204
Never mind. Is my husband in?

423
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,904
No, he left to see a buyer.

424
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:26,834
Did he?

425
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:30,374
Did you have something to say to me?

426
00:26:31,734 --> 00:26:35,734
No, no. You can get back to work.

427
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:50,104
The small stars are sparkling everywhere.

428
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,473
In the eastern sky.

429
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:54,273
You're such a good singer.

430
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:58,250
In the western sky.

431
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:02,403
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

432
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:05,903
How I wonder what you are.

433
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,473
Well done. I'm proud of you.

434
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:10,403
Sit on my lap.

435
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:13,074
You must be tired. Put him down.

436
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:17,704
I'm not tired at all. He's
as light as a feather.

437
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,333
Ji Hoon, do you like sitting on my lap?

438
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,334
Yes.

439
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:25,174
How come you answer like such a big boy?

440
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:30,104
I told your mom already.

441
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,734
Instead of suffering alone in Seoul,

442
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:35,174
why don't you come home to Incheon?

443
00:27:36,374 --> 00:27:40,203
Honey, leave that to her to decide.

444
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:43,003
She can relax with her family around...

445
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:46,104
and we get to see Ji Hoon's
antics all the time.

446
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,604
I only just started working...

447
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,704
and agreed to live with Jung In.

448
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:53,574
I think I should stay in
Seoul a while longer.

449
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,004
I'll think about moving back after that.

450
00:27:57,574 --> 00:28:00,633
Okay. People already know what happened.

451
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:05,574
Don't worry about the gossip.
Come back whenever you want to.

452
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:07,504
I will.

453
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,074
Hello?

454
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,574
Hi, Se Young.

455
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:25,434
What are you up to?

456
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,574
What do you mean?

457
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:31,104
What are you doing in
Incheon with your son?

458
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,004
Am I not allowed to be here?

459
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:37,274
This is my hometown and
my family lives here.

460
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:39,104
Why can't I visit?

461
00:28:39,274 --> 00:28:42,804
You never came here once.
Why are you here now?

462
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:46,304
I know what you're worried about.

463
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:51,204
Don't you think it's better
if I were to visit often?

464
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:57,534
The more I hide, the more people will talk.

465
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:01,733
I'm going to bring Ji Hoon
to Incheon when I want...

466
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,304
and see my family.

467
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:08,974
Uncle Dae Bong told me
you're getting married.

468
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:12,904
There will be no problems
once you're married.

469
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:17,174
Stop worrying about us
and focus on living...

470
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:19,104
a happy life with Jeong Wook.

471
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,504
We'll get on with ours.

472
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,304
(Incheon Cafe)

473
00:29:29,104 --> 00:29:30,274
Soo In.

474
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:39,004
Like you said, I hope we never have to...

475
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,534
see each other again.

476
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:44,474
Right. That's what I want.

477
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:06,474
Jeong Wook.

478
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:12,273
I met Soo In for a chat because she
came to Incheon after so long.

479
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:13,574
I see.

480
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:18,704
We'll head home first. See you.

481
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:41,504
He's so sweet.

482
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,804
I can't get enough of him.
He's my own grandson.

483
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:50,604
There's a reason they
say "apple of my eye".

484
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:54,904
I don't think I can do without him now.

485
00:30:56,434 --> 00:31:00,204
Seeing you love Ji Hoon so much...

486
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,703
makes me feel so happy.

487
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:07,074
Why wouldn't I love my grandson?

488
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:13,534
I've been thinking about something.

489
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:18,574
How about we register Ji
Hoon as Dal Ja's son?

490
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:20,704
As if he's adopted?

491
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:24,504
Yes. Right now he doesn't exist on paper.

492
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:28,704
That might be the best
for Soo In and Ji Hoon.

493
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:35,574
I'm not sure. I think we should
ask Dae Bong and Dal Ja first.

494
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:38,334
We don't know what Soo In will say either.

495
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:41,574
It's not an easy decision to make.

496
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:44,333
Dal Ja can't have children.

497
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,504
If she were to adopt him on paper,

498
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:50,374
it might make her feel better
and Soo In benefits too.

499
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:54,004
Let's give it some more time.

500
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:56,404
Okay.

501
00:31:57,104 --> 00:32:01,304
Soo In's spending quite a
long time with her friend.

502
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,003
I'll wait for her outside.

503
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,174
Okay.

504
00:32:28,174 --> 00:32:29,433
Why are you out here?

505
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:32,204
Because you were so late.

506
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:36,474
What did Se Young want to talk about?

507
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:40,904
She just wanted to catch up.

508
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:43,004
Did she?

509
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:46,804
Was it not about anything else?

510
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,434
No. Where's Ji Hoon?

511
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,174
He's sleeping in our room.

512
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:55,704
You must be tired. Go to bed.

513
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:57,974
I will.

514
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:08,974
What do you want to say?

515
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:12,834
Why did you see Soo In?

516
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,174
Why do you think? She's my friend.

517
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,974
Can't friends meet up?

518
00:33:18,274 --> 00:33:21,534
"Friends"? You know what I'm talking about.

519
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:23,534
Why did you meet up?

520
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:25,574
Why do you care?

521
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:26,734
Se Young.

522
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:29,403
This is really upsetting me.

523
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:33,074
Do not ask or even care
about Soo In anymore.

524
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:35,104
Not unless you still have feelings for her.

525
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,634
Taesan Noodles.

526
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,734
Do you have something?

527
00:33:55,904 --> 00:34:00,303
Yes. In April of 1973, Yoon
Soo In went to a clinic...

528
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,434
where she was recorded to
be four weeks pregnant.

529
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,104
Is that true?

530
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:10,003
Yes, and in December of the same year,

531
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,004
she had a son at Somang Hospital in Seoul.

532
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:16,334
Okay, thank you.

533
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:34,903
Have you lost your mind?

534
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:37,703
You know that Jeong Wook
and Soo In had a child...

535
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,503
and you still want to marry the man?

536
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:41,804
Mom, please.

537
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:43,950
Se Young!

538
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:45,603
Hello, mister.

539
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:48,080
Why are you here?

540
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:49,903
I wanted to see you.

541
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:53,103
If Mr. Choi knows that Ji Hoon is his son,

542
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:55,903
might he not come back to you?

543
00:34:55,904 --> 00:34:57,203
Give it back.

544
00:34:57,204 --> 00:34:58,573
You don't even have a dad.

545
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,604
Ji Hoon.

546
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:02,004
What? Ji Hoon's missing?
