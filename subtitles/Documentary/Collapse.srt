1
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:37,031
<i>You know, there's been a lot
of talk about Abraham Lincoln.</i>

2
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:39,836
<i>But the president we need today
is not Abraham Lincoln.</i>

3
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,140
<i>The president we need
today is Thomas Jefferson.</i>

4
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:46,841
<i>He said that we needed
a revolution every generation.</i>

5
00:00:46,882 --> 00:00:48,850
<i>Thomas Jefferson said
you have to be ready</i>

6
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:50,749
<i>in order to preserve
the vitality</i>

7
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,617
<i>of your liberty
and your freedom</i>

8
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:55,316
<i>to defend it not by
overthrowing anything else</i>

9
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:57,723
<i>except for what you
have been holding in your head</i>

10
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,523
<i>that may not be
applicable anymore.</i>

11
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:01,824
<i>We've gotten very lazy.</i>

12
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,558
<i>We're many generations overdue</i>

13
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,429
<i>for a revolution
in our thinking.</i>

14
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,435
<i>I'm not talking about
blood and violence;</i>

15
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:10,597
<i>although I'm afraid
that's already happening.</i>

16
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>I'm talking about a revolution</i>

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,605
<i>that's probably
the hardest kind,</i>

18
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:15,735
<i>the kind that takes place
inside the human soul</i>

19
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,438
<i>and the human mind,</i>

20
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,174
<i>to be able
to tear everything down,</i>

21
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:20,579
<i>throw everything out,</i>

22
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,446
<i>and start with a completely
fresh piece of paper</i>

23
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:25,510
<i>and say, "Okay, how do we
solve this problem?"</i>

24
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,301
<i>Can you talk to me
a little bit, like...</i>

25
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>I mean, who are you?</i>

26
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,883
Listen, this is not a plan

27
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,948
that would make sense to anybody
except God.

28
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,359
You know, I gave up trying to
figure that out a long time ago.

29
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,557
I was born into a family
deeply connected

30
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,065
to the U.S.
intelligence community.

31
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,726
My mother had been
a cryptanalyst

32
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:16,204
at the Army Security Agency
and NSA in World War II.

33
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:19,435
Her work product went
to the President Roosevelt

34
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:25,970
and to Secretary of War Stimson
and Cordell Hull at State.

35
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,676
My father was
an Air Force aviator

36
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,912
who went to work
for Martin Marietta

37
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,045
on contracts for the CIA
and the Air Force,

38
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,453
namely the Titan IIIC

39
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,051
which put out the CIA's
Keyhole spy satellites.

40
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:42,154
At age 19 when I was interning
for LAPD,

41
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,596
I was pulled into
the chief's office

42
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,600
because somebody discovered
I had a Q clearance.

43
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:47,192
I didn't know anything about it.

44
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,600
I went home,
and I asked Dad he said,

45
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,332
"Yeah, because you're my son,

46
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:52,499
"and, you know,
they have to do that

47
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,702
because I might leave
my briefcase open."

48
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:57,143
But a Q was a secret
compartmentalized clearance

49
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,170
above top secret.

50
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:04,017
I went through UCLA
as a Republican

51
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,043
who didn't like anything
about the war in Vietnam,

52
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,112
who didn't like anything
about government

53
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,454
with this naive belief that,
you know,

54
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:11,618
you can get inside the system

55
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,525
and change it from the inside.

56
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,801
I became an L.A. policeman,

57
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,860
worked in South Central
Los Angeles in The Jungle,

58
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,700
and the CIA tried unofficially

59
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,603
to recruit me
into an operation

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,505
where they were smuggling drugs
into the country

61
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,908
back in 1976, 1977,

62
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:32,072
and I wouldn't get involved
in that.

63
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:34,081
You know, I thought,
"Well, jeez, this must be

64
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,549
"an isolated incident
of corruption.

65
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:37,847
"This must be something

66
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,945
"that everybody is gonna
want to correct right away.

67
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:41,580
My God."

68
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:43,386
And of course
that was a mistake.

69
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,154
Basically my life disintegrated

70
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:47,855
because I was betrayed
by a woman

71
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,456
who worked for CIA,
who was my fiancée,

72
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,364
and when I said I wouldn't
get involved in drugs,

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,800
she disappeared, and people
started shooting at me,

74
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,327
and then it was
a matter of saving my life,

75
00:03:57,372 --> 00:04:00,933
and the tools which
I acquired to save my life then,

76
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:03,536
which were, you know,
writing letters to congressmen,

77
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:04,840
getting on the record,

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,973
trying to get
newspaper stories written,

79
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:08,880
those were survival skills,

80
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:13,217
but it was also a part
of learning how things worked.

81
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,587
I was a mapmaker if you will,
a cartographer,

82
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,286
going out to try and map
how the world really worked

83
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,523
as opposed to the way
we were told it worked.

84
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:23,861
And the map that we have made

85
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:28,233
has proved so startlingly
accurate over ten years

86
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,261
whether they had to do
with gold prices

87
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:35,800
or geopolitical developments
or economic events.

88
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,072
The only thing that amazes me

89
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:40,775
is the speed with which things
are falling apart,

90
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,043
and that message now

91
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,143
is the single most
important thing in my life.

92
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,414
It's the only thing in my life,

93
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:50,686
well, except for rock and roll
music, good music,

94
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,558
playing with my dog,
and long walks on the beach.

95
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:04,334
Rags, come here.
Rags, come here.

96
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:13,573
I first became focused
on energy issues in late 2001,

97
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:16,345
just maybe a month or two
after 9/11.

98
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,579
I was contacted by a geologist,

99
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,418
a brilliant guy named
Dale Allen Pfeiffer,

100
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,754
who introduced me to the concept
of peak oil

101
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,657
and the basic issues
about energy

102
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:26,922
and helped me to realize

103
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:30,261
that there was a great deal
of evidence in 2001,

104
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,596
not only that peak oil
was very real

105
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,694
but that government agencies
were acting

106
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,103
and responding
as if it was very real.

107
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,971
All plastic is oil.

108
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:50,417
Most paints, all pesticides
are made from oil.

109
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:56,516
Everything from toothpaste to
tooth brushes is made from oil.

110
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:59,550
There are seven gallons of oil
in every tire.

111
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:03,428
There is nothing anywhere
in any combination

112
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:07,868
that will replace the edifice
built by fossil fuels.

113
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,767
Nothing.

114
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,470
Peak oil is probably now
very easy to explain,

115
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,446
much easier
than it was a long time ago.

116
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:24,282
People have felt what
$147 a barrel oil feels like.

117
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:29,953
Essentially peak oil is like if
you know what a bell curve is.

118
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,720
Goes up, comes down.

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,489
Peak oil is the point
of oil production

120
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,462
when you're at the top
of the bell curve.

121
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,829
And essentially
what that means is,

122
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:41,859
you've used up
half of the resource.

123
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,996
In the case of oil or
any other substance like that,

124
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,735
no matter how much money
you throw at it,

125
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:49,039
you're never going
to be able to increase

126
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:52,171
oil production above
where it was at peak.

127
00:06:56,985 --> 00:07:00,284
As of 2008, the International
Energy Agency has admitted

128
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:04,382
that there is a global 9%
decline rate in oil production.

129
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:08,157
That's the equivalent of
about 8 million barrels a day.

130
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:11,563
There is no way, having plucked
all the low-hanging fruit

131
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,464
and found the big reservoirs

132
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:17,904
that we are gonna able
to offset a 9% decline rate.

133
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,267
From a detective's standpoint,

134
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,475
if you are trying
to assemble a case, you know,

135
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,211
the multidimensional aspects
of a case...

136
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,843
means, motive, opportunity...

137
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:36,914
to understand what kind of force
drives events,

138
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,054
peak oil was almost
with the stroke

139
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:43,257
of, like,
a diamond cutter's knife

140
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,493
the single piece which started
to make

141
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,502
everything resonate
and make sense together.

142
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,666
<i>An economy
that runs on petroleum,</i>

143
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,199
<i>some 20 million barrels of it
a day.</i>

144
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:59,008
You will recall that when the
Bush administration took office

145
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,743
in January of 2001,

146
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:05,014
a National Energy
Policy Development Group,

147
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,418
the NEPDG, was formed

148
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,048
and placed under
the exclusive, private,

149
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,924
absolute control
of Vice President Dick Cheney.

150
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,360
Its records were kept a secret,

151
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:16,295
its minutes were kept a secret,

152
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:19,664
seven pages were released
as a result of two lawsuits,

153
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,432
and it clearly shows that that
task force was looking saying,

154
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:24,733
"How much oil is there?

155
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,638
Where is it?
Who owns it?"

156
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,403
They knew that this was coming
for a long time.

157
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:30,673
It has been known
that this event,

158
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,976
this collapse,
this crash, was coming.

159
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,003
<i>Who they were,</i>

160
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,345
<i>we can't even get information</i>

161
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,147
<i>as to who was involved
and what they were doing.</i>

162
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,155
First of all, if you think
there might be oil someplace,

163
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:42,850
then what you do is,
you go drill a test well.

164
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,382
Then what you have to do

165
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:46,859
is to take that one well
in the center,

166
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:49,625
and then you drill a series
of appraisal wells

167
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:50,858
around that well

168
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,868
to determine where the oil field
might go.

169
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:55,631
You don't know how much oil
you're gonna get,

170
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,264
how deep it is, what kind of oil
it's gonna to be.

171
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,864
There are many different grades
of oils,

172
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,934
a lot of which
are more expensive to refine.

173
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,172
So all of that has
to do with how long it takes

174
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,408
to make something produce,

175
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,279
how much energy do you get back

176
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,775
for how much energy
you invested.

177
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:15,153
When oil was seeping out
of the ground in Pennsylvania,

178
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,455
you got a return of,
I don't know, 200 to 1.

179
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,654
When you have to go offshore,

180
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,927
to deep water drilling
in 15,000 feet of water

181
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:29,869
and your first well costs
$150 million to build,

182
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,464
all that's energy that's being
invested to get energy,

183
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,270
and the moment you start
burning more energy

184
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,470
to get a barrel of oil out
of the ground than it's worth,

185
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,500
forget about it.

186
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,077
The world's been
thoroughly explored

187
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:42,742
over the last 120 years.

188
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:45,116
There's no major
oil finds left.

189
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:48,452
As a matter of fact,
no field the size of Ghawar,

190
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,218
the largest field
in Saudi Arabia,

191
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,782
has ever been discovered since.

192
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,426
Saudi Arabia has 25%

193
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,830
of the known oil reserves
on the planet.

194
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,596
25%.

195
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,866
Why, if Saudi Arabia has all
these untapped reserves on shore

196
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,806
are they moving heavily
into offshore drilling?

197
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,969
Now, if it's 5, 10, 50 times
more expensive

198
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,842
to drill offshore
than on land,

199
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,541
doesn't that tell you
that Saudi Arabia

200
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:16,209
knows they've got
no more oil to find?

201
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:20,551
It's axiomatic that if
Saudi Arabia has passed its peak

202
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,317
and is in decline,
the whole planet is

203
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:24,621
just because of the size
of the reserves that are there.

204
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:32,127
Iraq is oil
that's not only accessible,

205
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,895
it's right close
to the Persian Gulf,

206
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:35,960
which means it's
a short distance to ships.

207
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:37,130
They can put the pipelines.

208
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,299
They can get that into
the global supply stream

209
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,536
as everything else declines.

210
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,211
And Iraq was all about the oil.

211
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:51,685
A lot of people have admitted
that, and like, duh.

212
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:54,745
11 days after 9/11,
when there was no clear evidence

213
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,019
that Saddam Hussein had anything
to do with 9/11...

214
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:58,286
of course, he didn't...

215
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,727
the plans were started
to invade Iraq, of course.

216
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:06,359
That was the objective,
get control of that oil.

217
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,494
Because Saddam Hussein
had been talking about

218
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,528
pricing his oil in Euros,
taking it away from the dollar.

219
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,596
We got in there.

220
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,902
We restructured everything.

221
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,502
We put in a friendly government
using the U.S. dollar,

222
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:19,604
and we assured
the oil companies

223
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:24,084
their "fair access"
and fair share of Iraqi oil.

224
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,747
<i>International oil companies
into Iraqi oil fields</i>

225
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,689
We have no intention
of leaving Iraq.

226
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,352
We're never gonna
leave Iraq.

227
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:35,021
Going back to 2004,
we started building the largest,

228
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:38,294
most permanent military bases,
three of them, in the world,

229
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,268
plus the largest embassy
compound that's ever been built.

230
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:44,396
We built an embassy compound
in Baghdad

231
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:47,101
that's bigger than Vatican City.

232
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:51,805
That's not a temporary deal.

233
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,438
Nobody is gonna take
that oil.

234
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:56,917
We are sitting on it.

235
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:01,388
But there is not enough oil
in Iraq to change anything.

236
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:04,414
Iraq probably has around
90 billion barrels

237
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,517
of recoverable oil.

238
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,551
That sounds like a lot of oil.

239
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:10,155
But when you consider that in
2008 the world was consuming

240
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,756
85 million barrels a day,

241
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,164
that means
a billion barrels of oil

242
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,828
only last for about 111/2 days,

243
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,166
so that ain't that much oil.

244
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:17,762
<i>That's only the first
of the good things</i>

245
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,171
<i>that will come to Iraq,
thanks to oil.</i>

246
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,905
They knew exactly
what was coming.

247
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,040
That's what's in
the National Energy Policy

248
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,414
Development Group report
that's been classified,

249
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:32,749
because if that report
were declassified,

250
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:36,154
we would be building scaffolds
to hang Dick Cheney

251
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,124
and everybody in that
administration tomorrow.

252
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:45,429
Let's assume
just for the sake of discussion

253
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,993
that there's 600 billion barrels
in the Arctic.

254
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:52,598
First of all, it happens
to be under the polar ice cap.

255
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,073
That's a problem.

256
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:56,941
The polar ice cap happens to be
on, what, 10,000,

257
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,606
15,000 feet water.

258
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,775
The problem with the polar ice
cap is, it floats; it moves.

259
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:04,910
So you can't drill a well
on Tuesday

260
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,716
and expect it to be in
the same place on Thursday.

261
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:11,748
That's why a lot of conservative
think tanks and oil companies

262
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:16,196
are cheering the melting
of the polar ice caps.

263
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,256
<i>Developing this tiny section
of ANWR,</i>

264
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,291
<i>could eventually yield up
to a million...</i>

265
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,859
If there is oil in ANWR

266
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:25,634
there's no more than about
a six-month supply

267
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,107
for the entire United States.

268
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,576
There are no pipelines
across a thousand miles

269
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,841
of tundra that's melting due
to global warming,

270
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,280
which means you can't sink pipes
to support

271
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:38,615
a pipeline in tundra
that's turned to mud.

272
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,713
There's no tanker routes,
the wells aren't drilled,

273
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:47,695
and yet we are spending our
future as if that oil is there.

274
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:53,393
We got to drop all this lying
right now.

275
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,629
We don't need transparency
about anything

276
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,662
other than about
how much oil is really left,

277
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,173
because we don't know.

278
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,766
Oil is a commodity;
it's an asset.

279
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,970
You make loans based upon
what's in the ground,

280
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,876
so you have all these
accounting terms:

281
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,381
possible reserves,
proven reserves,

282
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,281
ultimately recoverable reserves,

283
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:12,843
verified reserves, estimated...

284
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,549
But actual reserve estimates
are state secrets.

285
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,081
The Saudis don't dare announce
that they've passed

286
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,218
their peak of oil production.

287
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,249
Why?

288
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,819
They have a very
restive population

289
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:24,889
that have been sold
an expectation

290
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,695
of a rising standard of living,

291
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,225
and the moment Saudi Arabia
acknowledges it's past peak,

292
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,067
it may well have a revolution.

293
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:34,199
Now, what happens if there's
a revolution in Saudi Arabia

294
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,301
with 25% of the world's
known oil?

295
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,073
Where is that oil going
to get replaced from?

296
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,842
It can't be.

297
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:41,906
Very complex problem.

298
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,917
It's a very complex situation.

299
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,783
<i>Just start working now,
otherwise we won't have time.</i>

300
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,919
<i>We're gonna be out
of oil within a few years.</i>

301
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,362
<i>In doing this sort of pulling
archival footage for this film,</i>

302
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:01,334
<i>I found at least ten examples
of people in the late '70s</i>

303
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:03,269
<i>talking about,
this is the end of oil.</i>

304
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,670
<i>This is, like,
end of a way of life,</i>

305
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:06,934
<i>we are hitting a new era.</i>

306
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,965
<i>This situation is destined
to continue.</i>

307
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,568
<i>People look at that footage,</i>

308
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,944
<i>and I think they can feel
that it's somewhat alarmist,</i>

309
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,778
<i>given that we were able
to continue</i>

310
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,650
<i>our way of life
for another 30, 35 years.</i>

311
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:23,418
<i>Do you see any parallels
between that time and now?</i>

312
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:33,029
The '70s was really
a critical decade.

313
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,934
In the '70s,
Marion King Hubbard,

314
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,871
the original prophet
of peak oil,

315
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:41,704
in late 1949 he did the math

316
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:46,008
and said U.S. domestic oil
production will peak in 1970.

317
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:49,847
So that's not some feat
of Nostradamus

318
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,909
communicating with some entity.

319
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,615
It's math; it's science;
it's simple.

320
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:58,284
But in the '70s, M. King Hubbard
testified before Congress.

321
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,157
That was 1974.

322
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:03,220
In 1976,
President Jimmy Carter said,

323
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:07,098
"Man, we cannot use as much
energy as we have been using."

324
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,567
<i>To use energy
more efficiently.</i>

325
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,002
That's when solar panels
went up.

326
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,664
That's when he start... he knew.

327
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,401
They have known in Washington.

328
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:14,738
I have...

329
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,370
I have published on my website,
as have others,

330
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,711
declassified CIA documents
from 1976

331
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:25,651
showing that CIA was perfectly
aware of peak oil.

332
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,347
In those days, of course,

333
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:30,289
when the situation appeared
to be normal,

334
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,315
when people had jobs,
they had vacations,

335
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,123
they had credit cards,
they had credit lines,

336
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,152
everybody is talking about
growth, growth, growth,

337
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,427
buy, buy, buy,
spend, consume, consume,

338
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,093
and everything seemed
to be working,

339
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:43,365
yeah, we were called alarmists.

340
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,565
We don't live
in that world anymore.

341
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:54,172
<i>Americans were on the way
to owning millions of cars.</i>

342
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:56,843
800 million internal
combustion-powered vehicles

343
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,476
on the planet.

344
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,783
They all run on oil.

345
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:04,257
It takes uncounted barrels
of oil

346
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:07,853
to make those cars and engines
in the first place,

347
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,625
and you cannot plug
any new technology

348
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:13,532
into an internal combustion
powered engine.

349
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,728
With seven gallons of oil
in every tire,

350
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,964
nobody will ever make

351
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:19,939
800 million new
internal combustion anything

352
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,908
because there ain't gonna be
enough oil.

353
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:29,046
Ethanol is an absolute...

354
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,243
joke.

355
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,216
First of all, a very brilliant
scientist, David Pimentel,

356
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,520
took the concept of net energy,

357
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,923
how much energy do you invest

358
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,484
versus how much
do you get in return,

359
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:45,522
and he concluded
about a decade ago, I guess,

360
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,831
that it takes more energy
to make ethanol

361
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:52,202
than you get from burning it,
which is absolute stupidity.

362
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,037
Because you drive the
oil-powered machines, etcetera,

363
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:56,839
you irrigate,
you use the fertilizers,

364
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,846
you're burning all that oil
and natural gas to grow it.

365
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,848
Then you make steam which is...

366
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,543
which is more
hydrocarbon energy,

367
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:04,983
you add more chemicals,

368
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,852
and you come up with ethanol,
which you can put in a car.

369
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:11,790
Now, the Bush administration
had announced a goal

370
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:15,421
of having 15% of all fuel
in the United States

371
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:18,728
made from ethanol, I think,
by the year 2015.

372
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,165
They forgot to tell you that

373
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:23,295
that would take all the arable
land used to grow corn to do it.

374
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,735
Canadian tar sands is an oil.

375
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:34,647
it is a very, very thick,
sticky, obnoxious substance

376
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:36,946
that's mixed in with sand

377
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:41,353
at levels 200, 300, 400,
500 feet in layers

378
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,378
beneath the soil.

379
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:43,822
This is in Alberta.

380
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:48,693
And they literally strip mine
thousands of tons a day.

381
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,027
They put them in these huge,
oil-powered dump trucks

382
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,523
and drive them to a place
where they then wash the sand.

383
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:58,561
They take millions and billions
of gallons of fresh water,

384
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,471
which we're running
out of everywhere,

385
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,443
and they boil it
by burning natural gas.

386
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,742
There is not
a possibility anywhere

387
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,772
that Canadian tar sand's
production

388
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,252
will exceed maybe 3 million,
3.5 million barrels a day.

389
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,513
The first thing
that the uneducated mind

390
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,047
that's in denial says,

391
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,320
"Well, what about hydrogen?

392
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,622
Can't we make electric cars?"

393
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,151
Then I have to bring them back
to the fact

394
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:24,164
that there's seven gallons
of oil in every tire,

395
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,690
that there are thousands
of gallons of oil in every car,

396
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,397
in the plastics, the paints,
the resins, everything.

397
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:31,632
All of that is made by oil.

398
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,299
The oil that's used
to manufacture the car

399
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,036
and ship it around, to heat
the metals, etcetera, etcetera.

400
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:40,206
There will never be 800 million
electric powered vehicles,

401
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:44,183
and electricity is not
an energy source.

402
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:47,244
Electricity is generated
by burning

403
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:50,257
or using some other kind
of energy.

404
00:19:56,931 --> 00:20:01,163
<i>Today freedom and power
are woven together.</i>

405
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:05,195
<i>The invisible battalions
of electric power...</i>

406
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,799
It's clear that electricity

407
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,039
is the key
to industrial civilization

408
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,980
in that it powers
our refrigeration.

409
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:17,575
It runs the water pumps
that pump water out

410
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,178
of the New York subway
system every day.

411
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,553
It allows us
to commute electronically,

412
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,353
charge our cell phone batteries,

413
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:29,021
preserve food,
run operating rooms, etcetera.

414
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:36,200
The subject
of alternative energies.

415
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:44,003
There is no such thing
as clean coal,

416
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,535
and there never ever will be.

417
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,207
Why?

418
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,979
Carbon sequestration
is enormously expensive.

419
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,452
What it says essentially is,
you capture the CO2

420
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:56,149
and any other
greenhouse gases emitted

421
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,953
in the burning of the coal,

422
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:02,224
you exert enormous amounts
of energy to compress it,

423
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:05,892
then you move it over
enormously long distances,

424
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:10,393
and you pump it into some
airtight chamber in the ground

425
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,270
where somebody will figure out
with technology

426
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,104
what to do with
the greenhouse gas in 10,000

427
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,575
or 15,000 thousand years.

428
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,474
Nuclear process
requires something

429
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:22,675
like 10 to 13 years
of incubation

430
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:26,174
to get the permitting done,
all the regulations satisfied,

431
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,552
and the construction
of nuclear power plants

432
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,921
is one of the most
energy-intensive processes

433
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,186
in the world.

434
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,160
The steel, the lead containment,

435
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,721
the enrichment of uranium
is a horribly intensive process.

436
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,733
You just don't throw
a rock of uranium in

437
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,291
and start making nuclear energy.

438
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,324
Can't do that.

439
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,862
The first and obvious
problem with tidal energy is,

440
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:50,605
it has to be generated
or collected near a coastline.

441
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,135
Salt water
is extremely corrosive.

442
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,174
There's an enormous energy cost
in manufacturing the machines.

443
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,686
There are only two
alternative energies

444
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:04,316
which can really have
an immediate impact,

445
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,349
an immediate benefit.

446
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,488
Now, the problem with plans
like enormous wind farms

447
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,900
in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado,

448
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:17,563
the fundamental law
with electricity is,

449
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:21,871
is that it's drawn off
right where it's used first.

450
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,878
Yes, you can transmit
electricity over long distances,

451
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:26,743
but people don't think
about the energy

452
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,042
that goes into transformers,

453
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,209
and how much copper
is in power lines,

454
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,083
and all the maintenance
that has to go to that grid.

455
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,681
So when you see really
ridiculous commercials

456
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:41,855
that say we could have a solar
array 96 miles in the desert,

457
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,556
they don't even think about
the fact

458
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,963
that that electricity is going
to get used in California

459
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,865
before it goes any place else.

460
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:53,835
<i>Just, you know,
if you saw this movie</i>

461
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,774
<i>and you didn't know
who you were,</i>

462
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:57,208
<i>and you wanted...</i>

463
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,109
<i>you were just curious
what your credentials are</i>

464
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:03,879
<i>in terms of understanding
this information.</i>

465
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:12,587
I have a bachelors degree
in political science

466
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:18,087
with honors from UCLA, 1973.

467
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:22,762
Graduate of the Los Angeles
Police Academy, Valedictorian,

468
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,738
class of 1173,

469
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:30,642
was sent to do DEA Narcotics
Enforcement School by LAPD.

470
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:34,273
I have 30 years of experience
as an investigative journalist.

471
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:39,047
I've broken major scandals
that have had national impact.

472
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,112
Of course, I got to know
many members of Congress.

473
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:45,182
I had been trying to testify
for a long time,

474
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,659
and actually I have
never testified in Congress.

475
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,026
I did, at the request of

476
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,860
the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence,

477
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:52,490
submit written testimony,

478
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,262
but after they read
the written testimony

479
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,325
that I was going to submit,

480
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,303
I never got a call to testify.

481
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,804
I have written two books,

482
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,706
one of which is in the
Harvard Business School library.

483
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:05,337
I've lectured at universities
all over the country

484
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,313
and in many countries.

485
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,814
People wonder, you know,

486
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,250
how this guy with
a bachelors degree from UCLA

487
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,480
came to know all this shit.

488
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,820
Well, this comes from 30 years
of learning

489
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,952
how to scan mainstream media
and read it,

490
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:24,794
a way of finding stories
from around the world

491
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,563
that tell you all the things
that are really going on

492
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:32,129
that are not played
on the headlines...

493
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,571
but they're the kind of stories

494
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:38,306
that people who really make
decisions know how to look for...

495
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,337
and then how to connect them,

496
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:43,611
how to place the dots
close enough together

497
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,117
so that they can be connected.

498
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,628
The soil is the place from which

499
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,505
all plant matter
gets its nutrients,

500
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,806
and if you keep sucking
the nutrients out,

501
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,869
the soil is useless.

502
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:16,679
For all of history,
the way the soil was replenished

503
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:20,153
and the nutrients were returned
in some measure to the soil

504
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,382
was that plant matter
was allowed to decay,

505
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:25,550
to compost, to restock the soil.

506
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:27,787
That's why crop rotation
is so important.

507
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,420
You may have one crop
of celery

508
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:32,921
which will suck certain
chemicals out of the soil.

509
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:36,060
Another crop,
wheat or something else,

510
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:38,697
may return those same chemicals
to the soil.

511
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,003
So the soil maintains a balance.

512
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
It's kind of sad,
because we as a species

513
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:52,111
have become so disconnected
from the earth.

514
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,177
We don't have any
real contact with the earth.

515
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,155
We don't have any sense
of its functions,

516
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,658
its feel, its nature,
its seasons, its timing.

517
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,762
First of all, the topsoil
on which food is grown now

518
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,632
is nothing more than a sponge
onto which we pour chemicals

519
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:11,331
that we get from oil
and natural gas,

520
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,032
and without those chemicals...

521
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,041
the soil has been turned
into a junkie;

522
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,704
the soil is worthless.

523
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,645
So when you plant a crop now,

524
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:23,309
what happens is you drive
an oil-powered machine.

525
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,477
Drives along, and it plows.

526
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,283
Then you drive another
oil-powered machine,

527
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:31,018
and it drives along,
and it plants.

528
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:32,582
And then you irrigate.

529
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:33,650
Well, how do you irrigate?

530
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,094
Well, that water is pumped
by pumps

531
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,619
that are powered by electricity.

532
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,291
Where's that electricity
come from?

533
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,461
In the United States,
it's either coal or natural gas.

534
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,163
So next thing you do
is come along,

535
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,432
and you fertilize it.

536
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:49,340
All commercial fertilizers
are made from ammonia,

537
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:54,177
and the feedstock for ammonia
is natural gas.

538
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:56,705
So you have ammonium nitrate
fertilizers

539
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,719
that are then sprayed on
by another oil-powered vehicle.

540
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:02,916
Then the crop dusters come along
that are powered by oil

541
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:07,655
that spray pesticides that are
all made from petroleum.

542
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,958
Then when it's time to harvest
the food, what do you do?

543
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:11,555
You drive another
oil-powered machine,

544
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:12,997
and you harvest it.

545
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,934
You use another oil-powered
machine to drive it to a place

546
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,493
where it's processed.

547
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,528
Then you wrap it up in plastic,
which is oil,

548
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,564
and you put it in
another oil-powered machine,

549
00:27:21,608 --> 00:27:23,633
and you drive it X number
of miles

550
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,338
to a food distribution warehouse

551
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,506
and an oil-powered machine
to your supermarket.

552
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,646
The way food is grown, produced,

553
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,246
and moved around
the world today,

554
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,281
it's an enormous waste
of hydrocarbon energy

555
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,020
which doesn't make sense.

556
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,085
Why do we have strawberries
from Chile?

557
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,892
Why do we have
spinach from China?

558
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:46,024
Why do we ship anchovies
halfway around the world

559
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:50,526
to be packaged in tin cans?

560
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,269
There are ten calories
of hydrocarbon energy

561
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,506
in every calorie
of food consumed

562
00:27:58,545 --> 00:27:59,978
in the industrialized world.

563
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:12,992
Three times in my life

564
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:19,090
I tried to walk away from,
forget about,

565
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,396
the things
that I had seen

566
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:25,371
that were so out of whack,

567
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:29,068
that were so crazy,
that were so wrong.

568
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,010
You know, and that is what
many people urged me to do.

569
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,809
But what inevitably happened
every time

570
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:39,717
I tried to walk away from this
path that I have walked

571
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,277
was that everything else
in my life

572
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,481
would be taken away from me

573
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:45,719
so that this path
was the only thing left.

574
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,125
I had no other choice.

575
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:51,927
And, yeah, anger and resentment
do build up,

576
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:55,526
especially when you see
and document as much corruption,

577
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,797
as much dishonesty,

578
00:28:56,837 --> 00:29:00,500
as much illegality,
as much murder, as much betrayal

579
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:06,069
as I have from people
who pretend to be otherwise.

580
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,307
And I reached a point...

581
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:11,147
it was about 1993
when I first became involved

582
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:14,950
or learned of the murder
of Marine Colonel Jim Sabow

583
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,979
at El Toro Marine Air Station.

584
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:20,118
He was the chief of Air Ops,
and he had caught CIA C130s

585
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,958
flying 2,000 and 3,000 kilos
of cocaine on to his base,

586
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:25,396
and he was suicided.

587
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,457
I crossed my own Rubicon
at that point.

588
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:31,494
There was no turning
back for me,

589
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:33,870
and I knew that wherever
this path was gonna go,

590
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,067
I had to follow it.

591
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:43,649
In the '80s, because I had
some skill as a writer,

592
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:45,674
I started freelance writing.

593
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,981
I got published a few times.

594
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,649
I realized
that I could be a writer.

595
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,855
I wrote about 109 mysterious
deaths or suicides

596
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,228
in the U.S. military
in a very short period of time,

597
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:02,167
and I found that most of those
were connected

598
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,571
to covert operations
in one way or another.

599
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,801
The next real evolution
came in 1996

600
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,936
after my confrontation
with CIA Director Deutch,

601
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,310
John Deutch
at Locke High School.

602
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:17,748
You know, I remember standing up
saying something like,

603
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:20,776
"I am a former Los Angeles
police narcotics detective.

604
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,345
"I worked South Central
Los Angeles,

605
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:23,822
"and I can tell you,
Director Deutch,

606
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,484
"emphatically
and without equivocation

607
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:28,050
"that the agency
has dealt drugs in this country

608
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:29,084
for a long time,"

609
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:31,825
and the room exploded.

610
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,531
I had been saying that CIA
was dealing drugs for 18 years.

611
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,095
I mean, I'd been shot at for it.

612
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,629
I'd been forced out of LAPD.

613
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:41,663
I'd been trashed.

614
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,107
I'd been called crazy.

615
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,134
<i>If, in the course
of the IG's investigations</i>

616
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,645
<i>and Fred Hinson's work,</i>

617
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,138
<i>you come across evidence
of severely criminal activity,</i>

618
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:54,950
<i>will you tell
the American people the truth?</i>

619
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:58,389
<i>We will bring the people
to justice</i>

620
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,722
<i>and make them accountable.</i>

621
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,454
Like so often,
when they promise justice,

622
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:02,484
there isn't any.

623
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,429
It was whittled
and tweetered down.

624
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:07,228
There were some
very mysterious deaths involved.

625
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,292
Congressmen Julian Dixon,
who was at that meeting,

626
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:13,705
had a very sudden
heart attack...

627
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,073
which led to the publishing of
the first issue of my newsletter

628
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,510
<i>in May of 1998,
From the Wilderness.</i>

629
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:23,209
I sat down
and wrote a few pages out,

630
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,581
like, eight pages I think.

631
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:27,109
I mailed it to 68 names,

632
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:28,746
and over the next
81/2 years,

633
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:31,814
<i>From the Wilderness grew
to have</i>

634
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:36,557
as many as 60 members
of Congress as subscribers,

635
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,791
professors at universities
around the world,

636
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,801
government officials.

637
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:44,099
One of my first exposés
after CIA and drugs

638
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:46,503
was that I proved CNN
was absolutely lying

639
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,067
in something called
the Tailwind Scandal of 1998

640
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,907
where CNN had
correctly reported...

641
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,810
their producer April Oliver
had reported

642
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,645
that CIA had used sarin gas
in Laos

643
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:57,672
during the Vietnam War,

644
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:59,116
and Henry Kissinger
authorized it.

645
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:02,280
<i>Four different A-1
pilots who dropped the gas.</i>

646
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,313
<i>In spite of
what the Pentagon said.</i>

647
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,257
CNN, you know, rolled over.

648
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,487
Henry Kissinger called.

649
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:11,793
Oliver was fired.

650
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:15,927
Pat Tillman series
that I broke in my newsletter.

651
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:19,427
All seven parts, that was what
broke the Pat Tillman exposé

652
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:23,340
that brought down nine officers
or got them disciplined.

653
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,903
<i>The government violated
its most basic responsibility.</i>

654
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,212
But my
economic predictions then,

655
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,239
we had it so right.

656
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,115
<i>The problems are several-fold</i>

657
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:34,848
<i>behind the economic crash
that is coming</i>

658
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:38,824
<i>that will be nothing
like we have ever seen before.</i>

659
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:43,852
In 2006, we said,
"Get out of debt right now.

660
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:45,387
"Check your mortgage carefully,

661
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,957
"especially if you have
an A.R.M.

662
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,263
"Get into gold.

663
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,964
"Reduce debt
as much as possible.

664
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,200
"Stay away from any kind
of financing

665
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,640
and heavy credit card."

666
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:57,700
We issued a whole series
of warnings.

667
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,371
<i>How many people have ever heard
of the fact</i>

668
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,778
<i>that they're trading pools
of mortgage-backed securities?</i>

669
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,443
<i>Like mutual funds,
but it's all mortgages.</i>

670
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,180
<i>Those books are as cooked
as the books on Enron.</i>

671
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,847
But it was like 11, 12 days

672
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,753
after we issued
that economic alert

673
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,451
in the middle of running
the Tillman series

674
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,426
that our offices
were burglarized.

675
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,929
All seven computers smashed

676
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:19,193
and a whole chain of events
took place up there

677
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:22,861
which was... which actually
worked out okay,

678
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:27,202
because I needed to evolve,
and I have since then.

679
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:35,237
There was a period after,
you know, so many years

680
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:38,342
of deliberate attempts
to sabotage my operations,

681
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,287
four of which we connected in
one way or another to the FBI.

682
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,522
I published that I had retired.

683
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:52,327
I said officially
that I had retired.

684
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:56,267
What I had... and at that point,
given the way I felt,

685
00:33:56,303 --> 00:34:02,469
that was
a pretty honest statement.

686
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,204
I didn't know
that I would bounce back

687
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:06,542
or that there was a third
or a fourth wind

688
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:08,012
to come inside of me,

689
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:12,849
but that also is the image
that I wanted out there

690
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,285
just to take the heat off me

691
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:17,188
at least until Bush and Cheney
got out of the White House,

692
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,987
because that's where
the heat was coming from.

693
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,290
<i>From them personally?</i>

694
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,729
<i>I mean,
from their administration,</i>

695
00:34:24,764 --> 00:34:26,994
<i>or, you know, the people
that ran the CIA,</i>

696
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,523
<i>that ran the FBI?</i>

697
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,763
<i>Who was that pressure
coming from?</i>

698
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:34,262
I have absolutely no doubt
that Richard Cheney

699
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:38,107
and Donald Rumsfeld took an
intense personal interest in me

700
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:39,771
and what my newsletter
had published

701
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:42,441
for all the years
of the Bush Administration.

702
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:45,883
That's about as specific
as I care to get.

703
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:56,956
There was a guy named
von Clausewitz

704
00:34:56,996 --> 00:34:59,556
who said that war
is a continuation of politics

705
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,726
by other means.

706
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:06,102
Politics is a continuation
of economics by other means.

707
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,939
To understand all of this mess,
you need to understand one term.

708
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,414
It's a big financial term that
is real simple to understand.

709
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,417
It's called a derivative.

710
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:22,945
A derivative is
any financial instrument

711
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,822
which is derived
from the inherent value

712
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,487
of something else
that is tangible.

713
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:31,361
In other words,
an ear of corn has value.

714
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,423
A barrel of oil has value.

715
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,435
If you have a house
and a mortgage, that's fine.

716
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,869
When you start doing
mortgage-backed securities,

717
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:41,339
packaging, and bundling,
that's called a derivative.

718
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,909
As of the start of the collapse,

719
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:51,610
which let's peg
at September of 2008,

720
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,519
there were derivatives
with a notional value,

721
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,546
meaning that if you added up
all the pieces of paper,

722
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,424
were worth $700 trillion.

723
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:03,452
In other words,
if they all cashed out at once,

724
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,726
you would need to have
$700 trillion in cash,

725
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:07,528
and of course,
there isn't that much money.

726
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:15,229
So with all of these hedges and
derivatives and puts and calls,

727
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:16,333
those are all derivatives,

728
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:18,503
and all these other things
they do,

729
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:20,843
all they cared about was making
the minimum monthly payment

730
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,040
on the credit card bill.

731
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:25,278
In other words, to service
the $700 trillion

732
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,479
in notional-valued derivatives,

733
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,920
they had to pay a certain amount
of cash every month,

734
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,685
and God forbid they should
all come due.

735
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:33,783
What's happening
with all of these bailouts,

736
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,523
which are now around
$11 trillion

737
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:39,396
if you add up
all the U.S. bailouts,

738
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:43,391
they're chasing a $700 trillion
derivatives bubble

739
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:46,166
down the drain.

740
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:04,687
The people who have run
the monetary paradigm,

741
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:07,784
the economic paradigm,
since money was first invented

742
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:09,260
have wanted to mystify it

743
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,785
and to make everybody believe

744
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,924
that only some expert could
understand the mumbo jumbo

745
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,527
of the priesthood of money.

746
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,730
Three things only anybody
needs to know

747
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,898
about the way money works
around the world today.

748
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,567
One: fiat currency.

749
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:23,598
What is money?

750
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:30,239
If I were to take a bill
out of my wallet,

751
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:33,343
and I reach in my wallet,
and I pull out this bill,

752
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,819
it's $20.

753
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:36,446
Wow. Okay.

754
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,013
Can I eat it?

755
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:39,251
Can I roll it up and chew it?

756
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,055
Do I get calories and vitamins?

757
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,220
No, I don't.

758
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,093
Can I crumple it up,

759
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,529
throw it in my gas tank?

760
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:46,896
Is the car gonna go anywhere?

761
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,697
No, it's gonna clog
the fuel injectors, maybe.

762
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,670
This is only a symbol.

763
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,365
This doesn't mean anything.

764
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:54,395
It's fiat.

765
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,702
It's created out of thin air

766
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:57,733
because somebody turned on
a printing press.

767
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:01,406
That's all it is.

768
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:05,315
Before the great growth
of population

769
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,911
which occurred
with the advent of oil

770
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,185
came this revolution in
the monetary system as well.

771
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,919
There was a time
when the pound sterling

772
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,326
actually meant
a pound of sterling silver.

773
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,330
There was only so much silver
out of the ground.

774
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,353
It was tangible.

775
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,661
You couldn't print silver.

776
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,397
It was something real.

777
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,667
You cannot print any more money

778
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,834
than there is energy
to back it up.

779
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,867
That simple.

780
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:36,814
So we have fiat currency.

781
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,841
Then we have something called
fractional reserve banking.

782
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:46,389
If you were to bring me
a $10 deposit,

783
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:50,123
I could make $90 worth of loans

784
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,495
based on just having
that $10 in my drawer,

785
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:54,762
because it's all calculated
on the premise

786
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,234
that not everybody's
gonna come in

787
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,429
and want their cash all at once.

788
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,495
That's called a run on the bank.

789
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,632
So they have calculated
the odds,

790
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:05,405
much as Vegas odds makers do,
and said,

791
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:07,913
"Okay, well, you know,
there are very little odds

792
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:10,643
under normal conditions."

793
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:17,418
When I lend now a total of $100
based on that $10 deposit,

794
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:21,655
that's more money
that I create out of thin air.

795
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:24,390
Well, gee, that means
that in order to pay off,

796
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,558
whoever gets that money
has to make more money still

797
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,500
to feed in at the bottom
to pay the bank

798
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,561
so that the bank
can create still more money.

799
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:37,969
You know, I think it's probably
pretty safe

800
00:39:38,011 --> 00:39:40,411
at this point in time with the
collapse of the U.S. economy

801
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,914
to say that pretty much
everybody is understanding

802
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,042
how compound interest works.

803
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,848
The higher the interest rate
on your credit card,

804
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:51,584
for those people who had 20%,
25% cards,

805
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:53,990
that means they are creating
that much more money

806
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:57,895
if they don't pay cash
every month.

807
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,833
What I have just described
is a pyramid scheme.

808
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,032
We live in
an infinite-growth paradigm

809
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,869
which requires growth forever.

810
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,808
It's not that Bernie Madoff
was a pyramid scheme

811
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:13,869
or Stanford was
a pyramid scheme.

812
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,279
The whole economy
is a pyramid scheme.

813
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:19,284
The whole global economy
cannot be sustained.

814
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:21,946
It requires infinite growth.

815
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:25,981
But infinite growth collides
with finite energy.

816
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,492
First law of thermodynamics,

817
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:29,927
energy can neither be created
nor destroyed.

818
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:31,122
The second law:

819
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,325
energy converts
in only one direction:

820
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:35,561
from usable to unusable.

821
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,966
That's called
the law of entropy.

822
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:38,129
Things break down.

823
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,639
And in every energy transaction,

824
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:43,301
some energy is always lost.

825
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:44,809
So you have finite energy

826
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:46,812
and you have
a financial paradigm

827
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:48,473
which demands infinite growth,

828
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,641
and we are at the point
of human history

829
00:40:50,683 --> 00:40:53,413
where the infinite growth
paradigm collides with something

830
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,648
that is more powerful
than money is.

831
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:11,931
By 2006, I knew that
the collapse was very imminent,

832
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,405
that there would be a major
implosion of the U.S. economy.

833
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,635
I actually missed it
by about a year,

834
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:17,665
maybe a little bit more.

835
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,143
I thought it was
gonna happen sooner,

836
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,941
but it happened.

837
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,914
And now that it is happening,

838
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,712
these pieces are falling exactly

839
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:27,811
as if everything else
we had written, said, done...

840
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:28,980
all the peak oil activists,

841
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:33,515
all the sustainability
advocates...

842
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,857
our map was proving
deadly accurate.

843
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:49,140
Things don't break up;
they break down.

844
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:53,134
When a government collapses,
what happens?

845
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,612
Mail stops getting delivered.

846
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,877
Air traffic controllers
don't get paid,

847
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,281
so they don't go to work,

848
00:41:58,317 --> 00:42:00,649
which means planes don't fly.

849
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:03,746
Bridges and highway inspections
don't get made.

850
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,419
Food and Drug Administration
inspections don't get made.

851
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,724
Maintenance is going
to be defrayed.

852
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:12,890
Law enforcement stops working.

853
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:14,126
I mean, it's no secret now.

854
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,395
You see the headlines every day.

855
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:19,063
California is bankrupt,
Michigan is bankrupt, Ohio.

856
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:22,939
They're shutting down services
left and right.

857
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,307
There are tent cities springing
up all over the country.

858
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,574
There are homeless
displaced people.

859
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:32,016
A great many billionaires,
who we would call the elites,

860
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,680
a great many very, very wealthy
people are getting crashed,

861
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,315
burned, and eaten alive.

862
00:42:38,357 --> 00:42:41,849
What you don't hear is the fact
that, all over the world,

863
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:45,955
economies are collapsing much
faster than the U.S. economy.

864
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:52,031
Britain is an absolute
basket case.

865
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:56,531
There is a curtain of despair
descending

866
00:42:56,576 --> 00:43:01,138
across Eastern Europe.

867
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,045
There's a revolution under way
in Greece.

868
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,379
It's not riots.

869
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,012
It's not civil unrest;
it's a revolution.

870
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:10,147
Drug violence right across
the border in Mexico,

871
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,520
this is all part
of the collapse.

872
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:15,391
Pakistan, Afghanistan,
there's lots of violence.

873
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:18,329
The people who have run
the planet to this point

874
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:22,061
and who are running the planet
now are losing control.

875
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:32,044
Have I ever been called
a conspiracy theorist?

876
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:36,515
Of course I've been called
a conspiracy theorist.

877
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:38,107
But I don't deal
in conspiracy theory.

878
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,516
I deal in conspiracy fact.

879
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,756
Somebody once said to me
a long time ago,

880
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:54,766
and this was probably
back in '84,

881
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,930
"Climb down off the cross,
asshole, we need the lumber!"

882
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:00,666
I am not a Messiah.

883
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:03,334
I am not responsible
for saving anybody.

884
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:07,710
The only person I am
responsible for saving is me.

885
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:12,015
What I see now is the end
of a paradigm

886
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:14,918
that is as cataclysmic
as the asteroid event

887
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:17,821
that killed almost all the life
on the Earth

888
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:19,552
and certainly the dinosaurs.

889
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:23,494
Now, the dinosaurs were
kings of their paradigm,

890
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:25,497
and a paradigm is
what you think about something

891
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:26,964
before you think about it.

892
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,864
Somebody talks about money,

893
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:32,166
and you automatically accept
without thinking

894
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:35,264
that compound interest,
factional reserve banking,

895
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:36,570
and fiat currency is okay,

896
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:37,667
and we have to protect that,

897
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,143
because if we don't
protect that,

898
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:43,274
it's gonna be bad for us.

899
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:45,443
If you know anything
about Darwinism,

900
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:46,917
basically what it said was

901
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:49,945
is that those species
that had evolved

902
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:54,119
or were able to adapt
to changing circumstances

903
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,457
were the ones that survived,

904
00:44:55,494 --> 00:44:56,927
and those that were not equipped

905
00:44:56,963 --> 00:45:00,194
or had been...
become evolutionary dead ends

906
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:02,894
were destined to die.

907
00:45:02,935 --> 00:45:04,402
"Mike, you better be careful.

908
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:08,237
It sounds like you're advocating
Social Darwinism."

909
00:45:08,274 --> 00:45:10,799
I'm not advocating
Social Darwinism.

910
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:13,573
I am witnessing
actual Darwinism.

911
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:20,478
If you are in a camp
with a bunch of campers

912
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,987
and a bear attacks,

913
00:45:23,022 --> 00:45:25,957
you don't have to be faster
than the bear.

914
00:45:25,992 --> 00:45:28,927
You only have to be faster
than the slowest camper.

915
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:40,762
There is one and only one
graph image

916
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:43,240
that I have used

917
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:48,975
in I would guess 60 to 70
lectures in eight countries,

918
00:45:49,015 --> 00:45:51,483
and that's a graph
of human population,

919
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:55,078
and if one looks at that graph,

920
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,919
what you see is human population

921
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:02,951
roughly stable at around
a billion people or so

922
00:46:02,995 --> 00:46:05,156
with maybe a little bit more
at around the time of Christ.

923
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:09,099
Then it stays pretty stable
until we get to the bubonic...

924
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:12,571
it starts to rise some as some
primitive technology emerged,

925
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:14,095
but then you get
to the Bubonic plague.

926
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,732
There's a little dip.

927
00:46:15,775 --> 00:46:17,174
Then after the bubonic plague,

928
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:21,111
you begin the start of what
we would call the Renaissance

929
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:24,446
and the early stages
of the Industrial Revolution,

930
00:46:24,483 --> 00:46:26,974
the discovery of steam.

931
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:30,318
The population starts
to go like this.

932
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:31,448
The introduction of coal,

933
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,515
the population
starts to go like this.

934
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,359
But around 1900, around the turn
of the 20th century,

935
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:40,559
what you see as oil
became ubiquitous

936
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:44,126
was that the population
went like this,

937
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,367
and it goes up
to 6.5 billion people.

938
00:46:47,406 --> 00:46:49,465
We may be at 7 billion people

939
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:53,308
by the time anyone
sees this interview.

940
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:58,180
All of those people exist on
this planet only because of oil.

941
00:46:58,217 --> 00:46:59,548
That's it.

942
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:02,418
So it's axiomatic
that if you take the oil away,

943
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:04,650
the population
must go away also.

944
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,887
In all of science,
in all of biology,

945
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:10,691
there is no case
where any population,

946
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:14,859
be it bacteria in a petri dish
or caribou in an Arctic island,

947
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,698
runs into a set
of favorable circumstances

948
00:47:17,736 --> 00:47:22,673
and goes to that point
without an immediate crash down.

949
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:23,834
It's a law.

950
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:25,309
It's a law
as fundamental as gravity.

951
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,869
It's a law as fundamental
as thermodynamics,

952
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,175
and if one thinks about it,

953
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:32,116
it might also be viewed
as true of the stock market

954
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:33,175
or the financial markets,

955
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,208
which go like this,

956
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:35,345
and when they go like this,

957
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:36,752
they automatically go like this.

958
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,518
That's the history
of every bubble.

959
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:56,230
I think it's a mistake
to ask, "If people,"

960
00:47:56,275 --> 00:48:03,010
and make all people
the same as one entity,

961
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,482
if they will understand it.

962
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:11,047
I don't care
if all people understand it.

963
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,581
When you're faced
with an overwhelming,

964
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,116
life-threatening crisis,

965
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:18,688
as in the Titanic being hit
by an iceberg,

966
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:21,427
and you happen to be aware
before anybody else is

967
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:22,593
that the ship is gonna sink

968
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:24,933
and there aren't
enough lifeboats

969
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,097
and you know
how to build lifeboats

970
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:29,073
and you tried
to deal with that

971
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:32,771
in however long the Titanic
had before it went down,

972
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:36,474
you're likely to run across
three types of passenger

973
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:37,743
on the Titanic.

974
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:39,717
You'll run across a type

975
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:42,448
that's basically
deer in the headlights.

976
00:48:42,488 --> 00:48:44,080
"Ship's been hit?
What does that mean?

977
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:45,522
"What do I do?
I don't know what to do.

978
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:46,547
"I don't where to go.
Should I do that?

979
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:47,581
I don't know."

980
00:48:47,626 --> 00:48:48,615
That's one group.

981
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:51,926
There's another group that says,

982
00:48:51,964 --> 00:48:53,591
"We get that the ship
is gonna sink.

983
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:55,793
"We get that we're all gonna die

984
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,699
"unless we make some lifeboats
and do it fast.

985
00:48:57,736 --> 00:48:59,601
Show us what to do."

986
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:01,230
Then you have a third group
that says,

987
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:02,297
"This is the Titanic.

988
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:04,866
"It's absolutely unsinkable.

989
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,242
"Un-fucking-sinkable.

990
00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:09,076
"So we're going back to the bar
for a drink,

991
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:12,106
and all you doomsday sayers
can actually just take a hike."

992
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:14,278
Now, if you're the one who knows
how to build lifeboats,

993
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,550
which group of people
are you gonna help?

994
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,187
Certain things
are inevitable right now.

995
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:26,494
FDIC insolvency,
I will tell you, is coming.

996
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:29,228
Insolvency of
the Federal Reserve is coming.

997
00:49:29,268 --> 00:49:31,429
Federal Reserve can go bankrupt.

998
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,631
T-bill defaults.

999
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:36,664
We're looking
at major bankruptcy,

1000
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:38,370
starvation, dislocation.

1001
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,277
All these things
are already on the way.

1002
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:46,414
Everything is
gonna break down

1003
00:49:46,452 --> 00:49:49,046
differently in different places.

1004
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:51,181
The best that I can do
is give you some ideas

1005
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:55,387
of some markers
that are gonna come.

1006
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:59,090
The bumpy plateau has been
described by peak oil activists

1007
00:49:59,131 --> 00:50:00,962
and researchers
for many, many years,

1008
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,298
and it's actually happening.

1009
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:08,796
Basically you come up
the growth curve of oil prices,

1010
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:12,834
and the oil prices go up until
you start running out of oil.

1011
00:50:12,878 --> 00:50:15,642
Then what happens is,
you have to destroy demand,

1012
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,512
which is what's happening
with this collapse.

1013
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:20,245
Demand gets destroyed;
the price of oil drops.

1014
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:22,846
But as you start a recovery
you start back up again,

1015
00:50:22,888 --> 00:50:26,346
and you collide again
with the finite oil

1016
00:50:26,392 --> 00:50:27,916
and the rising energy prices,

1017
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,359
which shuts
everything down again.

1018
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:32,228
This is the bumpy plateau.

1019
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:35,097
I think it's fairly certain

1020
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:39,400
that the mortal blow to human
industrialized civilization

1021
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:42,601
will happen
when oil prices spike again

1022
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:45,041
and nobody can afford
to buy that oil,

1023
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:47,511
and everything
will just shut down.

1024
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,681
The collapse must happen fast

1025
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,087
in order to leave
infrastructure standing.

1026
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,523
We have all heard the stories
about infrastructure, you know,

1027
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,892
the sewers and the bridges
and the roads and all that.

1028
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:05,260
Well, the point is,

1029
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:09,757
is that as economic collapse
continues or accelerates,

1030
00:51:09,802 --> 00:51:15,172
those structures will fall
into more and more disrepair.

1031
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:16,572
There's not gonna be
any money

1032
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:18,371
or anything running
to fix those,

1033
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,870
so what you want to have
is the change to a new paradigm,

1034
00:51:22,915 --> 00:51:24,746
getting the old one
out of the way

1035
00:51:24,783 --> 00:51:27,115
while there is still
infrastructure left

1036
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:29,677
to start building something new.

1037
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,691
We have to survive
the transition phase

1038
00:51:35,728 --> 00:51:37,127
of human civilization,

1039
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:41,394
which I anticipate could last
anywhere between 20 years...

1040
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:46,370
and oh, my God,
would that be fast and hard...

1041
00:51:46,405 --> 00:51:48,236
you know, to 50 years
or 100 years

1042
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:52,972
before some kind of stable
civilization starts to emerge.

1043
00:51:53,011 --> 00:51:54,876
You need to survive
the transition phase.

1044
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:56,210
So don't panic.

1045
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:57,977
Don't freak out.

1046
00:51:58,016 --> 00:51:59,847
Use your heads.

1047
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:03,548
Analyze your local situation
where you live,

1048
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:05,557
don't worry about
rebuilding sewers.

1049
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:08,287
You're gonna be able
to get water for a few years.

1050
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:13,661
People say there's either oil
or no oil.

1051
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:16,190
There's either food or no food.

1052
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:17,725
And people say,

1053
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,136
"Well, we're gonna have food
in the supermarkets on Tuesday,

1054
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:21,571
and we're never gonna
see it again."

1055
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,040
That's not the way
it's gonna happen.

1056
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:27,239
As things break down,
we will see specific shortages

1057
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:30,339
in specific areas
for periods of days

1058
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:33,943
before it gets to the point
where there's nothing left.

1059
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:36,580
So what you need to prepare for
is not the end result,

1060
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:38,988
but you need to prepare
to survive the transition.

1061
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:43,918
When people say, "Okay,
I'm gonna run for the hills.

1062
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:45,156
"I'm gonna go build a cabin.

1063
00:52:45,197 --> 00:52:47,495
I'm gonna buy ten million cans
of baked beans."

1064
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,433
Well, they're probably gonna be
the first to die.

1065
00:52:49,468 --> 00:52:51,402
Number one, it's too late.

1066
00:52:51,437 --> 00:52:52,995
If you don't know
how to live off the land,

1067
00:52:53,038 --> 00:52:55,302
and if you're not already
on the land right now,

1068
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,534
don't even try to go,

1069
00:52:56,575 --> 00:52:58,839
because you're gonna
fail miserably,

1070
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,367
and you might be shot
by the people

1071
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:02,039
who got there ahead of you.

1072
00:53:06,652 --> 00:53:07,949
<i>You know, the one factor</i>

1073
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:09,544
<i>that you're not including
in some of this</i>

1074
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:12,716
<i>is just sort of discounting
human ingenuity,</i>

1075
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:17,388
<i>or our ability
to sort of problem solve.</i>

1076
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:23,265
Because my father was an Air
Force aviator combat veteran,

1077
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:26,829
he was very much trained
in a military style

1078
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:28,464
of decision making and analysis

1079
00:53:28,507 --> 00:53:31,635
where it's motivated
by life-and-death decisions,

1080
00:53:31,677 --> 00:53:34,168
where you are trained
how to think critically

1081
00:53:34,213 --> 00:53:36,704
and respond critically
in response to emergency.

1082
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,546
So I was trained at an early age

1083
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:42,349
in the skill
of critical thinking,

1084
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:43,718
and maybe I have a gift
for it too.

1085
00:53:43,755 --> 00:53:45,086
I believe there are some people

1086
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:47,421
who have a gift
for critical thinking.

1087
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:49,222
In my own experience
on the streets

1088
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:51,695
in South Central Los Angeles
as a cop,

1089
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,254
there were quick decisions,

1090
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:59,100
sometimes decisions
which changed people's lives

1091
00:53:59,137 --> 00:54:01,037
or could end people's lives,

1092
00:54:01,073 --> 00:54:04,668
and it gave me an ability
to respond and think

1093
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,144
to separate the ice cream
from the bullshit.

1094
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,807
Probably one of
the biggest impediments

1095
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:11,748
I removed
to critical thinking was,

1096
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:15,082
I stopped taking mainstream
media seriously a long time ago.

1097
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:21,551
<i>We were talking about
human ingenuity.</i>

1098
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:30,564
No amount of technology
and no amount of human ingenuity

1099
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:33,127
can possibly overturn
the laws of physics,

1100
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:36,163
the laws which govern
this planet.

1101
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:39,507
Those are intractable,
immutable, real,

1102
00:54:39,545 --> 00:54:41,376
and science has never
been able to do that.

1103
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:44,109
Man's great arrogance,
I believe,

1104
00:54:44,149 --> 00:54:46,174
and one for which
he is paying a price now

1105
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:48,686
is to believe that mankind
really could become God

1106
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,282
and even turn over and upset
and revoke somehow

1107
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:54,724
the laws of the universe.

1108
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:01,160
I am a great advocate of buying
and owning physical gold,

1109
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:02,427
not paper gold.

1110
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,492
You buy gold, you own it.

1111
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:07,334
When hyperinflation occurs
after deflation here,

1112
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:09,431
and all these trillions
of dollars come back

1113
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,807
and we are wheeling wheelbarrows
of thousand dollar bills

1114
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:15,779
to buy a loaf of bread,

1115
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:18,112
the only thing people
will accept for goods

1116
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,084
is gonna be gold.

1117
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,244
Do whatever you can

1118
00:55:21,286 --> 00:55:23,516
to reinsulate your house
if you need to.

1119
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:25,887
If you have a house,
if you have soil,

1120
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:28,222
you immediately
get it off petrochemicals

1121
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,490
and start learning
how to restore it.

1122
00:55:30,529 --> 00:55:33,293
What I do in the yard
where I am renting,

1123
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:35,197
I'm mixing barbeque
and wood ash

1124
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:36,928
and then I go out
and pee on everything,

1125
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:38,459
because then you get
the root elements

1126
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:42,371
of ammonium-nitrate that
starts to bring the soil back.

1127
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:46,844
If you are dependent upon
a cell phone, get a land line.

1128
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,869
All the
telecommunications companies

1129
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:50,905
that operate the satellites,
the cell towers,

1130
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,382
the fiber optic cables,

1131
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:55,079
and all this stuff that makes
your wonderful cell phone work

1132
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,180
are cutting back on maintenance
as the stock market collapses,

1133
00:55:58,223 --> 00:56:01,556
and we're gonna see failures
in cell phone service.

1134
00:56:01,593 --> 00:56:06,053
A land line is a redundancy
that can help you.

1135
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:10,432
Get books on first aid
and holistic medicine.

1136
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:12,699
Moderate fresh water supply,

1137
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:15,104
a reasonable amount
of food storage.

1138
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,801
You can't store enough
to live on.

1139
00:56:16,842 --> 00:56:19,402
What you need to store is seeds.

1140
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:22,004
Seeds that are not manufactured
by Monsanto,

1141
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:23,378
that are not Frankenseeds,

1142
00:56:23,415 --> 00:56:25,940
that only work one time
you plant them

1143
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:27,611
and then you got to go buy more.

1144
00:56:27,653 --> 00:56:30,486
You get good organic
whole seeds,

1145
00:56:30,522 --> 00:56:32,183
and you store them.

1146
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:35,716
That could be a great
currency in the future.

1147
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:45,292
Unlike the Great Depression,

1148
00:56:45,337 --> 00:56:47,237
this is a vastly
different scenario.

1149
00:56:47,272 --> 00:56:49,866
We do not have infinite
resources left to be tapped.

1150
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:53,742
We don't have lots of land,
we are at peak everything,

1151
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:56,714
all the commodities,
everything else.

1152
00:56:56,748 --> 00:57:01,583
What they had in the 1930s that
my grandparents told me about

1153
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,316
was the ability to grow food
right where they live,

1154
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:06,688
and local food production
is perhaps

1155
00:57:06,725 --> 00:57:09,558
the most fundamental key
to human survival

1156
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:12,722
in the collapse
of industrialized civilization.

1157
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:24,571
We've had examples of what
happens when oil disappears

1158
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:26,236
and how civilizations respond

1159
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:27,802
and what works and what doesn't.

1160
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:30,713
In 1991,
the Soviet Union collapsed,

1161
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:33,274
and there were two nations
that were absolutely

1162
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:36,014
and totally dependent upon
Soviet oil for their survival

1163
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:37,419
because they had none:

1164
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:40,050
Cuba and North Korea.

1165
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:43,755
And what they did in response
to that was completely opposite,

1166
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:46,263
and the proof, as the say,
was in the pudding.

1167
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:54,370
North Korea was a rigid,
hierarchical, top-down,

1168
00:57:54,406 --> 00:57:58,240
Soviet-style,
bureaucratic regime

1169
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,301
where everything came
from the central government.

1170
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:04,372
They managed everything,
and North Korea starved.

1171
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:09,877
I mean, it was... in human terms,
the suffering was amazing.

1172
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:11,286
All of a sudden,
there's no oil.

1173
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:12,347
There's no natural gas.

1174
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,379
There's no fertilizer.

1175
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:14,414
Cars don't run.

1176
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:15,687
Trains don't run.

1177
00:58:15,727 --> 00:58:17,922
You get to a point where
you can run trains on some days

1178
00:58:17,963 --> 00:58:19,590
or generate electricity
on others,

1179
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,394
but you can't do both
at the same time.

1180
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:27,998
But the Cuban government
reverted

1181
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:30,030
to one of the purest forms
of capitalism.

1182
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:33,841
It said, "Everybody start
restoring the soil

1183
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:34,868
"and grow food.

1184
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:36,813
"You will grow food
where you live.

1185
00:58:36,848 --> 00:58:38,941
"If you find any piece
of arable land

1186
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:40,952
"that is not being used,
you occupy it,

1187
00:58:40,986 --> 00:58:42,044
"and you start farming it,

1188
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:44,453
and you start growing food
right now."

1189
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:46,286
The Cuban government
did everything it could

1190
00:58:46,324 --> 00:58:49,452
to liberate local food growing,

1191
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:50,483
and what happened was,

1192
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:52,690
is after a very tough period,

1193
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:57,191
the Cuban people were eating
better than they had ever eaten,

1194
00:58:57,235 --> 00:59:00,432
because they were free of
this whole agri-biz, you know,

1195
00:59:00,472 --> 00:59:02,064
Frankenfood nightmare.

1196
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:03,597
Everything was organic,

1197
00:59:03,642 --> 00:59:06,805
and you had every square inch
in Havana that had soil,

1198
00:59:06,845 --> 00:59:12,078
on rooftops or in flower boxes,
was growing food,

1199
00:59:12,117 --> 00:59:13,948
and there was a degree
of sustainability.

1200
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,612
Everything became organic,

1201
00:59:15,654 --> 00:59:18,623
and all you had to do
was separate the people

1202
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:21,649
from the way money worked
and top-down control,

1203
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:23,627
explain to them,
you grow it where you eat it,

1204
00:59:23,662 --> 00:59:24,651
and you're gonna make it,

1205
00:59:24,696 --> 00:59:26,425
and Cuba survived and thrived.

1206
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:33,763
And that's the essence
of where everything is going to

1207
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,773
in the new human paradigm.

1208
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,798
Everything will be local.

1209
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:46,640
Jack London was one
of my favorite writers,

1210
00:59:46,685 --> 00:59:49,745
and he wrote about animals
a lot.

1211
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:51,346
One thing you know about animals

1212
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:52,788
is that they all want to go home

1213
00:59:52,824 --> 00:59:54,587
when they know that
they're gonna face death.

1214
00:59:54,626 --> 00:59:56,685
They all want to be
in their tribe

1215
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:59,356
or their pack or whatever it is.

1216
00:59:59,397 --> 01:00:00,864
They want to be
on familiar ground.

1217
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:04,198
It's a natural animal instinct.

1218
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:07,865
In Dubai, the economic crash
has hit so hard

1219
01:00:07,906 --> 01:00:11,069
that Indians who were living
and working in Dubai

1220
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:12,508
lost their jobs,

1221
01:00:12,544 --> 01:00:14,774
and they just drove
to the Dubai airport

1222
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:16,508
and abandoned their cars.

1223
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:19,176
There was a story talking about
all the cars that were abandoned

1224
01:00:19,217 --> 01:00:23,119
as these Indians caught a
one-way ticket home to go home.

1225
01:00:23,154 --> 01:00:25,122
It's happening in Britain too.

1226
01:00:25,156 --> 01:00:28,023
You have lots of Poles
and Eastern Europeans,

1227
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,890
who were the latecomers
into E.U.,

1228
01:00:29,928 --> 01:00:31,953
fleeing Britain to go home.

1229
01:00:31,997 --> 01:00:34,966
Now in some areas, and certainly
in the southern California basin

1230
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,663
with 13, 14 million people
and a four-day food supply,

1231
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:41,729
it's clear that people are going
to migrate out of this area,

1232
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:43,206
because it's not sustainable.

1233
01:00:43,241 --> 01:00:45,869
We get most of our water
from Northern California.

1234
01:00:45,911 --> 01:00:49,005
That's a problem.

1235
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:51,607
We get a lot of our electricity
from Hoover Dam

1236
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,844
out in Las Vegas.

1237
01:00:52,884 --> 01:00:54,317
Hmm.

1238
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:57,788
Phoenix, for God's sake,
Las Vegas,

1239
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:00,188
those people have to
worry about where to go,

1240
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:06,960
and community
is what will save us.

1241
01:01:06,998 --> 01:01:08,863
You are gonna have to do it
in conjunction

1242
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,492
with your neighbors
and your family

1243
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:13,060
and the people around you.

1244
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:14,867
You will fail
as a rugged individual.

1245
01:01:14,906 --> 01:01:17,739
You will survive as a member
of a tribe or a family.

1246
01:01:21,646 --> 01:01:22,943
I have emotion about this.

1247
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:25,882
I'm losing it.

1248
01:01:44,202 --> 01:01:47,729
We have waited...

1249
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:52,539
have waited for so long
for somebody to listen to us.

1250
01:01:57,148 --> 01:02:00,049
When the mainstream press
and the government says

1251
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:01,552
nobody could have
predicted this,

1252
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:06,216
they're lying through
their fucking teeth.

1253
01:02:06,257 --> 01:02:09,226
We all saw exactly
what was gonna happen

1254
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,852
and how it was gonna happen

1255
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:13,625
and, remarkably,
when it was gonna happen.

1256
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:15,292
None of us expected the collapse

1257
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,233
to be as severe
as it's proving to be

1258
01:02:17,268 --> 01:02:19,736
or as fast
as it's proving to be.

1259
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:21,295
But we've been screaming
for years,

1260
01:02:21,339 --> 01:02:23,034
and we've been watching
everything we said

1261
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,063
come to pass,

1262
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:29,911
and we have felt so angry.

1263
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,889
I haven't lost
emotional connection to it.

1264
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:51,197
What I have learned to do
over the course of my life

1265
01:02:51,236 --> 01:02:55,366
is to balance the...

1266
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:59,503
the horror with love,

1267
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:04,072
with play,
with making people smile.

1268
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,878
I take my dog out for a walk,

1269
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:09,546
and we count how many smiles
we can inflict

1270
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:10,679
in the course of one walk.

1271
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:12,155
I walk through downtown
Culver City,

1272
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,988
and, you know, I usually
come home, you know, and say,

1273
01:03:15,026 --> 01:03:18,154
"That was 23 smiles
we created today."

1274
01:03:18,196 --> 01:03:20,130
And for some reason
at this moment in time,

1275
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:22,133
that's a very precious
little treat for me.

1276
01:03:27,806 --> 01:03:31,537
There was a psychologist...
psychiatrist,

1277
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:33,510
Elizabeth Kübler Ross,

1278
01:03:33,545 --> 01:03:36,514
who talked about
the five stages of grief,

1279
01:03:36,548 --> 01:03:37,537
and when you're hit with

1280
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:40,881
an overwhelming
life-changing situation.

1281
01:03:40,919 --> 01:03:42,352
The first is denial.

1282
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:43,786
"This can't possibly
be happening.

1283
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:47,280
It's not true;
no, it's not happening."

1284
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:49,987
And you stay in denial,
and you fight to stay in denial.

1285
01:03:50,028 --> 01:03:52,258
Then comes anger.

1286
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:58,463
I really believe that mankind
is now entering just barely...

1287
01:03:58,503 --> 01:04:02,599
it has just barely crossed the
threshold of the anger phase.

1288
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:18,385
We have to get through
the anger phase.

1289
01:04:18,423 --> 01:04:20,618
And how we get through
that anger phase

1290
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:22,683
is going to be critical.

1291
01:04:22,727 --> 01:04:26,390
The way we're going
under current government

1292
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:28,797
and monetary rule,

1293
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,097
the only kind of anger
that's going to be produced

1294
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:33,434
is the destructive kind,

1295
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:37,100
borne of absolute frustration
and bitterness

1296
01:04:37,142 --> 01:04:39,110
that nothing
that's being sold to us

1297
01:04:39,144 --> 01:04:40,236
as being a solution

1298
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:43,907
is making us feel
any goddamn better.

1299
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,347
Then, of course, after that,

1300
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:46,680
you know,
we have the bargaining.

1301
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:49,812
Well, the bargaining
is kind of going on now too.

1302
01:04:49,854 --> 01:04:51,754
"Maybe I could've
done something different.

1303
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,416
"Maybe I should have
thought of this.

1304
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:56,518
Maybe if I do this now,
it won't be different."

1305
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,392
Then you go through
the bargaining,

1306
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:00,454
and you finally get to a place
of depression,

1307
01:05:00,498 --> 01:05:01,988
where it's really starting
to sink in,

1308
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:03,625
and these are all
emotional stages

1309
01:05:03,668 --> 01:05:04,692
that one goes through

1310
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:05,896
whether they're an individual

1311
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:08,462
or a culture
or a civilization.

1312
01:05:08,506 --> 01:05:11,100
And the final stage
is acceptance,

1313
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:12,575
and it's really only when people

1314
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,010
have reached
the point of acceptance

1315
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:17,037
that you can find those people
who are like

1316
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,981
part of the ones
on the Titanic saying,

1317
01:05:19,017 --> 01:05:21,212
"Okay, show us
how to build a lifeboat."

1318
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,420
<i>You know, there's different
ways to look at...</i>

1319
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,187
<i>you can find stories
that support arguments</i>

1320
01:05:29,227 --> 01:05:30,558
<i>that you want to make,</i>

1321
01:05:30,595 --> 01:05:32,460
<i>just because there's
different authors</i>

1322
01:05:32,497 --> 01:05:34,362
<i>that sort of support
your world view,</i>

1323
01:05:34,399 --> 01:05:35,764
<i>and there's other ones
that don't.</i>

1324
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,099
<i>Is it possible to sort
of create a reality</i>

1325
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:42,504
<i>based on picking news stories
that support your world view?</i>

1326
01:05:49,881 --> 01:05:52,509
I don't do debates anymore,

1327
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,450
and the reason why
I don't do debates anymore

1328
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:57,682
is because I don't have to.

1329
01:05:57,722 --> 01:05:59,883
At some point, you have
to acknowledge the fact

1330
01:05:59,924 --> 01:06:01,585
that what I've been
writing about

1331
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:02,820
and what I've been saying

1332
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,294
is actually happening
all around us.

1333
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:08,959
So why do I need
to debate anything?

1334
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,093
Why does the peak oil movement,

1335
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,535
why does
the sustainability movement,

1336
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:15,835
need to debate anything?

1337
01:06:15,873 --> 01:06:17,636
Everything that we said
was gonna happen

1338
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:19,939
is taking place right now.

1339
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:32,946
Every aspect of human existence
is on the table.

1340
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:36,552
As far as political parties go,
they're all anachronisms.

1341
01:06:36,594 --> 01:06:41,554
They're all products
of centuries gone by.

1342
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,466
The human race now
is only going to be concerned

1343
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:45,696
not with an ideology

1344
01:06:45,737 --> 01:06:47,432
but what allows them to survive.

1345
01:06:48,906 --> 01:06:51,966
Capitalism, socialism,
and communism are all terms

1346
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,376
that need to be tossed
in the trash can immediately,

1347
01:06:54,412 --> 01:06:56,346
because all of them were created

1348
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:59,908
on the assumption
of infinite resources.

1349
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:03,443
Not one of those ideologies
that are now dead dinosaurs,

1350
01:07:03,488 --> 01:07:04,955
archaic fossils,

1351
01:07:04,989 --> 01:07:07,389
and no longer relevant
to our way of life,

1352
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:10,485
not one of them recognizes
that there must be a balance

1353
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:15,761
between growth and the resources
and the planet.

1354
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,792
So forget the idea that you can
have as much as you want,

1355
01:07:18,836 --> 01:07:22,203
because until mankind
surrenders to the fact

1356
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,071
that it lives
on a finite planet

1357
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,338
and it must have balance
with that planet,

1358
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:28,504
with the planet's resources,
with the animal life,

1359
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:29,638
and all the other life,

1360
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:32,081
there can be no happiness
for anything.

1361
01:07:32,116 --> 01:07:33,981
Anything.

1362
01:07:34,018 --> 01:07:36,885
It's all about
getting balance back.

1363
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:41,381
And who sold me the idea
that it was my destiny to grow?

1364
01:07:41,426 --> 01:07:42,825
Nothing grows forever.

1365
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,623
There's no such thing
as infinite growth.

1366
01:07:44,662 --> 01:07:46,152
It's not possible.

1367
01:07:46,197 --> 01:07:48,597
Look around at everything you
see around you that's living.

1368
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:50,328
There is a cycle:

1369
01:07:50,368 --> 01:07:54,270
birth, growth, maturation,
decline, and death.

1370
01:07:54,305 --> 01:07:56,364
The challenge being faced
by the human race now

1371
01:07:56,407 --> 01:07:57,567
is either evolve or perish,

1372
01:07:57,608 --> 01:07:58,836
either grow up or die.

1373
01:07:58,876 --> 01:07:59,968
God doesn't care.

1374
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,501
God's not gonna play babysitter
for us.

1375
01:08:01,546 --> 01:08:04,106
The challenge is either
you grow up and mature,

1376
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:05,706
change your minds
and the way you think,

1377
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,615
or you're gonna perish.

1378
01:08:07,652 --> 01:08:09,347
Everything is on the table now.

1379
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:10,615
God is on the table.

1380
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:13,954
Every religion in the world
is on the table now.

1381
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:16,118
They'll all be measured
as standards by,

1382
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,754
"This is reality, and this is
what the religion says,"

1383
01:08:18,796 --> 01:08:19,956
and every religion in the world

1384
01:08:19,997 --> 01:08:22,522
is gonna be under
a huge microscope.

1385
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:24,467
This is gonna be
the greatest age of evolution

1386
01:08:24,502 --> 01:08:26,697
in human thinking
that's ever taken place.

1387
01:08:30,508 --> 01:08:31,770
You walk towards your fear.

1388
01:08:31,809 --> 01:08:33,037
You embrace your fear.

1389
01:08:33,077 --> 01:08:35,568
You don't try to hedge it,

1390
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:38,047
that a part of real living
as a human being,

1391
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:39,344
as a spiritual being,

1392
01:08:39,384 --> 01:08:42,649
is to embrace and encompass
your fear, your love,

1393
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:45,087
and not run away from anything,

1394
01:08:45,123 --> 01:08:47,990
because that's
the life experience,

1395
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:49,754
and it's in that richness

1396
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:52,024
that I think we find
the most beautiful art,

1397
01:08:52,063 --> 01:08:53,496
the most beautiful music.

1398
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:57,228
We find the richness of
what the human soul can offer,

1399
01:08:57,268 --> 01:09:02,604
and I see all that richness
buried under such bullshit.

1400
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:12,447
<i>Can you talk about
your own spirituality?</i>

1401
01:09:12,483 --> 01:09:14,644
<i>You talk about
a lot of different religions.</i>

1402
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:20,624
<i>How do you define
your own spirituality?</i>

1403
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:24,287
I quote a Christian,
St. Timothy,

1404
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:29,789
and I find it to be true
what he said,

1405
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:34,771
that the love of money
is the root of all evil.

1406
01:09:34,806 --> 01:09:38,207
That's the end result of my
spiritual intellectual quest.

1407
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,470
It is the end.

1408
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:42,274
It is the fundamental truth
that I have verified

1409
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:47,580
through three decades of
empirical, investigative, legal,

1410
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:50,712
academic research,

1411
01:09:50,755 --> 01:09:52,848
trying to answer
some fundamental questions

1412
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,654
about human existence
and why we behave the way we do,

1413
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:56,887
why we think the way we do,

1414
01:09:56,928 --> 01:09:58,623
why we act the way we do.

1415
01:09:58,663 --> 01:10:00,631
The love of money
is the root of all evil,

1416
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:01,825
and it is the love of money

1417
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:04,528
which has the potential
to exterminate,

1418
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:08,665
to render extinct
the entire human race.

1419
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:25,581
All right,
so here we have this...

1420
01:10:25,623 --> 01:10:28,615
this likeable,

1421
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:34,256
sincere guy
in the White House,

1422
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:39,235
and he is as imprisoned
as we all are.

1423
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:40,259
I need to cut.

1424
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,965
I need to cut.
I need to cut.

1425
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:45,271
I'm just having a real powerful
wave of emotion right now,

1426
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:48,642
because a whole new realization
is opening to me

1427
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,203
about what I'm actually saying,

1428
01:10:50,248 --> 01:10:52,045
and this is some
serious fucking shit,

1429
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:55,541
so I got to get my head
around it for a second.

1430
01:10:55,586 --> 01:10:57,577
Fuck.

1431
01:11:00,525 --> 01:11:04,859
Okay, I'm ready.

1432
01:11:04,896 --> 01:11:06,227
He is a prisoner of government.

1433
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:07,322
He's a prisoner of politics.

1434
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:08,832
He's a prisoner of economics.

1435
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:11,266
He's a prisoner of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York.

1436
01:11:11,302 --> 01:11:13,099
He's a prisoner
of the Federal Reserve.

1437
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:16,368
He's a prisoner
of a governmental system

1438
01:11:16,407 --> 01:11:19,706
that's archaic
and not quickly responsive,

1439
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:25,239
so we should not make
the success or failure

1440
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:30,687
of human civilization
rest on his shoulders.

1441
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:39,060
The only thing in the world that
you and I can possibly change

1442
01:11:39,096 --> 01:11:41,064
to give ourselves
a chance of survival

1443
01:11:41,098 --> 01:11:42,895
and to give our children
a chance

1444
01:11:42,934 --> 01:11:49,737
at some kind of human
civilized life is our minds.

1445
01:11:49,774 --> 01:11:55,440
You have to believe, not wish,
not hope, not pray, not beg.

1446
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,811
You just have to believe
that there's a way out of it,

1447
01:11:57,848 --> 01:11:59,475
and you're gonna find it.

1448
01:11:59,517 --> 01:12:02,077
This is perhaps
the greatest part

1449
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,518
of the American character is,

1450
01:12:03,554 --> 01:12:04,646
when we get pissed off

1451
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:06,384
and we put our minds
to something

1452
01:12:06,424 --> 01:12:08,324
and we clearly understand
what needs to be done

1453
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:09,587
and we believe in it,

1454
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:11,993
we really can change things.

1455
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:17,695
I plan on living joyfully and
happily for the rest of my life,

1456
01:12:17,735 --> 01:12:19,498
a free man.

1457
01:12:19,537 --> 01:12:21,528
Shit.

1458
01:12:21,572 --> 01:12:24,097
How can you possibly say
there's no hope?

1459
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:27,440
Just change your mind
and see what we see.

1460
01:12:27,478 --> 01:12:29,207
Stop thinking like dinosaurs.

1461
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:35,409
<i>So do you feel that the work
that you do,</i>

1462
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:36,784
<i>you're just gonna do it</i>

1463
01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:38,812
<i>regardless of what the
possible consequences are?</i>

1464
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:42,155
<i>It just would be so much easier
to have walked away.</i>

1465
01:12:46,497 --> 01:12:55,735
If there was a German
in 1932, 1933,

1466
01:12:55,773 --> 01:12:57,900
who had the foresight
to look ahead

1467
01:12:57,942 --> 01:13:00,467
and to see what
the inevitable end result

1468
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:03,207
of the Third Reich would be,

1469
01:13:03,247 --> 01:13:05,477
if there was somebody
who had seen that coming,

1470
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:08,644
do you honestly think that
they could in good conscience

1471
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:10,278
turn around
and walk away from it

1472
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:13,051
and pretend it wasn't there?

1473
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:16,253
When every passing day,

1474
01:13:16,293 --> 01:13:17,954
from the first election
of Adolf Hitler

1475
01:13:17,995 --> 01:13:19,826
as Chancellor in 1933,

1476
01:13:19,864 --> 01:13:23,459
to Kristallnacht,
to the Night of the Long Knives,

1477
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:26,800
to Anschluss,
the occupation of Austria,

1478
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,271
to Sudetenland, Poland,

1479
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:32,036
as all of those things happened
that were right on the map,

1480
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:34,943
how do you think that person
would have felt?

1481
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:39,109
Do you think that person
could have walked away?

1482
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:42,813
We are all collectively
as a species responsible

1483
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:47,756
for what may be the greatest
preventable holocaust

1484
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:50,260
in the history of planet Earth.

1485
01:13:50,294 --> 01:13:53,855
Our own suicide.

1486
01:13:53,898 --> 01:13:57,527
How do you walk away from that?

1487
01:13:57,568 --> 01:14:00,332
How do you sleep at night?

1488
01:14:00,371 --> 01:14:03,431
Who is anybody?

1489
01:14:05,543 --> 01:14:08,808
Who are you to tell me

1490
01:14:08,846 --> 01:14:12,475
it would have been easier
to walk away?

1491
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:14,143
You aren't in my skin.

1492
01:14:14,185 --> 01:14:16,676
It was never easier for me
to walk away

1493
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:19,815
because to walk away
would have meant to compromise.

1494
01:14:19,857 --> 01:14:24,191
To walk away would have meant
selling out.

1495
01:14:28,999 --> 01:14:35,427
You know, I'm still a guy who,
30 years ago,

1496
01:14:35,473 --> 01:14:38,033
approached his government
as a citizen

1497
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:40,635
asking for redress of grievance.

1498
01:14:40,678 --> 01:14:42,111
I caught the CIA dealing drugs.

1499
01:14:42,146 --> 01:14:43,272
It's wrong.

1500
01:14:43,314 --> 01:14:44,781
Somebody needs
to talk about this,

1501
01:14:44,815 --> 01:14:47,511
and I'm still that same guy.

1502
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:50,850
I'm still the 27-year-old
about to be promoted,

1503
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:53,686
perfect record,
perfect rating report,

1504
01:14:53,724 --> 01:14:58,058
LAPD...
dedicated, clean LAPD cop.

1505
01:14:58,095 --> 01:14:59,619
He's still alive in me,

1506
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:03,690
and he very much wants
some answers.

1507
01:15:24,622 --> 01:15:31,687
There is a legend or a fable
that really speaks to my life

1508
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:33,060
about the 100th Monkey.

1509
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:45,601
A long time ago
in the late '40s, early '50s

1510
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,668
when atom bombs and H-bombs
were in vogue

1511
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,874
with above-ground testing,

1512
01:15:50,915 --> 01:15:54,510
we set off an atom bomb
on an atoll in the Pacific,

1513
01:15:54,552 --> 01:15:56,349
and then we waited
a number of years,

1514
01:15:56,387 --> 01:15:58,753
because we wanted
to answer questions like,

1515
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:01,053
"Gee, how soon after we
nuked something

1516
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:04,254
would it be possible to get
any kind of life started again?"

1517
01:16:06,831 --> 01:16:08,321
So they went back
to this island,

1518
01:16:08,365 --> 01:16:11,061
and they decided
to repopulate it with monkeys,

1519
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:13,501
and the monkeys ate coconuts.

1520
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:15,528
Everything was pretty healthy

1521
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:17,871
except for the fact that
the husks of the coconuts

1522
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:22,811
were slightly radioactive.

1523
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:26,681
So the scientists took
ten monkeys or so

1524
01:16:26,717 --> 01:16:29,550
and taught them
to wash the coconuts

1525
01:16:29,587 --> 01:16:33,114
in a fresh water stream
on the island

1526
01:16:33,157 --> 01:16:35,591
before they cracked them open

1527
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:39,562
and turned the whole thing loose
to see what would happen.

1528
01:16:39,597 --> 01:16:40,894
Well, you know, pretty soon,

1529
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:43,798
maybe 12 monkeys out of
a population of 10,000

1530
01:16:43,834 --> 01:16:45,267
were washing their coconuts

1531
01:16:45,302 --> 01:16:48,465
and then 20,
and then 47.

1532
01:16:50,574 --> 01:16:53,407
But a funny thing happened.

1533
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:55,139
As soon as the 100th monkey

1534
01:16:55,179 --> 01:16:56,806
started washing
his coconut husk,

1535
01:16:56,847 --> 01:17:00,180
all 10,000 started
washing simultaneously.

1536
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,789
I guess one way that I have
always looked at my life,

1537
01:17:05,823 --> 01:17:07,757
especially since
I clearly understood

1538
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:13,889
what this issue was
in late 2001 is,

1539
01:17:13,931 --> 01:17:16,399
this is my quest
for the 100th monkey.
