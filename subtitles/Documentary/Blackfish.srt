00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,694
Dispatcher:
Orange County Fire Rescue.

4
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,655
Woman:
6600 Sea Harbor Drive.

5
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:30,907
SeaWorld Stadium.

6
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,701
Dispatcher:
Okay.

7
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,870
Woman: We actually have
a trainer in the water

8
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,872
with one of our whales--

9
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,874
the whale that they're not supposed
to be in the water with.

10
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,876
Dispatcher: Okay.
We'll get somebody en route.

11
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,421
Woman: Okay, through gate #3
to Shamu Stadium.

12
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,588
Dispatcher:
Gate 3.

13
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,014
Dispatcher #2:
Orange County Sheriff's Office.

14
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,933
Man:
We need SO to respond

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,269
for a dead person at SeaWorld.

16
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,189
Uh, a whale has eaten one of the trainers.

17
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,194
Dispatcher #2:
A whale ate one of the trainers?

18
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,738
Man:
That's correct.

19
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:19,909
( Applause )

20
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,716
( instrumental music playing )

21
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,515
Narrator:
Do you believe?

22
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:39,851
My parents first brought me to a SeaWorld park

23
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,060
when I was very young.

24
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,191
From that point forward, I was hooked.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,652
It meant everything to me because

26
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,780
I'd never wanted anything more.

27
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,240
I remember being probably
in first or second grade

28
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,367
watching National Geographic specials

29
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,702
or Mutual of Omaha specials

30
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,121
and seeing whales and seeing dolphins
and as a little kid

31
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,040
just being really incredibly inspired by it.

32
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,750
I never went to SeaWorld.

33
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,502
I grew up in New York,
so I went to the Bronx Zoo.

34
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,921
Grew up on a lake with horses.
We'd swim the horses.

35
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,088
I grew up around the ocean.

36
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,966
I came from the middle of the country
in flatland Kansas.

37
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,134
I'm from Virginia.

38
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,512
Traveled down, did the theme park thing

39
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,389
in Orlando when I was 17

40
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:23,019
and saw the night show at Shamu Stadium.

41
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,022
Very emotional, you know, popular music.

42
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,943
And I was just-- I was very driven
to want to do that.

43
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,614
Kim Ashdown:
Then I saw what the trainers did...

44
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,450
and I said,
"That's what I want to do."

45
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,247
Dean Gomersall:
One of the trainers there, he goes,

46
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,123
"What are you doing out there?
You should be a trainer."

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,500
I go, "I don't know how to train animals.

48
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,876
I've never trained animals
in my life."

49
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,128
How do you prepare yourself for an encounter

50
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,048
with an 8,000-pound Orcinus orca?

51
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,759
Ashdown: I always thought
you needed, like, a master's degree

52
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,469
in marine biology to be a trainer.

53
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:59,889
James Earl Jones: It takes years
of study and experience

54
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,308
to meet the strict requirements necessary

55
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,353
to interact in the water with Shamu.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,522
Ashdown: Come to find out,
it really is more about

57
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,941
your personality and how good you can swim.

58
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,026
I went and tried out, got the job right away.

59
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,778
I'm like, "Yeah!"
So excited, you know.

60
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,905
I was so, so excited.

61
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:18,366
Berg: I really wanted to be there.
I really wanted to do the job.

62
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,994
I couldn't wait to get in the water
with the animals.

63
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,371
I really was proud of being a SeaWorld trainer.

64
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,416
You know, I thought this was
the most amazing job.

65
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,879
I showed up there on my first day,
not really knowing what to expect.

66
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,756
I was told to put on a wetsuit
and get in the water.

67
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,091
Hi, Mom!

68
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:38,344
Oh, I was scared out of my wits.

69
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,263
First of all, I put my wetsuit on backwards

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,308
because I was raised on a farm in Virginia.

71
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,393
- Hi, Dad!
- My first thought

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,646
and memory of that time
was that dolphins are a lot bigger...

73
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:50,815
- ( clicking )
- ...heh, than they look

74
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,400
when you get in the water next to them.

75
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,069
Well, I watched the Sea Lion & Otter Show,

76
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,571
and this guy, Mike Morocco,

77
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:01,576
he comes out during the show
with a dress on as Dorky,

78
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,494
the alter ego of Dorothy--

79
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,831
in a dress with a sea lion,
the Coward Sea Lion, right?

80
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,416
And he's walking along with this little basket,

81
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,294
and I go, "I will never,
ever do that."

82
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,379
You know?
Two months later...

83
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,714
( high voice )
Hi, I'm Dorky!

84
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,674
( laughing )

85
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,885
Walking out onstage with a sea lion.

86
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,853
Ashdown: I was overwhelmed
and I was so excited.

87
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,774
I mean, just seeing a killer whale...

88
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,360
is breathtaking.

89
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,406
John Jett:
I was just in awe.

90
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,992
It's shocking to see how large they are

91
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,327
and how beautiful they are.

92
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,580
Berg: Being in the presence
of the killer whales

93
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,749
was just inspiring and amazing,

94
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,250
and I remember seeing them for the first time,

95
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,170
just not being able to believe
how huge they were.

96
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:59,467
You're there because you want to train
killer whales and that's your goal.

97
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:02,345
Trainers:
Yay!

98
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,013
Berg: I didn't know
it was going to happen,

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,223
so I wasn't expecting it.

100
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,642
And one day they say,
"Okay, Sam, you're ready to go."

101
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,143
Woman:
Come on, you got it.

102
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,646
Berg: "You're going to stand
on the whale.

103
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,107
You're going to dive off the whale.

104
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,526
The whale's going to swim under you
and pick you up again.

105
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,320
And then you're going to do
a perimeter ride around the pool."

106
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,905
Man:
Good!

107
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,282
Keep moving.
Ride him to the slide-out.

108
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,243
( Cheering )

109
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,787
Berg: They just told me
to go do it and I did it.

110
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,123
Wow, I did-- I just rode
a killer whale.

111
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,291
( Cheering and applause )

112
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,460
Woman:
Yay, girly!

113
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,633
When you look into their eyes,
you know somebody is home.

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,968
Somebody's looking back.

115
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:46,014
You form a very personal relationship
with your animal.

116
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,142
There's something absolutely amazing

117
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,104
about working with an animal.

118
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,981
You are a team.

119
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,983
You build a relationship together.

120
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,237
You both understand the goal
and you help each other.

121
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,073
I've been with this whale
since I was 18 years old

122
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,035
and I've seen her have all four of her babies.

123
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,704
- ( Squeaking )
- We've grown up together. Huh?

124
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,456
That's the joy I got out of it.

125
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,459
It's a relationship like I've never had.

126
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,144
Dawn Brancheau: Bro,
I have to know-- are you nervous?

127
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,729
- I'm scared.
-( laughter)

128
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,355
- Ventre: Oh, no.
- Gomersall: Nice hair, Jeff.

129
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:37,815
( laughter)

130
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,901
( cackling )

131
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,278
Did you see anything?

132
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,239
Ventre: Projection for the future
of Jeff Ventre.

133
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,159
Jeff Ventre is going to go over there,
he's going to shine.

134
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,786
- You're going to notice...
- Berg: Dawn.

135
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,954
- Oh, that's Dawn.
- Ventre: Wow.

136
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,123
He's going to be my supervisor one day.

137
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,792
There you go.

138
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,255
Ventre: I knew Dawn
when she was new.

139
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,507
She was a great person to work with

140
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,344
and she obviously blossomed
into one of SeaWorld's best trainers.

141
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,845
This is Dawn Brancheau.

142
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,265
Dawn is the senior trainer
here at Shamu Stadium.

143
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,268
I guess you could say
I kind of knew Dawn in a past life.

144
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,436
Reporter:
It's a tough job, isn't it?

145
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,814
Yeah, we really do go through
a lot of physical exertion.

146
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,316
You can see in the show
we do a lot of deepwater work,

147
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,361
breath holds, very high-energy
behaviors with animals.

148
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,154
Obviously they're giving out
a lot of energy too,

149
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,532
but we're working together
and having a lot of fun as well.

150
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,576
She's beautiful, she's blonde,
she's athletic, she's friendly.

151
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,036
You know, everybody loves Dawn.

152
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,579
And I mean this so sincerely,

153
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:36,082
watching you perform yesterday--
you're amazing.

154
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,667
- Thank you.
- You really are.

155
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,629
Berg: She captured what it means
to be a SeaWorld trainer.

156
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,840
She had so much experience
that it made me realize

157
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,093
what happened to her
really could have happened to anyone.

158
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,934
Revere:
This is Detective Revere

159
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,185
with the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

160
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,813
Today's date is February 24, 2010.

161
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,106
The time is 4:16.

162
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:02,984
In the room with me right now
is a Thomas George Tobin.

163
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,610
- Is that correct?
- Tobin: Correct.

164
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,549
- Revere: So the arm is nowhere...
- Tobin: Right.

165
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,894
Jett: OSHA, on behalf
of the federal government,

166
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,313
is basically suggesting that swimming with orcas

167
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,065
is inherently dangerous
and that you can't completely predict

168
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,736
the outcome when you enter the water
or enter their environment.

169
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:49,113
Dave Duff us:
That's the crux of the OSHA case.

170
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:54,285
Stay out of proximity with the animals
and you won't get killed.

171
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:57,413
It will have a ripple effect
through the whole industry.

172
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,707
This was national headline news.

173
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,375
Martha Sugalski:
SeaWorld's whale performances

174
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,585
may never be the same.

175
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,879
Right now the theme park is arguing in court

176
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,547
to keep whale trainers in the water,

177
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,050
something OSHA says is extremely dangerous.

178
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,761
These are wild animals,
and they are unpredictable

179
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,179
because we don't speak whale.

180
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:14,931
We don't speak whale, we don't speak tiger,

181
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,724
we don't speak monkey.

182
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,684
Sugalski: And tempers flared
between the two sides today

183
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,687
when OSHA's attorney suggested
that SeaWorld only made changes

184
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,024
after trainer Dawn Brancheau's death
outraged the public.

185
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,568
Reporter: OSHA doesn't want
the trainers going back in the water

186
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,863
without a physical barrier
between them and the whales.

187
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,076
Being in close proximity
to these top predators is too dangerous.

188
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,661
Anderson Cooper: They won't then
be getting in the water

189
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,829
riding on the whales, things like that.

190
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,250
If you were in a bathtub for 25 years,
don't you think you'd get

191
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,045
a little irritated, aggravated,
maybe a little psychotic?

192
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,510
The situation with Dawn Brancheau--
it didn't just happen.

193
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,761
It's not a singular event.

194
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:58,808
You have to go back over 20 years
to understand this.

195
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,280
It was a really exciting thing to do

196
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,865
and so everybody wanted to do it.

197
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,326
Interviewer: What were they
telling you you were going to do?

198
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:21,872
Mm, capture orcas.

199
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,333
- Man: Whoo-hoo!
-( plane buzzing )

200
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,751
Howard Garrett:
They had aircraft,

201
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,837
they had spotters, they had speedboats,

202
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,589
they had bombs they were throwing in the water.

203
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,757
( Explosion )

204
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:35,469
They were lighting their bombs
with acetylene torches in their boats

205
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,430
and throwing them as fast as they could

206
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,349
- to herd the whales into coves.
- ( explosion )

207
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,976
Whoo!

208
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,811
But the orcas had been caught before

209
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,646
and they knew what was going on

210
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,357
and they knew their young ones
would be taken from them.

211
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:53,612
So the adults without young
went east into a cul-de-sac

212
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,491
and the boats followed them,
thinking they were all going that way,

213
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,661
while the mothers with babies went north.

214
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,830
But the capture teams had aircraft.

215
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,541
And they have to come up for air eventually.

216
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,586
And when they did,
the capture teams alerted the boats

217
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:11,839
and said, "Oh, no, they're going north--
the ones with babies."

218
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:14,717
So the boats-- the speedboats
caught them there

219
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,385
and herded them in.

220
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,805
And then they had fishing boats with seine nets

221
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,975
that they would stretch across
so none could leave

222
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,519
and then they could just pick out
the young ones.

223
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,865
We were only after the little ones.

224
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:41,994
And a little one is, you know,
a big animal still.

225
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,455
But I was told because of shipping costs

226
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,083
that's why they only take the little ones.

227
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:52,880
Garrett: They had the young ones
that they wanted in the corrals,

228
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,340
so they dropped the seine nets.

229
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,259
And all the others could have left,
but they stayed.

230
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,226
We're there, trying to get
the young orca into the stretcher,

231
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:08,562
and the whole famn damily is out here,

232
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,564
25 yards away maybe,

233
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,025
- in a big line...
- ( orcas vocalizing )

234
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,112
...and they're communicating
back and forth.

235
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,780
Well...

236
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,743
you understand then what you're doing, you know.

237
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,956
( Orcas vocalizing )

238
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,917
I-- I lost it.

239
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,837
I mean, I just started crying.

240
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,214
I didn't stop working,

241
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,133
but I...

242
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,761
you know, I just couldn't handle it.

243
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:46,100
Just like kidnapping a little kid
away from their mother.

244
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,937
Everybody's watching.
What can you do?

245
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,316
It's the worst thing I can think of, you know?

246
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,069
I can't think of anything worse than that.

247
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,948
Now, and this really sounds bad,

248
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,410
but when the whole hunt was over,

249
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:08,205
there were three dead whales in the net.

250
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,749
And...

251
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,962
so they had Peter and Brian and I...

252
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:20,217
cut the whales open, fill them with rocks,

253
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,761
put anchors on their tail, and sink them.

254
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,432
Well...

255
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,643
you know...

256
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:33,606
really, I didn't even think about it

257
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,483
being illegal at that point.

258
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,776
I thought it was a PR thing.

259
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,448
They were finally ejected
from the State of Washington

260
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,451
by a court order in 1976.

261
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:48,078
It was SeaWorld by name that was told,

262
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,457
"Do not come back to Washington
to capture whales."

263
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:55,794
Without missing a beat, they went
from Washington to Iceland

264
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,963
and began capturing there.

265
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,637
I've been part of a revolution
and two change of presidents

266
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,097
in Central and South America...

267
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:12,186
and seen some things that's hard to believe,

268
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,648
but this is the worst thing
that I've ever done--

269
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,651
is hunt that whale.

270
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,728
( Instrumental music playing )

271
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,274
Narrator: Sealand has been
a part of Victoria for over 20 years.

272
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,319
We specialize in the care
and display of killer whales.

273
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,366
By the time I started, when he was four,

274
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,370
he was up to 16 feet long
and weighed 4,000 pounds.

275
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,082
Announcer:
Tilikum, up again.

276
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,667
- Thank you.
- ( whistle blows )

277
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,128
I had actually seen Tilikum
quite a number of times.

278
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,381
He was right across the street here in Victoria.

279
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,550
Announcer: Now, this show
can get a little bit soggy at times.

280
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,720
Balcomb: All Sealand was
was a net hanging in a marina

281
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,888
with a float around it.

282
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,184
Tilikum was the one
we really loved to work with.

283
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,188
He was very well behaved
and he was always eager to please.

284
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,609
When he was first introduced,
everything just went fine and dandy,

285
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,194
but the previous head trainer

286
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,864
used techniques that involved punishment.

287
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:51,118
He would team a trained orca up
with Tilikum who was untrained.

288
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,954
He would send them both off
to do the same behavior.

289
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,791
If Tilikum didn't do it,
then both animals were punished.

290
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,252
Deprived of food to keep them hungry,

291
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:03,213
this caused a lot of frustration
with the larger animal,

292
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,673
the established animal,

293
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,217
and would in turn get frustrated with Tilikum

294
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,803
and would rake him with his teeth.

295
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,972
There would be times during certain seasons

296
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,559
that Tilikum would be covered
head to toe with rakes.

297
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,479
Rakes are teeth on teeth and raking the skin.

298
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,481
And from head to toe you could see blood

299
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:24,401
and you could see scratches,
and he would just be raked up.

300
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,987
Walters: Both females
would gang up on him.

301
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,697
Tilikum was the one we trusted.

302
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,075
We never were concerned about Tilikum.

303
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,411
The issue was really that we stored
these whales at night

304
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,748
in what we call a module,
which was 20 feet across

305
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,418
and probably 30 feet deep as a safety precaution

306
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,046
because we were worried about people
cutting the net and letting them go.

307
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:47,132
And the lights were all turned out,
so there was really no stimulation.

308
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,303
They're just in this dark,
metal 20x30-foot pool

309
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,722
for two-thirds of their life.

310
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,186
Huxter:
When we first started,

311
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,188
they were quite small and quite young.

312
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,898
So they fit in there quite nicely,

313
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,943
but they were immobile for the most part.

314
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,489
It didn't feel good.
It just didn't.

315
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,533
And it was just wrong.

316
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,743
We started having difficulty getting them all

317
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,372
into this one small steel box, to be honest.

318
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,457
That's what it was.
It was a floating steel box.

319
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,334
Walters: That's where
food deprivation would come in.

320
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,129
We would hold back food,

321
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,630
and they would know if they went in the module

322
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,798
that they would get their food.

323
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,591
So if they're hungry enough,
they're going to go in there.

324
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,176
And during the winter that would be

325
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,555
from 5:00 at night
till 7:00 in the morning.

326
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,390
When you let them out,
you'd see these new tooth rakes

327
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,308
and sometimes you'd see blood.

328
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,853
Closing that door on him

329
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,690
and knowing that he's locked in there
for the whole night is like...

330
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,486
it's a stab, it's a "whoa."

331
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,490
If that is true, it's not only inhumane,

332
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,659
and I'll tell them so...
( chuckles )

333
00:17:55,826 --> 00:18:00,038
but it probably led to what I think
is a psychosis that...

334
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,333
he was on a hair trigger.

335
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,252
He'd kill.

336
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,422
( Seagulls screeching )

337
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,929
( sirens wailing )

338
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,140
( overlapping voices ) An employee
is dead after an encounter...

339
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,143
...at a Canadian park
called Sealand of the Pacific.

340
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,021
The victim, Keltie Byrne,
was a championship swimmer

341
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,106
and a part-time worker at Sealand.

342
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,693
As seen in this home video,
rescuers used a huge net to try...

343
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,488
...rescue workers' efforts
were hindered by the agitated whales.

344
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,782
I'd like to make
the Pan Pacific team this summer,

345
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:39,244
but my more immediate goal
is just to swim fast at nationals.

346
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,836
Kallen:
It was sort of a cloudy, gray day

347
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,671
and we were looking for something to do,

348
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,090
so we thought,
"Why not go to Sealand?"

349
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:56,470
It was kind of like this dingy pool
with these whales and--

350
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,847
it just felt a little bit like an amusement park

351
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,893
that was kind of on its last legs
and everything was a bit gray.

352
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,812
Yeah. It was like
a swimming pool.

353
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,979
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know,

354
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,815
three whales in a swimming pool.

355
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:08,982
Yeah.

356
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,569
And they would come up
and touch the ball and there was--

357
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:16,031
I think there was some tail splashing
and there was some--

358
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,408
- Some jumping.
- The fish. And--

359
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,954
They hold the fish and the whales jump up.

360
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,374
I remember saying, "Oh, what a fun job.

361
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,961
You know, she's so lucky."

362
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,506
And then I saw her walking with her rubber boots

363
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,843
and she tripped and her foot
just dipped into the edge of the pool

364
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,470
and she lost her balance and fell in.

365
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,224
And then she was pushing her way up
to get out of the pool

366
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,893
and the whale zoomed over, grabbed her boot,

367
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,520
and pulled her back in.

368
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,772
At first, I didn't think it was that serious

369
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,609
because you see the trainer
in the pool with the whale

370
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,154
and you think, "Oh, well,
the whales are used to that."

371
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,866
And then all of a sudden,
it started getting--

372
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,369
there was more swimming,
more activity, more thrashing,

373
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,288
and she was starting to get panicked.

374
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,207
And then as it progressed,
you started to realize,

375
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,668
"Whoa, something's not right here."

376
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,713
She started to scream
and she started looking around

377
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,132
and her eyes were, like, bigger and bigger

378
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,926
and realizing that,
"I really am in trouble here."

379
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,138
And then they would pull her under.

380
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,181
And then they would come up
and then when she--

381
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,559
they came up, she'd be,
"Help me, help me."

382
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,060
And then they'd take her down again.

383
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,647
And she would be submerged for several seconds

384
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,066
up to, I don't know, maybe a minute.

385
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,943
You're not keeping track.

386
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:40,657
So it was harder and harder
for her to get the air in

387
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,159
because she was screaming.

388
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:46,079
And my sister remembers
her saying, "I don't want to die."

389
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,249
( exhales )

390
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,630
Well, condolences to Keltie's family.

391
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,673
Yeah.

392
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,550
That we couldn't help her

393
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,677
was pretty wretched.

394
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,097
Sealand closed.
Well, it's probably a good thing.

395
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,559
I mean, it was a little pond.

396
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,561
And I think the owner,

397
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,649
you know, made the right decision
for whatever reasons.

398
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,360
I don't believe he's a bad guy, a bad man.

399
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,654
I think he was shocked by the whole affair, too.

400
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,615
The blush was gone from the business

401
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,077
and he decided that that was it.

402
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,411
We should shut down.

403
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,414
No one ever contacted us.
There was an inquest.

404
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,001
No one ever asked us to say what happened.

405
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,212
- Yeah.
- You know, we just left.

406
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,590
There was no big lawsuits afterwards
and there was no memorial.

407
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:43,178
And the only thing remaining
of Keltie Byrne is--

408
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:48,600
is what's left in the folks' minds
who recall the case.

409
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,769
So in the newspaper articles,

410
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,814
the cause of death
was that she drowned accidentally,

411
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,192
but she was pulled under by the whale.

412
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,444
Well, there's a bit of smoke
and mirrors going on.

413
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,489
I mean, one of the fundamental facts is
is that none of the witnesses

414
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,451
were clear about which whale pulled Keltie in.

415
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,162
Yes. Yeah, it was the large whale.

416
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,374
Tilikum, the male, is the one
that went after her.

417
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,293
And the other two just kind of circled around.

418
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,754
But he was definitely the instigator.

419
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:22,175
And we knew it was that whale
because he had the flopped-over fin.

420
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,845
Like, it was very easy to tell.

421
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,061
Ventre: Sealand of the Pacific closed
its doors and was looking, I guess,

422
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,521
to make a buck on the way out

423
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,773
and these whales are worth millions of dollars.

424
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,484
When SeaWorld heard that Tilikum was available

425
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,988
after this accident at Sealand of the Pacific,

426
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,699
they really wanted Tilikum
because they needed a breeder.

427
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,243
So I don't even think that anybody
even was questioning,

428
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,245
like, is this a good idea?

429
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:54,082
My understanding of the situation
was that Tilikum and the others

430
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,667
would not be used in shows.

431
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,419
They would not be performance animals.

432
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,920
Our understanding of their behavior

433
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,715
was that it was such
a highly stimulating event for them

434
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,300
that they were likely to repeat it.

435
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,178
Sealand was-- we were all young
and bit of sea cowboys

436
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,306
and we weren't so technical
and scientific as SeaWorld,

437
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,767
so we all had this vision
that they knew more than us

438
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,477
and they were better than us
and Tilikum would have

439
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,187
a bigger pool and he'd have a better life

440
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,439
and he would have better care
and he'd have better food

441
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,649
and it'd be a great life for him.

442
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,277
So it was like, "Okay, Tilly.

443
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,697
You're going to Disneyland.
Lucky you."

444
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,576
( whale blows )

445
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,330
Narrator:
The orcas' intelligence

446
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,832
may be even superior to man's.

447
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,211
As parents, they are exemplary,
better than many human beings.

448
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:43,590
And like human beings, they have
a profound instinct for vengeance.

449
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,635
( Screaming )

450
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,178
Narrator:
Dino De Laurentiis presents...

451
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,597
- ( screaming )
- ..."Orca."

452
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,435
If you go back only 35 years, we knew nothing.

453
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,853
In fact, less than nothing.

454
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,981
What the public had was superstition and fear.

455
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,275
Narrator:
A fight to the death...

456
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,613
between the two most dangerous animals on Earth.

457
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,323
What in hell are you?!

458
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,367
Garrett: These were
the vicious killer whales

459
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,786
that, you know, had 48 sharp teeth

460
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,539
that would rip you to shreds
if they got a chance.

461
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,713
What we learned is that
they're amazingly friendly

462
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,551
and understanding and intuitively
want to be your companion.

463
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,845
- ( Squeaking )
- Woman: Are you recording this?

464
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,597
- ( Squeaking )
-( laughing )

465
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,975
And to this day there is no record

466
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:38,228
of an orca doing any harm
to any human in the wild.

467
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,661
They live in these big families.

468
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,416
And they have life spans
very similar to human life spans.

469
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,253
The females can live to about 100, maybe more,

470
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,922
males to about 50 or 60.

471
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:10,177
But the adult offspring never leave
their mother's side.

472
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,679
( Whistling )

473
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:17,392
Each community has a completely
different set of behaviors.

474
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,019
( Clicking )

475
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:23,231
Each has a complete repertoire of vocalizations

476
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,318
- with no overlap.
- ( whistling )

477
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,861
You could call them languages.

478
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,363
The scientific community is reluctant to say

479
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,074
any other animal but humans uses languages,

480
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:36,745
but there's every indication
that they use languages.

481
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:40,207
The orca brain just screams out

482
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,709
intelligence, awareness.

483
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,544
We took this tremendous brain

484
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:48,215
and we put it in a magnetic
resonance imaging scanner.

485
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:52,302
What we found was just astounding.

486
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,388
They've got a part of the brain
that humans don't have.

487
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,975
A part of their brain has extended out

488
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,937
right adjacent to their limbic system.

489
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,856
The system processes emotions.

490
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,109
The safest inference would be these are animals

491
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:12,447
that have highly elaborated emotional lives.

492
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,408
It's becoming clear that dolphins and whales

493
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,912
have a sense of self, a sense of social bonding

494
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,414
that they've taken to another level--

495
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,084
much stronger, much more complex

496
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,004
than in other mammals, including humans.

497
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,382
We look at mass strandings,

498
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,593
the fact that they stand by each other.

499
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,888
Everything about them
is social-- everything.

500
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,434
It's been suggested
that their whole sense of self

501
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,980
is distributed among
the individuals in their group.

502
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,940
Man:
There are five of them.

503
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:51,027
These orca are going
to attack this seal on--

504
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:55,907
they've been breaking the ice off
and swimming around him.

505
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,826
Oh, here they come, two of them.
Lookit, underneath there.

506
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,494
You can see them underneath.

507
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,038
They made a big wave.
Look at that, a big wave.

508
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,290
- Oh, yeah.
- Woman: Whoa.

509
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,917
- Man #2: Oh, God.
- Woman #2: Oh, God. No, no, no.

510
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,420
Oh!
Oh, I can't stand it.

511
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,006
Man: If you can't watch
the bullfight, you'd better leave.

512
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,925
Oh, yeah, here they go.
Look at this-- three of them.

513
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:15,927
Man #3:
Look at this. Look at this.

514
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,804
Woman #2:
Oh, God. Oh, no!

515
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,472
- Oh, God!
- Man: It's all over.

516
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,641
Woman #3:
Nope, not quite.

517
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,769
- Man: Yeah, it's all over.
-( people shouting )

518
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,688
Man:
It's all over.

519
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,414
Duff us: The First Nations people
and the old fishermen on the coast,

520
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,167
they call them "blackfish."

521
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:51,504
They're an animal that possesses
great spiritual power

522
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,090
and they're not to be meddled with.

523
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,764
I've spent a lot of time around killer whales

524
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,474
and they're always in charge.

525
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:06,519
I never get out of the boat,
I never mess with them.

526
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,940
The speed and the power is quite amazing.

527
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:16,780
( Boat engine revs )

528
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,367
Rules are the same
as the pool hall--

529
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,495
keep one foot on the floor at all times.

530
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,918
Even after seeing them thousands of times...

531
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,716
you see them and you still--
( gasps )

532
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,635
you know, wake up.

533
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,722
( Hydraulic machine whirs)

534
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,192
He arrived, I think, in 1992.

535
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,694
I was at Whale and Dolphin Stadium
when he arrived.

536
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,116
And he's twice as large
as the next animal in the facility.

537
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,283
Woman:
Yay!

538
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,827
Man: The guy is right
at about 12,000 pounds.

539
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,288
That's incredible.
He looks fantastic.

540
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,582
When Tilikum arrived at SeaWorld,

541
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:14,712
he was attacked viciously,
repeatedly by Katina and others.

542
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,299
In the wild, it's a very matriarchal society.

543
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,344
Male whales are kept at the perimeter.

544
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,054
- ( Vocalizing )
- In captivity,

545
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,392
the animals are squeezed
into very close proximity.

546
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,686
Tilikum-- the poor guy
is so large,

547
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,481
he couldn't get away
because he just is not as mobile

548
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,484
relative to the smaller and more agile females.

549
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,195
And where was he going to run?
There's no place to run.

550
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,865
Berg: I think he spent
a lot of time in isolation.

551
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,492
SeaWorld claims that, "Oh, no,
he's always in with the other--

552
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,661
with the females," but from what I saw,

553
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,456
he was mostly put with the females
for breeding purposes

554
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,710
and he didn't spend a lot of time,
you know, with the other whales.

555
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:57,338
It's for his own protection
that he gets beat up.

556
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,674
And so by segregating him,

557
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:04,804
it provides a physical barrier
so the females can't kick his butt.

558
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,599
Tilikum is pretty much kept in the back,

559
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:12,103
and then brought out at the very end
as, like, the big splash.

560
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,688
( Instrumental music playing )

561
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:19,235
He was always happy to see you in the morning.

562
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:20,820
- Hi!
- There we go.

563
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,072
- You're the boy.
- Look at his chompers.

564
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,533
Ventre: Maybe because he was alone,
maybe because he was hungry,

565
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,910
maybe because he just liked you--

566
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,078
who knows what was going on in his head.

567
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,414
- You want to whistle?
- ( Tilikum whistling )

568
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,542
-( laughs )
- All right, so he can talk to us.

569
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,169
- Yes.
- You don't say.

570
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,670
He's precious.
Yes?

571
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,047
That was really loud.
Terrific.

572
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,299
( Sputters )

573
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,301
- Come on, big boy.
- Show the pecs.

574
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,803
Berg: He seemed to like to work.
He seemed to be interested.

575
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,348
He seemed to want to learn new things.

576
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,559
He seemed to be enjoying
working with the trainers.

577
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,397
Jett:
He, for me, was a joy.

578
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,274
He really responded to me and I--

579
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:01,236
you know, every day I went to work,
I was happy to see Tilly.

580
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,696
( Woman laughs )

581
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,950
- Boop!
- ( woman #2 laughs ) That's cute.

582
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,912
( laughs )

583
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,289
You're being too cute.

584
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,125
Berg: I never got the impression
of him while I was there

585
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:19,379
that, oh, my God, he's the scary whale.

586
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,547
Not at all.

587
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:25,301
Maybe some of it's just our naiveté or whatever,

588
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,012
you know, because we weren't given

589
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,598
the full details of Keltie's situation.

590
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,183
Woman: Turn around.
Smile, buddy.

591
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,102
- Cheese.
- Woman: Yay!

592
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:36,729
I was under the impression
that Tilikum had nothing to do

593
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,190
with her death specifically,
that it was the female whales

594
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,525
who were responsible for her death.

595
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,528
What I found really odd at first
was the way they were acting

596
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,530
around this whale and what they had told us

597
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,907
seemed to me to be two different things.

598
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,826
The first day he arrived, I remember

599
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,662
one of the senior trainers
at SeaWorld, she--

600
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,915
Tilikum was in a pool
and she was walking over a gate,

601
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,710
and she had her wetsuit unzipped
and it was tied around her waist.

602
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,920
And she was making cooing noises and going,

603
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,714
"Hey, Tilikum,
what a cute little whale."

604
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,633
And she was, like,
just kind of play-talking at him,

605
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,429
and one of the supervisors said,
"Get her out of there!"

606
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,931
And just screamed at her,
like, "Get her away from there,"

607
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,058
like they were so worried
that something was going to happen.

608
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,270
And I remember thinking,
"Why are you guys making

609
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,189
such a big deal out of this
when he didn't actually kill her?"

610
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,484
Well, clearly management thought
there was some reason

611
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,445
to exercise caution around him.

612
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,239
You know, clearly they knew more
than they were telling us.

613
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,407
( Instrumental music playing )

614
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,076
Ladies and gentlemen, the next two
behaviors you're going to be seeing,

615
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,495
you can only see right here at SeaWorld.

616
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:39,125
Berg: Jeff was out in the audience
filming one of the Shamu shows.

617
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,543
It was a perfect show.

618
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,961
All of the hot dog sequences,

619
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,255
the water works sequences went off great.

620
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,302
I was really excited just to be capturing this

621
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,138
because it was kind of turning out
to be a great show.

622
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,810
A show that's kind of complete--

623
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,731
it doesn't-- it probably only happens
a few times a week.

624
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,110
At the very end of the show,
Liz was working Tilikum

625
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,363
and apparently Tilikum
lunged out of the water at her.

626
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,783
And I had captured Tilikum
coming out of the water

627
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,868
kind of turning sideways and appeared to me

628
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,453
to try to grab Liz.

629
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,622
And at that moment,

630
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,916
the tape became unusable.

631
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,336
I was just kind of basically instructed
to get rid of the tape.

632
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:26,756
Wanting to kind of preserve the tape,
I actually used the editing equipment

633
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:30,009
and snipped out
that little half-second or second

634
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,178
when he did that and stitched it back together

635
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,681
so it just kind of looked like
a glitch in the tape.

636
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,808
And I'm like, "Look at this."
And it was like, "No.

637
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,393
This is no longer usable."

638
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,853
You know, and so we had to destroy the tape.

639
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,436
Ventre: It's pretty outrageous
that SeaWorld would claim

640
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,105
there was no expecting Tilikum
to come out of the water

641
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,065
because they had witnessed him
coming out of the water,

642
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,276
and it's written into his profile.

643
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,488
He lunges at trainers.

644
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,370
When we visit SeaWorld,
we tend to take advantage of the fact

645
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:43,082
that Shamu has been provided
with a safe and comfortable habitat.

646
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,168
And everything trained is an extension

647
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:48,087
of the killer whale's natural behavior.

648
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:51,424
I spewed out the party line during shows.

649
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,342
I'm totally mortified now.

650
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,388
There was like-- something like,
"Look at Namu.

651
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,308
Namu's not doing that
because she has to."

652
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,936
Namu is doing this because she really wants to.

653
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,730
Oh, my gosh.

654
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,982
Like, some of the things I'm embarrassed by,

655
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,358
so embarrassed by.

656
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,905
At the time, I think
I could have convinced myself

657
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:17,408
that the relationships that we had
were built on something

658
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:20,369
stronger than the fact
that I'm giving them fish.

659
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,038
You know, I like to think that...

660
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,956
( laughs )

661
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,584
but I don't know that that's the truth.

662
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,545
( Orca vocalizing )

663
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:33,216
I had been there a while and I had seen
a few other things along the way

664
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,719
that made me question why I was there

665
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,554
and what we were doing with these animals.

666
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,685
Narrator:
On November 4, 1988,

667
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,271
a killer whale at SeaWorld

668
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,900
gave the performance of a lifetime.

669
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,451
Don't miss this small miracle.

670
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:04,372
Come see our new Baby Shamu.

671
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,582
Ray:
I know it was naive of me,

672
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,543
but I thought that...

673
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,878
( clears throat )

674
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,214
it was our responsibility
to do as much as we could

675
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,007
to keep their family units together

676
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,927
since we knew that in the wild
that's what happens.

677
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,346
♪ Yes, sir, that's our baby... ♪

678
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,849
Ray: Kalina was
the first Baby Shamu.

679
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,601
Narrator: Baby Shamu--
SeaWorld's newest star...

680
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:30,189
She had become quite disruptive
and challenging her mom a little bit

681
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,859
and disrupting some shows
and that kind of thing.

682
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,902
♪ She's got the whole place jumpin' ♪

683
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,281
♪ Shamu,
she's that baby whale. ♪

684
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,117
It was decided by the higher-ups
that she would be moved

685
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:44,161
to another park when she was
just four, four and a half years old.

686
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:48,416
And that was news to us as trainers
that were working with her.

687
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,168
To me, it had never crossed my mind

688
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:55,089
that they might be moving the baby from her mom.

689
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:01,846
The supervisors basically
was kind of mocking me,

690
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,432
like, "Oh, you're saying, 'Poor Kalina,"'

691
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,935
you know, "'what's she going to do
without her mommy?"'

692
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:10,855
And, you know-- and that
of course just shut me up.

693
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,356
( laughs )

694
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:15,067
So, the night of the move,
we had to deploy the nets

695
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:19,196
to separate them and get Kalina,
the baby, into the med pool.

696
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,491
And Katina was generally a quiet whale.

697
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,952
She was not an overly vocal whale.

698
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,247
After, Kalina was removed from the scene

699
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,292
and put on the truck and taken to the airport,

700
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,961
and Katina, her mom, was left in the pool.

701
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:37,715
She stayed in the corner of the pool,

702
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:41,719
like, literally just shaking and screaming,

703
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:42,970
screeching, crying.

704
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,264
- ( Crying )
- Like, I had never seen her

705
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,891
do anything like that.

706
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,976
And the other females in the pool,

707
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,519
maybe once or twice during the night

708
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,355
they'd come out and check on her.

709
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,983
And she'd screech and cry
and they would just run back.

710
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:00,363
There was nothing that you could call that,

711
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,532
watching it, besides grief.

712
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,119
Those are not your whales.

713
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:10,206
You know, you love them and you'll think,

714
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,751
"I'm the one that touches them,
feeds them, keeps them alive,

715
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,212
gives them the care
that they need."

716
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,714
They're not your whales.

717
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,007
They own them.

718
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,761
Kasatka and Takara were very close.

719
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:27,723
Kasatka was the mother, Takara's the calf.

720
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,725
Takara was special to me.

721
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,396
They were inseparable.

722
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,148
When they separated Kasatka and Takara,

723
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,192
it was to take Takara to Florida.

724
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:42,738
Once Takara had already been
stretchered out of the pool,

725
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,158
put on the truck, driven to the airport...

726
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,702
( clicking, crying )

727
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,330
Hargrove:
Kasatka continued to make vocals

728
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,457
that had never been heard before.

729
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,292
- ( Crying continues )
- They brought in

730
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,671
the senior research scientists
to analyze the vocals.

731
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,757
They were long-range vocals.

732
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,385
- ( Crying )
- She was trying something

733
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:08,639
that no one had even heard before
looking for Takara.

734
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,349
That's heartbreaking.

735
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,809
( Clicking, crying )

736
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,270
How can anyone

737
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:19,150
look at that and think
that that is morally acceptable?

738
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,193
It's not.

739
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,362
It is not okay.

740
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,866
Woman:
Stand by, Dean.

741
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,617
Richard:
Let's go live to SeaWorld

742
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,454
where Dean Gomersall
is joining us for a sneak peek.

743
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,622
Hi, Dean.
Tell us about the new show.

744
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:34,999
Good afternoon, Richard.

745
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,876
The new show is the Whale and Dolphin Discovery.

746
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,170
What it does is it shows
the relationship we have

747
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,297
between all our animals here at the Whale...

748
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,674
There's so many things that were told to us

749
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,968
that they tell us-- they tell you
so many times

750
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,553
that you just--
you start believing it.

751
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,430
So all the animals here get along very well.

752
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,390
It's just like training your dog, really.

753
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,976
I was blind, you know.
I was a kid.

754
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,645
I didn't know what I was doing, really.

755
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,105
- Man: Nice.
- Woman: Good job.

756
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,982
- You did a real good job.
-( laughs )

757
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,151
( instrumental music playing )

758
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,867
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is David from Maryland.

759
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,578
Go ahead and wave at everyone, David.

760
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:15,581
Berg: I just really bought into
what they told us.

761
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,709
You know, I learned to say
what they told us to the audience.

762
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:19,877
Hello out there.

763
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,046
Children are some of Shamu's biggest fans.

764
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:24,048
We can do just about anything we want.

765
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,675
I thought I knew everything about
killer whales when I worked there,

766
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,302
you know, and everything about these animals.

767
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,096
I really know nothing about killer whales.

768
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,389
I know a lot about being an animal trainer

769
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,266
or a killer whale trainer,
but I don't know anything

770
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:37,144
about these animals' natural history
or their behavior.

771
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,272
I really in some ways believed a lot
of what I was learning from them,

772
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,816
because why would they lie?

773
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:47,613
Because the whales in their pools die young,

774
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,660
they like to say that all orcas
die at 25 or 30 years.

775
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,412
- 25 to 35 years.
- 25 to 35 years.

776
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,958

778
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:03,003
They tend to live a lot longer
in this environment

779
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,630
because they have all the veterinary care.

Garrett:
And of course that's false.

781
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,928
We knew by 1980, after half a dozen
years of the research,

782
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:14,682
that they live equivalent to human life spans.

783
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:19,061
And every other potentially
embarrassing fact is twisted

784
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,605
and turned and denied one way or another.

So, in the wild, they live...

- Less.
- Less.

787
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,360
Like the floppy dorsal fins.

788
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:30,322
25% of whales have a fin
that turns over like that

789
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,657
as they get older.

790
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:35,828
Dorsal collapse happens
in less than 1% of wild killer whales.

791
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:36,996
We know this.

792
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:42,126
All the captive males
100% have collapsed dorsal fins.

793
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:45,754
And they say that they're a family,
that the whales are in their family.

794
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,339
They have their pods.

795
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:51,969
But that's just an artificial
assemblage of their collection,

796
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:55,347
however management decides they should mix them

797
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,683

Kandu, trying to assert

I saw that there was just
a lot of things that weren't right.

00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,474
And there was a lot of it--

and something was amiss.

843
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:08,063
And, you know, I sort of
compartmentalized that part of it

844
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,941
and did the best that I could
with the knowledge that I had

845
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:12,985
to take care of the animals that were there.

846

Because I felt sorry for Tilikum.

How do I make this animal
as beautiful as they are

859
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,908
and have people walk away loving this animal?

I left in January of 2010,

863
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:10,709
a month before Dawn passed away.

864
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,296
She was like a safety guru.

865
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:17,007
I mean, she was always
double-checking,

866
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:18,842
making sure that everyone
was doing the right thing.

867
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:21,512
So I remember she would record
every show that she did

868
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:24,223
and she would watch it and critique herself.

869
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,643
She was constantly trying to be better.

870
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,812
When I found out it was Dawn,

871
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,231
I was shocked.

872
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,692
That could have been me.
I could have been the spotter.

What if I was there and I could have saved her?

Berg: John Sillick
is the guy who, in 1987,

876
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:58,298
was crushed between two whales
at SeaWorld of San Diego.

877
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,677
Now, even though I'd been working
at SeaWorld for six months,

878
00:46:01,844 --> 00:46:03,595
I had no idea that that had even happened.

879
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,013
I never even heard that story.

880
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,434
And the SeaWorld party line was that,
well, that was-- it was a trainer error.

881
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,477
It was John's fault.
You know, John's fault.

882
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:12,187
He was supposed to get off that whale.

883
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:15,107
And for years, I believed that
and I told people that.

884
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:26,743
I actually started at SeaWorld, like,
five days after that event occurred

885
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,788
and we didn't--
we weren't told much about it

886
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:33,083
other than it was trainer error.

887
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,336
And, you know, especially
when you're new into the program,

888
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:37,754
you don't really question a whole lot.

889
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,007
Well, you know, years later,
when you actually look at the footage,

890
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:42,134
you go, "You know what?
He didn't do anything wrong."

891
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:43,719
That whale just landed on him, you know.

892
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:46,180
That whale just went to the wrong spot.

893
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:47,890
It could have been aggression.
Who knows?

894
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,059
But it was not the trainer's fault
at all, watching that video.

895
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:59,151
When I saw the video
of the killer whale landing on John,

896
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:00,861
I mean, it just absolutely took my breath away.

897
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:03,238
I watched it two or three times,

898
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:04,823
and every time I saw that, I just gasped.

899
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,408
I could not believe what I was seeing.

900
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:08,368
What kept his body together is--

901
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,412
his wetsuit basically held him together.

902
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:11,955
But I know he's had multiple surgeries

903
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,249
and he's got tons of hardware in his body.

904
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,419
And it's hard for me to believe
that I didn't actually see that video

905
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:19,796
while I was actually an animal trainer

906
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,007
because it seems to me that every person

907
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,593
who works with killer whales
should have to watch that video.

was interacting with whales

00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:44,988
she's taking her foot off.

915
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:48,659
She's putting her foot on Orkid,
her rostrum, she's taking it off.

916
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:51,411
Watching the video, knowing Orkid,

917
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:55,123
your stomach drops because you know
what's probably going to happen.

918
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,668
She grabbed her foot.

919
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:01,004
Tamarie whips around and she grabs the gate.

920
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,840
You see herjust ripped from the gate.

921
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:08,428
At this point, Tamarie knows
that she's in trouble.

922
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:09,888
She's under the water.

923
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:12,057
Splash and Orkid both have her.

924
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,892
She's totally out of view.

925
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,603
No other trainer knows that this is happening.

926
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,021
People start to scream.

927
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:21,316
It was a park guest that was filming it.

928
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,235
You hear-- you don't see her,

929
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:26,905
but you hear Tamarie surface.

You hear herjust scream out,
"Somebody help me."

00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,830
it was just
such a bloodcurdling--

933
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:38,083
like she knew she was going to die.

934
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:42,838
Robin-- when he ran over,
he made a brilliant decision.

935
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:46,383
He told a trainer to run and take
the chain off Kasatka's gate.

936
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:50,178
By taking that chain off,
it would give the precursor to Orkid

937
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,930
that Kasatka was coming in.

938
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,017
Kasatka's more dominant than Orkid,

939
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,061
so Orkid let her go.

940
00:48:58,228 --> 00:49:02,482
Her arm, it was U-shaped.

941
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,860
It was compound fractured.

942
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:10,115
She's very lucky to be alive, that's for sure.

943
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:26,214
Berg: I believe it's 70 plus,
maybe even more,

944
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,884
just killer whale trainer accidents.

945
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:33,388
Maybe 30 of them happened prior to me
being actually hired at SeaWorld.

946
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:34,848
And I knew about none of them.

947
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:41,772
Ventre: I've seen animals
come out at trainers.

948
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:48,236
Man:
Something's wrong.

949
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,905
I've seen people get slammed.

950
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:06,797
The whales, they're just playing or--
or they're upset for a second.

951
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,849
It was just something that happened, you know?

952
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:20,519
Jett: This culture of
"You get back on the horse

953
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:22,396
and you dive back in the water.

954
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,440
And if you're hurt, well, then we've got
other people that will replace you."

955
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,026
And, "You came a long way.
Are you sure you want that?"

956
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,788
Meredith Vieira: A SeaWorld trainer
is recovering today

957
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:43,375
after a terrifying ordeal
in front of a horrified audience.

958
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,544
( Instrumental music playing )

959
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:12,988
Duff us: For some reason,
the whale just took a different approach

960
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,948
to what it was going to do

961
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:18,410
with a very senior,
very experienced trainer, Ken Peters,

962
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:20,287
and dragged him to the bottom of the pool

963
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:22,080
and held him at the bottom.

964
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,251
Let him go, picked him up,

965
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:27,836
took him down again.

966
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:39,556
And these periods he was taken down
were pretty close to the mark.

967
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:43,518
You know, a minute, a minute 20.

968
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:50,192
When he was at the surface, he didn't panic,

969
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,027
he didn't thrash, he didn't scream.

970
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:53,987
Maybe he's just built that way.

971
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:56,865
But he stroked the whale.

972
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,830
And the whale let go of one foot
and grabbed the other.

973
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,769
That's a pretty deep pool
and he took him right down.

974
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:28,396
I think that's to two atmospheres of pressure.

975
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,691
Apparently, Mr. Peters
is an experienced scuba diver

976
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,443
and I think that knowledge probably contributed

977
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,529
to how he was able to be hauled down there

978
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,865
that quickly and stay calm and know what to do.

979
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,287
He knew what he was doing because
you can see him actually in the film.

980
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:46,122
It's-- the def is so good,
you can see him ventilating.

981
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,958
You can see him ventilating really hard.

982
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:51,211
So he knows about swimming
and diving and being underwater.

983
00:52:51,378 --> 00:52:54,673
He may have been assuming
he was going under again.

984
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,511
I did not walk away unimpressed
by his calm demeanor

985
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:01,471
during that whole affair.

986
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:06,852
I would be scared shitless.

987
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,289
He was near to the end.

988
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:33,712
Presumably, Ken Peters
had a relationship with this whale.

989
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:36,381
Maybe he did.
Maybe that's what saved him.

990
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:40,385
But Peters got the whale to let him go.

991
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:43,305
And they strung a net across.

992
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:56,484
And Ken Peters pulled himself
over the float line

993
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:59,571
and swam like a demon
to a slide-out

994
00:53:59,738 --> 00:54:02,449
because the whale was coming right behind him.

995
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,951
The whale jumped over and came right after him.

996
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:06,328
He tried to stand up and run.

997
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:07,579
Of course, his feet were damaged.

998
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:10,749
I mean, he just fell and he scrambled.

999
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:14,920
And they take this as a prime example

1000
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,671
of their training working.

1001
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:20,634
And they say, "Just stand back
and stay calm," and that did work.

1002
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:25,263
They claim this as a victory

1003
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,390
of how they do business.

1004
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:35,774
And maybe so, but it can also be interpreted

1005
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:39,486
as a hair's breadth away from another fatality.

1006
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,078
All: Hi, Shamu.
Hi, everybody.

1007
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,622
We're the Johnsons from Detroit, Michigan.

1008
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,666
We sure had a great time
when we visited SeaWorld.

1009
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,250
It's one of our favorite places.

1010
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,671
Yeah, I like the part when Shamu
gets everybody wet.

1011
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,965
When the whales get close to the glass

1012
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:01,591
and start kicking out the water?

1013
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,343
Whamo!
You're a goner.

1014
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,511
( Instrumental music playing )

1015
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:07,138
( crowd screaming )

1016
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:17,232
Orange County's sheriff's deputies
have identified the 27-year-old man

1017
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:20,235
found dead in a killer whale's tank at SeaWorld.

1018
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:24,155
The victim is Daniel P. Dukes
from South Carolina.

1019
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:27,158
Dukes was found yesterday
draped over the back of Tilikum,

1020
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:30,161
the largest orca held in captivity.

1021
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,456
Well, all I know is
the public relations version of it--

1022
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,501
he was a young man that had been arrested

1023
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:39,295
not long before he snuck into SeaWorld.

1024
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,131
Maybe he climbed the barbed wire fence

1025
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:44,509
around the perimeter and stayed after hours.

1026
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:48,138
Perfect story line--
a mentally disturbed guy

1027
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:51,141
hides in the park after hours
and strips his clothes off

1028
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:54,394
and decides he wants to have
a magical experience with an orca

1029
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:57,439
and drowns because he became hypothermic.

1030
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,482
Right.
So that's the story line

1031
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,443
and none of us were there
to know the difference.

1032
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:05,155
He was not detected by the night watch trainers

1033
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:07,365
who were presumably at that station.

1034
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:09,367
There are cameras all over SeaWorld.

1035
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,786
There are cameras all over
the back of Shamu Stadium

1036
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:12,954
pointing every which way.

1037
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,206
There are underwater cameras.

1038
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:19,252
I find it hard to believe
that nobody knew until the morning

1039
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:21,254
that there was a body in there.

1040
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,049
They have a night watch trainer every night.

1041
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:27,218
That person didn't hear
any splashing or screaming?

1042
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:30,722
I mean, I just find that really suspicious.

1043
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,182
One of the employees--

1044
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,267
I don't know if it was
a physical therapist or somebody--

1045
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:38,688
was coming in in the morning
and there was Tilikum,

1046
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:41,608
you know, with a dead guy,
a dead, naked guy on his back,

1047
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:45,820
kind of parading him around the back pool.

1048
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:48,615
The public relations spin on this was that

1049
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:52,327
he was kind of a drifter
and died of hypothermia.

1050
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:56,164
But the medical examiner reports

1051
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:58,333
were more graphic than that.

1052
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,127
For example, Tilikum stripped him,

1053
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:02,796
bit off his genitals.

1054
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,381
There was bite marks all over his body.

1055
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:09,469
Now, whether that was post-death
or pre-death, I don't know.

1056
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:12,263
But, yeah, all I can comment on

1057
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,391
is that the guy definitely
jumped in the wrong pool.

1058
00:57:22,649 --> 00:57:25,276
So why keep Tilikum there?

1059
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,154
This guy, he has a proven
track record of killing people.

1060
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:31,074
He's clearly a liability to the institution.

1061
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:34,160
Why keep him around?
Well, it's quite simple to answer.

1062
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:36,663
And that is that his semen
is worth a lot of money.

1063
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:48,299
Berg: Over the years,
Tilikum has been

1064
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:51,177
one of the main breeding whales at SeaWorld.

1065
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,934
It's brilliant because they can
inseminate way more female whales,

1066
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,103
because they can just
get his sperm and freeze it.

1067
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,313
And then he's basically
operating as a sperm bank.

1068
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,401
In a reputable breeding program, rule number one

1069
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,362
is you certainly would not breed
an animal that has shown

1070
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:12,198
a history of aggression towards humans.

1071
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:15,368
Imagine if you had a pit bull who had killed.

1072
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,537
That animal would have likely been put down.

1073
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,581
But in the entire
SeaWorld collection--

1074
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:23,126
it's like 54% of the whales
in SeaWorld's collection

1075
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:26,004
now have Tilikum's genes.

1076
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:35,972
( Applause )

1077
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:42,061
The fall is to assume that
all killer whales are like Tilikum.

1078
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,189
You have to look at their
learning history from birth.

1079
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,817
You have to understand why Tilikum was a hazard

1080
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:49,569
to anybody in the water.

1081
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:52,947
And you have to understand that none
of the other killer whales at SeaWorld

1082
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,365
that are in that system are that way.

1083
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,993
Interviewer: What about
the incident at Loro Parque?

1084
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,620
First of all, I-- I can't--

1085
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:02,832
I can't speak with specificity
about Loro Parque.

1086
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:04,918
I wasn't there.

1087
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:07,295
In fact, I know very little about it.

1088
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,923
Probably about as much
as the general public knows.

1089
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,490
( Speaking Spanish )
He told me he has something important to say

1090
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:40,211
He knelt down and Propose to me

1091
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:41,491
Estefania Rodriguez

1092
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:43,873
( laughs )

1093
00:59:43,874 --> 00:59:44,874
Very Romantic

1094
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:45,875
Of course I said "Yes".

1095
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:46,876
I said "Of course "

1096
00:59:54,877 --> 00:59:56,977
He never expected to train whalse.

1097
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:57,978
He thougt he'd be a sound technocian.

1098
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:04,979
He always loved animals and decided to try it out.

1099
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,980
He loved it.He tried it and just fell in love with it.

1100
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:15,613
Suzanne Allee: Loro Parque,
it's in the Canary Islands,

1101
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,907
which is an autonomous region of Spain.

1102
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:21,119
It's the largest tourist attraction
in all of Spain.

1103
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:24,998
( Speaking Spanish )

1104
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:29,669
Allee: And when SeaWorld
sent the orcas to Loro Parque,

1105
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,255
everybody was always questioning,

1106
01:00:32,422 --> 01:00:37,427
like, how did they make
that leap to send four young orcas

1107
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:40,555
to a park off the west coast of Africa

1108
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:45,435
with trainers who-- a lot of them
had never been around orcas before?

1109
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:49,314
Nothing was ready.

1110
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,857
The venue wasn't ready.

1111
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:54,485
It wasn't ready for the orcas,
it wasn't ready for a show.

1112
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:57,155
The owner of the park
didn't want to lose revenue

1113
01:00:57,322 --> 01:00:59,782
by shutting down the pools and repairing them.

1114
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,951
So for three years, the animals ate the pools

1115
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:04,120
and for three years
the animals had problems--

1116
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:06,956
with their teeth, with their stomachs.

1117
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:08,583
So that's the reason why these animals

1118
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,793
are enduring the endoscope procedures.

1119
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,213
Back up.
Now back up, back up.

1120
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,257
Allee: Those are still
SeaWorld's animals

1121
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:18,718
and they are responsible for those animals.

1122
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:21,888
( Orca crying )

1123
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,478
( orca clicking, crying )

1124
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:31,439
Loro Parque doesn't have a good reputation.

1125
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:35,318
People that work in the business
know the reputation of places

1126
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:38,571
and Loro Parque does not have a good reputation.

1127
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:41,866
They didn't spend the same amount
of time as the SeaWorld trainers,

1128
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,951
did not go through the same regimen

1129
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:46,913
that the SeaWorld trainers went through.

1130
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,707
You know, and Alexis really was
the best trainer.

1131
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,877
And I did say-- I said,
"You're the only trainer there

1132
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:56,422
that can hold his own
with a SeaWorld trainer."

1133
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:58,925
And I said, "But you need
to be careful."

1134
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:10,311
He complaind to me he was tired.

1135
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:15,312
But I didn't take it seriously.

1136
01:02:15,393 --> 01:02:17,313
I said everyone gets tired from their job.That's normal.

1137
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:20,314
He said "But my job id physical..."

1138
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:24,315
"I have to be fit becuse I'm in danger every single day."

1139
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:28,316
"If Iam not fit ,who khows? Mybe tomorrow something might happen to me."

1140
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,317
He said this the night before the attack.

1141
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,544
Anywhere along the line
it could have been stopped

1142
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,296
because everyone knew
it was a tragedy waiting to happen.

1143
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:40,007
But no one ever did anything about it.

1144
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,509
And in the end,

1145
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:44,595
it was the best trainer who lost his life.

1146
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:50,848
( Speaking Spanish )
My cellphone rang.

1147
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:52,129
It was Miguel Diaz, Alex's boos

1148
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:57,750
He said "There was an Incident with one of the whales."

1149
01:02:57,851 --> 01:02:59,851
"Alex if fine"

1150
01:03:01,253 --> 01:03:09,531
( Speaking Spanish ) Mercedes Martines Alexis Mother
We noticed a few ambulaces and the company owners.

1151
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:15,532
The owner was there with the director and their lawyers.

1152
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:18,533
He told us "there was nothing we could do"

1153
01:03:19,764 --> 01:03:22,534
"there was nothing we could do"

1154
01:03:23,615 --> 01:03:24,535
what?

1155
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:29,536
They asked me if I wanted to see him.

1156
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:35,447
It was Horrible.

1157
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:39,538
They took us to ...

1158
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:42,539
( exhales )

1159
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:51,362
the room where his body was.

1160
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:54,363
Only his head was showing.

1161
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,364
He was completly coverd up.

1162
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:00,005
I leand over his chest

1163
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:04,486
I noticed something was wrong.

1164
01:04:04,437 --> 01:04:12,437
It seems as though his chest had burst.

1165
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:18,158
I asked what had happend

1166
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:21,459
I coulden't understand why they told  me he was fine.

1167
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:23,370
And all of a suden ,I see him like this...

1168
01:04:24,191 --> 01:04:26,371
I just gave  him a big hug....

1169
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:29,372
And said "I love you.I love you."

1170
01:04:29,373 --> 01:04:32,373
Then They escorted out.

1171
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:35,183
And I don't remember anything else.

1172
01:04:35,224 --> 01:04:36,224
"It was an accident,It was an accident"

1173
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:39,875
But I wasnt content whit that answer.

1174
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:44,156
Finally,autopy gave us the reason.

1175
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:47,997
It was no accident ,it was an attack.

1176
01:04:48,028 --> 01:04:49,138
a burst attack.

1177
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:54,269
This was not just an accident.Thats a lie.

1178
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:07,380
Aleis training at seaWolrd 12 months befor his death,

1179
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:04,944
Duff us:
Those were SeaWorld's whales.

1180
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,488
They were trained using SeaWorld's techniques.

1181
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:12,868
And their training was being supervised
at the time of the fatal accident

1182
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:17,123
by one of their senior trainers from San Diego.

1183
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:42,398
Duff us: For somebody to get up
and say in a court of law

1184
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:45,985
they have no knowledge of the linkages

1185
01:05:46,152 --> 01:05:50,197
between SeaWorld
and this park in Tenerife is well--

1186
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:53,576
either she doesn't know and is telling the truth

1187
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:55,995
or it's just a bold-faced lie.

1188
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:03,336
As trainers, we never forget
Shamu's true potential.

1189
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:05,296
We see it each and every day.

1190
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:09,175
That's why all of our interactions
are very carefully thought out,

1191
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:11,427
especially our water work interaction.

1192
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,095
Whoa!

1193
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:19,393
( laughing )

1194
01:06:20,728 --> 01:06:22,938
You big dork.

1195
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:25,066
Especially our water work interactions

1196
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,943
because they're potentially the most dangerous.

1197
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,739
I'd been expecting it
since the second person was killed.

1198
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:35,117
I'd been expecting somebody
to be killed by Tilikum.

1199
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:36,911
I'm surprised it took as long as it did.

1200
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,121
Reporter: First tonight,
a six-ton killer whale

1201
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,957
has lived up to its name,
killing an experienced trainer

1202
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,251
at SeaWorld, Orlando, today.

1203
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:45,878
Reporter #2:
A tourist at an earlier show

1204
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,880
said the animal seemed agitated.

1205
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:51,175
Reporter: Trainers complained
the whales weren't cooperating.

1206
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:53,469
The whole show, the main show,

1207
01:06:53,636 --> 01:06:55,513
was a disaster that day.

1208
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,848
There was, you know, whales chasing each other

1209
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,351
and eventually the trainers decided
that they had to stop the show

1210
01:07:00,518 --> 01:07:02,353
because they couldn't
get the whales under control.

1211
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,730
Tilikum was in the back pool

1212
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:09,735
set up to do a Dine with Shamu
performance with Dawn.

1213
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:13,322
Likely she saw what had gone on
during the main show

1214
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:17,034
and so she had probably felt
more pressure to do a good show.

1215
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:20,663
Yay!

1216
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,790
Berg: When you watch
the whole video, you can see

1217
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:25,626
that Tilikum is actually really with Dawn

1218
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:27,545
in the beginning of the video.

1219
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:29,922
( Applause )

1220
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,717
There's a couple of behaviors
that she asks him to do

1221
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,844
where Tilikum justjumps right in

1222
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,388
and he does exactly what she asks him to do.

1223
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,521
Ventre: There seemed to be
a point in the session

1224
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,982
where things went south, so to speak.

1225
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,692
And in my humble opinion,

1226
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:53,320
it was at that missed bridge--
whistle bridge,

1227
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,364
on the perimeter pec wave.

1228
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:58,075
She asked him to do a perimeter pec wave

1229
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:01,954
where she asked him to basically
go all the way around the pool

1230
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:03,706
and wave his pectoral flipper.

1231
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,961
- And she blows her whistle...
- ( whistle blows )

1232
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,629
- Announcer: There we go.
- ...which is a bridge,

1233
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,840
which tells the animal that, okay,
you've done a good job.

1234
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,133
Come back and get food.

1235
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,010
But he missed that cue.

1236
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,555
Announcer: He likes waving so much.
That's beyond waving.

1237
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:21,891
Berg: And he went
all the way around the pool

1238
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:23,851
on this perimeter pec wave.

1239
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:25,936
Announcer: That's all right.
We're going to let him keep on waving.

1240
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,690
My interpretation is that
he didn't hear the whistle.

1241
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:32,318
Berg: So not only
did he not hear the bridge,

1242
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,987
then he went and did
a perfect behavior and came back,

1243
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:38,699
and what he got was what we call
a three-second neutral response,

1244
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:40,242
which is just a way to let the animal know,

1245
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,827
"No, you didn't do the correct thing.

1246
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,288
You're not going to get rewarded.
And then we're going to move on."

1247
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:45,831
And then you can also see through the video

1248
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:48,000
that Dawn is running out of food.

1249
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,669
Ventre:
The animals can sense

1250
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,963
when you're getting to the bottom
of your bucket of fish,

1251
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,341
because they can hear the ice clanging around

1252
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:57,968
and the kind of fishy, soupy water
at the bottom.

1253
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:01,722
And the handfuls of fish that
they're getting delivered by the trainer

1254
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:03,182
are all getting smaller.

1255
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:06,352
So they know that they're coming down
to the end of session.

1256
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:08,813
Berg: When you see the difference
between the beginning of the video

1257
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:10,606
and the end of the video, you can see

1258
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:14,193
that he's just not quite on his game anymore.

1259
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,486
There was no food left.

1260
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:18,447
She kept asking him for more and more behaviors.

1261
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,324
He wasn't getting reinforced for the behaviors

1262
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:21,617
that he was doing correctly.

1263
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:24,829
He probably was frustrated towards the end.

1264
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:29,959
Ventre: Then she walked around
the perimeter of G pool.

1265
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,836
He followed her.

1266
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,969
And then continued over
into the rocky ledge area

1267
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:44,431
where she laid down with him
to do a relationship session,

1268
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,518
which is--
it's quiet time, basically.

1269
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,396
Jett: Tilikum at some point
grabbed ahold of her left forearm

1270
01:09:50,563 --> 01:09:53,315
and started to drag her
and eventually did a barrel roll

1271
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,109
and pulled her in.

1272
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:58,070
It may have started as play or frustration

1273
01:09:58,237 --> 01:10:02,783
and clearly escalated to be
very violent behavior

1274
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,494
that I think was anything but play.

1275
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:07,997
In the end, he basically

1276
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:10,374
just completely mutilated that poor girl.

1277
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:17,756
Hargrove: They were gathering
all of the trainers at the Texas park.

1278
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:22,052
He said, "There's been an accident

1279
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,180
at the Florida park
and a trainer was killed."

1280
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:29,435
Hearing that it was Dawn,
I was-- I couldn't believe it.

1281
01:10:29,602 --> 01:10:31,604
I just remember saying to myself, "Not Dawn.

1282
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,397
It can't be Dawn."

1283
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:37,943
He said that--
"And he still has her."

1284
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,863
And I just...

1285
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,157
was so disturbed by that

1286
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:47,620
and the reality of how powerless we are.

1287
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:51,123
Duff us: Avulsion, laceration,
abrasion, fractures.

1288
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,792
Fractures and associated hemorrhages.

1289
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,545
Blunt force traumas

1290
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:59,048
to the main body, to the extremities.

1291
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:03,761
To see this meted out against a trainer...

1292
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:06,722
and I cannot fathom the reason.

1293
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:09,141
It's shocking.

1294
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:13,145
The lawyer for OSHA asked me
what I thought we'd learned,

1295
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,980
and I'm sitting in the courtroom

1296
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:19,109
and I've got the Keltie Byrne
case file in one hand

1297
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:21,028
and I've got Dawn Brancheau in the other.

1298
01:11:21,195 --> 01:11:23,155
And they're almost, to the day, 20 years apart.

1299
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:25,199
And I'm looking at these two things.

1300
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,868
My only answer is, "Nothing."

1301
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,079
In fact, it's not a damn thing.

1302
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,497
We have not learned a damn thing

1303
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:34,583
for something like that
to happen 20 years apart.

1304
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,544
Reporter: Could you tell
if it was an accident or if this--

1305
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,838
Reporter #2: Did this female trainer
work with this whale on a regular basis?

1306
01:11:40,005 --> 01:11:43,384
I don't know. What apparently happened
is we had a female trainer

1307
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,135
back in the whale holding area.

1308
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:47,596
She apparently slipped or fell into the tank

1309
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,140
and was fatally injured by one of the whales.

1310
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:52,601
At first, SeaWorld reported
that a trainer slipped

1311
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:55,145
and fell in the water and was drowned.

1312
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,814
So that was the first report.

1313
01:11:56,981 --> 01:11:59,441
It wasn't until eyewitness
accounts disputed that

1314
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:00,859
that they had to go back in their huddle

1315
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:02,778
and say, "Wait a minute.
We gotta come up with a new plan."

1316
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:04,488
Reporter: New tonight--
SeaWorld has confirmed

1317
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:07,241
the killer whale pulled
the woman into the water.

1318
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:08,951
She didn't fall into the tank

1319
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:11,578
as the sheriff's department initially reported.

1320
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,873
The new plan is that he grabbed her ponytail.

1321
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,794
This is a subtle way of placing
the blame on Dawn's shoulders.

1322
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:20,754
She shouldn't have had a long ponytail,

1323
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,507
or if she did have that ponytail,
it should have been up in a bun.

1324
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:25,926
Dawn, if she was standing here
with me right now,

1325
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:29,430
would tell you that it was her mistake

1326
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:31,348
in allowing that to happen.

1327
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,517
Hargrove:
They blamed her.

1328
01:12:33,684 --> 01:12:35,686
How dare you?

1329
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:39,606
How disrespectful for you to blame her

1330
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:43,110
when she's not even alive to defend herself.

1331
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:45,487
He grabbed her ponytail
and pulled her into the water.

1332
01:12:45,654 --> 01:12:47,114
That's as simple as it gets.

1333
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:49,366
Berg: There are photographs
of plenty of other trainers

1334
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:51,326
doing exactly the same thing that she was doing,

1335
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:55,873
so I knew that SeaWorld was lying
about the fact that this was her fault.

1336
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,752
The ponytail, in all likelihood, is just a tale.

1337
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:04,965
The safety spotter, who apparently
didn't actually see the takedown,

1338
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:06,133
came up with that.

1339
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,927
- Are you excited?
- Crowd: Yeah!

1340
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:10,763
Dave McDaniel:
During the spotter's testimony,

1341
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,807
OSHA pushed him to say
that he wasn't really sure

1342
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:16,268
that it was her ponytail
that was in the whale's mouth,

1343
01:13:16,435 --> 01:13:20,189
that he just saw her underwater
and he assumed it was the ponytail.

1344
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,316
OSHA contends that the whale came up

1345
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:24,193
and grabbed Dawn Brancheau's arm,

1346
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:26,320
saying that that was another level
of aggressiveness.

1347
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,490
And again, SeaWorld is saying
it was not an aggressive move.

1348
01:13:29,656 --> 01:13:31,784
One of SeaWorld's top curators, Chuck Tompkins,

1349
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,078
said when Dawn Brancheau
was pulled off that ledge,

1350
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:37,289
it wasn't necessarily
aggressive behavior by the whale.

1351
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:41,043
The initial grab was not an act of aggression.

1352
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,420
This is not a crazed animal.

1353
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,798
The industry has a vested interest
in spinning these

1354
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,425
so that the animals continue to appear

1355
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:51,970
like cuddly teddy bears
that are completely safe.

1356
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:53,972
You know, that sells a lot of Shamu dolls,

1357
01:13:54,139 --> 01:13:58,143
it sells a lot of tickets at the gate,
and that's the story line

1358
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,355
that they're going to continue
to stick with for as long as they can.

1359
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:23,836
Recognize that those that say
this is a crazed animal

1360
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:27,005
that acted out and grabbed Dawn maliciously,

1361
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:32,553
they want to prove the theorem
that captivity makes animals crazy.

1362
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,346
And that is just false.

1363
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,932
All whales in captivity have a bad life.

1364
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:38,767
They're all emotionally destroyed.

1365
01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:41,854
They're all psychologically traumatized,

1366
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,690
so they are ticking time bombs.

1367
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:46,233
It's not just Tilikum.

1368
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,819
We have to separate
what happened to Dawn--

1369
01:14:48,986 --> 01:14:52,114
and, as tragic as it is, no one wants
to ever see it happen again.

1370
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:54,491
Can SeaWorld create an environment

1371
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:55,951
where it never happens again?

1372
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:58,162
Yes, I absolutely believe they can.

1373
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,709
What if there were no SeaWorlds?

1374
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:07,087
I can't imagine a society, with the value we put

1375
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:09,798
on marine mammals, if those parks didn't exist.

1376
01:15:09,965 --> 01:15:13,635
I'm not at all interested in having my daughter,

1377
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:15,387
who is three and a half,

1378
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:18,348
grow up thinking that it's normalized

1379
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:21,393
to have these intelligent,
highly evolved animals

1380
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,728
in concrete pools.

1381
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:25,439
I don't want her to think
that's how we treat the kin

1382
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:28,525
that we find ourselves around on this planet.

1383
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,194
I think it's atrocious.

1384
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,945
This hearing is expected to last all week

1385
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:34,990
with OSHA continuing to work
toward this theory--

1386
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:38,660
that SeaWorld knew there was
a calculated risk of injury or death,

1387
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:41,788
but put trainers in the water
with the whales anyway,

1388
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,082
while SeaWorld will say
that Dawn Brancheau's death

1389
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:46,001
was an isolated incident.

1390
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:49,129
Reporting live in Seminole County,

1391
01:15:59,223 --> 01:16:00,224
There's something wrong.

1392
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:05,395
You know with Tilikum that
there's something wrong and that's--

1393
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:08,732
when you have a relationship
with that animal and you--

1394
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:14,571
you understand that he's killing
not to be a savage.

1395
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:17,407
He's not killing because he's just crazy.

1396
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:20,410
He's not killing because
he doesn't know what he's doing.

1397
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,246
He's killing because he's frustrated

1398
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:28,001
and he's got aggravations
and he doesn't know how to--

1399
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:30,295
he has no outlet for it.

1400
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,091
Jett: Now Tilikum is spending
a great deal of time by himself

1401
01:16:34,258 --> 01:16:38,095
and basically floating lifeless in a pool.

1402
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,057
Woman:
Three hours now...

1403
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:44,184
and he hasn't moved.

1404
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:47,104
They try to sugarcoat it by saying,

1405
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,855
"He comes out in the front pool
every once in a while.

1406
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:50,315
Now he's doing shows."

1407
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:51,483
Really? You know
what he does in a show?

1408
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:52,901
( Applause )

1409
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:54,778
He does a few bows

1410
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:58,490
and then he goes back in his little jail cell.

1411
01:16:58,657 --> 01:16:59,950
That's his life.

1412
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:01,868
( Applause )

1413
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:04,204
Duff us:
I feel sad for Tilikum.

1414
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:07,416
A regal thing like him swimming around the tank

1415
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:09,376
with his fin flopped over like that

1416
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:12,587
compared to a wild bull killer whale that size,

1417
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,257
which is one of the most kinetic
and dynamic things

1418
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:16,967
you can imagine...

1419
01:17:19,428 --> 01:17:21,763
I feel sad when I see him.

1420
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:27,164
Tilikum remains at SeaWorld Orlando,performing daily.

1421
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:30,063
Berg:
It's time to stop the shows.

1422
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,566
It's time to stop forcing animals to perform

1423
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:34,484
in basically a circus environment.

1424
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,570
And they should release the animals
that are young enough

1425
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,656
and healthy enough to be released,
and the animals like Tilikum

1426
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,617
who are old and sick and have put in
25 years in the industry

1427
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:44,202
should be released to an open ocean pen

1428
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:45,579
so they can live out their lives

1429
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:47,748
and just experience
the natural rhythms of the ocean.

1430
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:49,708
This is a multibillion-dollar
corporation

1431
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:53,712
that makes its money
through the exploitation of orcas.

1432
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:56,214
They're not suitable to have in captivity.

1433
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,592
The whales are really bored.

1434
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:03,013
You deprive them of all
this environmental stimulation.

1435
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,140
Gomersall:
I think that in 50 years,

1436
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:08,101
we'll look back and go,
"My God, what a barbaric time."

1437
01:18:14,102 --> 01:18:17,802
SeaWorld repeatedly declined 
to be interviewed for this film

1438
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:32,803
Mey 30,2013
Judge Ken Welcsh issued a ruling on OSHA vs.SeaWorld

During shows,SeaWorld trainers must now remain 
behind barriers,separated from the orcas.

1439
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:39,804
SeaWorld has appealed,

1440
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,520
Dawn Brancheau--
DB, dream big.

1441
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:56,066
Dawn was the most loving,
giving person you ever met.

1442
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:59,486
Her smile just radiated.

1443
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:10,831
She's comp-- she fulfilled her life.

1444
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,922
Ventre:
We saw whales

1445
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:04,843
swimming in straight lines
with straight dorsal fins.

1446
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:08,680
I was so honored to be there.

1447
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:16,563
And I was so thankful that I had sunglasses on

1448
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,983
because the tears were kind of coming out.

1449
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,819
And it was moving.

1450
01:20:19,904 --> 01:22:29,907
