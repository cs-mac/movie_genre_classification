1
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,270
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,533
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:50,541
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,610
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,408
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,248
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:09,162
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,667
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,531
Sorry.

10
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,546
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,677
Just this way.

12
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:35,913
So the Beach Olub Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,483
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,552
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,154
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,291
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,097
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,503
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:55,907
Oonstant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,775
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,746
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,912
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,817
And you want to live in London?

24
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,947
Very much. Very much.

25
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:11,255
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:13,192
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,657
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,801
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,668
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,799
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,241
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,472
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:33,947
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:35,279
All that stuff.

35
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,819
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,821
So it's all good.

37
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,414
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:46,189
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,059
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,929
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,162
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,229
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:59,070
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:15,615
Very good.

45
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,772
Ohris Wilton.

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,637
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,642
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,439
I think Ohris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:38,208
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:41,479
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:44,818
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,413
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:49,119
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:50,491
OK.

55
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,621
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,790
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:10,580
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:12,946
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,882
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,352
For a while.

61
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,946
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,786
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,350
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,293
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:28,698
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,568
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:35,231
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some ODs.

68
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:39,004
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:41,171
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,306
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,610
I love opera.

72
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:47,811
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Oovent Garden.

73
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,787
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,187
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,255
To the opera?

76
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,795
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:00,331
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,459
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:06,403
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Oan I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:09,066
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:13,305
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:16,403
So?

83
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:19,474
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,611
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:24,520
- This is Ohris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,524
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:29,357
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,623
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:33,359
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,458
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:38,095
- This is my sister... Ohloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,230
- I'm Ohloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:34,627
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:37,823
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:42,267
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,897
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,635
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,701
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,680
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:57,718
'Oause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:57,785 --> 00:08:02,119
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,340
Ohlo-Ohlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Ohris for a bit?

103
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,276
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,507
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,607
Irish! Have you ever had a
Ouba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:32,119
Lt'd be really boring
for Ohris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:34,917
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,788
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Ohop-chop.

109
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:40,828
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,763
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:45,663
Playing with a stronger player. Oome on.

112
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,463
OK.

113
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:08,720
Was I dreadful?

114
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,555
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:15,529
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,930
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,867
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,929
Oaught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,032
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,674
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,670
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:34,478
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,381
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:40,047
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:43,354
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,159
I love it.

127
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:47,628
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:50,029
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,294
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,031
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,836
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,137
That'd be great.

133
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:04,175
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,011
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,813
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:10:08,886 --> 00:10:11,582
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,953
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:17,892
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,156
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,630
Oan I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,394
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,868
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,427
I can do that.

144
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,963
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,772
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,745
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:40,011
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,775
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,105
You?

150
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,706
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,281
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,716
What did I walk into?

153
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,066
What did I walk into?

154
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,396
It's like this.

155
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:11,200
- May I?
- Please.

156
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:17,438
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:23,287
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,516
The story of my life.

159
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,024
So, tell me,

160
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,891
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:32,193
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:41,337
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,911
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,314
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,379
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,817
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:06,390
There you are.

168
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,525
I wanted to introduce you
to Ohris Wilton.

169
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:11,628
Ohris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancee.

170
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,906
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,967
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:20,376
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:23,246
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,342
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,416
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,818
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:42,933
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,133
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,302
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,812
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,973
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,711
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:01,478
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,079
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:04,146
To be honest with you,

186
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,523
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,859
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,023
Especially an American one.

189
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,001
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,768
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,841
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,437
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,847
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,319
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:15,326
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:16,990
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,728
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,962
Do you need money?

199
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,837
God, no.

200
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,701
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,473
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:40,144
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,708
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:03,042
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:07,015
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:30,331
You've been seeing a lot
of Ohris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,002
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,841
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,781
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,114
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:45,644
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:49,989
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,052
Oan't we do something for him?

214
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,428
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,796
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:59,530
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,834
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,965
Ohloe, be careful.

219
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:07,978
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:10,947
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,880
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,816
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:18,117
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,420
Well, I care very deeply for Ohris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,858
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:38,973
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,535
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,479
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,483
Oan I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:51,747
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:51,824 --> 00:17:53,416
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:57,861
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,763
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,531
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:06,469
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,031
Thanks.

237
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:12,100
What do you think?

238
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,169
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,045
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:24,885
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:27,621
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:32,197
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,994
I think it is.

244
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,434
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:41,167
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:43,436
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:44,477 --> 00:18:47,378
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,540
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:53,074
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,211
To?

251
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:58,223
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

252
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,226
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:06,356
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,657
Of course.

255
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:11,898
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:15,100
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:17,609
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,702
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,942
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:26,384
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:28,285
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:32,122
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:38,661
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,598
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,466
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:47,166
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,675
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:52,809
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,108
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,541
Hello.

271
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:03,016
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,787
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExOeL.

273
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:08,852
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,726
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:11,992
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,658
You love your cars, don't you, Ohris?

277
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,863
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:20,806
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,071
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,042
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:28,514
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,676
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:33,721
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,522
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:41,756
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,958
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:47,627
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:51,069
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:53,869
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,274
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,335
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:00,005
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,515
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,418
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:09,083
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:10,887
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,895
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,487
"So-so."

299
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,524
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,502
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:25,301
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,308
He was kind of austere.

303
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,537
Ohris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,601
Oh, Ohrist.

305
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,614
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:37,085
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,451
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,219
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,123
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:47,788
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,662
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:54,533
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,164
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,835
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,743
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:06,476
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,983
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,178
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:12,381
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,219
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,522
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:19,789
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:23,731
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,735
No purpose, no design.

325
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,430
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,406
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,501
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:37,206
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:39,681
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,048
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,416
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,114
Oan we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:48,488
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,220
No, I was...

335
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:54,891
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:59,403
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,132
Not that I'm ever
going back to Oolorado.

338
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:03,504
Ever.

339
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:06,043
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:10,072
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:10,548
- Good morning. Ohris Wilton.
- Rod Oarver.

342
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,243
- Good morning. Ohris Wilton.
- Rod Oarver.

343
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,545
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

344
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:17,110
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

345
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,450
Hi, Alan. How are you?

346
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:22,118
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

347
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,356
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

348
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,398
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:30,161
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

350
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,964
Now, if you're OK with the package,

351
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,197
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

352
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:36,069
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

353
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,199
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

354
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,265
And Rod.

355
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,538
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

356
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:41,977
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

357
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:49,177
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

358
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,815
It's such good news.

359
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,523
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

360
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:58,062
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:02,601
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

362
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:06,468
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

363
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,198
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

364
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,244
It has some beautiful arias on it.

365
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,040
And his voice expresses

366
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:16,445
everything that's tragic about life.

367
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,209
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

368
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:25,980
I love it.

369
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,188
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,764
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

371
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:39,428
Puligny-Montrachet.

372
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:41,804
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

373
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,206
Now I'm addicted.

374
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:46,006
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

375
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,774
but I told them we're busy.

376
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,474
But we have no plans.

377
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:54,543
Well, no special plans.

378
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,446
I thought we said we'd stay in?

379
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:01,093
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

380
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,753
We could've joined them.

381
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:05,297
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

382
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,729
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

383
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:14,803
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

384
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:17,172
Well, shall I call them?

385
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,872
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

386
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,240
Well...

387
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:28,220
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

388
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,780
The wine, the opera.

389
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:33,851
Absolutely.

390
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,202
I just figured...

391
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,837
We can stay in any... any night, and...

392
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:51,945
...they're free and suggested a film.

393
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:53,343
What's the film?

394
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:56,042
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

395
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,012
I am in the mood for a film.

396
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:07,217
Thank you so much, fella.

397
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:12,422
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

398
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,661
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

399
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:18,295
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

400
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:20,739
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

401
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:22,771
Where is she?

402
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:26,311
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

403
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,474
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

404
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,142
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:30,218 --> 00:26:33,312
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

406
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,879
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

407
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:39,724
Everybody likes you at work.

408
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:44,389
Papa says he's heard great things.

409
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:49,129
You're a very clever boy.

410
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,445
Hey!

411
00:27:08,824 --> 00:27:10,156
Hey.

412
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:11,853
- Hi.
- How are you?

413
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:15,591
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

414
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:18,463
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

415
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,926
It's vicuna.

416
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:22,436
- Vicuna.
- Vicuna?

417
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:23,767
- Yeah.
- Right.

418
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,898
Where are you going?

419
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:27,636
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

420
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,699
- Why?
- So...

421
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:31,269
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

422
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:35,909
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

423
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:39,614
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

424
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:42,123
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

425
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:46,651
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

426
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:50,995
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

427
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:54,127
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

428
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:57,801
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

429
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,967
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

430
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,442
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

431
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,072
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

432
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:07,411
Have you ever tried yoga?

433
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:10,178
- No.
- No?

434
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,411
Hi.

435
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,469
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

436
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:12,341
- How was it?
- Blew that.

437
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,612
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

438
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:18,281
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

439
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,619
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

440
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,023
Yeah.

441
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:24,251
You know what,

442
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,230
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

443
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,731
...a little bit.
- Sure.

444
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,791
- OK.
- This way.

445
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,144
What was I saying?

446
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,017
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

447
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,786
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

448
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:56,184
You should see my sister, she's...

449
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:01,426
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

450
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,264
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

451
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,906
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

452
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,737
My sister...

453
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:14,577
...is classically beautiful.

454
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,713
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

455
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,650
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

456
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,349
It's just a joke.

457
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,925
What did your father do?

458
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,731
He... left.

459
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,395
And never sent any money.

460
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:41,804
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

461
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,605
- No?
- No.

462
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:48,069
Her problem was that she drank.

463
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,341
How did you meet Tom?

464
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,546
We met at a party.

465
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:58,818
He...

466
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,621
...saw me across the room

467
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,926
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

468
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,421
And I...

469
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,330
I liked him right off, you know.

470
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:10,198
I thought...

471
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,234
Well, I think he's very handsome.

472
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,534
Don't you?

473
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,472
Very.

474
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,773
And he asked you to marry him?

475
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,042
Well, he...

476
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:27,918
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

477
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,922
What did I know
about that kind of life?

478
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,153
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Oolorado.

479
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,660
But...

480
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,190
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

481
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,997
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

482
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,502
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

483
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:48,542
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

484
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:51,043
It's such an inbred family. It's...

485
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:53,478
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

486
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:00,452
I thought he was very handsome.

487
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,513
You know, and I told you I was just...

488
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:07,017
I was overwhelmed with attention.

489
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,298
So, what about you and Ohloe?

490
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:17,327
She's very sweet.

491
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,399
She is very sweet.

492
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,670
And she wants to marry you.

493
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,342
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

494
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,612
No. No, it's different.

495
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:35,144
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

496
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,182
...are being groomed.

497
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,921
You mark my words.

498
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:43,362
They almost died when they thought
that Ohloe had run off with some...

499
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:46,093
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

500
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:47,658
But...

501
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:54,802
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

502
00:32:55,977 --> 00:32:58,036
And how am I going to blow it?

503
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,010
By making a pass at me.

504
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:08,587
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

505
00:33:10,826 --> 00:33:13,159
Men always seem to wonder.

506
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:18,296
They think I'd be
something very special.

507
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:20,358
And are you?

508
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:26,339
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

509
00:33:29,712 --> 00:33:32,840
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

510
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,648
I've had too much to drink.

511
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,150
Oan you get me a cab?

512
00:33:45,228 --> 00:33:47,219
Sure.

513
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:08,451
Thank you.

514
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:10,543
You were driving a bit fast,

515
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:12,111
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

516
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:15,052
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

517
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,114
Oh, hi.

518
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:17,387
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

519
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:19,486
Oarmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

520
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:20,996
Oh, he's so sweet.

521
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,998
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

522
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,034
It should have dissipated fully already.

523
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:27,332
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

524
00:34:27,404 --> 00:34:28,996
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

525
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:31,939
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

526
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:34,739
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

527
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,676
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

528
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,738
You're so beautiful.

529
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:44,048
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

530
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:46,419
that the company would pay for?

531
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,048
I don't know.

532
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:54,823
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

533
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,997
And the beginning of next year

534
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:59,969
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

535
00:35:00,038 --> 00:35:03,997
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

536
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:06,873
Plus, there are a number of perks...

537
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:10,972
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

538
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:13,574
We had been focusing on someone else...

539
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,011
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Ohloe have become close.

540
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:21,456
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

541
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,118
I'd hate to disappoint you.

542
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,887
- Oh, excuse me.
- Oome on, Ohris...

543
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:27,955
We're nearly ready.

544
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:30,432
- I'll bring a gun for Ohris.
- Thanks, Tom.

545
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,398
Never mind, fella.

546
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:40,069
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

547
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:43,011
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

548
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,549
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

549
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:47,585
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

550
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,814
- Don't you worry, Ohris.
- Quite right, Papa.

551
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,877
Oome on, Ohloe.

552
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,688
Hi, darling.

553
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,388
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

554
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:58,794
No.

555
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:00,627
How did your audition go?

556
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,964
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

557
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,903
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

558
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:09,805
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

559
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:14,335
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

560
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,646
So, how long do you keep it up?

561
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:22,544
How long?

562
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:25,920
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

563
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:30,519
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

564
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:33,258
To try something else?

565
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,999
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

566
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,057
I'm not saying that.

567
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:39,833
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

568
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,603
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

569
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:47,806
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

570
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,145
Well, I do ask myself that.

571
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:52,343
See? It's only logical, Tom.

572
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,717
Especially for a woman.

573
00:36:54,788 --> 00:36:57,621
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

574
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,420
and as you get older and time passes,

575
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,757
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

576
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,329
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

577
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,996
I'm not saying now.

578
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,006
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

579
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:17,109
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

580
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:19,668
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

581
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:21,907
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

582
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,006
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

583
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:28,020
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

584
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,453
...innuendos.

585
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:32,185
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

586
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,284
Those that have it, know it right off.

587
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,886
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

588
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,831
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

589
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,891
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

590
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:43,834
Excuse me.

591
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:45,461
Nola.

592
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,734
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

593
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:50,743
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

594
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,006
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

595
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,641
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

596
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,951
I was looking for you.

597
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:18,092
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

598
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,158
I don't mean to intrude.

599
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,304
I need a drink.

600
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:26,136
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

601
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,200
- Do I?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:30,609
- Oonfident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

603
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,307
You shouldn't have followed me here.

604
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:34,372
Do you feel guilty?

605
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:37,676
Do you?

606
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:47,652
We can't do this.

607
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,322
I know.

608
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,497
This can't lead anyplace.

609
00:41:15,386 --> 00:41:16,375
Hello.

610
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,446
Darling, I think it's for you.

611
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:22,290
But take it outside.

612
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,934
Well, there's hope, at least.

613
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:42,206
When's the callback?

614
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,443
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

615
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:49,715
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

616
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:53,586
Yeah. OK.

617
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:54,751
Bye.

618
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:57,519
Why have you been so cold to me?

619
00:41:57,596 --> 00:42:00,326
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

620
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:02,560
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

621
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:05,034
you've been distant, evasive.

622
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,231
I don't want to encourage anything.

623
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,638
What happened, happened, Ohris.

624
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,677
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

625
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:15,441
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

626
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:18,210
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

627
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:22,344
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

628
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:25,689
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

629
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:29,419
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

630
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,293
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

631
00:42:32,364 --> 00:42:33,661
We had our moment.

632
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:36,223
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

633
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,565
Ohris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

634
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:41,597
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

635
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:43,904
Ohris, forget it. It's over.

636
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,550
Thanks. Henry!

637
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,288
- Hey. How are you?
- Ohris. All right.

638
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:03,886
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

639
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:06,227
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

640
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:08,028
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

641
00:43:08,101 --> 00:43:09,830
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

642
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,269
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

643
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:14,932
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

644
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:17,738
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

645
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,540
I just couldn't stand it.

646
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:21,944
No. No, I heard you went into business.

647
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:24,245
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

648
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:26,751
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

649
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,345
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

650
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:31,014
Family's got nothing but money.

651
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,288
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

652
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,419
Hey, look, I understand.

653
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:38,192
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

654
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,790
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

655
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,358
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

656
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,336
I always admired
your game though, you know?

657
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:45,838
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

658
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:47,498
Oool under pressure, but creative.

659
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:49,736
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

660
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,243
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

661
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:53,109
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

662
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,171
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

663
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:57,547
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

664
00:43:57,618 --> 00:43:58,915
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

665
00:43:58,986 --> 00:44:00,681
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

666
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,449
- Give me your number.
- Oertainly.

667
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,518
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

668
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:07,925
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

669
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:09,155
So good to see you, Henry.

670
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,595
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

671
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:12,029
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

672
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:14,158
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

673
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,293
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

674
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,234
- All right.
- Bye.

675
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:18,669
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

676
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,004
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

677
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,068
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

678
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:26,670
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

679
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:27,737
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

680
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:30,080
- Oan you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

681
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:32,176
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

682
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,222
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

683
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:35,278
Stop it.

684
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:37,416
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

685
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:39,289
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

686
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,589
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

687
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:44,063
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Oome on.

688
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:46,430
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

689
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:49,561
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Ohloe and I have discussed it.

690
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:51,868
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

691
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,339
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

692
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:55,501
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

693
00:44:55,577 --> 00:44:56,908
I appreciate that.

694
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:37,545
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

695
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,291
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

696
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,453
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

697
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:48,520
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

698
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:49,963
It was all her fault, you know.

699
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:52,796
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

700
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:54,859
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

701
00:45:54,937 --> 00:45:57,371
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

702
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,465
All men who see you want to attack you.

703
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:02,767
Isn't that right, Ohristopher?

704
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:05,380
Oh, God, are you all right?

705
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:07,807
I'm fine.

706
00:46:07,884 --> 00:46:10,250
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

707
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:16,187
I now pronounce you man and wife.

708
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,318
You may kiss the bride.

709
00:46:34,277 --> 00:46:36,268
Oh, my God.

710
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:38,610
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

711
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,641
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

712
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:43,686
There's another bedroom through there.

713
00:46:43,754 --> 00:46:45,722
The bathroom and a kitchen.

714
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:47,814
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

715
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,951
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

716
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:54,657
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

717
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:56,722
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

718
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:01,569
Oome on.
The light coming through every day.

719
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:03,800
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

720
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,866
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

721
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,080
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

722
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:13,140
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

723
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:17,217
I want you to make me pregnant.

724
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:21,622
Ohloe... We discussed this.

725
00:47:21,693 --> 00:47:23,593
It's very quick.

726
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:26,755
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

727
00:47:27,498 --> 00:47:30,490
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

728
00:47:32,603 --> 00:47:35,595
Oome on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

729
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:45,041
Hey! Where are you?

730
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,341
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

731
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,116
Not good.

732
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,083
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

733
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:57,261
What?

734
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,764
Well, Nola and I...

735
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:01,629
...broke up.

736
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,861
- No!
- Yeah.

737
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:06,234
Or, I should say, I called it off.

738
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:09,904
I thought you were gonna get married.

739
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:12,136
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

740
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:14,805
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

741
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,008
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

742
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,710
who's her main candidate.

743
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:21,643
God, no.

744
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:25,553
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

745
00:48:26,558 --> 00:48:29,049
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

746
00:48:29,128 --> 00:48:31,528
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

747
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:34,522
...l've met someone else.

748
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,625
- No!
- Yeah.

749
00:48:36,702 --> 00:48:40,934
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

750
00:48:41,006 --> 00:48:44,374
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

751
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:47,709
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

752
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:50,773
You know what I mean.

753
00:49:09,302 --> 00:49:12,237
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,568
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:49:32,892 --> 00:49:33,951
Excuse me.

756
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:36,496
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

757
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:40,330
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

758
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:45,870
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

759
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:49,699
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

760
00:49:56,884 --> 00:49:59,580
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

761
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:02,445
Just business.

762
00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:09,558
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

763
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,121
Oh, Ohloe, I'm beat.

764
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:16,331
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

765
00:50:17,204 --> 00:50:19,434
OK, I can take a hint.

766
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:28,138
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

767
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,615
Look...

768
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:32,012
...it'll happen.

769
00:50:32,087 --> 00:50:34,521
I'm just really tired.

770
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,953
Kiss.

771
00:50:41,897 --> 00:50:43,455
Sweet dreams.

772
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:51,672
I now pronounce you man and wife.

773
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,867
You may kiss the bride.

774
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:08,020
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

775
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,092
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

776
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:13,026
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:14,288
I know.

778
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,628
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

779
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,726
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

780
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:22,794
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

781
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:26,308
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

782
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,366
I want my own children.

783
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,242
This one?

784
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:32,636
Sort of...

785
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,149
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

786
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,411
Really?

787
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:38,385
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

788
00:51:38,454 --> 00:51:40,479
Her and her husband
just found each other.

789
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,525
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

790
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:45,583
and itjust works like a charm.

791
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:49,893
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

792
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,727
- God...
- I know, it's great.

793
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:55,800
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

794
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:59,440
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

795
00:51:59,508 --> 00:52:01,601
If I have to work all night.

796
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:02,666
OK.

797
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,872
Thank you. Thanks.

798
00:52:17,394 --> 00:52:19,624
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

799
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:28,766
Thanks.

800
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,337
Are you OK, sir?

801
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:38,214
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

802
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,941
No, not really.

803
00:52:45,522 --> 00:52:46,511
Oh, Ohrist!

804
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,581
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

805
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:50,683
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

806
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:53,025
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

807
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:54,654
Not before.

808
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:56,494
Good night.

809
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,711
- Ohris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

810
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:53,621
- Hi, Oarol.
- Hi, Ohris.

811
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,159
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

812
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:57,491
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

813
00:53:57,563 --> 00:53:58,552
Yeah?

814
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:00,393
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

815
00:54:00,466 --> 00:54:02,366
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

816
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:03,423
Why?

817
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:06,403
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

818
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:09,168
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

819
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,230
I'm coming.

820
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:11,867
- OK.
- OK.

821
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:13,170
Hello.

822
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:16,402
What a surprise.

823
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:17,807
I...

824
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:21,643
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

825
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:25,411
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

826
00:55:25,485 --> 00:55:28,079
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

827
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:32,414
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

828
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:35,657
I looked for you.

829
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,592
For what?

830
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:40,723
You're still so angry.

831
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:45,733
Where are you living?

832
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:49,099
In town. Why?

833
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:52,041
You live alone?

834
00:55:52,112 --> 00:55:55,639
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

835
00:55:57,117 --> 00:55:59,108
Oan I meet you for a drink?

836
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:01,051
Talk?

837
00:56:02,656 --> 00:56:05,489
Where can I reach you? Oome on.

838
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,722
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

839
00:56:08,796 --> 00:56:10,855
Look who I bumped into.

840
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:13,092
- Hi.
- Hi.

841
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,727
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

842
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:18,067
- You look great.
- Thanks.

843
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:20,832
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

844
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:24,036
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

845
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:26,739
Yeah. They've got a baby.

846
00:56:26,814 --> 00:56:28,942
You know Tom, all settled down.

847
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:31,611
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

848
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:34,018
This is my friend Oarol.
This is Nola.

849
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:56:35,924 --> 00:56:38,893
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

851
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,054
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

852
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,462
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

853
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:47,296
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

854
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:48,768
Say your phone number.

855
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:52,204
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

856
00:56:52,274 --> 00:56:53,935
- Ohris...
- Please.

857
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:56,068
Say your phone number.

858
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:04,276
02079460996.

859
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,249
I'll call you.

860
00:57:08,523 --> 00:57:09,512
Bye.

861
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:15,085
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

862
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:17,097
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

863
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,828
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

864
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:22,029
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

865
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,394
It's OK, John.

866
00:57:23,472 --> 00:57:25,269
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

867
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,104
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

868
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:29,701
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

869
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,939
- OK.
- See you at home.

870
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,002
Bye.

871
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,605
You have a very charming flat.

872
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:10,480
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

873
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,385
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

874
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,192
I mean, it's not perfect.

875
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,230
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

876
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,424
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

877
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,293
...you know, the lobby's decent.

878
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,303
The key word is it's cheap.

879
00:58:31,607 --> 00:58:33,199
What time is it?

880
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,402
Time for you to go.

881
00:58:36,979 --> 00:58:38,970
It's so hard to leave you.

882
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:45,243
Beautiful woman.

883
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,950
How'd you sleep?

884
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,494
Good.

885
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,334
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

886
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:02,394
about that earthquake in Ohina?

887
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:06,002
Terrible.

888
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,079
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

889
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,082
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

890
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,583
Yeah.

891
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:30,325
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

892
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,766
Papa's getting so into the idea.

893
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,027
It should be good for you.

894
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,374
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

895
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,675
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

896
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,738
...before you went to work.

897
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,877
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

898
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:52,410
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

899
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:57,420
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Oome on, it'll be fun.

900
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:00,127
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

901
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,468
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

902
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:16,980
Let me come up.

903
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:19,915
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

904
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:22,384
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

1
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:27,752
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

2
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,317
Oome on.

3
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,795
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

4
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,236
Hey, did you get that pest control?

5
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, yes. Yes.

6
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:46,008
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

7
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:47,543
It's much better than cheese,

8
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:49,943
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

9
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,413
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

10
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,972
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

11
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,245
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

12
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,308
Bye.

13
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,613
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

14
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,747
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

15
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,291
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

16
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,725
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

17
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,056
Yeah.

18
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,723
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

19
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,732
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

20
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,165
Heths didn't have a problem

21
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,169
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

22
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,205
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

23
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,467
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

24
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,701
- No.
- Yeah.

25
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:55,472
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

26
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,473
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

27
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,176
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

28
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,948
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

29
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:07,115
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

30
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,556
But she's just such an odd girl.

31
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:12,493
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

32
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,354
But something's just...

33
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:18,128
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

34
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,725
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

35
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:22,966
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

36
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,803
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

37
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,002
but, I don't know...

38
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:30,372
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

39
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:34,515
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

40
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,643
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Ohloe, let you know.

41
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,982
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

42
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:40,888
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

43
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,790
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

44
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,987
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

45
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,394
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

46
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,453
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

47
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,591
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

48
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:51,998
I know Tom's dying to get away.

49
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,661
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

50
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:54,726
Me?

51
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,899
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

52
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:01,034
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

53
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,874
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

54
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:05,141
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

55
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,241
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

56
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,718
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

57
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,913
I'd have sworn it was you.

58
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,149
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Ohris hailing a cab.

59
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,089
He's completely dependant on our driver.

60
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,421
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

61
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:21,260
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

62
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:24,494
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

63
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:28,095
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

64
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,368
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

65
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:32,806
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

66
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,241
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

67
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:35,437
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

68
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:36,501
Nuts.

69
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,213
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

70
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,145
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

71
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,414
Just the Sarazin people at two.

72
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:45,614
- Oan we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

73
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:48,920
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

74
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,657
Ohris. Where are you off to?

75
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,790
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

76
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,062
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

77
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:02,037
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

78
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:06,006
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

79
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,841
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

80
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:10,777
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

81
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,315
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Ohloe, it's just...

82
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,873
I don't wanna talk about Ohloe anymore!

83
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,078
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

84
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,054
- Ohris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

85
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:21,522
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

86
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,957
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

87
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,085
It's a hard field.

88
01:04:25,162 --> 01:04:27,653
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

89
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:30,564
Tom's mother was right.
Itjust gets to a point, you know?

90
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:32,397
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

91
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,461
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

92
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,576
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Ohloe.

93
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:44,304
Maybe I will.

94
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,781
Don't say that unless you mean it.

95
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,881
Ohloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

96
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,023
I mean, it's... mechanical.

97
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,392
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

98
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,734
Really. I mean it.

99
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,235
- Merry bloody Ohristmas.
- Lovely.

100
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:14,004
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

101
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,272
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

102
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,211
- Well, it is Ohristmas.
- It's such a pity.

103
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,441
- Oome on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

104
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,984
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

105
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,676
Hi.

106
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,085
I wanted to wish you a merry Ohristmas.

107
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,691
I've been thinking about you.

108
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:35,429
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

109
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,334
OK. See you then.

110
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,960
Bye-bye.

111
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:43,538
There you are, Ohris.

112
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,974
Ohloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

113
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,806
over the past few months.

114
01:05:48,879 --> 01:05:51,814
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

115
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:53,679
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

116
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,581
Well, who could have predicted these?

117
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,916
Look, I don't want
you and Ohloe to worry.

118
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:00,855
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

119
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:02,448
Oh, no, you've made Ohloe happy,

120
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,584
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

121
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:09,714
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Ohris?

122
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,158
Yes.

123
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:14,924
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

124
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:15,987
- Boat.
- Boat.

125
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,260
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

126
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,699
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

127
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:19,996
- What?
- No.

128
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,594
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

129
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:24,538
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

130
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,596
Oh, that reminds me,

131
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,143
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

132
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,200
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

133
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,804
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

134
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,712
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Orete.

135
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,772
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

136
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:37,376
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

137
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:38,443
Oh, God.

138
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,954
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

139
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,992
You know, I bought Ohris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

140
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,924
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

141
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,690
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

142
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:49,698
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

143
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:52,758
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

144
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:53,825
Poor thing.

145
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,497
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

146
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:57,562
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

147
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,335
I miss you.

148
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:02,140
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

149
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,679
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

150
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:05,908
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

151
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:08,041
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

152
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:09,745
When can you get here?

153
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,150
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

154
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,588
Look...

155
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,987
It's a three-day weekend.

156
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,818
Tuesday.

157
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:21,353
Ohris, I need to see you.

158
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:25,228
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

159
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,735
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

160
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,773
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

161
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,398
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

162
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,875
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

163
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:35,933
Jack Garner?

164
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:38,037
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

165
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,411
The traffic'll be terrible.

166
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,882
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

167
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:42,940
I don't mean today.

168
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,680
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

169
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:46,085
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

170
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:47,987
- Why did they do that?
- 'Oause it howls all night long.

171
01:08:48,058 --> 01:08:49,582
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

172
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,422
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

173
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,483
That's mean.

174
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,588
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

175
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,132
I've some lovely new horses.

176
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,792
Do you remember when
Ohris came here first,

177
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,836
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

178
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:01,996
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

179
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,903
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

180
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,565
- No.
- Yeah.

181
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,166
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

182
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,369
- Where from?
- Anyway...

183
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:10,845
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

184
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:13,747
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

185
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,310
Excuse me.

186
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,647
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

187
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,420
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

188
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,519
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

189
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:27,952
Hello?

190
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:30,226
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

191
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,668
Are you mad calling me here?

192
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,896
When are you coming over?

193
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:36,962
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

194
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,133
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

195
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:42,042
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

196
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:50,209
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

197
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,754
'Oause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

198
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:55,916
...horse for Ohris.
- They got it in the navy?

199
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,628
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

200
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,221
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

201
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,629
Well, they only had biscuits.

202
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,066
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Oordial originated...

203
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:09,902
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

204
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:13,101
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

205
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,440
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

206
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,776
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

207
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,012
It's no big deal.

208
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,243
I'll pop back into town.

209
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:25,343
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

210
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,082
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

211
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:28,784
Well, it is a pity because I...

212
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:31,053
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

213
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:32,492
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

214
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,689
but, you know,
Ohris has a lot of responsibility.

215
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,425
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

216
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,989
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

217
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,056
- Oan you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

218
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:39,202
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

219
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:41,898
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

220
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,768
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

221
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,398
but you couldn't wait.

222
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,210
What unbelievable bad luck.

223
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,077
Ohrist, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

224
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,979
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

225
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,847
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

226
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,943
Is that your interpretation?

227
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,079
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

228
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:01,749
not as part of some fertility project.

229
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,724
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

230
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,556
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

231
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,188
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

232
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,789
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

233
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,664
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

234
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,703
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

235
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,762
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

236
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,774
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

237
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,810
Why? You hate yourjob,
you hate your life.

238
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,574
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

239
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,342
Look, Nola, I have to go.

240
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,384
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

241
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,011
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

242
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,987
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

243
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:35,285
Ohris...

244
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:38,486
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

245
01:11:38,561 --> 01:11:41,086
I'm not walking away from this.

246
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,701
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

247
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:51,132
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

248
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,268
Us.

249
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:56,702
Is something wrong?

250
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:00,913
Yeah. There is.

251
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,407
What?

252
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,546
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

253
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,090
you know it's not a problem.

254
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,287
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Ohloe.

255
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:15,694
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

256
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:19,292
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

257
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:24,034
What is it?

258
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:31,911
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

259
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:36,280
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

260
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:43,057
Are you having an affair?

261
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:46,257
Am I having an affair?

262
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:48,422
Yeah, that's what I asked.

263
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:52,799
- No.
- You are.

264
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,064
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

265
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,373
Do you not love me anymore?

266
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,781
Of course I love you.

267
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:16,150
Well, what's wrong?

268
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:21,592
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

269
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:23,689
You're not. How?

270
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:29,331
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

271
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,633
I just...

272
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:37,678
...feel so guilty.

273
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:41,211
So terribly guilty.

274
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,616
Listen, Ohris.

275
01:13:43,686 --> 01:13:47,122
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

276
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:51,650
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

277
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:57,629
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

278
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:03,336
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

279
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,004
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

280
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,172
Oh, Ohloe.

281
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,352
Let's get off the subject.

282
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:25,417
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

283
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:29,261
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

284
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:34,893
I had to talk to somebody.

285
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:37,537
I'm really suffering.

286
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,701
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

287
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,936
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

288
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,306
But when the time came to tell her...

289
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,945
...I couldn't do it.

290
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,488
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

291
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,319
It's crazy.

292
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:01,324
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

293
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,761
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

294
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:07,166
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

295
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,830
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

296
01:15:09,906 --> 01:15:11,601
Right.

297
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,504
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

298
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,079
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Ohloe?

299
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:24,012
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

300
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:27,487
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

301
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,715
Is it for a woman you love?

302
01:15:29,792 --> 01:15:32,522
To live how? Where?

303
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:35,798
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

304
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,765
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

305
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:40,928
There must be anotherjob in another
firm that you can just, you know...

306
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,063
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

307
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,233
And he loves me.

308
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,844
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

309
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,506
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

310
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:55,379
We're going away for three weeks.

311
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:58,477
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

312
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:01,956
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

313
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:05,323
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

314
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,589
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

315
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,632
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

316
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,726
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

317
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,202
which is all you ever tell me...

318
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:18,069
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

319
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,310
It's a big blow.

320
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:23,538
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

321
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:26,980
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

322
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,142
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

323
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:31,812
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

324
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,981
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

325
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:38,288
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

326
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:40,386
Hey, keep your voice down.

327
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:43,594
You know I make love to her.

328
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,157
And you know it's just routine.

329
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:49,667
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

330
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,633
Yeah.

331
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,810
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

332
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,541
It will.

333
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,078
- It will.
- OK.

334
01:17:07,757 --> 01:17:09,520
The holiday's off.

335
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,059
Why? What happened?

336
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,288
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

337
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:15,525
Why?

338
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:17,998
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

339
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,864
Anyway, he needs recovery time

340
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:23,167
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

341
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,706
Let me just pack up my stuff.

342
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:27,334
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

343
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,071
Yeah.

344
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,185
Hello?

345
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,166
Hello?

346
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,191
An opportunity has arisen, Ohris,

347
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,252
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

348
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,319
Really?

349
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:24,423
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

350
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,628
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

351
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:32,106
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

352
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,404
assuming our predictions are correct.

353
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:35,876
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

354
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,937
Eleanor. I've just
told Ohris the good news.

355
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:41,916
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

356
01:18:41,984 --> 01:18:44,043
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

357
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,111
You already are a young grandmother.

358
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,452
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

359
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,515
but I'd like you to be a mother.

360
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,823
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

361
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,058
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

362
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,861
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

363
01:18:57,933 --> 01:18:59,901
Great. You forgot.

364
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:02,597
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

365
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,367
So my hints worked.

366
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,534
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

367
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:08,599
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

368
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:10,942
- Hello?
- Ohris?

369
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,241
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

370
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:13,804
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

371
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:15,475
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

372
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,143
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

373
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,515
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

374
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,851
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

375
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:23,481
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

376
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:24,890
I've been waiting a week.

377
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,858
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

378
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:29,957
When are you coming home?

379
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,531
In about two weeks.

380
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,262
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

381
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,701
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

382
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,568
Ohris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

383
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,540
OK. OK...

384
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:41,438
Who is that? What country are you in?

385
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,569
Your mobile's been impossible.

386
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,073
I told you. I'm in Greece.

387
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,616
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

388
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:51,278
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

389
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,282
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

390
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,789
Oan you just?

391
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,419
Please tell Ohloe
as soon as you get home.

392
01:19:58,494 --> 01:20:01,224
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

393
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:03,561
Do you miss me?

394
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,623
OK. Bye, bye.

395
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,899
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

396
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,700
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

397
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:40,029
Ohris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

398
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,027
Sardinia.

399
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:44,368
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

400
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,314
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

401
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,183
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

402
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:06,519
You lied to me.

403
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,153
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

404
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,720
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Ohloe!

405
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:11,562
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Ohloe.

406
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:12,623
Look, Ohrist, Ohrist.

407
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,895
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

408
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,197
I wanna talk to Ohloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

409
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,431
I can explain. I... Taxi!

410
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:17,836
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

411
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,137
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Oalm down.

412
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:23,042
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Oalm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

413
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,602
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

414
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,171
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Ohloe.

415
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,843
- I wanna talk to Ohloe!
- Oalm down. Oalm the fuck down!

416
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:33,787
I wanna talk to Ohloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

417
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,755
You're a liar!

418
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:42,630
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

419
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,528
I only came back
the day before yesterday

420
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,761
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Ohloe

421
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:49,669
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

422
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,672
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

423
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,537
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

424
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:54,940
I was about to when you called.

425
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,068
What does that have to do with anything?

426
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,305
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

427
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,903
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

428
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,006
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

429
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,745
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

430
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:06,253
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

431
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:07,914
Well, she has to know eventually.

432
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,225
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

433
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,281
Nola, stop!

434
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,624
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

435
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:15,254
We don't have to have a child together.

436
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,094
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

437
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,225
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

438
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,566
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

439
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:25,300
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

440
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,308
Nola, be reasonable.

441
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:30,368
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

442
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,607
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

443
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:34,012
So, you're threatening me?

444
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,677
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

445
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:38,611
Were you lying to me?

446
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,187
All those times we made love,

447
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,248
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

448
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,850
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Ohloe.

449
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:49,762
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

450
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:54,495
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

451
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:50,983
Have you seen Ohris?

452
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:53,044
A minute ago. He went that way.

453
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:55,184
Ohris?

454
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,118
Ohris?

455
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,090
Ohris?

456
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:09,663
Where are you, Ohris?

457
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,930
Ohris?

458
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,742
Ohloe, are you there?

459
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,281
Have you seen Ohris anywhere?

460
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:22,647
No. Oould you come up for a minute?

461
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:25,346
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

462
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,945
Yeah, OK.

463
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,440
I'm telling Ohloe tomorrow.

464
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,247
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

465
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,312
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Ohris.

466
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,415
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

467
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,359
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

468
01:26:06,428 --> 01:26:08,453
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

469
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,294
My theory is you want me to tell Ohloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

470
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:14,096
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

471
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,693
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

472
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:18,865
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

473
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:21,409
Look, Ohris,
if I don't do something about this,

474
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:23,536
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

475
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:26,137
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

476
01:26:26,215 --> 01:26:28,274
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

477
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:31,649
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

478
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:33,681
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

479
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:37,987
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

480
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,550
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

481
01:26:39,628 --> 01:26:43,189
Yeah. Ohris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

482
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,459
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

483
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,927
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

484
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,199
Did you hate it?

485
01:26:51,273 --> 01:26:53,935
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

486
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:55,874
I thought you were gonna pass out.

487
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,242
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

488
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,514
I still can't do it with you tonight.

489
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:06,019
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

490
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,255
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

491
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:14,454
No. What are you doing?

492
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,191
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

493
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:18,199
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

494
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:22,135
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

495
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:23,933
'Oause I don't know
where else it can be.

496
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:26,839
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

497
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:31,968
Is this it?

498
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,607
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

499
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:36,617
I've got to have words
with her about it.

500
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:38,277
It's really...

501
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,082
What did you just put in your pocket?

502
01:27:40,155 --> 01:27:42,783
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

503
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,223
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

504
01:27:44,293 --> 01:27:45,988
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

505
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:47,619
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

506
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:50,290
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

507
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,559
- Guess what?
- What?

508
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:54,033
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

509
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,093
You haven't. That's not like you.

510
01:27:56,171 --> 01:27:58,401
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

511
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,306
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

512
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,071
No, that's not so.

513
01:28:03,145 --> 01:28:06,603
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

514
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:08,616
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

515
01:28:08,684 --> 01:28:11,050
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

516
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,848
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

517
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,516
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

518
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,586
You're so sweet.

519
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:22,129
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

520
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:27,965
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

521
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,833
OK, I will.

522
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,470
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

523
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,007
When you get off work today,
come right home.

524
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:41,106
I have some good news.

525
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,548
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

526
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:47,486
You've got to meet me
right after work.

527
01:28:47,556 --> 01:28:50,252
We have... plans to make.

528
01:28:51,226 --> 01:28:54,525
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

529
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,325
It's good. This is good.

530
01:28:56,398 --> 01:28:59,196
I'll see you soon. Bye.

531
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:01,668
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

532
01:29:04,206 --> 01:29:07,266
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

533
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,503
Is that right, Ohris? A half year?

534
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:10,567
Yes.

535
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:13,274
A half year should do it, maybe less.

536
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,010
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

537
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:24,120
Good.

538
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:28,362
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

539
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,523
for developing their capacity.

540
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:33,124
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

541
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,980
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

542
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:50,509
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

543
01:30:57,085 --> 01:31:00,213
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Ohris.

544
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,916
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

545
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,219
We met here last...

546
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,692
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

547
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:08,753
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

548
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:13,395
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

549
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,062
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

550
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:19,130
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

551
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,101
I'm Ohris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

552
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:24,577
Well, what's the trouble?

553
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:27,479
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

554
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:31,485
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

555
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:35,045
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

556
01:31:35,123 --> 01:31:36,147
Yes.

557
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:40,183
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

558
01:31:40,262 --> 01:31:43,459
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

559
01:31:43,532 --> 01:31:45,523
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

560
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,591
I have to take my medicine.

561
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:07,582
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

562
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:33,604
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

563
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:18,062
Mrs. Eastby?

564
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:23,200
It's lan.

565
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,216
Mrs. Eastby?

566
01:36:36,991 --> 01:36:39,221
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

567
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:44,954
I'm going down the corner shop.
Oan I get you anything?

568
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,966
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

569
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,819
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

570
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:19,560
D'you ever get that
portable OD player we talked about?

571
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:21,693
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

572
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,759
Excellent.

573
01:37:39,721 --> 01:37:42,189
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

574
01:38:12,787 --> 01:38:14,118
Nola.

575
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,932
Excuse me.

576
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:36,900
Hello.

577
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:38,943
Where are you?

578
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,708
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

579
01:39:14,415 --> 01:39:15,848
- Good evening.
- Hello.

580
01:39:20,889 --> 01:39:22,948
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

581
01:39:23,024 --> 01:39:24,514
Two pounds.

582
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,655
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

583
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:50,675
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

584
01:39:50,752 --> 01:39:52,811
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

585
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,878
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

586
01:39:54,956 --> 01:39:56,287
As he, or they, were running out

587
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:58,848
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

588
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:00,224
Either out of panic,

589
01:40:00,295 --> 01:40:03,287
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

590
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:05,958
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

591
01:40:06,034 --> 01:40:08,161
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

592
01:40:08,236 --> 01:40:10,602
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

593
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:13,038
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

594
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:14,438
Probably cased her.

595
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,875
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

596
01:40:16,945 --> 01:40:18,970
She picked the wrong time to come home.

597
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,675
Some people just don't have any luck.

598
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,675
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

599
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:27,653
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

600
01:40:27,722 --> 01:40:29,349
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

601
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:30,618
Do you need anything from the car?

602
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:32,717
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

603
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:36,059
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

604
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,030
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

605
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:39,828
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

606
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:41,232
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

607
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:44,066
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

608
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:45,867
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

609
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:48,568
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

610
01:40:48,643 --> 01:40:50,611
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

611
01:40:50,678 --> 01:40:52,407
Oould we send the
photographers in now, please?

612
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,606
No, hang on. If you just wait.

613
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:56,047
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

614
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:59,382
Ohris, Ohris, can you
liaise with this man here?

615
01:40:59,454 --> 01:41:01,945
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

616
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:04,423
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

617
01:41:04,492 --> 01:41:06,357
Scenes of Orime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

618
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:07,724
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

619
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:09,956
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

620
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:11,931
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

621
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,434
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

622
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:17,835
Nothing. It was a portable OD player
which reads MP3s, OD rewrites...

623
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,930
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

624
01:41:20,008 --> 01:41:22,101
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

625
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:23,438
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

626
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:26,378
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

627
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,540
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

628
01:41:28,616 --> 01:41:30,015
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

629
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:33,451
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

630
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,818
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

631
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:36,584
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

632
01:41:36,657 --> 01:41:38,750
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

633
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:41,818
They can make them pretty small.
Oatherine, love, you can't park there.

634
01:41:41,896 --> 01:41:44,091
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOOO coming down.

635
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,130
Did you like the musical last night?

636
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:52,772
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

637
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,240
Yeah, he's very good.

638
01:41:55,877 --> 01:41:58,004
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

639
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:00,138
Good.

640
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:06,375
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

641
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:10,680
Oh, my God! Nola!

642
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:13,522
- Nola Rice.
- What?

643
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:17,524
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

644
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:21,158
What? Here, let me see that.

645
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:23,032
Jesus Ohrist!

646
01:42:27,008 --> 01:42:29,067
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

647
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:33,102
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

648
01:42:33,181 --> 01:42:35,672
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

649
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,743
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

650
01:42:39,821 --> 01:42:42,085
Oh, my God.

651
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:49,186
Hello?

652
01:42:50,098 --> 01:42:52,794
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

653
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:54,459
Isn't itjust terrible?

654
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:57,800
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

655
01:42:57,872 --> 01:43:00,898
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

656
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,169
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

657
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:05,472
I know.

658
01:43:05,546 --> 01:43:08,106
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

659
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,911
Hello?

660
01:43:09,984 --> 01:43:12,475
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

661
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:15,420
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

662
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,855
I suppose she must've...

663
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:19,586
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

664
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,924
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

665
01:43:21,996 --> 01:43:23,725
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

666
01:43:23,798 --> 01:43:25,993
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

667
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:29,332
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

668
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:31,303
over the past year.

669
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:34,000
Did you hear that? Yeah.

670
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:38,444
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

671
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:46,184
Mummy.

672
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:50,313
I've got something to tell you.

673
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,416
But I want Ohris to be here.

674
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:55,593
Ohris?

675
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:58,655
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

676
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:00,724
He was just in here. Ohris?

677
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,393
Ohris?

678
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:12,076
He was just here.

679
01:44:12,146 --> 01:44:13,807
Well, what did you want to tell me?

680
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:16,349
Just wait. Wait, wait. Ohris?

681
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:50,844
Where are you? Ohris?

682
01:44:52,353 --> 01:44:53,615
Well, what did you want to tell me?

683
01:44:53,688 --> 01:44:55,383
Well, I just really want him to be here.

684
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:57,788
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

685
01:44:58,326 --> 01:45:00,453
- Oan we tell her now?
- Sure.

686
01:45:00,528 --> 01:45:02,758
Well, I wanted you to be here.

687
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,388
Well, what is it?

688
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:05,932
Mummy...

689
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,764
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

690
01:45:08,836 --> 01:45:10,565
It looks like I'm pregnant.

691
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,902
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

692
01:45:12,974 --> 01:45:16,774
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

693
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:18,901
Alec?

694
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,676
Alec? Oome here.

695
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:24,316
We're both walking on air.

696
01:45:24,385 --> 01:45:27,548
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

697
01:45:27,622 --> 01:45:29,487
- 'Oause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

698
01:45:29,557 --> 01:45:30,819
Ohloe's pregnant.

699
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:33,359
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

700
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:35,827
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

701
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,523
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

702
01:45:37,598 --> 01:45:38,587
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

703
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,190
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

704
01:45:40,268 --> 01:45:42,634
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

705
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:46,503
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Oongratulations! That's wonderful.

706
01:45:46,574 --> 01:45:48,007
Thank you, Margaret.

707
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:50,410
Sam?

708
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:53,038
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

709
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:55,014
Detective Mike Banner, called.

710
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:58,210
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

711
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:01,746
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

712
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,756
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

713
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:05,223
I bet it was that night...

714
01:46:05,293 --> 01:46:08,558
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

715
01:46:11,065 --> 01:46:14,523
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

716
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:16,763
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

717
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:19,032
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

718
01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:20,698
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

719
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:23,335
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

720
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:28,643
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

721
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:31,879
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

722
01:46:31,952 --> 01:46:34,785
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Oongratulations!

723
01:46:34,855 --> 01:46:36,618
Detective Banner, please.

724
01:46:36,691 --> 01:46:38,682
This is Ohris Wilton.

725
01:46:42,363 --> 01:46:43,352
Oh, hello.

726
01:46:43,431 --> 01:46:45,922
This is Ohris Wilton. You called?

727
01:46:46,033 --> 01:46:48,900
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

728
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:51,199
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

729
01:46:51,272 --> 01:46:54,708
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

730
01:46:54,775 --> 01:46:58,040
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

731
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,145
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

732
01:47:03,217 --> 01:47:05,208
I certainly hope not.

733
01:48:11,786 --> 01:48:14,346
- Ohris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

734
01:48:14,422 --> 01:48:17,414
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

735
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:20,316
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

736
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:24,455
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

737
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:28,762
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

738
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:31,202
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

739
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:33,068
How?

740
01:48:33,974 --> 01:48:37,239
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

741
01:48:37,311 --> 01:48:39,040
That's...

742
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:41,840
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

743
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:46,915
They broke up. A year ago. More.

744
01:48:48,389 --> 01:48:50,380
When did you last see her?

745
01:48:51,292 --> 01:48:53,624
Oh, God, I can't remember.

746
01:48:57,064 --> 01:49:00,295
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

747
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,801
But that was a long time ago.

748
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:06,299
Have you seen her since?

749
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,504
Not that I recall.

750
01:49:11,245 --> 01:49:12,906
Have?

751
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:15,548
Have you ever seen this?

752
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:18,508
No. What is it?

753
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,414
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

754
01:49:31,932 --> 01:49:33,593
No.

755
01:49:34,602 --> 01:49:36,593
As you can see...

756
01:49:37,204 --> 01:49:39,604
...you're all over it.

757
01:49:46,847 --> 01:49:49,213
Yes, I can see that.

758
01:49:52,453 --> 01:49:54,648
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

759
01:49:54,722 --> 01:49:57,247
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

760
01:50:00,294 --> 01:50:03,855
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

761
01:50:04,498 --> 01:50:06,830
But you people have to protect me here.

762
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:10,566
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

763
01:50:10,638 --> 01:50:12,629
How long did your affair go on?

764
01:50:17,845 --> 01:50:20,746
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

765
01:50:21,515 --> 01:50:23,676
They broke up, she moved away.

766
01:50:24,752 --> 01:50:28,518
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

767
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,949
God, have a heart.

768
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:36,127
My wife is gonna have a baby.

769
01:50:36,397 --> 01:50:38,661
This will devastate her.

770
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:41,266
Did you...

771
01:50:41,602 --> 01:50:45,504
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

772
01:50:45,873 --> 01:50:47,966
No, I did not.

773
01:50:48,342 --> 01:50:50,674
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

774
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,944
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

775
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:03,084
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

776
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,421
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

777
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,551
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

778
01:51:09,296 --> 01:51:12,231
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

779
01:51:12,299 --> 01:51:15,962
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

780
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:20,666
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

781
01:51:20,741 --> 01:51:22,766
But you did lead her on,

782
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:25,641
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

783
01:51:26,313 --> 01:51:28,611
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

784
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:31,446
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

785
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:37,757
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

786
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:41,259
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

787
01:51:41,328 --> 01:51:43,421
much less Nola Rice.

788
01:51:48,769 --> 01:51:51,670
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

789
01:51:51,739 --> 01:51:53,764
and she walked in when it was happening?

790
01:51:55,643 --> 01:51:59,170
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

791
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:01,571
...wreck people's lives.

792
01:52:01,649 --> 01:52:04,743
My family, my marriage is at stake.

793
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:08,447
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

794
01:52:08,522 --> 01:52:10,922
OK, but I'm not your man.

795
01:52:11,425 --> 01:52:14,656
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

796
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,958
but that does not make me a murderer.

797
01:52:17,131 --> 01:52:20,066
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

798
01:52:20,134 --> 01:52:22,125
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

799
01:52:22,202 --> 01:52:23,794
And if we have to talk to you again,

800
01:52:23,871 --> 01:52:26,203
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

801
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:27,797
Your personal life's your own.

802
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:31,743
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

803
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:44,015
I understand.

804
01:52:44,925 --> 01:52:46,586
Look...

805
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,855
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

806
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:50,920
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

807
01:52:50,998 --> 01:52:52,966
please call me on my mobile.

808
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,459
This is my number.

809
01:52:57,337 --> 01:52:58,929
Thanks.

810
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,629
One other thing.

811
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:03,108
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

812
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:06,746
Me?

813
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:08,141
No.

814
01:53:08,215 --> 01:53:12,083
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

815
01:53:12,152 --> 01:53:14,347
You can check it out, but...

816
01:53:15,322 --> 01:53:19,281
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

817
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:21,452
Of course.

818
01:53:24,431 --> 01:53:26,422
Thank you.

819
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:37,033
So, what do you think?

820
01:53:37,578 --> 01:53:39,375
I think it's what it looks like.

821
01:53:39,446 --> 01:53:41,505
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

822
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:45,143
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

823
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:49,748
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

824
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:51,814
He's 'specting a baby.

825
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:54,426
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

826
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:57,189
...we can find out discreetly enough

827
01:53:57,264 --> 01:54:00,256
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

828
01:54:02,136 --> 01:54:06,197
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

829
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:09,106
never mind sawing one off.

830
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:12,902
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

831
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:14,709
Not even a speeding ticket.

832
01:54:14,782 --> 01:54:17,580
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

833
01:54:17,651 --> 01:54:19,983
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

834
01:54:20,053 --> 01:54:22,283
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

835
01:54:22,356 --> 01:54:23,846
Well, come on, Mike.

836
01:54:23,924 --> 01:54:25,755
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

837
01:54:25,826 --> 01:54:27,987
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

838
01:54:28,061 --> 01:54:30,359
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

839
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:33,422
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

840
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:38,096
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

841
01:54:38,172 --> 01:54:41,198
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

842
01:54:41,275 --> 01:54:43,140
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

843
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:46,577
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

844
01:54:46,647 --> 01:54:48,945
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

845
01:54:49,016 --> 01:54:51,746
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

846
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,164
Ohris.

847
01:57:01,148 --> 01:57:02,877
Nola...

848
01:57:04,952 --> 01:57:07,216
...it wasn't easy.

849
01:57:08,188 --> 01:57:10,952
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

850
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:15,851
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

851
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:21,662
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

852
01:57:22,836 --> 01:57:24,599
You have to.

853
01:57:24,671 --> 01:57:27,196
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

854
01:57:27,274 --> 01:57:29,435
And what about me?

855
01:57:29,509 --> 01:57:32,239
What about the next-door neighbor?

856
01:57:33,013 --> 01:57:36,005
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

857
01:57:37,451 --> 01:57:42,354
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

858
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:48,694
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

859
01:57:50,764 --> 01:57:53,028
You were collateral damage.

860
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:55,568
So was your own child.

861
01:57:59,806 --> 01:58:01,797
Sophocles said:

862
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:05,471
"To never have been born

863
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,570
may be the greatest boon of all."

864
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:13,249
Prepare to pay the price, Ohris.

865
01:58:14,154 --> 01:58:16,315
Your actions were clumsy.

866
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:18,085
Full of holes.

867
01:58:18,158 --> 01:58:21,355
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

868
01:58:24,865 --> 01:58:27,834
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

869
01:58:27,901 --> 01:58:29,801
and punished.

870
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:34,668
At least there would be
some small sign ofjustice.

871
01:58:34,741 --> 01:58:37,710
Some small...

872
01:58:38,412 --> 01:58:41,848
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

873
01:58:44,251 --> 01:58:47,414
Ohris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

874
01:58:47,487 --> 01:58:49,250
What?

875
01:58:50,457 --> 01:58:52,015
It's as we speculated

876
01:58:52,092 --> 01:58:54,492
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

877
01:58:54,561 --> 01:58:57,655
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

878
01:58:57,731 --> 01:58:59,426
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

879
01:58:59,499 --> 01:59:00,488
He waited in the hall.

880
01:59:00,567 --> 01:59:02,467
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

881
01:59:02,536 --> 01:59:05,801
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

882
01:59:05,872 --> 01:59:07,999
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

883
01:59:08,075 --> 01:59:10,339
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

884
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:12,935
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

885
01:59:13,013 --> 01:59:14,480
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

886
01:59:14,548 --> 01:59:16,743
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

887
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:18,580
and I am going to break this case.

888
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:20,483
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

889
01:59:20,554 --> 01:59:21,543
What?

890
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:23,555
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

891
01:59:23,623 --> 01:59:24,885
What's the bad news?

892
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:27,859
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

893
01:59:27,928 --> 01:59:30,658
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

894
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:33,961
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

895
01:59:34,034 --> 01:59:35,729
No, he didn't have to.

896
01:59:35,802 --> 01:59:38,999
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

897
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:42,938
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

898
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:47,141
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

899
01:59:47,214 --> 01:59:49,512
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

900
01:59:49,583 --> 01:59:51,847
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

901
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:54,551
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

902
01:59:55,155 --> 01:59:57,180
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

903
01:59:57,257 --> 01:59:59,088
Oome on, I'll buy you breakfast.

904
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:01,491
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

905
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:02,960
No, wait.

906
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:07,022
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

907
02:00:08,435 --> 02:00:11,802
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

908
02:00:11,872 --> 02:00:14,602
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

909
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:16,539
Oome on.

910
02:00:17,878 --> 02:00:19,140
I give up.

911
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,009
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

912
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:23,413
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

913
02:00:23,483 --> 02:00:26,816
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

914
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:30,285
What a world. Am I right?

915
02:00:30,757 --> 02:00:33,749
Oareful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

916
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:36,819
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

917
02:00:36,897 --> 02:00:38,831
Right. Ohampagne.

918
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:41,129
- I think he's got your eyes, Ohloe.
- Really?

919
02:00:41,201 --> 02:00:43,567
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

920
02:00:43,637 --> 02:00:46,902
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

921
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:49,799
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

922
02:00:49,876 --> 02:00:52,538
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Ohristopher.

923
02:00:52,612 --> 02:00:56,104
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

924
02:00:56,183 --> 02:00:58,549
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

925
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:00,108
Let's work on number two. Oome on.

926
02:01:00,187 --> 02:01:03,520
Oome on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

927
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:04,852
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

928
02:01:04,925 --> 02:01:06,984
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

929
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:08,391
- Ohloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

930
02:01:08,461 --> 02:01:09,985
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

931
02:01:10,063 --> 02:01:12,190
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

932
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:13,254
Please do.

933
02:01:13,333 --> 02:01:14,391
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

934
02:01:14,467 --> 02:01:16,697
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

935
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:19,170
With parents like Ohloe and Ohris,

936
02:01:19,239 --> 02:01:22,037
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

937
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:23,632
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

938
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:25,644
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

939
02:01:25,712 --> 02:01:27,043
I just hope that he's lucky.

940
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,740
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

941
02:01:28,815 --> 02:01:30,146
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

942
02:01:30,217 --> 02:01:32,048
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

943
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:34,951
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

944
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:36,420
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

945
02:01:36,489 --> 02:01:37,786
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

946
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:40,018
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

947
02:01:42,162 --> 02:01:43,561
What are you saying about him?

948
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:45,655
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

949
02:01:45,732 --> 02:01:49,691
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

950
02:01:49,769 --> 02:01:51,031
I wonder what he's thinking.

951
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,366
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

952
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:54,100
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

953
02:01:54,174 --> 02:01:56,108
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

954
02:01:56,176 --> 02:01:58,838
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.

955
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:16,071
THE END
