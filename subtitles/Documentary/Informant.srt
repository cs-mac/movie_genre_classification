1
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,315
Newswoman:
<i>We turn now to a story</i>
<i>out of Austin, Texas,</i>

2
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,218
<i>that's shocked social justice</i>
<i>activists nation wide.</i>

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,488
<i>Brandon Darby has admitted</i>
<i>to wearing recording devices</i>

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,090
<i>and wearing a transmitter</i>
<i>embedded in his belt.</i>

5
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,594
<i>He's expected to testify</i>
<i>in the trial of two</i>
<i>Texas activists</i>

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,430
<i>who were arrested on charges</i>
<i>of making and possessing</i>
<i>Molotov cocktails.</i>

7
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:40,272
Newsman: <i>Two Texas men are</i>
<i>charged with plotting to attack</i>
<i>police with Molotov cocktails.</i>

8
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,375
Newswoman: <i>David McKay and</i>
<i>Bradley Crowder could face up</i>
<i>to ten years in prison.</i>

9
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,811
Man: <i>To say that</i>
<i>Brandon Darby didn't give</i>
<i>those guys a fair chance</i>

10
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:51,450
<i>It's a travesty what he did.</i>
<i>It's a travesty what he did.</i>

11
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,563
Where am I looking?

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,398
Interviewer:
<i>Look straight into the camera.</i>

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
It's not looking
straight at me.

14
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,102
<i>You're looking</i>
<i>straight at it right now.</i>

15
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:12,638
- Am I?
- <i>Yep, yeah.</i>

16
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,211
- Tell me when.
- <i>We're ready. We're rolling.</i>

17
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,148
I'm gonna start over.
I'm sorry, man.

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,659
I've received a lot
of direct death threats.

19
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,228
I've had to go to trial
and testify

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,631
against someone
sending me death threats.

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,669
People put images of me
with "kill him" on the Internet.

22
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,105
The U.S. Attorney's office
offered me

23
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,241
the witness protection program,
but this is my home.

24
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,478
This group,
they use Molotov cocktails,
they threaten violence.

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,613
No it doesn't work, man.

26
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,683
Because it's not about them,
it's about the whole
fucking Left

27
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,885
and their support
of these fuckers.

28
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,255
<i>Okay, let's just get you,</i>
<i>just talk, speak your mind.</i>

29
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,458
- Okay...
-  <i>And just try to focus</i>
<i>on this...</i>

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,562
<i>- and just tell it to us.</i>
<i>- Okay, go ahead, man.</i>

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,268
This is my home.
I'm not going to leave.

32
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,545
<i>(helicopter blades whirring)</i>

33
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:32,618
<i>as the founder</i>
<i>of the New Orleans-based</i>
<i>group Common Ground Relief,</i>

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,921
<i>which he helped start after</i>
<i>Hurricane Katrina.</i>

35
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,489
How's this?

36
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,692
- What is that?
- Interviewer: Interview...

37
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,363
Where do I look?

38
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,565
-  <i>Always in the camera.</i>
<i>- Into that thing?</i>

39
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,367
Strange.

40
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,636
<i>One second for the focus.</i>

41
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,437
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'm ready.</i>

42
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,342
<i>My name is Brandon Darby</i>
<i>and I work with the Common</i>
<i>Ground Collective</i>

43
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:01,413
<i>in New Orleans, Louisiana.</i>
<i>We're in the Lower Ninth Ward.</i>

44
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,650
<i>We've been here between</i>
<i>four and five months,</i>

45
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,587
working with... with people
from around the country,
and with locals.

46
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,624
To get water and food
and medicine, medical care...

47
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,297
<i>The people here</i>
<i>were left to die.</i>

48
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,435
What I saw was awful.
You know?

49
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,572
If I'd had
an appropriate weapon

50
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,607
I would have,
I would have attacked
my government

51
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,276
for what they
were doing to people.
I honestly would have.

52
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,283
Newsman: <i>Much of New Orleans</i>
<i>is flooded, and now we're</i>
<i>having to deal with it.</i>

53
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,285
Newsman 2:
<i>It's just this</i>
<i>incredible misery.</i>

54
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,454
<i>We were at the New Orleans</i>
<i>Convention Center today...</i>

55
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,556
You turn the TV
on and you see these images,

56
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,558
and you're like,
what's going on?

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,662
Newsman: <i>...with their babies,</i>
<i>literally living in raw sewage.</i>

58
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,466
Brandon: <i>It was like wow,</i>
<i>this is fucked up.</i>

59
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,302
You know, this is wrong.
How could this happen?

60
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:02,007
Newsman:
<i>Just a horrible scene</i>
<i>down there.</i>

61
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,778
And my friend's there,
and I couldn't get him
to leave before the storm.

62
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,481
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>if he was alive or dead.</i>

63
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,384
<i>And it bothered me...</i>
<i>profoundly.</i>

64
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:16,755
'Cause you can't really
know the guy and not,
not care about...

65
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,324
you know not like the guy,
you know, like he's one
of those people.

66
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,493
I began to call people,
and I said hey,

67
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,730
"You know,
we should go get King,
you know?"

68
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,533
We're talking and he says,
man, let's go get him.

69
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,670
<i>So we arrive.</i>

70
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,275
<i>We had gone through</i>
<i>what used to be a neighborhood.</i>

71
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,279
<i>And we saw</i>
<i>dead bodies everywhere.</i>

72
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,715
I wasn't even
ready to deal with it.

73
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,290
Brandon:
<i>Some people had returned,</i>
<i>to look for loved ones.</i>

74
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,760
<i>There was a guy whose dad</i>
<i>stayed in a yellow house.</i>

75
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,462
A little ways up the road
we saw a part of a yellow house,

76
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,898
and we had this big debate
on whether we should go tell him

77
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,334
or let him find it
for himself?

78
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,772
And we decided that emotionally
we couldn't handle it.

79
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,808
So we let him
find it for himself.

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,411
And we had a lot
of those experiences,

81
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,414
going into the city
of New Orleans.

82
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,716
And it was really fucking sad,
you know?

83
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,586
Scott: <i>So he gets in his truck</i>
<i>and he goes across the bridge.</i>

84
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,325
Brandon:
<i>I was just determined that,</i>

85
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,761
there was no way in hell
that I was not go and get King,

86
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,631
or at least know if he was dead,
you know? There's no way.

87
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,800
That's it there.

88
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,402
So this was all underwater.

89
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,874
<i>I parked my truck</i>
<i>and I started walking.</i>

90
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,678
<i>I ended up under an overpass.</i>

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,749
<i>The law enforcement</i>
<i>on the overpass stopped me</i>
<i>and told me I couldn't be there.</i>

92
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,120
<i>And I said you're up there,</i>
<i>I'm down here.</i>

93
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,522
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>Tough shit, you know?</i>

94
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,691
<i>And they talked</i>
<i>and they were like,</i>
<i>let us call you an airboat.</i>

95
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>I get in the airboat--</i>
<i>it's Army Rangers.</i>

96
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,763
<i>And they're like, well,</i>
<i>this is gonna take too long.</i>

97
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,566
And I started getting this
really weird feeling that they
weren't actually

98
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,434
trying to help me
go get my friend.

99
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,705
The one thing I had going for me
<i>was everyone was afraid</i>
<i>of the water.</i>

100
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:18,710
And then I said,
"You can get me at my friend's
house at this address."

101
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,548
I got on a fencepost.
And I think it's
that fence post.

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,752
And I just held on
to the fence post,
so I could stay up.

103
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,721
And they were saying things
like, "You're gonna get so sick
from that water.

104
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,723
You need to get
out the water now.
Come back."

105
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,993
And I was like,
"No-- Go get my friend,
and I'll get in your boat.

106
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,462
Sorry, go get him and
then I'll get in your boat."

107
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,598
And then I had
a cell phone call.

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,802
Cause I had my phone
in my mouth when I swam
from here to over there.

109
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,804
And it was him.
He was like, "Brandon."

110
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,806
And I was like, "Oh shit,
where are you at?

111
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,808
You don't know what,
the situation I'm in.

112
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,810
Where are you?
Don't tell me you're in Texas."

113
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,812
And he was like,
"No, I'm in this boat
with these Rangers."

114
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,480
And I was like, oh shit.

115
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,950
It was the Army Rangers who had
initially picked me up.

116
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,620
And they,
they went to his
address and got him.

117
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:05,490
In a moment, in a, you know,
flash of an eye,

118
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:10,562
how the whole infrastructure
could just dissolve.

119
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,867
<i>I had been surrounded</i>
<i>by water by this time about</i>
<i>maybe ten days.</i>

120
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,637
"Your friend sent us to get you.
<i>Do you know Brandon?"</i>

121
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,507
<i>I said, "Yeah"</i>
<i>and I just laughed</i>
<i>and said, "Wow."</i>

122
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,511
Brandon calls. "I got King."
And man, I cried.

123
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,915
And I cried, like it was one
of the most joyous
times of my life.

124
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,451
<i>Cause I'd almost given up</i>
<i>hope that he would be alive.</i>

125
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,504
You have all kind of signs
all over the community

126
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,807
saying that we kill looters,
but what constitutes a looter?

127
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,779
Scott:
<i>They put all these</i>
<i>really hateful signs.</i>

128
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,814
But then they decided
to take it on themselves

129
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,651
to have armed militia patrols.

130
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,887
These guys were
policing their community,

131
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,824
and they identified
enemy as black.

132
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,594
And so they had in fact
become racist and because

133
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,096
they were armed
and they were using that,
they were using force,

134
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,499
they had become
racist militias.

135
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,269
Scott: <i>We go and we cover up</i>
<i>a dead body that was</i>
<i>bullet-riddled.</i>

136
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,572
And the question is,
who killed this man?

137
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,075
And then there's
another one two streets over.

138
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,043
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>who killed this man?</i>

139
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,746
- Was it the vigilantes?
- We shot 'em!

140
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,016
- Woman: <i>They were looters!</i>
<i>- You had to do what you</i>
<i>had to do.</i>

141
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,920
If you had to shoot somebody
you had to shoot somebody.

142
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,590
Don't go into a white
woman's home and tell her
you're gonna take it over.

143
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,692
- Woman:
<i>No. You don't do that.</i>
<i>-</i> No.

144
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,761
We don't allow
that around <i>these</i> parts.

145
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,932
No way is this happening.
Not in front of me, you know?

146
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,902
Not in front of me,
I'm not letting this happen.

147
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,904
Even if it kills me,
it's wrong.

148
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,139
It's just wrong,
I'd rather die saying
hell no to this.

149
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,808
And that's what we--
that's the decision we made.

150
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,577
Brandon and I,
when we brought guns,

151
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,312
we brought a lot of
semiautomatic weapons,

152
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,314
we brought a lot
of high-powered rifles.

153
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,583
And we fucking...
and us and people
from this community

154
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,151
sat on the porch
and said, "no more."

155
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,121
Get the fuck out of here.
This is not a place
to fuck with.

156
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,889
Like this is...
it's over.

157
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,891
You know I was ready
for guerrilla warfare

158
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,927
and Scott was the one
who was actually

159
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:26,031
and he was like well we need
to be prepared for that,

160
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,801
if indeed something else happens
and they start trying to kill
black people again.

161
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,037
But we also--
here's a chance to organize.

162
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:38,176
This is gonna be a chance for us
as anarchists to do something

163
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,948
that is not just fighting
in the streets or resisting
corporate power, state power.

164
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:49,087
<i>Scott and Malik really used</i>
<i>their activist connections</i>
<i>in a really positive way.</i>

165
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,122
They'd started a clinic,
I mean they did amazing stuff.

166
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,765
Man:
<i>They were giving out</i>
<i>food, water.</i>

167
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,069
If you had medical problems,
they were there with everything.

168
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,937
It was amazing.

169
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,806
We put it on the Internet

170
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,676
and we ask people that are
activists or organizers
in those cities

171
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,878
to print as many of those out
and bring them to the churches,

172
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,914
bring them to the shelters,
and bring them to the hotels,

173
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,649
and bring them,
that will get the word out.

174
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,820
We want to get as many people
back home as we can,

175
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,922
as soon as possible.

176
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,124
'Cause they trying to put
a time limit on us.

177
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,027
We don't have a church
for people to organize it from.

178
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,931
This pastor right here,
he says that he's willing
to open his home up,

179
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:37,402
it's called Eagle Wings,
open his church up
for people to use.

180
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,804
So we already had had a lot
of support in the community,

181
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,906
but law enforcement
was not happy with us.

182
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,143
I'm Scott Crow, I'm one
of the co-organizers,
co-founder.

183
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,979
You got any paperwork
saying officially who
you are?

184
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,081
What kind of group
you are?

185
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,717
- I have my ID.
- Let me see that.

186
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,053
<i>You know here are</i>
<i>a bunch of radicals hanging out</i>

187
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,757
<i>and associating with former</i>
<i>Black Panther Party members.</i>

188
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,427
Frankly, I really felt--
and the literature that I read
on Common Ground--

189
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,065
That... a mission to overthrow
the United States government.

190
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,235
Chief Bryson, the head
of the Fifth District showed up,

191
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,737
and he had two
U.S. Marshals with him.

192
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,041
<i>He just said "Okay,</i>
<i>what the hell are you</i>
<i>doing in my city?</i>

193
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,176
<i>What are you doing here?"</i>
<i>And I told him, I said,</i>

194
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,247
"I'm trying to foment radical
social change, that's what
we're trying to do."

195
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:26,751
We're gonna shine a light
on the neglect that has happened
in this community.

196
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,820
Lisa: <i>Common Ground was</i>
<i>this convergence.</i>

197
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:32,023
There's the anarchist influence,
obviously the Black Panther
influence.

198
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:37,896
We're showing the city
of New Orleans that the days
of old is gone.

199
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,899
That a new progressive city
will be built.

200
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,937
Malik: <i>Brandon Darby,</i>
<i>one of the true heroes</i>
<i>of Katrina,</i>

201
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:52,477
is staying
in the Lower Ninth Ward,
in an act of civil disobedience.

202
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,715
Woman: <i>I first met Brandon Darby</i>
<i>two months after the storm,</i>

203
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,318
and my first impression of him
was that he was an ego-maniac

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
who was pretty full of himself.

205
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,723
Very, very strong.
Very direct.

206
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,159
Very alpha male,
kind of top dog.

207
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:12,197
I do hope
that you all figure out
a way to communicate

208
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,300
with the people
of the Lower Ninth Ward and make
sure their needs are addressed,

209
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,302
make sure they're not
kicked out of hotels,

210
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:23,041
Scott:
<i>Brandon had never organized</i>
<i>anything in his life.</i>

211
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,043
<i>Because of what</i>
<i>he and I had done,</i>

212
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,045
dealing with the vigilantes
and coming to find King,

213
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:31,783
Malik elevated him to a status
that was beyond anybody else.

214
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,853
My name is Lisa
and I work with Common Ground,

215
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,855
and some folks
from Common Ground,

216
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,857
Brandon Darby who's been
coordinating this project...

217
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,959
I think Malik trusted me,
and he just said,

218
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,027
well I want you to do
the Ninth Ward project.

219
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,230
We're willing to do
whatever we need to do,

220
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,867
to be in solidarity
with anybody in this area,
in the Lower Ninth Ward.

221
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,869
I appreciate
the people that are here,

222
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,004
because I'm gonna tell you,
without you... shhhh...

223
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:58,777
Brandon: <i>The Lower Ninth Ward</i>
<i>was the most affected area</i>
<i>from Katrina,</i>

224
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,212
and it was on the other side
of the industrial canal.

225
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,816
<i>And that's where people saw</i>
<i>the image of the barge,</i>

226
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:08,353
<i>and every day there were</i>
<i>news helicopters seeing this</i>
<i>barge sitting on the land,</i>

227
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,355
<i>where there had been homes,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

228
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,558
And no one was allowed
no matter what to be in their
houses after dark.

229
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
So you couldn't,
you couldn't even move back
and stay in your house.

230
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,996
So we had to figure out a way
to challenge that,

231
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,998
and get residents
back to their homes.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,568
I'm gonna be in this house
every night. I'm gonna try
to challenge that law...

233
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,136
the curfews
they're doing to people.

234
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,406
So for residents
that wanna stand in the homes,

235
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,276
and they wanna stand
in the homes even if
a bulldozer's gonna come,

236
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:37,182
Caroline: <i>I wouldn't say that</i>
<i>I've changed my mind</i>
<i>about his ego.</i>

237
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:41,419
But I've seen him use that ego
to achieve some pretty
incredible things.

238
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,922
I mean look around, you know?

239
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,591
These are people,
these people have
nowhere else to go.

240
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,028
I think if we could get
one house on each block rebuilt,

241
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,330
I think that that'll
do a lot to inspire people.

242
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,600
That was the glory days
of Common Ground. And also
of Brandon.

243
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:59,404
If your stuff got damaged,
and you wanna help
your neighbors,

244
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,973
you wanna help--
the tools are gonna be here.

245
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,042
Caroline:
<i>For several years</i>
<i>after the storm,</i>

246
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,445
<i>Brandon was considered</i>
<i>this hero, this god.</i>

247
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,315
We're gonna have everything
people need in this area.

248
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:15,186
Caroline: <i>He was the symbol</i>
<i>of what radical activism</i>
<i>could do.</i>

249
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,400
Brandon: <i>I can't really get into</i>
<i>when I became politicized,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

250
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,870
<i>without acknowledging</i>
<i>some of my past,</i>

251
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,304
<i>some of my history.</i>

252
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,106
And <i>I was raised in an area</i>

253
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,276
<i>where there wasn't a lot</i>
<i>of political awareness.</i>

254
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,481
<i>I'm from Pasadena, Texas.</i>

255
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,884
<i>It was a refinery town.</i>

256
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,388
<i>I had a situation in my life</i>

257
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,992
<i>where I have a mother</i>
<i>and several relatives</i>
<i>that are very sick,</i>

258
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,294
because of a Brio Chemical site.

259
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,097
<i>The people bury stuff</i>

260
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,199
<i>and then they built</i>
<i>a subdivision on it,</i>

261
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,034
<i>and they know</i>
<i>they did it.</i>

262
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:06,170
<i>I watched no one</i>
<i>get in trouble for it.</i>

263
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,442
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>at a very early age thinking,</i>
<i>uh-uh, that's not cool.</i>

264
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,283
<i>And so I have,</i>
<i>intense experiences</i>
<i>to draw from that push me,</i>

265
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,051
<i>with my activism.</i>

266
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,696
<i>At a fairly early age,</i>
<i>when my parents divorced,</i>

267
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,198
<i>I began to run away a lot.</i>

268
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,203
<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>I used to come down here and,</i>

269
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:43,207
so miserable about
stuff with my family
and my life,

270
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:48,112
And there's a lot
that comes with that,
there's a lot that happens

271
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,381
as a runaway 13
and 14-year-old.

272
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,285
Like the concept of people
taking advantage
of 13-year-olds,

273
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,488
you know runaways,
kind of pisses me off, you know?

274
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,293
<i>Those experiences I had,</i>
<i>as a runaway,</i>

275
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,195
<i>had a lot to do with why</i>

276
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,498
I had a strong disdain
for people abusing power.

277
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,102
<i>I moved into Austin,</i>

278
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,971
<i>which is more</i>
<i>of a progressive community.</i>

279
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,073
I was exposed
to a lot of different people,

280
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,975
a lot of different ways
of thinking.

281
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,545
<i>I met this Black Panther,</i>
<i>Robert King Wilkerson.</i>

282
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,114
Brandon idealized King
in a lot of ways,

283
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,116
and the struggles
that King went through.

284
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,485
<i>He's a former Black Panther,</i>
<i>did 32 years in prison,</i>

285
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,589
I began to have a fascination
with the Black Panther Party.

286
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,559
<i>That kind of attitude</i>
<i>towards the U.S. government.</i>

287
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,427
<i>That was pretty</i>
<i>influential on me.</i>

288
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,763
I identified as a revolutionary.

289
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:44,135
I felt that the U.S. government
<i>was an obstacle to having</i>
<i>a peaceful world.</i>

290
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,539
As a revolutionary
I really believed at some point

291
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,441
that I was going to join
a revolutionary movement.

292
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,779
<i>One day I got this call.</i>

293
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,482
It was King and he said,
Brother, me and so-and-so,

294
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,118
I'm not gonna
say the guy's name,
we're coming to pick you up.

295
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,290
Scott:
<i>The story is,</i>

296
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,526
<i>it was bunch</i>
<i>of former Black Panthers.</i>

297
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,229
<i>They called him</i>
<i>and they were like,</i>
<i>"Hey, man, we wanna meet you.</i>

298
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,131
<i>We're gonna take you</i>
<i>on this private ride."</i>

299
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,267
Brandon:
And I was like, what's going on?

300
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,269
<i>He goes, "Well I want you</i>
<i>to meet some people, brother,</i>

301
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,338
<i>and I think this is gonna help</i>
<i>kick off the revolution, bro."</i>

302
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,142
And I was like, oh shit,
this is an honor, you know.

303
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:30,048
Scott:
<i>He's thinking</i>
<i>it's gonna be a heist.</i>

304
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,183
That's what he wants it to
be in Brandon Darby's head.

305
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,452
And I'm over here
thinking that he has

306
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,521
some big revolutionary act
planned or something.

307
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,356
<i>Or I didn't know,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

308
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,258
Scott:
<i>They like make him</i>
<i>sit in the middle,</i>

309
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,393
<i>and he's a little</i>
<i>uncomfortable with it.</i>

310
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,529
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>are you ready for this?</i>

311
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,098
<i>Oh man, what's going on?</i>
<i>Are we really gonna</i>
<i>do something?</i>

312
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
And I'm like,
well who're we going to meet?

313
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,235
And he goes,
"That's the thing, my brother.

314
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,304
We have these things called
business units,

315
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:57,341
What they wanted to do was
get into multi-level marketing.

316
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,145
"Anybody you sign up,
is gonna get some.

317
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,147
You're gonna get
a percentage."

318
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,583
And I was like aawwh,
"Is it an Amway meeting?"

319
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:10,154
These are products
that are designed to help
the planet."

320
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,657
<i>And I was like, oh man,</i>
<i>let me out of the fucking car.</i>

321
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,428
<i>the Black Panther Party</i>
<i>was about... all about</i>
<i>guns and stuff.</i>

322
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,431
He wanted to form
a revolutionary cell
of underground people

323
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,366
to do something with a gun.

324
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,336
That's what he would want to do,
in his ideal world.

325
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,205
(pages shuffling)

326
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,876
<i>I was involved</i>
<i>in a lot of causes</i>

327
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,313
with people that I believed
to be political prisoners
at the time,

328
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,715
and I wanted to make sure
I had sussed out a place
for them to go,

329
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,119
because there was
a lot of talk about that.
We called it Plan B.

330
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,123
<i>And we figured ways of like,</i>
<i>would we ever break them</i>
<i>out of the prison.</i>

331
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,460
- Oh my gosh. Oh my god.
- <i>(interviewer speaks quietly)</i>

332
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,329
He made that shit up!

333
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,899
Nobody was... Listen...
what's the story?

334
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:59,170
Well Plan B is, the concept,
and it wasn't something
I initiated.

335
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,606
(indistinct chatter)

336
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:05,276
Brandon:
When it looked like there was no
way they were ever gonna get out

337
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:10,214
<i>the concept was for me</i>
<i>to get a job as a prison guard.</i>

338
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,684
<i>And then find a way</i>
<i>to break them out of the prison.</i>

339
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,189
...here, here, and there.

340
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,359
Nobody tried to...
he wanted to do that.

341
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,296
<i>That is a total fabrication.</i>

342
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,432
Maybe in his brain someday
he was gonna do that,

343
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,936
but it wasn't a story I ever
heard, or anybody else ever
heard that I know of.

344
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,938
<i>How serious were you</i>
<i>about Plan B?</i>

345
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,773
I was pretty dedicated to it.

346
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,775
You know?
I was pretty dedicated to it,

347
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:41,412
but I never lost hope
that there was a way to get
people out without that.

348
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,648
But I thought it was probably
pretty wise to do.

349
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,451
There's a few stories that run
into Brandon's head, over
and over again.

350
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,788
One of them is that he wanted
to be a revolutionary so that
he could go to prison.

351
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,623
He wanted it so bad.

352
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,659
But not really.
But that was the ideal.

353
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,662
And so, so he has
this whole prison story
and like he'd just start,

354
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,731
he'd just meet
somebody and start telling
them this story,

355
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,767
and you're like,
why are you telling that story?

356
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,769
It's like, this is a story
he made up.

357
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,772
So he's gonna
learn to cage fight,
and do all these things,

358
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:11,509
and somebody tries to rape him,
he can defend himself.

359
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,579
And he like goes
into all the details, like,
"When the cell door closes,

360
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,614
and it gets dark and somebody
tries to come in,

361
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,616
this is what I'm gonna
do to him."

362
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,352
And it just made me want
to pull my hair out.

363
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,687
I was like,
shut up already.

364
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,823
That is the stupidest story
I have ever heard.

365
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,696
Interviewer:
<i>What should people</i>
<i>who are living,</i>

366
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:38,002
<i>what should they</i>
<i>ask themselves in order</i>
<i>to understand the situation.</i>

367
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,705
The U.S. government has
a tendency to criminalize,

368
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,707
people that disagree
with it politically.

369
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,709
That's why we don't have
political prisoners,

370
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,445
is because if you're someone
who's political and they wanna
incarcerate you

371
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,714
for your politics
and your organizing,

372
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,583
they find a charge against you,
like they did Marcus Garvey,

373
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,420
or like, we could go on and on.
They criminalize you.

374
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,856
His, his, what he called
revolutionary rhetoric,

375
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,858
to me was also just
completely reckless.

376
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,027
I can't say anything else
about it.

377
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,597
Somedays I think,
I only wake up and
I think to myself,

378
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,434
like how on earth
could we attention
to what's happening here?

379
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,805
And the concept
of going to Congress
and burning myself alive,

380
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:20,311
I've thought of that, you know?
And I think about stuff
like that a lot.

381
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,680
Sounds drastic,
but you know,

382
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:26,684
there's a lot of things
happening here that aren't okay.

383
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,323
I don't want to minimize
Brandon Darby's work
at Common Ground,

384
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,791
because he did a lot
of good things.

385
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,295
<i>But I also saw</i>
<i>this recklessness.</i>

386
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,864
<i>He didn't want to be</i>
<i>accountable to anybody.</i>

387
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,566
Brandon:
<i>I had the skill-set</i>
<i>to run the project.</i>

388
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,903
What I didn't have were
the organizational skills
to learn how to,

389
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,707
I think, deal with people
who had different opinions.

390
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:54,312
Brandon did support hierarchy...
and did want to be in charge.

391
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:59,383
really what we want
is direct democracy
and participation from people.

392
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,520
Ken: <i>If you know anything about</i>
<i>decision making by committee,</i>

393
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,456
that's a long
and drawn-out process.

394
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,892
Brandon:
<i>I just didn't want to spend</i>
<i>five hours a day in a meeting,</i>

395
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,794
<i>arguing with 17-year-olds.</i>

396
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:14,098
Scott: <i>He didn't participate</i>
<i>in the meetings.</i>

397
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,402
<i>Or he would come</i>
<i>at the very end and just tell</i>
<i>everybody what to do.</i>

398
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,538
And that created
huge amounts of resentment.

399
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,939
I'm not an activist.

400
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,574
I was just trying,
trying to help my community.

401
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,576
But a lot of these people
were activists

402
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,679
and were looking for this
utopian type of thing.

403
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,449
Well, utopia doesn't exist.

404
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,918
Brandon:
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>the consensus model</i>

405
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,554
<i>meant a lot to all the folks</i>
<i>who came out.</i>

406
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,422
I understand you got
here yesterday

407
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,858
and you think this is
a fresh, virgin environment.

408
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,828
<i>Every week,</i>
<i>somebody's come here</i>

409
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,830
<i>and started</i>
<i>a composting toilet.</i>

410
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,766
We have no sawdust,
and y'all are pooping
and peeing in a bucket,

411
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,502
and then y'all go off
to the next like,

412
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,804
Chiapas or the next wherever.

413
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,639
I've dealt with 20 of you,

414
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,577
and y'all all leave me
to clean up the shit
in your bucket.

415
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,513
You can't tell us not to,
it's like, I'm telling you,

416
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,382
don't shit in a bucket
or I will have you removed.

417
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,484
I'm not cleaning up
your shit in that bucket.

418
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,822
Bryson: <i>I was amazed</i>
<i>that he was so aggressive.</i>

419
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:16,594
Mr. Darby was anti-police,
anti-establishment.

420
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:20,931
<i>I was very skeptical whether</i>
<i>or not they were here to help</i>
<i>or to hinder.</i>

421
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,801
Brandon:
Chief Bryson called and he said,

422
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,170
"Hey, I found these young people
who said that you had,

423
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,172
you sent them around
with medications,

424
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,975
you know for the elderly people
and I know these people."

425
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,978
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Well that's what we do."</i>
<i>And he said,</i>

426
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,448
well, I have a hard time
disliking you when you do
things like that.

427
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,617
And I said well I'm having
a hard time disliking you

428
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:43,654
<i>And shortly after that</i>
<i>he started really working</i>
<i>with us.</i>

429
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,625
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>in my life</i>

430
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,660
<i>that I'd really started</i>
<i>having those interactions.</i>

431
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:53,030
<i>Police were no longer "them."</i>
<i>- (Bryson laughs)</i>

432
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,800
It was breaking
that down a little bit,
to have to interact.

433
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:59,770
Woman: <i>How do you see</i>
<i>in the future empowering people</i>
<i>in this community,</i>

434
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>as they come back</i>
<i>to a devastated area?</i>

435
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,942
We're willing to do it,
often times, and don't
get scared,

436
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,845
I say by any means necessary,
that doesn't mean by violence.

437
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,781
You know, but when we say
that what we mean is
like next month,

438
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,051
we're gonna have a delegation
going to Venezuela.

439
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,922
The intention with that is
to try and ask foreign nations

440
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,524
to pay for a couple
of health clinics.

441
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,792
To pay, to fund,
legally,

442
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,861
but to fund it,
to fund education.

443
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:28,532
When Brandon told me he was
gonna talk to Chavez
in Venezuela,

444
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,836
I asked,
"Are you fucking crazy?"
I'm gonna say it the way it is.

445
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,638
He wanted to go and see
what revolutionaries were doing,

446
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,478
Interviewer: <i>What was the goal</i>
<i>in going to Venezuela?</i>

447
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,547
<i>It doesn't really make</i>
<i>that much sense to me.</i>

448
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:49,520
the overt goal of going
to Venezuela was to get
resources to buy shelter

449
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:50,955
for people in New Orleans.

450
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,023
And we figured if we did that,

451
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,960
then it would
embarrass the U.S. government
enough that they would,

452
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,062
they would then do
what they were supposed to do.

453
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,831
Which in itself could be
construed as very illegal.

454
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,501
And I knew it,
and I didn't really care.

455
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,706
<i>So, we go to Venezuela.</i>
<i>And it was beautiful, you know?</i>

456
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,708
<i>This revolutionary fervor</i>
<i>in young people.</i>

457
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,877
<i>It was lovely,</i>
<i>seeing so many people caring</i>

458
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,513
<i>and wanting to make change.</i>

459
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,048
It was what
I'd always dreamed
of. It was my dream.

460
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,723
Then it got much more
complicated when they were
on the ground down there.

461
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,858
We connected
with the government.

462
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,963
And we ended up
in a fairly high official's...
you know,

463
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,732
a high level of government.

464
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,905
<i>The minister I had met with</i>

465
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:44,875
<i>asked me to meet</i>
<i>with friends of his from</i>
<i>the oil industry.</i>

466
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,083
<i>And then the oil industry said</i>
<i>"Well, we think</i>

467
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:57,621
<i>if any money comes from</i>
<i>Venezuela we should do it</i>
<i>through the oil industry.</i>

468
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:02,560
I just need you to give us
a sense of what happened
here in this room.

469
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:06,897
You start talking to me
about getting into wanting me
to go with you to Columbia,

470
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,868
I don't know
if you're somebody
who's just trying

471
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,170
to help the FARC
kidnap an American.

472
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:16,173
You know what I mean?
I don't know what
you're doing.

473
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,708
Director: Good.
Okay, let's go
with that.

474
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,577
Action!

475
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,716
<i>They mentioned to me</i>
<i>that they knew what was</i>
<i>going on in New Orleans,</i>

476
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,085
<i>and they knew</i>
<i>what we were doing.</i>

477
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,121
And they wanted me to meet with,
with the FARC.

478
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:35,159
Newsman:
<i>The Revolutionary Armed Forces</i>
<i>of Columbia, or FARC.</i>

479
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:39,096
Newsman 2:
The FARC, a rebel group that for
years controlled large swaths...

480
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:45,636
<i>and on the State Department's</i>
<i>list of foreign terrorist</i>
<i>organizations.</i>

481
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,805
Brandon:
<i>I wasn't opposed to meeting</i>
<i>with resistance movements,</i>

482
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,374
<i>and I wasn't opposed</i>
<i>to making sure I had support</i>

483
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:53,077
if indeed the U.S. government
did what we though
they would do,

484
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,747
which is kill us because
we're disagreeing with them
in a successful way.

485
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,716
Challenging their power.

486
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,819
<i>Part of me hoped that</i>
<i>the FARC was just noble people</i>

487
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,622
<i>who wanted</i>
<i>to end oppression.</i>

488
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,657
<i>Part of me didn't want</i>
<i>to meet with the FARC</i>

489
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,692
<i>because I felt as though</i>

490
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:12,062
<i>I'd be meeting</i>
<i>with narco-traffickers</i>
<i>who kidnap people.</i>

491
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,100
Part of me felt like
it could be a CIA plot.

492
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,704
<i>I don't think I'm gonna go</i>
<i>meet with these people.</i>

493
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,107
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I'm interested in it.</i>

494
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,776
<i>"No come with us.</i>
<i>Come with us."</i>

495
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:28,112
These people
are really dedicated
to me crossing

496
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,781
national boundaries
into Columbia with them.

497
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,783
Why? Like do they want
to kidnap me?

498
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,185
Is it the CIA trying to bust me?
Am I gonna get arrested
if I don't go?

499
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,987
Or if I do go
am I gonna get arrested,

500
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,991
- I didn't know what to do.
- Interviewer: <i>How did you</i>
<i>shake them?</i>

501
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,727
<i>How did you get them</i>
<i>off your back?</i>

502
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,696
I told other parts of the--

503
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,965
leaders in other parts
of the government what
they were doing.

504
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,200
<i>Tell me about that.</i>
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

505
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:53,837
Ummmm,
I'm gonna take a break.

506
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,077
Lisa:
<i>Maybe it was Brandon</i>
<i>trying to find out</i>

507
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,780
<i>what revolutionary</i>
<i>really means.</i>

508
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,785
Maybe his vision of what he saw
wasn't what he thought it was.

509
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,220
I don't know what he
thought it is... or was.

510
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,024
Caroline:
<i>When Brandon came back</i>
<i>from Venezuela,</i>

511
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,760
I would describe
what happened maybe
as a mental breakdown.

512
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:23,467
He was withdrawn, very paranoid
<i>and very depressed.</i>

513
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,036
I left Venezuela
feeling very confused.

514
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,772
<i>I came back,</i>
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

515
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:33,177
As a person,
I was breaking.

516
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,915
Scott:
<i>Brandon, as much as any of us,</i>
<i>had post-traumatic stress.</i>

517
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:41,719
You can't go through the things
we went through in New Orleans,

518
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:45,122
and then pile on Venezuela,
and be okay.

519
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:51,829
Brandon:
<i>And it was just the internal</i>
<i>politics were killing me.</i>

520
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,931
Caroline:
<i>There was a lot</i>
<i>of tension in the ranks.</i>

521
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:57,134
A lot of people left
because folks didn't like him.

522
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,769
They didn't like
what he was doing,

523
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,871
they didn't like
his top-down approach.

524
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,074
<i>He no longer believed</i>
<i>in the collectivist attitude,</i>

525
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,143
<i>the anarchist approach.</i>

526
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,879
<i>(phone chatter)</i>

527
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,783
<i>He ended up going off</i>
<i>the radar for a while.</i>

528
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,292
Brandon:
<i>I went back to Austin.</i>

529
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,764
<i>Everything I had kinda</i>
<i>believed in for so many years...</i>

530
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>started crashing a little bit.</i>

531
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,241
(sighs)

532
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,343
You know over time,
I guess...

533
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,048
yeah, I guess my views
just really changed.

534
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,286
<i>I'm not so sure that--</i>

535
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,389
<i>I'm not so sure that</i>
<i>I'm completely right anymore.</i>

536
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,958
You know, I'm not so sure
that turning my country--

537
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
because that's
what would happen, right?

538
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,130
Like we'd have
a resistance movement
and if we were successful

539
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,000
and didn't
get killed right away
or put in prison,

540
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,336
you know, then the best
we could hope for is to have
what Columbia has, right,

541
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:10,240
which is just a sustained war
where everyone in the country
knows what murder is,

542
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:12,843
deals with murder,
deals with kidnappings.

543
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,212
And it's like, you know,
I don't want that in my country.

544
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,019
What kind of thing could happen
to be that bridge between being
a revolutionary

545
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,021
and going undercover
with the FBI?

546
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:27,291
And it's like well,
a lot of experiences in life.

547
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:30,594
A lot of doubts about views,

548
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,030
because of experiences
and growing older

549
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,332
and more perspective.

550
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,969
And then something absolutely
that radical coming up

551
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,839
that you have to say something
about or else you're
complicit in it.

552
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,375
Interviewer:
Let's talk about when you first
<i>came in contact with the FBI.</i>

553
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:51,048
I had met a man
named Riad Hammad--
a local teacher.

554
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:56,153
<i>And he was the guy at the</i>
<i>protests who always held up</i>
<i>a Palestinian flag.</i>

555
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,856
<i>Represented for</i>
<i>the Palestinian people.</i>

556
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:05,229
He had devised a plan that,
you know,

557
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,232
as a white American I could
open a fake business account...

558
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:11,902
a fake business, get a DBA,
and open the account,

559
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,904
and then he could put money
into the account,

560
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:17,007
and then he would be able
to send a debit card to Israel.

561
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,043
And he was pretty clear with me
what he wanted to do with that.

562
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,346
And he did talk about Hamas
and he did talk about Hezbollah.

563
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,448
And he talked about
the struggle in Israel

564
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,917
and he talked about
the fact that money

565
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,119
that the organization
was sending can't get to people,

566
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,121
and he said
all these things to me,

567
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,290
'cause we were pretty close.
And I just told him,

568
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,894
I was like, you know, umm-mmm,
I'm not doing that man.

569
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:42,165
and I said,
"Hey man I have a real problem.
This is what's going on."

570
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,434
And a lot of people said,
just stay away from the person.

571
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,137
No one said turn the person in,
or stop it.

572
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,139
It was just stay away
from the person.

573
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,476
But then other people
who I knew began to approach
me and say "Hey"--

574
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,244
they were younger people--

575
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,247
and say, "Hey, this man
approached me with this, too."

576
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,683
With me it's one thing,
you're gonna ask me to do this

577
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:03,120
But with these people
they don't know what
it's even for.

578
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,122
You know they're gonna
get their house--

579
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,258
their door kicked in
by federal agents at some point
for funding terrorism,

580
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,131
I find it hard to believe
that Riad was doing anything
of this kind...

581
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:17,267
providing material support.
He was too smart for that.

582
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,271
This isn't something that I just
said, "Hey, I'm not doing it"

583
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,273
and he got scared
and backed away from.

584
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,409
It was something that he was
gonna go ahead with.

585
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:28,045
This guy wasn't the most
militant person I ever met
in my life,

586
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,212
he didn't even
talk militantly.

587
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,214
He wanted,
he wanted a free Palestine,

588
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,183
but welcome to the world.

589
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:36,219
I remember watching
the news and there was
a suicide bombing in Israel

590
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:41,091
and I remember thinking,
"If I don't say something
about this,

591
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:44,428
I'm gonna have
some responsibility
for that happening."

592
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,498
You know? And so I decided
I was gonna say something.

593
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,171
I did get a call
from Brandon and he told me
about the situation,

594
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,340
and I stopped him in the middle
of the conversation.

595
00:32:56,342 --> 00:33:00,978
I said stop Brandon,
let me hook you up
with a handler.

596
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,152
I reached out
to law enforcement,
and I told on him.

597
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,221
And when I told on him
I did so very tearfully.

598
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,593
<i>Regardless of how right I felt</i>
<i>like that was to do,</i>

599
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:25,302
My entire adult life,
it had been so foreign to talk
to the FBI, you know?

600
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,169
That was such
a taboo thing to do.

601
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,011
<i>That's when I first</i>
<i>met my handler.</i>

602
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,047
<i>And he just said okay,</i>
<i>"In this situation,</i>

603
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,151
<i>we have a very hard time</i>
<i>getting anyone in this</i>
<i>person's life.</i>

604
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,454
<i>Something needed to be done."</i>

605
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,028
<i>I just told him what was said.</i>
<i>And that was it.</i>

606
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,499
As much as it seems crazy
that a revolutionary would work
with the FBI at some point,

607
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:58,235
under the particular
circumstances,

608
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,303
I don't think it's that crazy.

609
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,043
<i>I felt really strange</i>
<i>when I left that.</i>

610
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,582
And shortly after that,
a body was found...

611
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,551
<i>in Town Lake,</i>
<i>in Austin.</i>

612
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,620
<i>And it was just like,</i>
<i>oh no.</i>

613
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:19,256
Newsman: <i>Developing news</i>
<i>coming out of East Austin</i>

614
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,258
<i>where a body bound</i>
<i>with duct tape...</i>

615
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,393
Newswoman:
<i>...bound with duct tape</i>
<i>and his arms appeared to be tied</i>

616
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:28,598
<i>Detectives with</i>
<i>the Austin Police Department</i>
<i>are investigating...</i>

617
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,171
<i>the IRS and the FBI showed up</i>
<i>and took documents.</i>

618
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,180
Riad did something
quite extreme.

619
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:49,386
<i>Went down to the lake,</i>
<i>took a roll of duct tape,</i>

620
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:54,591
<i>wrapped it around his ankles,</i>
<i>and then around his mouth</i>

621
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:59,196
<i>and head,</i>
<i>then threw himself in the lake.</i>

622
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,434
<i>The agencies</i>
<i>putting pressure on him</i>

623
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,604
<i>caused him to feel</i>
<i>that he had no choice</i>

624
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,441
<i>but to relieve his family.</i>

625
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:15,445
<i>I do think that these agencies</i>
<i>are responsible,</i>

626
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,648
<i>even if they didn't</i>
<i>directly intend his death.</i>

627
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,517
In that sense
it's homicide,

628
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,320
and they bear
responsibility for it.

629
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,323
At the time I really felt
like I played a role in that.

630
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,225
You know, I really did.

631
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,260
And it was really upsetting.

632
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,696
And the thing that was really,
really difficult

633
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:35,599
was that I couldn't talk
about it, you know?

634
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,468
And I just felt,
it was just such a bad feeling.

635
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,403
And you feel for his family...

636
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,739
I mean you just can't talk
about any of it, you know?

637
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,343
<i>The only one I could talk</i>
<i>to about it</i>

638
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,278
<i>was the guy from the FBI,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

639
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:54,251
And I did every day,
cause I cried. I was upset.

640
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,560
<i>By the time the Republican</i>
<i>National Convention came up</i>

641
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,629
<i>came up I felt very bonded</i>
<i>with my handler.</i>

642
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:14,304
So that played a part,
in my decision to go
undercover.

643
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,306
You know?
But then it's just
this realization

644
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,643
like, wow, you know,
I'm privy to information,

645
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,444
and there are people,

646
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,513
regardless of how much
I can see their human side

647
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,582
and what I like
or dislike about them,

648
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,518
I'm privy to information,
about people and communities

649
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,655
who are openly expressing,

650
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,623
and some privately expressing,
which is even scarier,

651
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,661
that they are gonna hurt people.
And I need to do something
about it.

652
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,397
I need to do
something about that.

653
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,765
That's a moral obligation.

654
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,369
And the way I decided to do it
was to work undercover.

655
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,310
Interviewer:
<i>Can you talk about, in 2008,</i>

656
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,813
<i>when they asked you to start</i>
<i>following the group</i>

657
00:36:56,815 --> 00:37:00,417
that was going to the Republican
<i>National Convention?</i>

658
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,785
All right.

659
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:05,822
Well...
I was contacted by the FBI.

660
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,827
<i>They said, "Hey you know</i>
<i>there's a meeting coming up</i>

661
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,463
<i>for a group called</i>
<i>the RNC Welcoming Committee.</i>

662
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,466
<i>We've had some reports</i>
<i>that they've said some</i>
<i>frightening stuff.</i>

663
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,236
And so we need to send someone
who's trusted to go hear it,

664
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,704
and see what's going on."

665
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:24,774
I don't know that I wanna get
involved in that, man."

666
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,643
And they're like,
"We really need you to."

667
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,448
<i>Kinda wondered at the time</i>
<i>initially like why are you</i>
<i>asking me</i>

668
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,451
<i>to go to a meeting</i>
<i>at a bookstore.</i>

669
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,520
Once it was clear to me
what was being said,

670
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:38,788
I thought it was
important to do.

671
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,692
Two people came from Minnesota.

672
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,462
<i>They showed videos</i>
<i>and talked about what</i>
<i>their hopes were</i>

673
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:47,664
<i>for the Republican</i>
<i>National Convention.</i>

674
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,044
<i>They said they would use</i>
<i>a diversity of tactics.</i>

675
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,847
<i>Well, okay,</i>
<i>a diversity of tactics.</i>

676
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,486
<i>That's the word that the Earth</i>
<i>Liberation Front uses for arson.</i>

677
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,722
That's the word that the Animal
Liberation Front uses for arson.

678
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:19,763
<i>They went as far as to show</i>
<i>videos of people throwing</i>
<i>Molotov cocktails.</i>

679
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,365
<i>Even though it was done in</i>
<i>somewhat of a theatrical sense.</i>

680
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,068
It was clearly a satire.

681
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,505
So it's very, very open
to interpretation.

682
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:32,642
<i>(Blondie's "One Way</i>
<i>or Another" plays)</i>

683
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,546
<i>It's set to the Blondie song,</i>
<i>"One Way or Another."</i>

684
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:40,517
<i>It's kind of a wink-wink spoof</i>
<i>on the black bloc,</i>

685
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,386
<i>the most radical activists.</i>

686
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,434
There is a scene in it that
involves a Molotov cocktail.

687
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:01,604
A guy throws a Molotov cocktail
<i>into a barbecue.</i>

688
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,608
I don't think that you needed
to infiltrate these people.

689
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,646
<i>There's a side of Brandon</i>
<i>that's just very dramatic</i>

690
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:12,882
<i>and conspiratorial</i>
<i>and a little bit paranoid.</i>

691
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,618
Brandon: <i>I thought</i>
<i>that there was a likelihood</i>

692
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,488
that somebody would go
to an extreme.

693
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,460
They asked for a group of people
<i>in Austin to get together</i>

694
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,662
and meet and form
an affinity group.

695
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,768
Michael:
There's no doubt in my mind that
the FBI made a terrible mistake,

696
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,137
<i>sending Brandon Darby</i>
<i>into that situation.</i>

697
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:40,377
They put a 33-year-old,
renowned, militant activist...

698
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,615
<i>in a group with two guys</i>
<i>ten years younger than him</i>

699
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:49,552
<i>who look up to him,</i>
<i>but he's not supposed</i>
<i>to be the leader.</i>

700
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,155
Brandon: At the first meeting,
there was James Clark,

701
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,957
David McKay
and Brad Crowder and myself.

702
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,395
<i>I felt like David and Brad</i>
<i>both wanted to go,</i>

703
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:03,166
<i>I felt like they probably</i>
<i>had good intentions</i>
<i>but I also felt like</i>

704
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,435
there was probably
a lot of youthful anger.

705
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,440
<i>David reminded me</i>
<i>I guess more of myself.</i>

706
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:14,010
He was more of an action-driven
<i>kind of person he seemed like.</i>

707
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,646
With James I was always
kind of torn I guess.

708
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,750
<i>He's really like</i>
<i>a process-oriented anarchist,</i>

709
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,585
who traditionally I haven't
gotten along with too well.

710
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,888
It was a very
macho atmosphere.

711
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,690
There was definitely
a sense of like...

712
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:31,761
everybody trying to like,
toughen up.

713
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:35,965
It was the cycle of everybody's
<i>machismo feeding on itself.</i>

714
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,768
Brandon:
<i>The group went around</i>

715
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,904
and everyone
just talked about their goals.

716
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,974
<i>David and Brad expressed</i>
<i>more of a willingness</i>
<i>to serve some time.</i>

717
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,654
My initial reaction
was to discourage that.

718
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:59,656
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>prison's a good thing.</i>

719
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:01,491
<i>I don't think you realize</i>
<i>what it is.</i>

720
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,660
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>

721
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,862
<i>like when I go I'm gonna</i>
<i>shut the fucker down, too.</i>

722
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:09,666
James: <i>He said we needed</i>
<i>to like toughen up,</i>

723
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,802
<i>stop looking like we ate</i>
<i>a bunch of tofu.</i>

724
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,638
To my knowledge
none of the three of us
were vegetarian.

725
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,810
I mean, I've never been
a vegetarian. I'm just skinny.

726
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,480
And I'm sorry
that I don't measure up

727
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:26,950
to your standard
of toughness or masculinity,

728
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:30,019
but I mean don't tell me
to stop eating tofu.

729
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,523
Like, what does that
even mean, like?

730
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:39,863
<i>He made comments about how</i>
<i>Brad specifically, and me too,</i>

731
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,031
<i>were kinda like weaklings.</i>

732
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,768
<i>We weren't men's men.</i>

733
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,971
<i>The coffee that I ordered</i>
<i>I remember one time</i>

734
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,940
<i>he made fun because I ordered</i>
<i>a latte, and not like a coffee.</i>

735
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,010
<i>We didn't want</i>
<i>to just be these guys</i>

736
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,679
<i>that just like showed up</i>
<i>without any credentials.</i>

737
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,915
<i>That's everything</i>
<i>that Brandon was.</i>

738
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,920
<i>He was the activist guy</i>
<i>from Austin.</i>

739
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,860
Brandon:
<i>Brad and David both</i>

740
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,729
<i>were from working towns</i>
<i>like Midland,</i>

741
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,931
<i>similar to where</i>
<i>I was from.</i>

742
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,934
<i>I felt a sense</i>
<i>of camaraderie with that.</i>

743
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,538
<i>I could see a lot</i>
<i>of myself in them.</i>

744
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,809
<i>I understood</i>
<i>some of their anger.</i>

745
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,747
<i>I really</i>
<i>understood it actually.</i>

746
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,817
<i>David, he had a really rough</i>
<i>adolescence, you know?</i>

747
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,690
David: <i>There was always a lot</i>
<i>of conflict in my house.</i>

748
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,960
<i>I had a lot of fear of my dad.</i>

749
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,596
<i>He is a very</i>
<i>controlling individual.</i>

750
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:52,135
<i>I have always tried</i>
<i>to be the kind of a person</i>
<i>who's a man,</i>

751
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:55,572
<i>or tried to prove that I have</i>
<i>that kind of manliness.</i>

752
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,809
<i>(camera clicks)</i>

753
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,911
<i>My first real conflict</i>
<i>with law enforcement</i>

754
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:06,583
<i>was a protest against the KKK.</i>

755
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,719
- <i>That one ended pretty bad.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>(camera clicks)</i>

756
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,788
<i>I ended up being tased</i>
<i>and arrested.</i>

757
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:18,661
<i>I did not want to go be</i>
<i>vulnerable to that</i>
<i>situation again.</i>

758
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,130
<i>If I was gonna go,</i>
<i>I wanted to have protection.</i>

759
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,635
To start you're gonna need
to take one of these big,

760
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,136
orange traffic barrels,

761
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,939
and we're gonna be
turning it into this.

762
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,941
Brandon:
<i>They had taken these shields</i>

763
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,878
that had these little screws
to screw in a plexiglass window.

764
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,050
And they had modified them again
<i>to have long deck screws.</i>

765
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,954
That way if police pushed
against them it would
puncture the police.

766
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,023
David: <i>There were no screws,</i>
<i>they were all bolts.</i>

767
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:49,692
<i>You can't be punctured</i>
<i>by a bolt.</i>

768
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:51,094
<i>It was non-threatening.</i>

769
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:54,397
<i>It was a way we could go</i>
<i>be a part of it.</i>

770
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:58,134
<i>so we wouldn't get</i>
<i>any kind of like real trouble.</i>

771
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,707
Brandon:
David and Brad rented a trailer,

772
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,844
<i>and put their shields</i>
<i>and stuff in it.</i>

773
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:11,681
Yeah, I got in the van
and we started on a road trip.

774
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,820
<i>On that trip I remember</i>
<i>feeling like if I had said</i>
<i>my experiences,</i>

775
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,724
<i>starting in Austin,</i>
<i>and finished by the time</i>
<i>we got to Minnesota,</i>

776
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:25,928
<i>I probably could have</i>
<i>influenced them to not be</i>
<i>so radical.</i>

777
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,767
But the role I had
embarked upon was,

778
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:33,836
I was working undercover
with the FBI.

779
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,874
<i>His attitude from the point</i>
<i>that he got in the van,</i>

780
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:41,144
<i>all the way through,</i>
<i>was kind of like that</i>
<i>agitated level.</i>

781
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:45,748
<i>Very aggressive,</i>
<i>and very on-edge</i>
<i>and very demanding.</i>

782
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:50,153
<i>I don't think he was capable</i>
<i>of being in the situation</i>
<i>that he put himself in.</i>

783
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:55,958
(protesters chanting)

784
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,030
(man talks indistinctly
on megaphone)

785
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,909
Man: <i>An attorney</i>
<i>for the city said,</i>

786
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:14,777
on the first day
of the convention

787
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:18,114
the city of St. Paul
was on the verge of
being overthrown.

788
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,317
- (loud crash)
- (cheering)

789
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,886
We're Minnesotans,
we're not accustomed

790
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,990
to people being out
in the streets protesting
and throwing things.

791
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,061
(quick explosion)

792
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,999
Protestors are scared,
police are scared,

793
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,201
everybody was scared,
you know?

794
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,007
(spray can spraying)

795
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:58,988
All the dumpsters
along the way were either
pushed into police cars

796
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,824
or to other people's cars
or dumped over.

797
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,060
<i>(siren blaring)</i>

798
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,996
<i>(camera snaps)</i>

799
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,766
<i>I pulled out</i>
<i>my video camera.</i>

800
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:14,337
<i>And I just did my best</i>
<i>to try to watch the activists.</i>

801
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:19,008
I look over, and then Brad
and this group of others,

802
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,310
they have this gigantic
construction sign.

803
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,981
The seventy-mile-per-hour
interstate is below us.

804
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:28,351
<i>They throw it off</i>
<i>the overpass.</i>

805
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,220
I remember I was texting the
Bureau, like "Emergency!
Emergency! Emergency!"

806
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:34,891
<i>(glass breaking, cheering)</i>

807
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,060
<i>(siren blaring)</i>

808
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,366
<i>(quick explosions)</i>

809
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,154
David and Brad came running
into my room.

810
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,857
And they were like,
everything's gone.

811
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:11,427
And I thought that they
were joking and I just kind of
looked at them for a second.

812
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:16,065
<i>We were pretty upset because,</i>
<i>you know, we'd spent a lot</i>
<i>of time making them,</i>

813
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,134
<i>and we felt like</i>
<i>they were stolen from us.</i>

814
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,870
David kept saying that
there must be retribution.

815
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:24,974
I thought he was
probably gonna be a real
asshole in the streets,

816
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:27,109
but I didn't think he was
gonna do anything like
what he did.

817
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,317
Hanners:
<i>Here are these anarchists,</i>

818
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,254
<i>buying the material</i>
<i>for their bombs at Wal-Mart.</i>

819
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,625
<i>It struck me as</i>
<i>an odd thought,</i>

820
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:45,328
anarchists shopping
at Wal-Mart.

821
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,431
Gabby:
<i>When David asked me</i>
<i>to buy tampons,</i>

822
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:52,034
<i>I definitely like wasn't</i>
<i>going to be like, "Why do you</i>
<i>need tampons?"</i>

823
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,104
When I think of tampons,
I don't think of Molotov
cocktails.

824
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,073
Even now.
Errr, a little bit now.

825
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,350
(rattling)

826
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:10,186
David:
<i>We made them</i>
<i>in about 15 minutes.</i>

827
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:13,189
<i>Gasoline in a bottle</i>

828
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,259
<i>with a little bit of oil and</i>
<i>then he duct-taped the top.</i>

829
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:19,996
<i>It was incredibly easy.</i>

830
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:22,398
I got a text I think it was,
and it said, "Hey they bought"--

831
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
or "The whole group is
in a big fight right now."

832
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,435
And I was like why is the group
in a big fight?

833
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:30,172
These are the things
that Brad and David bought.

834
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,478
I know that those
can be made to make
Molotov cocktails,

835
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,346
and I think that
that's why they bought them.

836
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:40,316
And they're like, "Yeah."
And I was like, "Okay."

837
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,251
And then I let the FBI know.

838
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:51,160
James: <i>There's a definite sense</i>
<i>of what the fuck?</i>

839
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:55,531
<i>We came up here to protest,</i>
<i>make our voices heard.</i>

840
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,400
<i>Now here we are</i>

841
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:00,303
more than just feeling
like lied to or something.

842
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,404
Feeling used.

843
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:07,009
<i>When we found out</i>
<i>like how the group felt</i>
<i>about the situation.</i>

844
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:11,013
What you're doing is ridiculous,
<i>stupid and dangerous,</i>

845
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:16,185
the romantic revolutionary kind
<i>of idealism quickly left us.</i>

846
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:19,155
<i>Reality kind of came</i>
<i>crashing in.</i>

847
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,290
<i>We need to rethink this.</i>

848
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,326
<i>Maybe this is a bad idea.</i>

849
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,298
(chickens clucking)

850
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,453
Brandon:
<i>Being undercover is tricky.</i>

851
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,124
I really wanted just to grab him
and be like, hey,

852
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,459
"What you're doing
is so stupid.

853
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:58,227
You're going down
the wrong path.

854
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,762
This is ridiculous."

855
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:02,331
<i>But my role was</i>
<i>to provide information</i>

856
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,533
<i>and try to not influence.</i>

857
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,436
Not to be more radical,
but not to be less radical.

858
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,272
<i>To fit in.</i>

859
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,276
<i>But it tore me up,</i>
<i>it bothered me.</i>

860
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,248
<i>Sometimes like I felt like</i>
<i>I was using Brad and David.</i>

861
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:24,387
<i>That's something I had</i>
<i>to live with afterwards.</i>

862
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,623
But it wasn't my place
to talk people out of things.

863
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,594
And I think
about that though,

864
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:34,397
like what if I had
just been like, you know what?

865
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:40,069
I couldn't of though,
I would've probably went
to jail for that.

866
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,572
Maybe not went to jail,
it wouldn't have been good.

867
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,411
Michael:
There's a side of Brandon that's
<i>a huge anti-authoritarian.</i>

868
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:52,481
<i>So why did he do what his</i>
<i>FBI handlers told him to?</i>

869
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:56,585
For him it was just,
his loyalty was with the FBI.

870
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,088
Those guys had stood with him

871
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:04,260
through the devastating
Riad Hammad suicide.

872
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:08,631
So I think loyalty
trumped anti-authoritarianism
at that point.

873
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,408
Brandon:
<i>I was asked by the FBI</i>
<i>to get re-involved.</i>

874
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:23,679
"We'd like you to find out
from David whether or not
this is true,

875
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,648
and what he made,
where they are."

876
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,452
<i>My handler warned me,</i>
<i>he said, "Brandon this is where</i>
<i>it gets tricky.</i>

877
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,554
<i>If you don't want to do this,</i>
<i>we won't blame you.</i>

878
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:35,191
But there's a high likelihood
your name is gonna come out,

879
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:38,094
<i>if you go past</i>
<i>this point with us."</i>

880
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,364
<i>I ultimately decided</i>
<i>to get involved.</i>

881
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,236
<i>I got ahold of David</i>
<i>and we sat on the roof,</i>
<i>behind us.</i>

882
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,439
<i>I said, "Hey I heard that you</i>
<i>had made some things."</i>

883
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,577
And then I said,
"Well, I don't have a problem
with it, that's why I'm here."

884
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:57,346
And he said, "Okay, well yeah."
So then he told me what
he had done.

885
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:02,184
<i>And he said that he had made</i>
<i>eight Molotov cocktails.</i>

886
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,720
<i>And I asked him if they were</i>
<i>somewhere safe,</i>

887
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,223
<i>and he told me that they</i>
<i>were in the basement.</i>

888
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,732
<i>I tried to get a gist</i>
<i>of what his plans were,</i>

889
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,201
<i>and that's when he pointed off</i>
<i>in a direction and told me</i>

890
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,337
there was a parking lot
full of police cars.

891
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,542
So the parking lot behind
us, which was the target,

892
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:29,478
they had 35 people there,

893
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,348
loading and unloading cars,
getting in and out of cars.

894
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,652
And it was right at the end
of summer so the foliage
was still thick.

895
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:40,589
what was on the other side
of the tree line, down the hill.

896
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,361
<i>These were these big bottles</i>

897
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:47,396
of this homemade napalm mixture.

898
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,343
<i>I knew that if he did it,</i>
<i>it was gonna hurt people.</i>

899
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,646
<i>I knew it would.</i>

900
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:07,516
David: <i>Never did I plan to do</i>
<i>anything to hurt anybody.</i>

901
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:11,720
<i>I wouldn't throw</i>
<i>a Molotov cocktail</i>
<i>on a car with a cop in it.</i>

902
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:16,325
<i>We were gonna do</i>
<i>property damage.</i>

903
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,761
<i>People getting hurt</i>
<i>by the Molotov cocktails</i>

904
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:22,464
<i>was not a consequence</i>
<i>that I even considered.</i>

905
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,469
<i>And I didn't know</i>
<i>that just having them</i>

906
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,272
<i>was the crime that it was.</i>

907
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,214
Woman: <i>Hello, this is</i>
<i>a collect call from...</i>

908
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:42,685
Woman: <i>...an inmate</i>
<i>at the Sherburne County Jail.</i>

909
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:45,654
David: <i>Brandon brought upon</i>
<i>the romantic aspect</i>

910
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:49,558
<i>of you being a revolutionary</i>
<i>instead of an activist.</i>

911
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,561
<i>That we weren't just</i>
<i>going here to protest,</i>

912
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,831
<i>we were coming here to fight</i>
<i>for our beliefs.</i>

913
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,833
<i>To actually fight.</i>

914
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,637
<i>With him,</i>
<i>we felt like we were legitimate.</i>

915
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,309
Brandon felt like he could take
these young guys,

916
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:08,777
who reminded him
of himself,

917
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:12,748
under his wing
and at the same time,

918
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,583
<i>inform on them</i>
<i>for the FBI.</i>

919
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,485
Brandon:
I would like to be able
to tell them

920
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:20,556
and that they should try
to get out of it before
it's too late.

921
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:23,459
"Late" being defined
as being in prison,

922
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,494
being dead,
having to live underground,

923
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,763
or having to then realize
that a mistake was made.

924
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,332
Or having to live with one
of their incendiary devices

925
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,768
having fucked up
and killed someone.

926
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,605
It was very difficult, you know,
and I was very honest about it.

927
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,874
It was almost like journaling
to the Bureau.

928
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,510
I was very honest about it.
I didn't just write the facts,

929
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,746
I would say here are the facts
and here are my thoughts.

930
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,281
Here are how I feel about
these thoughts.

931
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:49,618
"I feel as though they are
some strange form of
collateral damage.

932
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,489
Not exactly,
considering what they're trying
to get involved in.

933
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,492
But in some ways
they are just that,

934
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:59,561
considering that I'm
not attempting to talk
sense into them."

935
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:03,365
I didn't go into
as a seasoned pro.

936
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:07,369
I went into it as a person
with a lot of mixed feelings.

937
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:08,637
You know?

938
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,808
I don't think he thought
through this very well.

939
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,878
I don't think he really realized
the situation he was in

940
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,913
until it was way too late.

941
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,850
<i>He had to choose</i>
<i>whether to go ahead</i>

942
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:25,854
<i>and put David in prison</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

943
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:29,091
<i>or piss off his FBI handlers.</i>

944
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:32,594
<i>He had to make that choice.</i>
<i>I think it was a painful choice.</i>

945
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,767
Brandon: <i>So the last night,</i>
<i>before the raid happened,</i>

946
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,870
<i>the FBI had asked me</i>
<i>to wear a wire.</i>

947
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:46,342
<i>That was very intense.</i>

948
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:53,449
<i>I realized that David's window</i>
<i>of opportunity to back down,</i>

949
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:55,351
<i>was starting to shut.</i>

950
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:58,387
So this is approximately

951
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,123
where David and I sat down
for our last discussion.

952
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,959
<i>We had come</i>
<i>to a cafe here,</i>

953
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,963
the night that he was
gonna throw the firebombs.

954
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,470
<i>I was wearing a wire</i>
<i>for the FBI.</i>

955
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,410
Brandon:
Are you sure they're gonna burn?

956
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:24,847
David:
<i>Yes, okay? They'll burn.</i>

957
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,616
<i>It might take a while</i>
<i>to get them lit,</i>

958
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,518
<i>but they'll go off</i>
<i>when they break.</i>

959
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:36,392
What if someone's
sleeping in the car
when you firebomb it, man?

960
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,727
- He'll wake up.
- What if he doesn't wake up?

961
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,696
What if he can't
get out?

962
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:42,664
I was torn.
I was wanting
to insinuate to him,

963
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,833
like, dude, you're gonna
get fucking busted.

964
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:47,436
You're gonna go to prison
for a long time. Stop.

965
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:50,005
But I couldn't come out
and say that.

966
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:55,444
David, what if someone's
in the car, and they die?

967
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:56,979
That's life, right?
That's how it goes.

968
00:56:56,981 --> 00:57:00,616
<i>"If he gets burnt or he dies</i>
<i>in the process, tough."</i>

969
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,484
<i>Okay.</i>

970
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:06,488
When he said that,
I realized that that gate
just went <i>bam.</i>

971
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,790
And it shut,
completely shut.

972
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,893
<i>He was probably gonna</i>
<i>be in an immense amount</i>
<i>of trouble.</i>

973
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,200
<i>We were at</i>
<i>the Hard Times Cafe.</i>

974
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:24,706
<i>We've made no plans</i>
<i>to do anything. I've agreed</i>
<i>to nothing.</i>

975
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,909
Director:
So the first line's
gonna be Brandon's.

976
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,211
It's "What if there's
a cop sleeping in the car?"

977
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:34,483
Dude, what if someone's
in the car and they die?

978
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:36,485
- David: <i>What if</i>
<i>there's a cop in the car?</i>
<i>- Actor David: I don't care.</i>

979
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:40,923
David: <i>What if he's sleeping?</i>
<i>I think he's joking.</i>

980
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:43,592
<i>When those quotes</i>
<i>were taken away from me,</i>

981
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:45,661
<i>I was laughing</i>
<i>at that situation.</i>

982
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:50,666
<i>I wouldn't</i>
<i>throw a Molotov cocktail</i>
<i>on a car with a cop in it.</i>

983
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:54,036
Would you leave
the scene if a cop's
burning or dying?

984
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:58,807
A cop gets
burned or maimed,
it's worth it, okay?

985
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,845
David:
<i>I've never used the word</i>
<i>"maimed" ever in my entire life.</i>

986
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:06,548
David:
That's what he acted like.
That's what he acted like.

987
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,684
<i>I think I agreed to him</i>
<i>saying that.</i>

988
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:11,553
<i>"Do you think it's worth it</i>
<i>if a cop gets burned or maimed?</i>

989
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:14,523
<i>If you're fighting</i>
<i>for something you believe in?"</i>

990
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,895
<i>And I agreed to that.</i>

991
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:23,899
Michael:
<i>I think it's pretty obvious</i>
<i>that during that conversation,</i>

992
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:27,569
David was saying a lot of things
<i>just to appease Brandon.</i>

993
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:30,873
Brandon's comfortable,
almost thrives on confrontation.

994
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:34,576
If you challenge him,
Brandon will argue for hours.

995
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,581
David:
<i>It was easier to play along.</i>

996
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,083
<i>I fell into like a role.</i>

997
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,655
<i>I had never let</i>
<i>my guard down with him.</i>

998
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,660
<i>I didn't want him</i>
<i>to think that I was scared.</i>

999
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,797
<i>You know, I ended</i>
<i>that conversation with him,</i>

1000
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,633
<i>and I thought that was it.</i>

1001
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,902
<i>I didn't want to touch</i>
<i>the Molotov cocktails.</i>

1002
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,804
<i>I didn't even want</i>
<i>to think about them.</i>

1003
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,041
<i>The next thing I remember,</i>

1004
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,877
<i>I'm waking up</i>
<i>to an assault rifle</i>
<i>to the back of my head.</i>

1005
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,716
Newsman:
<i>Two Texas men are now charged</i>
<i>with plotting to attack police</i>

1006
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,753
<i>with Molotov cocktails</i>
<i>during the Republican</i>
<i>National Convention.</i>

1007
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:19,054
Newswoman:
<i>David McKay</i>
<i>and Bradley Crowder</i>

1008
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,323
<i>could face up to</i>
<i>ten years in prison.</i>

1009
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:25,627
Man:
<i>David McKay and his</i>
<i>co-defendant Bradley Crowder</i>

1010
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,763
<i>were both charged</i>
<i>with three counts:</i>

1011
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:30,766
manufacturing Molotov cocktails,
<i>possessing them,</i>

1012
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:33,902
and three was a count
which charges possession

1013
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,737
of an unregistered
destructive device.

1014
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,640
It was Molotov cocktails.

1015
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:40,676
But under federal law,

1016
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:43,845
you still have to register
those, oddly enough.

1017
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,649
And there's even a form that
you're supposed to fill out.

1018
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:51,820
Needless to say
they did not fill out the form,
so they broke the law.

1019
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:56,058
The U.S. Attorney's office said,
"Look you know, if you want,

1020
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,962
we'll drop the charges,
so that you don't have to
have your identity revealed.

1021
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:03,065
But if we do that,
he's gonna get away
with what he did."

1022
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,200
And I didn't want him to--
you know--

1023
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,370
and I said no-- don't.
I'll testify.

1024
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,005
And they're like,
"Well, it's gonna change
your life.

1025
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,174
It's gonna be life-changing,
it's gonna be different.

1026
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:14,209
It's gonna change
where you hang out.

1027
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,678
It's gonna change
everything about your life."

1028
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,381
And I was like,
"I don't know."

1029
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,817
And he was like,
"So let us know,
think about it for a while."

1030
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,019
And then I decided to do it,
you know?

1031
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:28,023
I had figured out that
the informant was Brandon Darby.

1032
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:32,094
<i>I was covering one of</i>
<i>the early evidentiary hearings.</i>

1033
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:35,897
<i>One of the public defenders,</i>
<i>in her question,</i>

1034
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:38,033
<i>used the name Brandon.</i>

1035
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:41,003
David Hanners outed me
and my name.

1036
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:43,705
And I said,
"That's not true."

1037
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:45,807
And Scott said well,
then we need to do
this and this,

1038
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:49,111
Scott:
<i>"I stand by Brandon Darby.</i>

1039
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:51,847
If Brandon was conning me,
and many others,

1040
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,715
it would be the biggest lie
of my life

1041
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,118
since I found out the truth
about Santa Claus as a child.

1042
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,986
It's absurd."

1043
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,189
Scott Crow called me up
and reamed me out

1044
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,092
and called me
all kind of names,

1045
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:08,864
and said
"There's no way in hell
it could be Brandon Darby.

1046
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:10,832
I mean he's the last guy
on earth

1047
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:14,036
who would ever be
a confidential informant
for the FBI."

1048
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,772
David and Brad were saying
that Brandon was the informant.

1049
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:20,676
And people were like
we don't trust them.
We don't trust them.

1050
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,844
<i>But we got the files.</i>

1051
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,880
<i>I went to Scott's house</i>
<i>to look at them.</i>

1052
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,282
He's like,
Brandon's with the FBI.

1053
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:28,917
I was like...

1054
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,786
Scott:
<i>Was he my friend</i>

1055
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,689
or has he been gathering
information for the FBI
a long time,

1056
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:37,759
playing me for the biggest dupe
has ever happened in my life?

1057
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:42,130
Brandon:
At that point I had begun to see
Scott in a very different light.

1058
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:45,801
<i>When I was younger and was</i>
<i>getting into radical politics,</i>

1059
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,737
<i>he really took me</i>
<i>under his wing.</i>

1060
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,274
I felt like I was a lot
more radical by the time
I was done knowing Scott Crow.

1061
01:01:52,276 --> 01:01:54,476
Interviewer:
Brandon seems to have this idea

1062
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,912
<i>that you radicalized him.</i>

1063
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:58,914
<i>That you kinda</i>
<i>turned him towards violence.</i>

1064
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,182
<i>What do you make of that?</i>

1065
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,117
I'm not even gonna
answer the question.

1066
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:04,753
Yeah, it's like,
it's a moot point.

1067
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:06,254
<i>What's that based on,</i>
<i>do you think?</i>

1068
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,091
I mean, my answer is
Brandon's a liar.

1069
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,760
<i>Well, look at 200 pages</i>
<i>of documents that we have,</i>

1070
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:16,031
<i>and he tried to put me</i>
<i>and Lisa Fithian in prison.</i>

1071
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:19,000
<i>He tried very hard</i>
<i>to get me to participate</i>

1072
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:20,969
<i>in the Republican</i>
<i>National Convention.</i>

1073
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,939
<i>And I just refused to because</i>
<i>I wasn't interested in it.</i>

1074
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,941
I look at these documents

1075
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,043
and he tried to put me
in prison for doing nothing.

1076
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:30,045
They could never
trust him again.

1077
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:33,982
And I think that was
what really hurt them,

1078
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:37,953
and I think ultimately it's
what probably really hurt
Brandon.

1079
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:40,756
"To all concerned,

1080
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,091
There are currently
allegations in the media

1081
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:47,028
that I've worked undercover
for the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

1082
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:51,967
This allegation no doubt
confuses many of the activists
who know me,

1083
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,835
and probably leaves
many wondering

1084
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:58,106
why I would seemingly chose
to engage in such an endeavor.

1085
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,108
The simple truth is,
that I have chosen

1086
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,344
to work with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation."

1087
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:07,783
Somebody's who's a psychologist
did a little profile of him,

1088
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:09,317
reading his letter,

1089
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,853
and it shows,
you know,

1090
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,389
it says his personality
clearly shows he has a lot
of stress and trauma.

1091
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:18,260
And my belief,
it's because he's been living
a double life for years.

1092
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:21,029
(laughs)
Right, what is the truth?

1093
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,303
The Molotov cocktails would not
have been made

1094
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,205
had it not been
for Brandon Darby.

1095
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,307
I have no problem saying
that and I believe that.

1096
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:38,046
He wasn't saying,
"Oh we should make
Molotov cocktails."

1097
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:42,284
But he was creating
the groundwork for something
like that to happen.

1098
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:44,586
David was manipulated.

1099
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,888
I don't care
what anybody says.

1100
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,291
You know what,
I'd put a lot of money

1101
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,893
that those kids would not
have built those

1102
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:53,361
if Brandon had never
been involved.

1103
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:12,614
<i>The idea of Molotov cocktails</i>
<i>came from Brandon</i>

1104
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,217
<i>and it was,</i>
<i>"Go look on the website.</i>

1105
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,185
<i>Here's the website</i>
<i>that I know about.</i>

1106
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,921
<i>Brad what do you</i>
<i>think about this?</i>

1107
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,991
<i>Brad thinks it's a good idea.</i>
<i>David what do you think</i>
<i>about this?</i>

1108
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,993
<i>I think we can do this.</i>

1109
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,628
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>you can do this?"</i>

1110
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,397
<i>"Yeah we can do it.</i>
<i>What do we do?"</i>

1111
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,968
<i>"Well, you know,</i>
<i>you get the supplies.</i>

1112
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:36,104
<i>We'll be implementing,</i>
<i>this is a tactic.</i>

1113
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,406
<i>Call me when you're done."</i>

1114
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,142
Well he really got
into detail there,
didn't he?

1115
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:43,278
Yeah.

1116
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,114
Michael:
<i>That was a complete lie</i>
<i>that David said</i>

1117
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:49,084
<i>so that he could get off</i>
<i>for his crime.</i>

1118
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:53,021
The way that he rationalizes
and also Brad rationalizes

1119
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,357
is that the government
was also lying.

1120
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,359
They were trying to say
that they were domestic
terrorists,

1121
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:59,995
that they had intent to use
them, that they were planning
to kill people.

1122
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:03,932
And in the face of those
giant lies that made them
look like monsters,

1123
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,400
this was a minor lie.

1124
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,203
Well, you can justify...

1125
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,338
there's a lot of people
justifying things in this story.

1126
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:13,008
(protestors cheering, chanting)

1127
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:19,981
<i>Resist! Resist!</i>
<i>Raise your fucking fist!</i>

1128
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:22,484
<i>Resist! Resist!</i>
<i>Raise your fucking fist!</i>

1129
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:27,122
I think that there's
very legitimate questions
about whether the FBI

1130
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:33,295
<i>They have to have</i>
<i>something to justify</i>
<i>thousands of riot cops,</i>

1131
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,997
<i>and tear gas and mass arrests.</i>

1132
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,633
And sadly I think Brad and David
became that justification.

1133
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:46,942
Lisa:
<i>Who cares that a few windows</i>
<i>were broken in St. Paul?</i>

1134
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:49,411
<i>The magnitude of violence</i>
<i>our government is wreaking</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

1135
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:52,013
Right, I mean,
it's like the scope and scale

1136
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:55,150
of what we pay attention to is
so warped in our country.

1137
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:57,552
There's a time and a place
for corporate property
destruction.

1138
01:05:57,554 --> 01:06:00,555
(cheering, glass breaks)

1139
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:07,028
The fact that Brad and David
built Molotov cocktails

1140
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,397
I do not believe
is a violent act.

1141
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:12,100
Property destruction
is not violence.

1142
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:15,503
(police screaming)

1143
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:21,142
There's a million problems
with anarchists using arson,

1144
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,446
but one of the problems,
even if you're looking at it
from their perspective

1145
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:26,548
and you do take
their world view,

1146
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,417
is that they're not--
they don't have Ph.D.'s
in determining,

1147
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,553
you know, risk assessment.

1148
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,257
<i>What if you hurt someone?</i>

1149
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:38,526
<i>What if your fire</i>
<i>goes out of control?</i>

1150
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:45,300
Hanners: <i>I kinda got the feeling</i>
<i>that some of this was overblown.</i>

1151
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:49,471
What you have at the core is,
you know,

1152
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,574
a couple of 22-year-old guys

1153
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:57,512
who really didn't have
a strong clue as to what
they were doing.

1154
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,249
<i>I think they got in</i>
<i>quickly over their heads</i>

1155
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,517
<i>and got caught up</i>
<i>in the moment.</i>

1156
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,356
They hadn't gone
up there planning to make
Molotov cocktails.

1157
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,560
<i>When they made</i>
<i>Molotov cocktails</i>

1158
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:16,231
<i>was in response</i>
<i>to the shields being taken.</i>

1159
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,099
<i>Brandon hadn't</i>
<i>have been with them,</i>

1160
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:20,101
<i>shields wouldn't</i>
<i>have been taken,</i>

1161
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:22,303
<i>they never would</i>
<i>have made Molotov cocktails.</i>

1162
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:28,443
It's those kind of details
that defy simple explanations.

1163
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,311
Did he entrap them?
No.

1164
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,414
Would they have
made them without him? No.

1165
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:36,418
It's...  it's...
that's sort of the tragedy
at the heart of it.

1166
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:41,623
David:
<i>Never did I plan to do</i>
<i>anything to hurt anybody.</i>

1167
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:45,260
<i>There's no good guy</i>
<i>and bad guy in this situation.</i>

1168
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:48,329
<i>I'm not completely innocent,</i>
<i>but neither are they.</i>

1169
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,067
<i>It's not a black-and-white</i>
<i>case like that.</i>

1170
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,519
<i>(Gospel music playing</i>
<i>and singing)</i>

1171
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,326
At this time,
I'd like to introduce someone

1172
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:23,431
who met with the pastor
after the storm.

1173
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:29,270
He said we will help you
put this church back together.

1174
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,706
He stood behind
every word of it.

1175
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:35,677
Helping our folks
in the neighborhood.

1176
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,279
(applause)

1177
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,349
I'm a little nervous
to be up here.

1178
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:44,586
I struggle with all these things
in my personal life.

1179
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:49,290
Sometimes it's really easy
to get my eyes off what my role
in this world is,

1180
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,460
- which is to try
to help other people.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1181
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:56,397
And I can forget
every other thing
that I'm supposed to do,

1182
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,734
but I've usually
kept my eyes on that.

1183
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:03,471
And for whatever reason
God's really blessed me
and loved me.

1184
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:07,342
And he's taken a lot of my
mistakes and he's turned them
into really positive things.

1185
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:09,210
Congregation:
Amen!

1186
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:14,249
And I'm glad I was able to be
used in a way that was helpful.

1187
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,618
And it really
does touch my heart
to see everyone here

1188
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,686
and to see this building
standing as it does.

1189
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:24,192
There was a time when it
had water in it... pretty high.

1190
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:26,361
- So, thank you.
- Congregation: Thank you!

1191
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,774
The community?
Community would love him,

1192
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:42,277
take him back with open arms.

1193
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,180
The activist community?

1194
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,182
They might try to shoot him.
(laughs)

1195
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,351
<i>I knew from the very beginning</i>

1202

1203

<i>a young man that I loved,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

<i>to such dastardly deeds.</i>

1205
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:17,412
<i>Not for patriotism.</i>

1206
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,681
<i>Because he was</i>
<i>a paid informant.</i>

1207
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,617
<i>He did this</i>
<i>for thirty pieces of silver.</i>

1208
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:28,289
With that interview,
I don't really know where
to begin, you know?

1209
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:33,394
I did not co-found
a relief organization
to destroy it.

1210
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,664
And...

1211
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,535
and I didn't work
with the FBI for money.

1212
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:43,571
Brandon Darby is,
you know,

1213
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,741
he's relegated himself
into insignificance.

1214
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,310
And as far as I'm concerned
he's dead.

1215

1239
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,654
There are dangerous rivers
of thought going on,

1240
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,623
on the far Left and in
the peace and justice community.

1241
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,859
And the Left as a whole
needs to hold them accountable.

1242
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,495
They constantly beat the drum,
you know,

1243
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:49,564
beat the drum that I'm evil
or the Man is evil,

1244
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:51,566
the empire is evil.

1245

And I'm somehow part of that
because of what I've done.

1246
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:56,437
My biggest concern is like,

they've gone through
great efforts to protect me,

01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,838
<i>If he can be the savior,</i>
<i>for the moment,</i>

1278
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,508
if he can make the world
like him cause he doesn't
like himself.

1279
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,945
Man:
They called Brandon Darby
a snitch.

1280
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:48,816
and I said I don't care
what your politics are,
you're an American Hero.

1281
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,251
(applause)

1282
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:52,820
Without Brandon Darby
these guys would have

1283
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:56,858
thrown Molotov cocktails at
completely innocent individuals

1284
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,027
who were there practicing their
constitutional right

1285
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:02,997
to express
their political beliefs.

1286
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,602
<i>He was just doing</i>
<i>the right thing.</i>

1287
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,704
The radical Left hates me.

1288
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:12,106
I think the moderate Left
doesn't know what the hell
to think of me.

1289
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,942
And the conservatives
in the country

1290
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:19,113
are willing to embrace me
and be supportive because
of what I did.

1291
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:22,917
Caroline: <i>So Brandon's going</i>
<i>across the nation giving talks</i>

1292
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:26,687
on how the Tea Party can adopt
a grassroots, activist model.

1293
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,525
Man: <i>Mister Brandon Darby,</i>
<i>come on up.</i>

1294
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,693
- <i>(applause)</i>
<i>- Brandon:</i> <i>We're called Citizen</i>
<i>Patriot Response.</i>

1295
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,830
And what we do is we try to use
the experiences I have,

1296
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:39,033
and we try to encourage
Tea Party groups to help others,

1297
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,702
with low-income communities.

1298
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,804
Because we believe
that people help people

1299
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,973
better than
the federal government can.

1300
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:48,009
(applause)

1301
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,945
He's trying to introduce
the best elements

1302
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:52,613
of the Common Ground model,

1303
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,148
to the Tea Party,

1304
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,617
so that they will work
on issues of social injustice.

1305
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,619
Brandon:
I wanted to help people,

1306
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:02,623
and I thought the way
to help people was
to help the Left.

1307
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:05,860
But really
I wasn't such a Leftist
after all, you know?

1308
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:07,995
I just wanted
to help people.

1309
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,998
(applause)

1310
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,968
The 2008
Republican National Convention.

1311
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:17,772
How many of you realized
there was a bomb plot against
the delegates?

1312
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:20,875
They made eight gallon-size
homemade napalm mixtures

1313
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:23,945
that they were gonna throw
at Republican delegates,
and at cops.

1314
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,780
They get arrested.

1315
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:27,848
...honored to have been
a big part of that.

1316
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,050
I'm very honored.

1317
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,986
(applause)

1318
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,659
Thank you.
Thank you.

1319
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,896
I think from day one
Brandon has stories that
he tells himself.

1320
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,899
<i>Brandon had a story</i>
<i>that he told himself</i>

1321
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,802
<i>about why he was with the FBI</i>
<i>and what his concerns were.</i>

1322
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:49,837
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1323
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:53,207
Now that Brandon's main audience
<i>is the very right wing,</i>

1324
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:56,777
<i>he's convinced himself</i>
<i>of a new story.</i>

1325
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,148
How he's a hero who
single-handedly stopped,

1326
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:03,684
terrorists from
killing delegates

1327
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:06,621
<i>at the Republican</i>
<i>National Convention.</i>

1328
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:08,990
- Photographer: Bullshit!
- (laughter)

1329
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:14,395
<i>Maybe he hears it enough</i>
<i>and he believes it.</i>

1330
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:17,632
<i>He certainly went in</i>
<i>hoping that he would do</i>
<i>something heroic.</i>

1331
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:21,202
<i>I think that the details</i>
<i>of this are much more ambiguous.</i>

1332
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,939
I ended up helping
stop a bomb plot,

1333
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:30,845
And they tried to throw
Molotovs at police officers
and Republican delegates.

1334
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:32,880
In the farthest reaches
of the Left we have people,

1335
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:34,715
like Lisa Fithian,

1336
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:37,918
organizing the most radical
dredges of the Left.

1337
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,123
All of the young people
around her take that war drum

1338
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:45,760
that she beats about our country
and that dehumanizes you,

1339
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:47,862
and they make bombs to burn you.

1340
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:51,132
They burn your property down
and they attack you.

1341
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:53,768
Thank you for coming
and paying attention.

1342
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:56,237
You have to fight back,
you have to speak back,

1343
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,273
you have to do something about
the people who are trying
to destroy us.

1344
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:01,876
- Thank You.
- <i>(applause)</i>

1345
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:04,145
Brandon Darby.

1346
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:07,948
He was once part
of that other crowd

1347
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:12,720
that you see in the Occupy
Wall Street protests.

1348
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,722
He saw the light.

1349
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:19,260
<i>He has come over</i>
<i>to the side of freedom.</i>

1350
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:30,104
(alarm keypad beeps)

1351
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,044
Brandon:
<i>To all concerned.</i>

1352
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:40,748
<i>Like many of you,</i>
<i>I do my best to act</i>
<i>in good conscience,</i>

1353
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:44,151
<i>and to do what I believe</i>
<i>to be most helpful to the world.</i>

1354
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:48,189
<i>Though my views on how</i>
<i>to give of myself have changed</i>
<i>very substantially,</i>

1355
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,225
<i>the motivations</i>
<i>remain the same.</i>

1356
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,963
<i>I strongly stand</i>
<i>behind my choices.</i>

1357
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:59,033
<i>In solidarity,</i>
<i>Brandon Michael Darby.</i>
