1
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:17,295
It's true, the hittite army
has 16,000 troops camped outside Kadesh.

2
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,475
What's less clear is why.

3
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,604
The hittites are trying
to cross the border.

4
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,097
Obviously.

5
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,234
What else would they be doing?

6
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,570
Anticipating an invasion by us,
according to our information.

7
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,228
They think we are...

8
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,946
Preparing an attack,
which we are not.

9
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:38,487
What I don't want to do, and won't do,
is sit here...

10
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,163
And wait until we're fighting
hittite armies...

11
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,452
Outside the palace walls.

12
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,956
Come.

13
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,883
What do the entrails say?

14
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,303
They don't "say" anything.

15
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,974
They imply.

16
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,372
And that's open to interpretation.

17
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,722
So, interpret them.

18
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,385
We'll win or we won't
in a preemptive attack?

19
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,394
It's a yes or a no.

20
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,904
And it's not clear.

21
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,072
But something else is.

22
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,697
In the battle, a leader will be saved...

23
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:27,745
And his savior will someday lead.

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,586
Then the entrails should also say...

25
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,588
That we will abandon reason...

26
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,380
And be guided by omens.

27
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,177
Great sekhmet...

28
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,805
Pharaoh drinks in your name...

29
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,025
And prays for victory
over the hittites at Kadesh.

30
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,988
Your first order of business
when the time comes, you retire her.

31
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,491
I will.

32
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,452
I don't know why my father hasn't.

33
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,451
But, just in case...

34
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:10,825
If you see me in any real danger out there,
ride the other way.

35
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,171
I'm serious.

36
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,632
When I look at you,
I still see the two boys...

37
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,344
Who grew up together, close as brothers.

38
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,137
If, for any reason...

39
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,599
You ever forget that...

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,682
Let these remind you.

41
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,648
Long enough to be effective
from horseback...

42
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,517
Not so long that you trip over them.

43
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,817
This is his. You've got mine.

44
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,489
That's right. That's how I want it.

45
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,698
You have each other's...

46
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,816
To keep each other safe.

47
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,374
Promise me you'll do that...

48
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,533
Always.

49
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,675
Seti! Seti! Seti!

50
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,261
Seti!

51
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,165
There!

52
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:34,268
Deploy amun division to the north,
ra division to the center...

53
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,650
And ptah to the South.
And we hold Seth in reserve.

54
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,687
- In reserve?
- Yes.

55
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,696
We should concentrate our strength
in the center.

56
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,700
You should concentrate yours
on fighting.

57
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,701
Leave the generalship to me.

58
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,192
Fire!

59
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,912
Fire!

60
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,438
Charge!

61
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,092
Take Ramses! Go!

62
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,853
Go!

63
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,813
Turn around! Turn around!

64
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:35,638
Turn around!

65
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,125
Moses! Moses! Moses!

66
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,349
Moses.

67
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,147
What happened out there?

68
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,440
Nothing.

69
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,283
I asked the commanders the same thing.
They, too, lied.

70
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,988
And I'm tired of it.

71
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,532
He thinks something happened.

72
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,326
- But it didn't.
- Meaning?

73
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,158
The high priestess, her prophecy.

74
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,326
She said she couldn't see who would win.

75
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,844
The other one.
"The leader will be saved..."

76
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,298
And so on.

77
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,009
You saved my son's life?

78
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,511
Yes.

79
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,854
Sit.

80
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,846
"Thank you" is not sufficient...

81
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,691
But thank you.

82
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,975
I know you don't believe
in omens or prophecies...

83
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,025
But I do believe.

84
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,899
And I respect that.

85
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,703
But this isn't anything.

86
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,200
This doesn't even make any sense.

87
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,873
Because you're not my blood.

88
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,327
Yes.

89
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,039
It's true, you can't succeed me.

90
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,626
Not in the usual way.

91
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,210
Not in any way.

92
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,385
In any way imaginable, sitting here.

93
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,716
It's horrible to say this
about one's own son...

94
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,221
But I trust you more than him to lead.

95
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,728
"The hittite chariotry...

96
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,442
"Crashed through our defense
and began its attack.

97
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,570
"I found myself
surrounded by the enemy...

98
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,034
"No soldier, no shield-bearer...

99
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,583
"Facing a desperate fight for my life.

100
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,736
"Only with the help of the gods...

101
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,373
"Did I defeat our attackers...

102
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,674
"And rejoin ra division."

103
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,248
Stop there.

104
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,804
Anything you'd like to rephrase?

105
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,131
No.

106
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,052
- Shall I go on?
- No, I'm sure the rest is fine.

107
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,434
What's next?

108
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,720
Pithom.

109
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,893
What about it?

110
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,641
The situation. The slaves.

111
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,603
Fine. Ramses.

112
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,524
What?

113
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,443
Go up there, meet with the viceroy,
look around, make a report.

114
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,031
Me?

115
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:25,108
It will be yours someday.
Take an interest in it.

116
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,278
What else?

117
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,248
I'll go to see the viceroy.

118
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,595
No.

119
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,006
I'll go.

120
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,219
It's beneath you.

121
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,469
It's beneath any general.

122
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,970
I'll do it.

123
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,348
Ramses...

124
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,101
Can we forget what happened...

125
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,062
On the battlefield?

126
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,272
If our positions had been reversed...

127
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,153
I would've saved your life, too.

128
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,110
I know. I know.

129
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,333
It was a good shot.

130
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,675
Even if the gods did guide your aim.

131
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,183
A little venom in your blood
is a good thing.

132
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,098
Makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite.

133
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,138
Maybe even my father's.

134
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,557
Welcome to Pithom.

135
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,396
You get used to the smell.

136
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,583
The viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources.

137
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,344
This isn't a job everyone wants to do,
my lord.

138
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,547
A certain degree of comfort is necessary
to keep up his spirits.

139
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,465
You know what the problem is?
People live too long these days.

140
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,664
Every year, the death rate
lags further behind the birth rate.

141
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,940
And these people...

142
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,858
They reproduce like it's a sport.

143
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,359
This is the problem?
A growing work force?

144
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,031
No, of course not.
It's good for production.

145
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,571
Of course it is, but only to a point.

146
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,116
When that population wants you dead...

147
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,080
Yes, it's a problem.

148
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,789
So, either I'm given more troops
to maintain order...

149
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,464
Or I start thinning out the herd.

150
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,632
You start slaughtering people...

151
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,591
For no reason other than
this precarious theory...

152
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,643
You will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid.

153
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,468
Fine, then give me the troops.

154
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,770
Let's go down and talk to them.

155
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,979
Why on earth?

156
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:45,478
You're worried about sedition.
Let's find out if that worry is real.

157
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,773
By talking to them?

158
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,115
By looking at them...

159
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,572
When I talk with them.

160
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,282
You can tell a lot about somebody...

161
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,993
Looking him in the eye.

162
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,660
Let me tell you something...

163
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,331
About Hebrews.

164
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,169
They are a conniving, combative people.

165
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,465
Do you know what "Israelite" means...

166
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,713
In their own language?

167
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,134
"He who fights with God."

168
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,634
"He who wrestles with God."

169
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,296
There is a difference.

170
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,522
I may not be as educated as you, which,
apparently, you want to remind me of.

171
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,642
But I have to deal with them every day.

172
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,225
I know what I'm talking about.

173
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,650
You don't have to come.
I'll go down there myself.

174
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,976
Stop!

175
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,150
Why is he being punished?

176
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,230
Persistent troublemaker, my lord.

177
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,699
Why is he smiling?

178
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,244
He says he feels no pain, my lord.

179
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,874
Then why whip him?

180
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,801
You were not gathered up at random.

181
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,841
I asked to see...

182
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,593
The elders.

183
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,057
Come on. What do you pray for?

184
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,393
We pray to see Canaan again.

185
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,564
Canaan again?

186
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,812
You've never seen it.

187
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,814
I've seen Canaan.

188
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,566
I've seen that it's inhabited
by tribes fiercer than Egypt's military.

189
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,228
So, you won't be returning to it...

190
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,647
Or, if you do, from it.

191
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,575
- God says otherwise.
- Which God?

192
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,913
Your God? The God of Abraham?

193
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,738
The God that says that you are special?

194
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,913
That you are chosen?

195
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,291
Come here. Up.

196
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,447
Come here.

197
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,751
He's wrong.

198
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,512
I can see you're unconvinced,
and that's a problem.

199
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,836
Because next to unrealistic belief
lies fanaticism...

200
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,216
And next to that, sedition,
and next to that, revolution.

201
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,973
And it all starts with the elders.

202
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,025
What's your name?

203
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,097
What's yours?

204
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,732
I'll tell you.

205
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,361
I am Moses, son of Bithia...

206
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,148
Grandson of Horemheb.

207
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,411
Record this one's name
and the rest of them.

208
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,369
Bring in the next group.

209
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,541
My name is Nun.

210
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,043
My lord!

211
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,504
- Stop there!
- Let him through.

212
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,842
There's something the elder
has to tell you.

213
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,512
But not here.

214
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,630
Say where and when.

215
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,258
The prayer house, tonight.

216
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,849
Here.

217
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,284
I see you've survived your adventure.

218
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,034
Sorry to make you wait again.

219
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,779
I'm not waiting.

220
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,661
- How was your trip to the quarry?
- Fine.

221
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,818
You saw what I'm up against.

222
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,202
Tell me...

223
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,163
Is there any more of my records
I could get for you before you leave?

224
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,496
You can tell me...

225
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:36,631
Has all of this
been reported to Memphis?

226
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,091
Was it approved?
Do you have it in writing?

227
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,427
Of course. It's on record.

228
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,927
So you don't mind if we check?

229
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,641
Of course I don't mind.

230
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,930
But I don't understand
what's gone wrong.

231
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,025
Have I done something to displease you?

232
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,270
And if so, is there any way
I could please you?

233
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,816
You can stop living like a king.

234
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,072
You're not one.

235
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,790
"...and you will occupy
the land of Canaan."

236
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,424
Canaan is already occupied.

237
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,673
God promises we will return.

238
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,973
In chains or in coffins?

239
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,427
As free men...

240
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,007
Into a land flowing with milk and honey.

241
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,775
Can they at least wait outside?
We're not dangerous.

242
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,324
Wait by the horses.

243
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,281
Do you believe in coincidence?

244
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,279
As much as anything else.

245
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,204
I don't think this is one.

246
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,535
What isn't?

247
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,249
You coming to Pithom.

248
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,458
Why did you come?

249
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,618
Business.

250
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,003
Sit.

251
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:50,887
Who's your father?

252
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,144
I know you don't know his name...

253
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,143
Only that he was a general
in pharaoh's army...

254
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,435
Unnamed by your mother.

255
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,729
I can see
this is making you uncomfortable.

256
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,284
This will interest you.

257
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,954
There was no general.

258
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,529
Your mother...

259
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,744
The woman you call your mother,
has no children.

260
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,204
You were born a slave.

261
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,125
Don't go. Don't go.

262
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,923
It's better for you that I do.

263
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm leaving.

264
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:25,132
If you leave now,
you'll just come back...

265
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,836
Because you know something's wrong.
You've always felt it.

266
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,053
Please.

267
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,392
Everybody out.

268
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,351
Out.

269
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,203
The year of your birth...

270
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,698
There was a prophecy
that our leader would be born...

271
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,702
To liberate us from our bondage.

272
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,375
And so, there was an edict
from Memphis...

273
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,834
To kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.

274
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,755
Your parents didn't wait
for that to happen.

275
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,677
Any chance of your survival
was better than no chance.

276
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,337
They handed you to your sister.

277
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:17,386
She took you in a basket
to the banks of the river...

278
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,563
And she floated you to where she knew...

279
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,903
Pharaoh Paramesse's daughter,
Bithia, bathed.

280
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,740
Bithia took you and your sister,
Miriam, as a maid...

281
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,817
And raised you as her own.

282
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,912
She probably even loved you...

283
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:36,619
But she never told you, or anyone else,
the truth.

284
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,949
You are Hebrew.

285
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,119
The truth?

286
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,416
The truth is,
it's not even that good a story.

287
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,877
And I thought you people
were meant to be...

288
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,054
Good storytellers.

289
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,153
You, slave.

290
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,650
You!

291
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,079
Do you expect a reward
for this information?

292
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,042
Our reward is being of service to you.

293
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,132
That said, if there were...

294
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,418
Some token you had in mind
beyond that...

295
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,345
We wouldn't refuse it.

296
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,180
How about this, then?

297
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,258
What about if I don't kill you?

298
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:21,224
That would be sufficient payment.

299
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,101
You people.

300
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,445
Please leave.

301
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,154
Please.

302
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,323
How did it go?

303
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,912
We can talk about that another time.

304
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,452
We can talk about it now...

305
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,575
If only as a respite from this army
of grim-faced physicians.

306
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,462
Sit.

307
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:42,144
We're taking a thorough look
at the city records...

308
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,890
And the man is clearly a thief.

309
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:47,601
It's one of life's
more depressing ironies...

310
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,443
That the men who crave power...

311
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,818
Are best fitted to acquire it,
and least fitted to exercise it.

312
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,661
What's wrong, Moses?

313
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,821
You're sick.

314
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,660
Something else is troubling you.

315
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,501
I can tell.

316
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,835
No, nothing else.

317
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,865
May you be alert...

318
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:35,359
Rejuvenated and protected by the gods...

319
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,689
Every moment of your eternal life.

320
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:34,536
And to the left.

321
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,713
No, your left.

322
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,253
More, more, more.

323
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,587
Good.

324
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,594
It is tall.

325
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:44,974
Monuments are monuments...

326
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,391
For a reason. They inspire.

327
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,890
Inspire what, in this case?

328
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:54,395
In this, and in every case, power.

329
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,766
Say it out loud, whatever it is.

330
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,405
The viceroy of Pithom is outside.

331
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,745
He's not on the agenda.

332
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:06,408
He can go back to Pithom until he is.

333
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,079
No, we should deal with this.

334
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,487
Bring him in.

335
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,588
If you came here to beg
the new king's forgiveness...

336
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,473
It won't work.

337
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,139
Arrest him.

338
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,297
Wait, please.

339
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:29,968
May I at least respond?

340
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,314
I beg you.

341
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,979
It's in your interest.

342
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,016
- You make it short.
- I will...

343
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,309
To the king alone.

344
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,270
My advice is that...

345
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,986
He, and the other generals,
also leave the room.

346
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,446
Really?

347
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,319
That's your advice?

348
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,619
You are not his advisor.

349
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,157
That's right. You are.

350
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,286
That's right.

351
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,882
Moses.

352
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,295
Moses.

353
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,008
Everybody but the viceroy...

354
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,547
Out.

355
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,367
Terrible news.

356
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,870
There you are.

357
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,619
So...

358
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:38,835
The viceroy.

359
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,708
You didn't arrest him.

360
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,338
You didn't take
your chief advisor's advice.

361
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,716
No, he came.

362
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,930
He told me of an incident
involving two guards...

363
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,182
One of which survived the attack.

364
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,194
And I told him I did not care.

365
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:02,018
And then, he told me the most
unbelievable story.

366
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,978
Told to him, he said,
by very reliable sources.

367
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,566
Then, when pressed...

368
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,030
He admitted that they were Hebrew spies.

369
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,867
You know what I'm talking about.

370
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:14,239
Yes.

371
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,545
And what do you make of it?

372
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,287
I think it's offensive,
and I think it's ridiculous.

373
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,714
Yes. Yes!

374
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,502
You, of all people, a Hebrew.

375
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,670
And I said...

376
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,586
How can I believe such a story?

377
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,099
Cousin...

378
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,718
You can't.

379
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,346
What if I take the chance
of not believing it, Moses?

380
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,774
What am I to do?

381
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,233
Bithia!

382
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,859
Mother.

383
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:52,946
The man is a thief.

384
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,372
My son discovers this.

385
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,037
Not you.

386
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:59,537
And he reports it to your father,
who would have hanged this thief...

387
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
If he hadn't been dying himself.

388
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,294
You believe his feeble,
self-serving lies.

389
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,089
All I want to know is if it is true.

390
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,548
I didn't ask for a tirade.

391
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,381
To talk about this any longer...

392
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,764
Would dignify it...

393
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,051
- And I won't do that.
- Answer the question.

394
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,855
Yes or no?

395
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,098
Was I talking to you?

396
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,429
Bring her in. Bring her in.

397
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,310
Now!

398
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,479
Miriam!

399
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,067
Come. Sit down.

400
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,738
Now, I'm going to ask you some things...

401
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,699
That are going to seem
very strange to you.

402
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,620
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully.

403
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,660
How do you know Moses?

404
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,079
You know how I know him...

405
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,584
And you.

406
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,712
I helped raise you both.

407
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,627
So you are not his sister, then?

408
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,758
Of course not.

409
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,852
And you're not a Hebrew.

410
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:58,218
No.

411
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,597
Place your arm on the table.

412
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,111
Ramses...

413
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,149
don't be stupid!

414
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,649
I am not talking to you!

415
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,412
I am talking to her.

416
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,786
Your whole arm on the table, Miriam.

417
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,410
Thank you.

418
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:25,917
Ramses...

419
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,208
Don't take this any further.

420
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,303
Don't take this any further, or what?

421
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,546
Do not take this any further.

422
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,971
Are you quite sure about that?

423
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,680
Get your hand off it, or use it, now.

424
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,558
Or perhaps you'd like to answer
the question?

425
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,397
Then I'll proceed.

426
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,573
Miriam, I'm going to ask you again...

427
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,932
And if your answer is again no...

428
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,950
I apologize for what happens next.

429
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,412
Are you his sister?

430
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,708
No.

431
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:20,183
Yes!

432
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,352
Yes!

433
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,765
You don't need a reason to kill him,
but you have one.

434
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,591
- This was treason.
- How was it treason?

435
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,886
He just admitted he knew.

436
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,309
That wasn't an admission!

437
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,977
Simply did not want her arm lopped off!

438
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,848
I saw it in his eyes.

439
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,944
He does not believe this story.

440
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,783
I don't want to believe it!

441
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,819
You want to believe it, because it's an
opportunity to be rid of him...

442
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:20,994
Which you always wanted.

443
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:24,282
I didn't say "exiled," I said "dead."

444
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,003
That, I'm sure, will follow...

445
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,460
Where he's going.

446
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,468
Khyan...

447
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,300
Allow me to talk to my mother.

448
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,386
Yes, sir, yes.

449
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,915
Come, Miriam.

450
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:11,616
It isn't every man who would protect a
servant who's nothing more to him than that.

451
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,626
Certainly no one else in this family...

452
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:16,339
Including me.

453
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:20,049
I wouldn't have said
what he wanted to hear.

454
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,430
And neither would she.

455
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,388
That's how much we love you.

456
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,731
"We"?

457
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,279
It's not true.

458
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,532
It is true.

459
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,527
You were wearing this
when I brought you to the river.

460
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,115
I took it off you for obvious reasons.

461
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:54,002
That's you.

462
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:59,048
The connection between you
and our mother.

463
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,763
Your sister saved your life.

464
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,926
Now you saved hers...

465
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:10,932
Moshe.

466
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,455
Miriam.

467
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,057
Sorry, sir.

468
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,281
Moses!

469
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,489
Moses!

470
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,151
I have nothing to steal.

471
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:54,066
My horse is dead.

472
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,705
We're not here for your horse, Moshe.

473
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:03,621
A little bit higher.

474
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:22,762
What are you doing?

475
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,854
Don't stop. Keep working.

476
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,641
You, get water for our goats.

477
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:39,863
You.

478
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:42,204
Wait your turn.

479
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:55,092
Move your animals away from the troughs.

480
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,099
It's yours again.

481
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:35,044
Where are you from?

482
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,551
West of here.

483
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:40,051
Where are you going?

484
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:41,967
East.

485
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:44,303
What did you do?

486
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,221
What do you mean?

487
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,018
You committed some crime?

488
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,140
With respect...

489
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:56,016
Your daughters invited me for some food.

490
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:59,525
They did not tell me
there would be an interrogation.

491
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:01,109
I'm sorry.

492
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,573
I'm just curious.

493
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:08,869
You are welcome to get cleaned up
before dinner...

494
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,041
If that appeals to you...

495
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,399
And stay the night if you want...

496
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:14,792
Before continuing on...

497
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:16,794
To wherever it is.

498
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:18,086
Thank you.

499
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:44,409
Describe Memphis to someone...

500
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:46,447
Who's never been there and never will.

501
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:49,237
It's...

502
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,544
I don't want to say "civilized"...

503
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:54,869
Because I don't want to offend,
but it is civilized.

504
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:58,786
There's more there than sheep and goats.

505
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:01,416
There's more here than that.

506
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,134
Really? Where?

507
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,761
I'm sorry, that was rude.

508
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:09,513
That was rude.

509
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,925
I'm not ignorant
just because I live here.

510
00:48:11,974 --> 00:48:13,774
I can see that.

511
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:20,695
I can tell you one thing.

512
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:21,823
This is by far...

513
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:24,446
The nicest place...

514
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,907
Between here and there.

515
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:30,081
And so you're leaving?

516
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,447
Of course.

517
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,999
There's nothing here
for someone like me.

518
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:39,626
When?

519
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:42,461
Today?

520
00:49:33,806 --> 00:49:35,386
Remember this moment in time...

521
00:49:37,393 --> 00:49:39,313
For after these vows...

522
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,612
You shall say to the world...

523
00:49:43,232 --> 00:49:46,652
"This is my husband." "This is my wife."

524
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,408
I, Zipporah...

525
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,661
I, Moses...

526
00:49:54,702 --> 00:49:56,582
- Accept you, Zipporah...
- Accept you, Moses...

527
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:59,293
To be no other than yourself.

528
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,331
Loving what I know of you...

529
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:05,336
Trusting what I do not yet know.

530
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:08,301
With respect...

531
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,684
For your integrity...

532
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:12,218
And faith...

533
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,011
In your abiding love for me.

534
00:50:15,848 --> 00:50:18,558
In all that life may bring us...

535
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,811
I pledge my love.

536
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,312
I pledge my love.

537
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:23,194
Who makes you happy?

538
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:26,284
You do.

539
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:34,368
What's the most important thing
in your life?

540
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:36,871
You are.

541
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,419
Where would you rather be?

542
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:42,749
Nowhere.

543
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:46,456
And when will you leave me?

544
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,960
Never.

545
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,468
Proceed.

546
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,113
I said "per se."

547
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:55,199
I don't want to discuss my tomb, per se.

548
00:51:55,907 --> 00:52:00,117
I want to discuss why you seem to want
to discuss it all the time.

549
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,251
Respectfully...

550
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:04,087
It should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne.

551
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:06,748
It'll be a big project,
as you might imagine.

552
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:09,092
So is my house, apparently.

553
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,876
Is there a problem with the palace?

554
00:52:11,923 --> 00:52:13,513
It's not done.

555
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:15,379
It won't be long now.

556
00:52:15,426 --> 00:52:18,346
You said that months ago.
Meanwhile I'm living there like...

557
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:20,097
A bedouin.

558
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:22,637
Get it done.

559
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:24,811
Faster!

560
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,728
Or do I have to kill somebody?

561
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:30,648
I think you made your point.

562
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:43,369
Good throw, father.

563
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:45,082
Just aim a little higher.

564
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,085
Almost.

565
00:52:58,803 --> 00:53:00,183
Have you ever been to the top?

566
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
No.

567
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,353
Would you like to?

568
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:09,065
Mother says it's forbidden.

569
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:10,115
By who?

570
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,150
Our God.

571
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:15,111
Our God...

572
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:18,491
Stops us from climbing mountains?

573
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:20,201
Not every Mountain.

574
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,990
Just that one.

575
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:25,333
It's God's Mountain.

576
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,010
You're confusing him.

577
00:53:47,393 --> 00:53:48,813
I'm not trying to.

578
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:52,692
Is it good for our boy to grow up
believing in nothing?

579
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:56,742
Is it bad to grow up
believing in yourself?

580
00:53:57,987 --> 00:54:00,157
- It's my faith.
- I know.

581
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,948
- And it's his, too.
- I understand.

582
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,951
He can make up his mind when he's older.

583
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:05,543
- Yes.
- Just like you.

584
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,370
He's a lot like me already.

585
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:33,246
Moshe.

586
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,103
Help me!

587
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:57,768
I think my leg is broken.

588
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:01,397
More than that.

589
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:06,244
What did you say?

590
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:10,455
Who are you?

591
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:16,917
Who are you?

592
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,960
I'm a Shepherd.

593
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:23,092
I thought you were a general.

594
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:29,599
I need a general.

595
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:35,443
Why?

596
00:56:35,478 --> 00:56:37,148
To fight.

597
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:38,688
Why else?

598
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,820
Fight who?

599
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:45,034
For what?

600
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:49,491
I think you know.

601
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:59,341
I think you should go and see
what's happening to your people now.

602
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:02,127
He won't be at peace until you do.

603
00:57:03,422 --> 00:57:05,842
Or are they not people...

604
00:57:06,342 --> 00:57:07,632
In your opinion?

605
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:12,514
Who are you?

606
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,361
I am.

607
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:32,334
I am.

608
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:47,336
You were hit on the head.

609
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,391
Anything you saw...

610
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,895
Or think you saw afterwards...

611
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:54,426
Was an effect of that.

612
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:56,023
The storm...

613
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:59,478
The storm started before
I was hit on the head.

614
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,770
- It was not a storm.
- Fine, fine.

615
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:03,654
The storm was something.

616
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:05,691
It was something else.

617
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,535
- But the boy was all in your head.
- How do you know?

618
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:09,661
How do you know?

619
00:58:09,697 --> 00:58:10,697
Because God isn't a boy!

620
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:13,447
Then what does he look like?

621
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:16,202
Describe him.
Describe him to someone like me.

622
00:58:16,245 --> 00:58:17,525
Do you know what you sound like?

623
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:22,334
Yes. I sound delusional.

624
00:58:22,376 --> 00:58:23,376
Yes.

625
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,338
Yes.

626
00:58:25,379 --> 00:58:28,629
- You just need more rest.
- Yes, yes.

627
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,930
I have to tell you something.

628
00:58:33,471 --> 00:58:35,721
I have to tell you something.

629
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:41,057
I've not been completely honest
with you.

630
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:43,265
About what?

631
00:58:43,564 --> 00:58:44,944
About who I am.

632
00:58:46,275 --> 00:58:49,735
About what I've done
and who I was.

633
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:52,365
And how I feel.

634
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,240
- About what you feel about me?
- No.

635
00:58:56,744 --> 00:58:59,504
No, I've been honest about that.

636
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,794
Rest.

637
00:59:05,753 --> 00:59:07,593
- Rest.
- Don't leave me.

638
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,010
No. No.

639
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:28,654
Moshe.

640
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,040
Gershom?

641
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:54,012
What are you doing out here?

642
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:55,051
Nothing.

643
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:56,604
I can't sleep.

644
00:59:59,557 --> 01:00:01,177
Are you worried about me?

645
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:03,727
Yes.

646
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:06,362
Don't.

647
01:00:08,024 --> 01:00:09,444
I'll be fine.

648
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,245
What's that?

649
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:16,825
What's it look like?

650
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:24,039
Come inside.

651
01:00:24,373 --> 01:00:26,003
Come inside!

652
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:53,742
What are you going to do with all that?

653
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:58,866
Make sure I see you again.

654
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:03,411
Put it down and you can see me forever.

655
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:22,105
What's this mean?

656
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,230
It's someone I used to know.

657
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:39,782
This is not forever.

658
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:44,035
I will see you again.

659
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,791
Do you believe me?

660
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:53,131
Good for you.

661
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:57,171
Don't ever just say
what people want to hear.

662
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,547
But I will...

663
01:02:00,928 --> 01:02:02,468
I will see you again.

664
01:02:09,937 --> 01:02:12,107
Will you keep this for me?

665
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:15,231
Gershom.

666
01:02:16,194 --> 01:02:19,204
Gershom, please look at me.

667
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:35,553
What kind of God tells a man...

668
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:37,628
To leave his family?

669
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,761
If you understand it,
I'll understand it.

670
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:43,887
I don't.

671
01:02:45,014 --> 01:02:46,724
So I can't answer that question.

672
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:51,354
If that's what faith means,
I will trade mine...

673
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:52,895
To keep you.

674
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:02,705
Don't touch me.

675
01:03:04,283 --> 01:03:05,493
Go.

676
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,950
Go!

677
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:16,518
Father, have you some milk to spare?

678
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,108
Yes.

679
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:20,109
Where did you come from?

680
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:23,865
I come from the sea.

681
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:27,662
It's a narrow and dangerous path.

682
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:36,205
Thank you, father.

683
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:50,621
Joshua. I remember you.

684
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:53,655
Do you still feel no pain?

685
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,672
Keep your eye on the horse.

686
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,942
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, brother.

687
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,730
Aaron...

688
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:24,153
Your brother.

689
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,194
Ithamar.

690
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:30,531
Ithamar, this...

691
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,120
Is your famous Uncle Moses.

692
01:06:33,993 --> 01:06:36,083
He was once a prince of Egypt.

693
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:09,779
I'm fine.

694
01:07:11,906 --> 01:07:14,736
Everybody's fine.

695
01:07:52,989 --> 01:07:54,949
You sleep so well, my boy...

696
01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:59,325
Because you know you are loved.

697
01:08:01,998 --> 01:08:04,328
I've never slept so well.

698
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,110
I'm told I should address you...

699
01:08:26,147 --> 01:08:30,477
As Ramses the Great, now.

700
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,361
Moses...

701
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:36,824
You're alive.

702
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,906
- I'm glad you're alive.
- Really?

703
01:08:39,493 --> 01:08:42,043
Is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me?

704
01:08:42,997 --> 01:08:43,997
My mother.

705
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:46,458
- Don't blame her.
- Yes, she wanted you dead.

706
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:50,051
Who do you think hid your sword
where you would find it?

707
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:53,918
Moses.

708
01:08:57,678 --> 01:08:59,428
I'm not here...

709
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:02,636
To take your throne.

710
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:04,353
It's not about the prophecy
that worries you so much.

711
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,523
This is something else.

712
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:08,903
I have been told...

713
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:13,363
That things here have become...

714
01:09:14,612 --> 01:09:15,612
Much worse.

715
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:19,242
Things are better than
they ever have been, Moses.

716
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:21,368
No.

717
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,910
- We have order.
- Order?

718
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:26,124
The slaves...

719
01:09:26,874 --> 01:09:30,174
Their bodies burn night and day now.

720
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:32,051
I've seen it with my own eyes.

721
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:34,208
You call that order?

722
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,377
They're slaves.

723
01:09:35,424 --> 01:09:36,844
- No, they're not.
- What would you expect?

724
01:09:36,884 --> 01:09:38,644
They're Egyptians,
they should be treated as Egyptians.

725
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:40,218
They should have the same rights...

726
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:41,893
They should be paid for their work...

727
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,851
Or you must set them free.

728
01:09:44,892 --> 01:09:46,352
They are not Egyptians.

729
01:09:46,769 --> 01:09:49,519
They are slaves, Moses.
What else do you expect?

730
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:50,844
They wouldn't know what to do...

731
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:54,400
If all of a sudden they were left
to fend for themselves like animals.

732
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:56,783
Do not call them animals!

733
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:02,412
Listen,
from an economic standpoint alone...

734
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:03,911
What you're asking...

735
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:06,413
Is problematic to say the least.

736
01:10:07,206 --> 01:10:11,916
I didn't expect to hear a simple yes.

737
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:15,711
But I do not want to hear a simple no.

738
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:17,586
Is that what you are telling me?
Are you saying no?

739
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:19,843
I'm not saying no.

740
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,136
I'm saying time.

741
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:23,596
Time.

742
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:25,519
You're listening to Hebrews.

743
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:26,718
I'm not listening to Hebrews.

744
01:10:26,976 --> 01:10:29,436
Who are you talking to?

745
01:10:30,938 --> 01:10:31,978
God.

746
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:38,322
God.

747
01:10:38,654 --> 01:10:40,914
Which God?

748
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:04,763
You're not seriously
considering his proposal.

749
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:06,465
Is it a proposal?

750
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:10,386
If a man is holding a dagger
to your throat, minister?

751
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:11,846
- Is it?
- I stand corrected.

752
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:14,025
That's a demand.

753
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:17,405
He has lost his mind.

754
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:20,533
He's found a God. His God.

755
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:23,664
Not one of ours...

756
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,537
So I would like Moses...

757
01:11:31,332 --> 01:11:33,042
I want Moses dead.

758
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,382
Did you hear me?

759
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:39,344
Yes.

760
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,302
Then, go.

761
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:44,678
And...

762
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,060
His family, too.

763
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,530
Moses.

764
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:03,702
Where's Moses?

765
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:12,369
Moses? Where's Moses?

766
01:12:54,624 --> 01:12:55,624
Moses...

767
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,415
His family.

768
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,800
Where are they?

769
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:25,068
This is not Moses.

770
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:30,076
This is not his family.

771
01:13:32,286 --> 01:13:34,456
This is a man...

772
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,457
His wife...

773
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,579
And his child...

774
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:42,796
Who when asked the simple question,
"where is he?"...

775
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:46,629
Answered, "we don't know."

776
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:02,148
Carry this image home with you tonight...

777
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:04,611
And discuss why you would protect him...

778
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:08,609
Knowing that tomorrow at this time...

779
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,576
There will be another family...

780
01:14:11,617 --> 01:14:13,987
Where this one is.

781
01:14:14,036 --> 01:14:16,366
And another the day after.

782
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,334
And the day after that.

783
01:14:20,751 --> 01:14:23,841
Dare I say yours?

784
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:38,019
Go ahead.

785
01:14:40,146 --> 01:14:41,606
I want to join the fight.

786
01:14:41,647 --> 01:14:42,647
In there.

787
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:52,066
Joshua, use your knee.

788
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:02,334
It's good.

789
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:29,148
Both eyes open!

790
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,365
Nock! Draw!

791
01:15:32,114 --> 01:15:33,114
Loose!

792
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,198
Advance.

793
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:36,703
Nock. Draw.

794
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:38,578
Loose!

795
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:40,247
Draw!

796
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:42,415
Loose!

797
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:44,417
Draw!

798
01:15:45,044 --> 01:15:46,044
Loose!

799
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:54,427
Again!

800
01:16:01,143 --> 01:16:02,523
There are two kinds of warfare.

801
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:05,813
Each is dictated by numbers.

802
01:16:06,482 --> 01:16:08,362
With greater numbers...

803
01:16:08,693 --> 01:16:11,033
You attack the enemy head on!

804
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:14,160
You stab it in the heart!

805
01:16:14,824 --> 01:16:17,204
With fewer numbers,
you come at it from the side.

806
01:16:17,243 --> 01:16:20,203
You cut off the blood...

807
01:16:21,163 --> 01:16:22,163
That pumps the heart.

808
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:25,498
The army supply lines.

809
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:26,753
No!

810
01:16:27,253 --> 01:16:28,963
The people's supply lines.

811
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:30,305
Their food...

812
01:16:30,339 --> 01:16:31,969
Their property...

813
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:33,798
Their comfort.

814
01:16:33,843 --> 01:16:35,093
What would that achieve?

815
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:36,853
Everything.

816
01:16:36,888 --> 01:16:39,138
Only the Egyptian people...

817
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:42,182
Can force him
to accept our demands...

818
01:16:42,226 --> 01:16:45,186
For freedom. We must force them...

819
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:47,945
To make him say yes!

820
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:49,531
Yes?

821
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:50,857
Yes!

822
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:51,994
Yes?

823
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:53,528
Yes!

824
01:18:20,032 --> 01:18:21,032
With me!

825
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,291
With me!

826
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:24,327
Ready.

827
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:55,896
You're not going to do anything?

828
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,067
I didn't say that.

829
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,686
Where have you been?

830
01:20:15,731 --> 01:20:17,071
Watching you fail.

831
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,737
Wars of attrition take time.

832
01:20:20,236 --> 01:20:22,356
At this rate, you'll take years...

833
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:23,915
A generation.

834
01:20:24,615 --> 01:20:26,735
I am prepared to fight for that long.

835
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:28,618
I'm not.

836
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:30,605
I thought we were making progress.

837
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:35,583
Now, you're impatient.

838
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:40,507
After 400 years of slavery.

839
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:46,261
Am I the only one sitting here
who's done nothing about this until now?

840
01:20:47,096 --> 01:20:48,466
I do know...

841
01:20:48,514 --> 01:20:51,024
A few things about military action.

842
01:20:51,058 --> 01:20:52,888
Still, if you're not going
to listen to me...

843
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:54,395
Then why did you take me away...

844
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:55,937
From my family?

845
01:20:56,939 --> 01:20:58,439
I didn't.

846
01:20:58,941 --> 01:21:00,531
You did.

847
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:02,608
You don't need me.

848
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:04,779
Maybe not.

849
01:21:07,533 --> 01:21:09,123
So what do I do? Nothing?

850
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:11,292
For now...

851
01:21:12,538 --> 01:21:14,248
You can watch.

852
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:58,641
Divine goddess Kebechet,
I humbly call upon you...

853
01:22:58,686 --> 01:23:01,266
To purify the waters
of our life-giving river.

854
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:18,959
How long will it take?

855
01:23:19,749 --> 01:23:21,579
Not long.

856
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:27,759
But longer than that.

857
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,650
Ramses! Ramses!

858
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:07,022
Yes?

859
01:25:10,651 --> 01:25:11,991
Enough!

860
01:25:12,028 --> 01:25:13,648
Do something!

861
01:25:13,696 --> 01:25:16,026
They're just frogs.

862
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:27,708
Back away, back away.

863
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:29,042
Unclean.

864
01:25:29,086 --> 01:25:30,546
No, no, no. Don't drink.

865
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:31,588
Unclean.

866
01:26:03,287 --> 01:26:07,707
The Nile, as we know,
carries a certain amount of Clay.

867
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,210
This year there's much more of it
than usual...

868
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:12,713
Drifting in on the currents,
settling on the riverbeds...

869
01:26:12,755 --> 01:26:16,465
And kicked up by the wild thrashing
of the crocodiles.

870
01:26:16,509 --> 01:26:18,889
This thrashing not only...

871
01:26:18,928 --> 01:26:22,468
Dramatically changed the color of
the water, but it fouled it...

872
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:24,565
To the point of killing the fish.

873
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,890
But frogs, as we know...

874
01:26:26,936 --> 01:26:30,106
Can get out of the water,
when they have to.

875
01:26:30,147 --> 01:26:31,897
Which they did.

876
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:34,651
But frogs still need water...

877
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:37,454
And when they can't find it
in the streets of our city...

878
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,620
They what?

879
01:26:41,033 --> 01:26:42,243
They die?

880
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:43,625
They die!

881
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:45,787
And then they decompose.

882
01:26:46,455 --> 01:26:49,455
And then the gnats come
and the maggots come and the flies come.

883
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,459
And then...

884
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,471
And then what?

885
01:26:58,801 --> 01:26:59,841
The flies die.

886
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:45,218
Speak up.

887
01:27:45,264 --> 01:27:47,024
It's in Hebrew.

888
01:27:47,517 --> 01:27:49,227
Hebrew?

889
01:27:49,268 --> 01:27:50,518
Read it.

890
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:51,901
"These catastrophes...

891
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:53,896
"Are the work of God...

892
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:56,360
"And they have not finished.
They will get worse.

893
01:27:57,235 --> 01:27:59,195
"We need to reach a settlement...

894
01:27:59,237 --> 01:28:00,817
"For both our sakes."

895
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:05,583
So, the work of God.

896
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:13,129
Here is my settlement to you.

897
01:28:13,501 --> 01:28:15,881
Work quotas shall be doubled...

898
01:28:16,337 --> 01:28:18,507
And you will get no straw...

899
01:28:18,548 --> 01:28:20,298
To make your bricks.

900
01:28:21,217 --> 01:28:22,627
Perhaps your God...

901
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:25,047
Will provide it for you.

902
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:55,754
I was impressed at first.

903
01:28:56,252 --> 01:28:58,212
Not anymore.

904
01:28:59,922 --> 01:29:01,672
This is affecting everyone.

905
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:05,841
So, who are you punishing?

906
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:22,569
What's wrong with him?

907
01:29:26,908 --> 01:29:28,328
It's sick.

908
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:36,956
What is this?

909
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:38,961
- Did you do this?
- Not me.

910
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:40,173
- Is this you?
- No, no!

911
01:29:42,381 --> 01:29:43,551
What's happened to him?

912
01:30:16,249 --> 01:30:19,379
We have made great strides in medicine.

913
01:30:19,418 --> 01:30:22,698
However, there are still a few hidden
diseases that we don't completely understand.

914
01:30:23,756 --> 01:30:25,916
Animals are not exempt...

915
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:28,547
And there is some conjecture...

916
01:30:28,594 --> 01:30:32,894
That these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature.

917
01:30:32,932 --> 01:30:33,932
Like a...

918
01:30:34,934 --> 01:30:36,194
A fly.

919
01:30:44,026 --> 01:30:45,686
Have you been out to the river lately?

920
01:30:45,736 --> 01:30:47,356
I appealed to Kebechet again...

921
01:30:48,072 --> 01:30:50,202
And six more gods.

922
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,730
Is that it?

923
01:32:05,149 --> 01:32:06,729
Are you done?

924
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:13,955
I am.

925
01:32:24,502 --> 01:32:27,592
Are you trying to say something
with your absence?

926
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:32,341
Is it meant to humble me?

927
01:32:32,385 --> 01:32:34,645
Because it will not!

928
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:43,330
Initial reports suggest...

929
01:33:43,372 --> 01:33:46,882
More than 10 million square cubits
of crops have been lost.

930
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,750
The quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion...

931
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:53,046
Of the supplement to the civil granary.

932
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:56,223
An act of mercy.

933
01:33:57,136 --> 01:33:58,636
Your people are starving.

934
01:33:59,764 --> 01:34:02,734
Are you suggesting
that I should starve, too?

935
01:34:03,392 --> 01:34:04,392
No.

936
01:34:06,604 --> 01:34:09,154
People have plenty of water.

937
01:34:10,066 --> 01:34:11,566
They will endure.

938
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:49,980
Aim!

939
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:52,232
Fire!

940
01:34:57,113 --> 01:34:58,113
Aim!

941
01:34:58,656 --> 01:34:59,656
Fire!

942
01:35:53,711 --> 01:35:56,131
Is that you?

943
01:35:57,381 --> 01:35:58,841
Moses?

944
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:02,183
Brother?

945
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:09,521
Have you come to negotiate?

946
01:36:12,396 --> 01:36:13,856
Because I'm ready...

947
01:36:15,024 --> 01:36:17,364
As I have an offer for you.

948
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:21,241
One more thing happens...

949
01:36:22,532 --> 01:36:26,492
And I will bring my own plague to you.

950
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:31,121
You see, every Hebrew child...

951
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:33,035
Not yet walking...

952
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:35,291
They never shall.

953
01:36:36,379 --> 01:36:39,799
Because I will drown them in the Nile.

954
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:43,180
As you should have been.

955
01:36:45,888 --> 01:36:50,178
You say that you didn't cause all this?

956
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:53,901
Your God did?

957
01:36:55,857 --> 01:36:59,187
I am the God! I am the God!

958
01:37:03,656 --> 01:37:07,576
So, let's just see
who's more effective at killing.

959
01:37:08,828 --> 01:37:10,538
You.

960
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:12,332
This God.

961
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:15,924
Or me.

962
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,941
Nice of you to come.

963
01:37:40,109 --> 01:37:42,359
He's given you what you asked?

964
01:37:46,282 --> 01:37:48,992
Not yet. But his own people
are turning against him.

965
01:37:49,035 --> 01:37:51,165
- And his army?
- It will.

966
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:52,914
I disagree.

967
01:37:53,789 --> 01:37:55,579
Something worse has to happen.

968
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:56,925
I disagree.

969
01:37:57,251 --> 01:38:00,501
- Anything more would be...
- Would be what?

970
01:38:00,546 --> 01:38:01,626
What were you about to say?

971
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:04,256
Cruel? Inhumane?

972
01:38:04,592 --> 01:38:07,342
It's not easy to see...

973
01:38:07,386 --> 01:38:10,306
The people who I grew up with
suffering this much.

974
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:12,558
What about the people you
didn't grow up with?

975
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,980
What thought did you give to them?

976
01:38:16,145 --> 01:38:18,725
You still don't think of them
as yours, do you?

977
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:22,163
As long as Ramses
has an army behind him...

978
01:38:22,318 --> 01:38:23,858
Nothing will change.

979
01:38:23,903 --> 01:38:25,613
Anything more is just revenge!

980
01:38:25,655 --> 01:38:28,665
Revenge?
After 400 years of brutal subjugation?

981
01:38:30,493 --> 01:38:35,123
These pharaohs who imagine they're living gods,
they're nothing more than flesh and blood.

982
01:38:35,164 --> 01:38:39,294
I want to see them on their knees,
begging for it to stop!

983
01:38:39,335 --> 01:38:41,835
I'm tired of talking with a messenger!

984
01:38:45,675 --> 01:38:47,095
General!

985
01:38:48,427 --> 01:38:52,137
I have heard Ramses' final threat.

986
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:54,481
So, let me tell you
what's going to happen next.

987
01:38:57,687 --> 01:38:58,937
No. No.

988
01:38:59,438 --> 01:39:01,358
You cannot do this.

989
01:39:01,649 --> 01:39:03,689
I want no part of this!

990
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,760
Stay!

991
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:33,061
- Hold!
- Moses?

992
01:39:36,225 --> 01:39:37,265
Leave him.

993
01:39:44,358 --> 01:39:47,068
- Khyan.
- Moses.

994
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:04,210
I could have you killed.

995
01:40:04,879 --> 01:40:06,759
I don't think so.

996
01:40:08,132 --> 01:40:10,262
Unless you do it yourself.

997
01:40:10,718 --> 01:40:13,298
Your own soldiers let me in.

998
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:19,848
I am not negotiating anymore.

999
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:22,274
That's not why I'm here.

1000
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:27,609
I came to tell you
that something is coming...

1001
01:40:27,944 --> 01:40:30,744
That is out of my control.

1002
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,910
Something that will affect thousands...

1003
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:35,280
And thousands of citizens.

1004
01:40:35,326 --> 01:40:40,156
And it will affect you very personally
unless you accept what I've asked for...

1005
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:43,461
And announce it publicly...

1006
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:47,341
Before the sun goes down.

1007
01:40:49,966 --> 01:40:51,176
Ramses...

1008
01:40:51,217 --> 01:40:54,637
Do not turn your back on me!

1009
01:40:57,223 --> 01:41:01,693
This has nothing to do with you and I.

1010
01:41:02,144 --> 01:41:05,364
This is far beyond that.

1011
01:41:05,648 --> 01:41:08,358
This is about Egypt's survival.
Do you understand?

1012
01:41:14,532 --> 01:41:15,992
Sunset.

1013
01:41:17,493 --> 01:41:19,543
After that, it will be too late.

1014
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:22,119
What will be too late?

1015
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:24,384
You protect your child.

1016
01:41:25,168 --> 01:41:27,498
You protect your child tonight.

1017
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:29,842
My child?

1018
01:41:31,716 --> 01:41:33,256
Is that a threat?

1019
01:41:38,014 --> 01:41:40,854
Is that a threat? Moses!

1020
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:43,101
Moses!

1021
01:41:46,689 --> 01:41:48,109
Tell everyone...

1022
01:41:49,275 --> 01:41:51,365
To slaughter a lamb...

1023
01:41:52,028 --> 01:41:53,528
And mark their doors...

1024
01:41:54,113 --> 01:41:56,203
And their doorposts tonight...

1025
01:41:56,782 --> 01:41:58,032
With its blood.

1026
01:42:00,244 --> 01:42:01,294
Why?

1027
01:42:01,787 --> 01:42:05,037
Pity the lambs if I am wrong.

1028
01:42:07,418 --> 01:42:09,668
If I'm right...

1029
01:42:09,712 --> 01:42:12,592
We will bless them for eternity.

1030
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:34,231
Bennu? Bennu?

1031
01:45:25,408 --> 01:45:27,408
No!

1032
01:45:30,204 --> 01:45:31,414
Ramses?

1033
01:45:32,957 --> 01:45:34,457
Ramses.

1034
01:45:37,628 --> 01:45:39,088
Ramses.

1035
01:45:56,564 --> 01:45:57,944
No!

1036
01:46:03,321 --> 01:46:04,781
Zechariah?

1037
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:12,957
Zechariah?

1038
01:46:52,787 --> 01:46:54,157
Kneel!

1039
01:47:13,182 --> 01:47:14,392
Get out!

1040
01:47:15,351 --> 01:47:16,771
Murderer!

1041
01:47:17,854 --> 01:47:19,444
Child killer!

1042
01:47:30,449 --> 01:47:33,869
Their children died last night.

1043
01:47:35,663 --> 01:47:36,873
As did mine.

1044
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:43,841
Is this your God?

1045
01:47:46,549 --> 01:47:48,879
A killer of children?

1046
01:47:49,635 --> 01:47:53,385
What kind of fanatics
worship such a God?

1047
01:48:00,897 --> 01:48:03,227
No Hebrew child died last night.

1048
01:48:23,753 --> 01:48:24,843
Get...

1049
01:48:25,755 --> 01:48:26,765
Out.

1050
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:29,720
Go.

1051
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,720
Every one of you!

1052
01:48:33,221 --> 01:48:34,261
Go!

1053
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:38,930
Go to Canaan if that's what you want.

1054
01:48:40,186 --> 01:48:42,856
Back to the homeland of your dreams.

1055
01:48:43,773 --> 01:48:45,443
But go!

1056
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:50,860
As you command.

1057
01:49:02,834 --> 01:49:05,504
This is the route I took.

1058
01:49:05,545 --> 01:49:08,385
From here, we go South to the red sea.

1059
01:49:08,422 --> 01:49:11,012
The straits are here.
At low tide, we can cross on foot.

1060
01:50:49,732 --> 01:50:52,692
You know why you sleep so well, my boy?

1061
01:50:54,946 --> 01:50:57,406
Because you know you are loved.

1062
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:51,252
With respect...

1063
01:51:51,294 --> 01:51:54,054
If we're going to
recapture 400,000 slaves...

1064
01:51:54,088 --> 01:51:56,758
We might need more than three divisions.

1065
01:51:57,216 --> 01:51:59,296
We're not recapturing anyone.

1066
01:52:03,055 --> 01:52:04,345
Forward!

1067
01:52:43,179 --> 01:52:44,679
We should rest.

1068
01:52:44,722 --> 01:52:45,972
No.

1069
01:52:46,015 --> 01:52:49,135
We're not safe until we cross the sea.

1070
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:53,360
Moshe!

1071
01:52:57,735 --> 01:52:59,395
Ramses...

1072
01:52:59,445 --> 01:53:00,525
4,000 men...

1073
01:53:00,947 --> 01:53:02,157
A thousand chariots.

1074
01:53:02,198 --> 01:53:03,488
How far behind us?

1075
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:05,330
Four days.

1076
01:53:05,368 --> 01:53:07,288
Less, if they don't rest the horses.

1077
01:53:14,961 --> 01:53:16,091
Ramses!

1078
01:53:16,838 --> 01:53:18,378
Ramses!

1079
01:53:19,048 --> 01:53:20,918
We need to rest the horses...

1080
01:53:20,967 --> 01:53:22,507
And the men!

1081
01:53:34,856 --> 01:53:36,436
The straits are that way.

1082
01:53:36,482 --> 01:53:39,362
The longest, easiest route...

1083
01:53:39,402 --> 01:53:42,032
Is down the Western coast.

1084
01:53:43,573 --> 01:53:47,333
Or we go through the mountains.

1085
01:53:48,911 --> 01:53:50,251
The mountains?

1086
01:53:50,288 --> 01:53:53,868
Why? Why don't we take that route?

1087
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:55,416
We can, but so can Ramses.

1088
01:53:57,295 --> 01:53:59,385
The Mountain passes are dangerous...

1089
01:53:59,422 --> 01:54:02,842
But they are too narrow
for Ramses' chariots.

1090
01:54:02,884 --> 01:54:05,514
He couldn't follow.
That would give us needed time.

1091
01:54:07,138 --> 01:54:08,598
What does God tell you?

1092
01:54:14,812 --> 01:54:16,232
The mountains.

1093
01:54:17,315 --> 01:54:19,575
Can we make it?

1094
01:54:25,615 --> 01:54:27,075
Forward!

1095
01:55:08,157 --> 01:55:09,907
Which way from here?

1096
01:55:13,454 --> 01:55:14,714
Stay here.

1097
01:55:34,976 --> 01:55:37,806
We need your help.

1098
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:47,614
I don't know where I am.

1099
01:56:11,721 --> 01:56:13,721
You won't help me?

1100
01:56:16,267 --> 01:56:18,637
You won't help them.

1101
01:56:23,232 --> 01:56:24,822
This way!

1102
01:56:28,529 --> 01:56:30,409
Move out!

1103
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,880
This way!

1104
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:54,431
Are you sure?

1105
01:56:55,097 --> 01:56:57,217
I'm very sure.

1106
01:56:57,266 --> 01:56:59,886
I mean, are you sure we can make it
across with our equipment...

1107
01:56:59,936 --> 01:57:01,516
Our chariots?

1108
01:57:01,979 --> 01:57:03,579
They didn't think they could
with theirs.

1109
01:57:05,775 --> 01:57:07,325
How would they know?

1110
01:57:08,152 --> 01:57:09,572
They've never been here.

1111
01:57:10,112 --> 01:57:11,162
Moses may have.

1112
01:57:53,364 --> 01:57:55,074
Is this high tide or low tide?

1113
01:57:55,116 --> 01:57:56,696
Doesn't matter.

1114
01:57:58,119 --> 01:57:59,749
This isn't the straits, is it?

1115
01:57:59,787 --> 01:58:00,787
No.

1116
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,423
Do you even know where we are?

1117
01:58:05,668 --> 01:58:07,168
Yes!

1118
01:58:07,211 --> 01:58:10,511
We're at a point on the earth
where there is a sea ahead...

1119
01:58:10,548 --> 01:58:12,298
And an army behind!

1120
01:58:12,341 --> 01:58:14,221
So now what?

1121
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,300
Army or no army...

1122
01:58:15,344 --> 01:58:17,224
We have to rest.

1123
01:58:41,996 --> 01:58:44,116
I have misled all of them.

1124
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:48,753
I have abandoned my family.

1125
01:58:50,254 --> 01:58:51,924
I have failed you.

1126
01:58:57,345 --> 01:59:00,015
I'm not what I thought I was.

1127
02:01:56,107 --> 02:01:57,227
What is it?

1128
02:01:58,734 --> 02:02:00,404
The current.

1129
02:02:03,656 --> 02:02:05,196
It's strong.

1130
02:02:13,541 --> 02:02:14,751
We need to cross here.

1131
02:02:18,421 --> 02:02:20,421
We need to cross now!

1132
02:02:24,385 --> 02:02:26,175
We cross here.

1133
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:27,550
We cross here!

1134
02:02:28,848 --> 02:02:30,468
Ready yourselves!

1135
02:02:30,516 --> 02:02:31,636
We cross here!

1136
02:02:32,226 --> 02:02:34,596
Go tell them! Go!

1137
02:02:34,645 --> 02:02:35,725
Your orders...

1138
02:02:35,771 --> 02:02:38,691
Are like the lash of the Egyptian whip.

1139
02:02:40,276 --> 02:02:42,106
We are no longer slaves.

1140
02:02:42,695 --> 02:02:44,525
And yet, you are not free.

1141
02:02:46,073 --> 02:02:47,073
You have lost sight...

1142
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:48,990
Of Canaan...

1143
02:02:49,869 --> 02:02:51,909
Land of your forebears.

1144
02:02:53,998 --> 02:02:55,578
You have honored me...

1145
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:58,125
With your trust.

1146
02:02:58,961 --> 02:03:02,091
Now I honor you with my faith.

1147
02:03:03,966 --> 02:03:07,006
Follow me and you will be free!

1148
02:03:07,386 --> 02:03:10,096
Stay and you will perish.

1149
02:03:12,642 --> 02:03:14,352
Do not be afraid!

1150
02:03:15,853 --> 02:03:17,563
God is with us!

1151
02:03:17,605 --> 02:03:19,825
Go! Ready yourselves!

1152
02:03:20,691 --> 02:03:21,731
Go!

1153
02:03:21,776 --> 02:03:23,526
God is with us!

1154
02:03:23,569 --> 02:03:27,609
Pass the word! We cross here!

1155
02:03:28,115 --> 02:03:30,235
As quickly as you can,
gather your things...

1156
02:03:30,868 --> 02:03:32,238
And form in groups!

1157
02:03:36,332 --> 02:03:37,832
Quickly!

1158
02:03:45,341 --> 02:03:47,511
Come on!

1159
02:04:36,517 --> 02:04:37,517
Steady!

1160
02:04:43,149 --> 02:04:45,689
To the right, to the right! Tight!

1161
02:05:11,844 --> 02:05:13,804
Keep moving!

1162
02:05:14,805 --> 02:05:16,885
There's nothing to fear!

1163
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:21,940
Don't worry! You'll be safe!

1164
02:05:44,669 --> 02:05:47,629
Keep to the right! Keep to the right!

1165
02:05:51,968 --> 02:05:53,428
Ramses!

1166
02:06:27,336 --> 02:06:28,336
Stop!

1167
02:06:51,277 --> 02:06:54,107
Stop! Stop!

1168
02:07:12,632 --> 02:07:14,092
Go.

1169
02:07:16,594 --> 02:07:17,724
Keep moving!

1170
02:07:18,387 --> 02:07:20,677
Keep moving! Forward!

1171
02:07:50,169 --> 02:07:51,169
There.

1172
02:08:13,192 --> 02:08:14,192
Joshua!

1173
02:08:15,111 --> 02:08:16,201
Aaron!

1174
02:08:31,294 --> 02:08:32,884
Run!

1175
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:34,210
Everyone, run!

1176
02:08:34,589 --> 02:08:35,839
Move!

1177
02:08:35,882 --> 02:08:37,382
Run to shore!

1178
02:09:24,764 --> 02:09:25,764
Moshe.

1179
02:10:28,244 --> 02:10:29,414
Moshe.

1180
02:10:33,749 --> 02:10:34,749
We must leave!

1181
02:10:39,338 --> 02:10:40,338
Ramses!

1182
02:10:40,423 --> 02:10:42,093
Ramses!

1183
02:10:47,388 --> 02:10:48,428
Go!

1184
02:10:48,681 --> 02:10:50,101
Ramses, stop!

1185
02:10:57,815 --> 02:11:01,105
All! Turn around!

1186
02:11:01,152 --> 02:11:03,902
Turn around!

1187
02:11:03,946 --> 02:11:05,856
Khyan!

1188
02:11:12,663 --> 02:11:14,083
Leave.

1189
02:11:14,457 --> 02:11:15,367
Brother...

1190
02:11:15,416 --> 02:11:17,326
Leave now! That's an order!

1191
02:11:42,818 --> 02:11:45,488
Come! You'll never make it back!

1192
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:05,550
Go!

1193
02:12:12,181 --> 02:12:13,891
Faster!

1194
02:14:34,407 --> 02:14:35,777
It's just me here.

1195
02:14:44,167 --> 02:14:45,827
Sit.

1196
02:14:52,091 --> 02:14:54,721
My family...

1197
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:56,300
Is not far from here.

1198
02:14:56,345 --> 02:14:57,345
Your family?

1199
02:14:57,346 --> 02:14:59,846
My other family. My wife, my son.

1200
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:03,270
I was thinking...

1201
02:15:03,311 --> 02:15:05,771
Maybe I could convince them...

1202
02:15:06,522 --> 02:15:09,192
Convince them to join us,
but perhaps that's...

1203
02:15:10,735 --> 02:15:11,945
Perhaps that's not wise.

1204
02:15:11,986 --> 02:15:14,026
Of course they should come.

1205
02:15:14,071 --> 02:15:15,531
We have a long way to go.

1206
02:15:15,948 --> 02:15:17,618
A lot can happen.

1207
02:15:18,117 --> 02:15:19,617
And then...

1208
02:15:20,203 --> 02:15:22,453
We get there, if we get there.

1209
02:15:22,496 --> 02:15:24,376
You don't think they'll
let us settle in Canaan?

1210
02:15:25,166 --> 02:15:27,376
They'll see us as invaders.

1211
02:15:27,919 --> 02:15:31,419
They won't have a choice.
We're as big as any tribe.

1212
02:15:31,464 --> 02:15:34,064
We're as big as a nation of tribes
and that concerns me even more.

1213
02:15:34,425 --> 02:15:35,755
Why?

1214
02:15:36,969 --> 02:15:39,429
This many people?

1215
02:15:39,472 --> 02:15:41,522
You have to ask?

1216
02:15:44,143 --> 02:15:45,943
But we all have the same goal.

1217
02:15:45,978 --> 02:15:47,018
We do now.

1218
02:15:48,272 --> 02:15:50,522
What happens when we stop running?

1219
02:16:15,216 --> 02:16:16,626
Ramses...

1220
02:16:18,177 --> 02:16:20,217
The great.

1221
02:16:29,605 --> 02:16:31,395
Thank you.

1222
02:16:57,049 --> 02:16:58,219
Gershom.

1223
02:17:49,685 --> 02:17:51,935
Did you do what you said?

1224
02:17:52,939 --> 02:17:55,019
What did I say?

1225
02:17:56,234 --> 02:17:59,034
That you would trade your faith...

1226
02:18:00,571 --> 02:18:02,031
To keep me.

1227
02:18:03,032 --> 02:18:04,532
No.

1228
02:18:07,119 --> 02:18:09,199
Good.

1229
02:18:09,247 --> 02:18:12,287
You may need it more than ever now.

1230
02:18:24,929 --> 02:18:27,219
Who are they?

1231
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:31,058
They're my people.

1232
02:18:38,568 --> 02:18:40,898
Who makes you happy?

1233
02:18:43,239 --> 02:18:44,319
You do.

1234
02:18:45,449 --> 02:18:48,659
What is the most important thing
in your life?

1235
02:18:50,329 --> 02:18:51,409
You are.

1236
02:18:51,956 --> 02:18:53,616
You are.

1237
02:18:57,628 --> 02:18:59,418
When will I leave you?

1238
02:19:02,508 --> 02:19:03,758
Never.

1239
02:19:08,264 --> 02:19:10,024
May I proceed?

1240
02:19:12,602 --> 02:19:14,692
Proceed.

1241
02:20:38,521 --> 02:20:40,111
What do you think of this?

1242
02:20:41,691 --> 02:20:43,651
I wouldn't do it...

1243
02:20:43,693 --> 02:20:45,283
If I didn't agree.

1244
02:20:47,196 --> 02:20:48,946
That's true.

1245
02:20:49,615 --> 02:20:51,575
I've noticed that about you.

1246
02:20:52,535 --> 02:20:54,955
You don't always agree with me.

1247
02:20:55,746 --> 02:20:59,036
Nor you me, I've noticed.

1248
02:20:59,542 --> 02:21:02,962
Yet here we are, still speaking.

1249
02:21:03,254 --> 02:21:05,384
But not for much longer.

1250
02:21:09,218 --> 02:21:11,098
A leader can falter...

1251
02:21:11,137 --> 02:21:12,547
But stone...

1252
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:15,431
Will endure.

1253
02:21:16,058 --> 02:21:18,228
These laws will guide them
in your stead.

1254
02:21:21,105 --> 02:21:22,645
If you disagree...

1255
02:21:23,232 --> 02:21:25,612
You should put down the hammer.
