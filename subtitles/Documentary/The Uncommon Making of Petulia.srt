00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,455
Enjoy:)

3
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:06,629
Episode 10

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,499
Do you know?

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,174
My father didn't mention marriage.

6
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:17,757
My grandmother didn't talk
about a marriage date either!

7
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,368
So this can be taken as a success then.

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,577
I think so.

9
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:28,274
At least we don't have to worry
about getting married right away.

10
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,424
We just have to work on
the engagement first.

11
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:32,447
This is enough already.

12
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,292
As time drags on, it will all end, right?

13
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,393
I'm hoping for that too.

14
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:40,204
At least for today, we settled the matter.

15
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:41,224
Let's get back.

16
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:42,963
Wait.

17
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:45,169
This is not over yet.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,741
Let's make a contract.

19
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,142
What? Make a what?

20
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,643
Contract.

21
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:55,076
Whether it's real or fake,
it's best to have a contract written out.

22
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:57,880
As if we don't know you're a lawyer.

23
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,390
Fine, we'll do it.
Make things clear.

24
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:10,252
No matter what happens,
don't be angry with me.

25
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,096
That's not me, you know.

26
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,197
Let's get to it now.

27
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:18,750
Mutual non-interference.

28
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,622
That's a good one.

29
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,064
Second thing, time period.

30
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,384
For how long do we have to meet up?

31
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,795
Until the elders believe us.

32
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,594
So how long does that take?

33
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:34,195
I'm sorry but the contract must
state a specific period, you know.

34
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:37,483
Mmm... How about once a week?

35
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:38,662
That often?

36
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:39,957
If we want to keep the elders in the dark,

37
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,358
that frequency might not even be enough.

38
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,038
Then we can't do without that.

39
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,251
When we meet up,

40
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:49,267
what do we do?

41
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,768
I'm not sure what we will do,

42
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,842
but let's first cancel
shopping from our dates.

43
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,389
How can you do that?

44
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,697
Didn't we agree to do
something we're both happy with?

45
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:00,149
But it has to be at least reasonable.

46
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,661
If I bring you to a
soccer match every day,

47
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:02,784
would you be happy?

48
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:05,985
I like soccer so that's fine with me.

49
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:10,087
Ah! And...

50
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,141
definitely no skin ship*.
(*touching)

51
00:02:12,142 --> 00:02:13,682
Do you have any common sense?

52
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,424
If we're dating but we're
not even holding hands,

53
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,725
you think Grandmother will believe us?

54
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:24,112
So how far are you going to go?

55
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:26,273
It depends on the circumstances.

56
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:29,545
ah... I told you the contract
has to cover details.

57
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:31,897
So you mean when grandfather's around,
we hold hands,

58
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:34,078
when Grandmother's around, we kiss?

59
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,665
Is that how we put it?

60
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,853
Let's do it that way then.

61
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:39,035
Who says to write it like that?

62
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,423
Well..

63
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:43,036
Just say we allow some proper skin ship*.
(*touching)

64
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,934
See if you dare violate that.

65
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,126
That's my line.

66
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,223
I dare you to try me.

67
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:51,991
No matter what,

68
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:56,077
we try our best to avoid behavior
which create suspicion in the elders,

69
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,705
We date according to this contract.

70
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:00,058
All right.

71
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:04,258
And both parties must keep
this contract a secret.

72
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,658
Absolute secret.

73
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,888
Call, absolute secret.

74
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,406
So that's about it.

75
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:16,329
If the contract is violated,
how do we handle the penalty fee?

76
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,027
- Penalty fee?
- Yes.

77
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,254
Otherwise, there won't be a
need to write this contract,

78
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,267
if there's no loss when
the contract is violated.

79
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:26,039
So hand in one piece (of cheque)
each time a mistake is made.

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,327
One piece?

81
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,522
How much is that?

82
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:29,952
100,000 won.

83
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:31,574
So that we won't want to make a mistake.

84
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:34,917
Fine, since I've started
to earn a living now.

85
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,624
The last thing is,

86
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,199
if one of us make a mistake
and is found out by the elders,

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,593
that person has to be fully responsible.

88
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,874
For that, the price has
to be higher, correct?

89
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,646
Then we won't use money as penalty,
use something else.

90
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,045
What?

91
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:49,651
Whoever it is,

92
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:52,452
that person must
get married first no matter how.

93
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:54,326
Fine.

94
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,794
That way the other person
will get to live freely.

95
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,795
Our contract is made then.

96
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,162
Taek Soo, where are we going?

97
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,238
You'll find out when we get there.

98
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,139
Let's go, Father.

99
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,745
Yes, I want to have a look where we go.

100
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:18,632
You guys have been going
everywhere together, haven't you?

101
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,344
This way.

102
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,452
Kyung Tae

103
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,453
Have a look.

104
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,606
- Wow, so spacious.
- You like it?

105
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,143
Father's room...

106
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,172
How is it, Father?

107
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:39,173
You like it?

108
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,606
Of course I like it.

109
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,007
So long as you like it.

110
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,498
It has been some other
people helping to do this up,

111
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,246
so some things may
not be to your liking.

112
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:55,014
But if there's enough time,
I'll make sure every spot is perfect.

113
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,086
Then you can work on any
leftover spots on your own.

114
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:59,364
Ah friends...
No need for all the trouble.

115
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,704
We'll just live in a normal house.

116
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:04,618
So why did you leave your house,
and live in some other house then?

117
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,396
But I still can't trouble you.

118
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:08,208
How is that trouble to me?

119
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,115
Or shall I return the bakery to you?
That was yours originally.

120
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:13,327
No, no, don't say that.

121
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,167
Forget it, don't quarrel anymore.

122
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,121
Since we're not leaving,
it works out just nice.

123
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:23,898
Comparing the price of
the bakery and this house,

124
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,872
we'll call it even.

125
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:30,057
- Yes, yes, Father, you're right.
- I know.

126
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:32,692
Kyung Tae, you!

127
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:37,838
<i>Wow, this place is so clean.</i>

128
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,073
Everything's good.

129
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:45,283
The furniture's coming in today.

130
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:49,927
Wait, is there anything else you need?

131
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:54,255
But I said you don't have to do so much.

132
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:56,713
Aish... This is all out of my own will.

133
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:59,785
Back then when you went to Australia alone,
there was nothing I could help you with.

134
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:02,458
But here now, what is
it I can't help you with?

135
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,986
Am I right?

136
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,348
Thank you.

137
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,349
What is it?

138
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,413
How could you do that?

139
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,878
Didn't we say we're keeping
that house for Yeo Jun?

140
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,869
Who said it was for Yeo Jun?

141
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,230
He should settle it for himself.

142
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,398
When he gets married,
we should at least prepare a house for him.

143
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,514
How can he get married without a house?

144
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:28,591
Easier said than done,

145
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,020
it's enough that we fed
him and housed him so far.

146
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,928
Parents are not slaves who have to get
a house ready for him to get married.

147
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:34,929
- Honey!
- What a shock!

148
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,592
Why must you always shout so loud?

149
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:41,380
Back then when they gave us the
bakery for free, you said nothing.

150
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,275
Now we have to give him something
of ours and your heart's aching?

151
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,698
Even if your heart's not aching,

152
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,944
mine is aching, aching to death.

153
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:49,206
So was I having fun all this time?

154
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,438
Why didn't you think about me
suffering and doing all this work?

155
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,613
How can you make all the decisions
as you like it by yourself?

156
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,366
If you're thinking of doing this,
at least discuss it with me.

157
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,238
Discuss? What do you mean 'discuss'?

158
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,184
I'm just returning the object to its owner.

159
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,858
Man must have conscience!

160
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,859
Really.

161
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,559
Where are you going?
We're not done yet.

162
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,179
Aigoo,

163
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,910
now everything's solved
and settled nicely.

164
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,566
And with Taek Soo's help,
our housing problem's solved too.

165
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,690
I thought it would take us a
few months and I was worried.

166
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,091
That's true.

167
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:34,867
How is it?

168
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:36,922
With sufficient sunlight,

169
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,796
this environment is not bad, right?

170
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:41,061
Yes, I'm so happy with this.

171
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,962
I'd wanted to live in an
apartment, this is great.

172
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:49,099
We had so much space in Australia,

173
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
I never thought about living
in an apartment or something.

174
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,379
- Sang Eun
- What?

175
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,478
Have you brought your luggage back?

176
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,730
Yes, you can't keep living
there by yourself,

177
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,538
your family's all here,
why must you owe them a favor?

178
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,296
No, you must thank them profusely.

179
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:10,965
No, I have to be there with you.

180
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,321
For this house too,

181
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:15,378
I have yet to say proper thanks to
Grandmother and sister-in-law too.

182
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,714
That's true.

183
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,723
According to etiquette,
we can't let Sang Eun go by herself.

184
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:21,567
Sure.

185
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,758
But Father, aren't you coming along?

186
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,459
Oh well, I think I won't go along.

187
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,758
I don't want to get into any
quarrel with that old woman.

188
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:41,035
Brother-in-law's really too much.

189
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,219
The apartment is not just any object,

190
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,315
an outsider is still an outsider,

191
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,533
he didn't give it to me
when I'm the one living here,

192
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:48,418
yet he gave it to Kyung Tae.

193
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,693
Every day he calls him his real brother.

194
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:55,598
Hey, how does this involve you?

195
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,558
Noona, you mustn't
treat me like this too.

196
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,559
It's because you treat me so casually
that's why hyung-nim ignores me too.

197
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,969
<i>I'm so upset, Hyung-nim.</i>

198
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>- Why is he acting up too?
- Ah?</i>

199
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,587
Hey... This is all your fault.

200
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,381
Why must you blow up the matter?

201
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:22,834
Who says the matter is blown up?
You're the one who started it,

202
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,403
I definitely won't let
go of the apartment.

203
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:30,182
- I spent so much effort on it.
- You're really.

204
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:31,983
We're here.

205
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,883
- Oh, you're here.
- Yes, we've come.

206
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,023
Is something wrong?

207
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,880
No, nothing's wrong.

208
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,139
- Sit down.
- All right, sit down.

209
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,321
How is it going? Have you
finished cleaning up the house?

210
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:46,782
- Are settled in already?
- It will take some time.

211
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,912
Some of our stuff's being
shipped here still.

212
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:53,113
All thanks to you.

213
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:58,119
The apartment is really clean and
the environment's very good too.

214
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,985
Of course.
I spent so much time before I found it.

215
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,786
As long as you're happy with it.

216
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,144
Sister-in-law,

217
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,345
I'm not sure if it's all right for
us to just move out like this?

218
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:16,583
That's why, Kyung Tae,

219
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,388
that apartment...

220
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,614
Hey, that apartment,

221
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,951
it was my wife's idea to put you up there.

222
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,199
Since the last time you came,

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,460
she said she wanted you
to live at that apartment.

224
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,178
When did I...?

225
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:34,835
I see.

226
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,879
Sister-in-law, we are so grateful to you.

227
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,739
All this while, you've had to take care
of Sang Eun, we're already so thankful,

228
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,240
now the whole family owes you a favor.

229
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:47,645
I will never forget your favor.

230
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,937
We will surely repay you in future.

231
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,558
Well, let it be then.

232
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,500
What favor, you fella?

233
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:58,991
If what you say goes,

234
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:04,018
if I had to repay the favor I owe you,
I'll have to piggyback you every day.

235
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:05,837
Don't say that.

236
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,045
Mother,

237
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,538
Sang Eun's leaving now.

238
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,233
Grandmother, I'm leaving.

239
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,834
Let me bow to you.

240
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,372
Aigoo, Sang Eun, Sang Eun!

241
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,500
Bowing twice means...

242
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,605
When I came, I bowed once,

243
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,006
I'm leaving now, I have to
bow at least twice, right?

244
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,168
Really.

245
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,509
Grandmother, thank you for everything.

246
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,676
Don't be sick anymore.

247
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:49,202
Like what Yeo Jun said,
you mustn't get angry again.

248
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:52,771
You girl, when did I ever get angry?

249
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,942
Grandmother,

250
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,443
thank you.

251
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:56,297
- Aigoo
- Aigoo!

252
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,458
Aigoo... Hey!

253
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,742
I'll be back to see you.

254
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,243
You girl, you're always hugging.

255
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:16,179
And what do you think you're doing?

256
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,863
Don't you like everything your way?

257
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:23,164
So you lay your own bed out,
the way you like it.

258
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:25,651
Hah! Hah!

259
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,625
You think I'm scared of you?

260
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:30,906
Really.

261
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,477
Wife, water.

262
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,978
Water.

263
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:08,218
This woman is so stubborn.

264
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,981
You don't need to get
for Sang Eun now, right?

265
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,646
It's not easy to forget about her.

266
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,588
She's the only one missing,

267
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,523
but why is there so much rice left?

268
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:27,206
The house feels so empty,
like something's missing.

269
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:32,901
Don't you know how important a person is?
How can it be so easy to forget as you like?

270
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:35,902
That's right.
The house is very quiet.

271
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:37,833
That's right.

272
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,816
Kyung Tae must have
been so lonely out there.

273
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,164
He has no wife,

274
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:44,262
and Sang Eun's overseas too.

275
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,700
He only has his friend, right?

276
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,378
The more you think about Kyung Tae,

277
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,542
it makes up for what you owe him, right?

278
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,270
Not completely.

279
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:56,544
If the children get married,

280
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,745
that will be better.

281
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:01,346
Mother, eat more.

282
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,301
Yeo Jun,

283
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,209
I hear you two are dating,

284
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,902
but why haven't I seen you two together?

285
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:10,885
Ah... Well...

286
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:13,952
Well, that's because the
children are very busy.

287
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,453
What else can they be busy with?

288
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,540
Yeo Jun,

289
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,753
are you two really dating?

290
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,954
Why is it so quiet?

291
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,091
We said we'll meet tomorrow.

292
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,959
For our first date,

293
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,602
let's negotiate it together.

294
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:18,956
Negotiate?

295
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:20,457
Fine with me.

296
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:22,952
So have you thought of a place to go?

297
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,262
I don't know.

298
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,663
I haven't been to many places in Korea.

299
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,803
Don't you have any suggestions?

300
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,327
I don't know.

301
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,328
Just spend the day together causally.

302
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:37,338
Casually?

303
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:41,994
Yeo Jun,

304
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,295
you've never dated before, have you?

305
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,148
And you have lots of experience?

306
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,222
At least more than you.

307
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,795
Having lots of experience
is such an honorable thing.

308
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,023
So what do you want to do?

309
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,585
I don't know what
there's to do in Korea.

310
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,786
If this was Australia,
I'll know where to go.

311
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,698
Date?

312
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:21,715
With a girl?

313
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,303
Yes.

314
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:24,504
With a girl.

315
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,403
What do you suggest we do?

316
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,604
Sleep together.

317
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,705
What?

318
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:31,931
I said to sleep together.

319
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,607
To get to know each other really well,
that's the best way.

320
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,023
<i>Just sleep together.</i>

321
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:37,499
Hang up.

322
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:38,900
You jerk.

323
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:42,231
Why do you hang up like that?
Is he your friend?

324
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,032
I have my reason for doing so.

325
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,474
What did he say?

326
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,151
Nothing.

327
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:49,652
You don't have to know.

328
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:55,602
Sleep with him.

329
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:56,603
What?

330
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:00,529
<i>You guys are dating with
marriage in view, right?</i>

331
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,049
Then that's the most direct way.

332
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,977
Hey, Han Hyo Eun,

333
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:06,142
all this while, have you been
meeting your friends like this?

334
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,841
Of course not.

335
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:10,042
It's not like I'm getting married.

336
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,727
Looks like around me,
no one can help at all.

337
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,328
Around me too, no one can help.

338
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,929
What shall we do?

339
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,676
You finally chose this.

340
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:50,877
But I have absolutely no
interest in this at all.

341
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,864
This has to do with brain surgery,

342
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,816
I have to attend this.

343
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,707
Even so, what is this?
We're on a date, right?

344
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:02,608
I told you to just
listen for a bit, right?

345
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,912
Ah! Pretend like you don't know me.

346
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:09,413
If folks from the hospital sees us,
it won't be good for me.

347
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,688
If that's the case then you
shouldn't have brought me here.

348
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,802
You and I don't have a common time slot.

349
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,388
At least we're together.

350
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,744
Otherwise, how are we going to
answer to grandfather and grandmother?

351
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,296
I can't understand a single thing here.

352
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,157
Shh...

353
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,568
Who is that woman?

354
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,469
How am I supposed to know?

355
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,170
He's two-timing, I'm sure he is.

356
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,501
I can't stand this woman.

357
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,773
Hello.

358
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,874
What do you want?

359
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,941
Isn't it enough you look for me every day?
Now, you want me to come to you?

360
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,530
Let's eat.
You like it here, don't you?

361
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,282
Forget it.
I'm not in the mood to eat with you.

362
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,214
Your father came to see me.

363
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,706
What?

364
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,779
You... don't tell me...

365
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,720
It wasn't me,

366
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,521
he came to me himself.

367
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,622
I heard you almost died.

368
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,261
It has nothing to do with you.

369
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:06,862
Everything about you, has to do with me.

370
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,420
You decide.

371
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,445
What?

372
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:17,944
You want your father
to kneel to me again?

373
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:19,245
What?

374
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,546
You...

375
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:26,283
Jerk.

376
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:28,828
You threatened my father again?

377
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,549
You threw money at him again?

378
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,287
Money?

379
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:35,288
What are you saying?

380
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,701
What kind of a man do you take me for?

381
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,375
And you said 'again',

382
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:44,024
what do you mean by that?

383
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,077
If you didn't, forget it.

384
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,078
Postpone this meal some other time.

385
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:50,679
I'm not done talking yet.

386
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:57,812
I can make you shop close down tomorrow,

387
00:20:57,813 --> 00:21:00,667
and I can put a stop to your
brother's job at the hospital too.

388
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:04,365
In order to get my daughter back,
I'll do anything.

389
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:08,066
There's so much I want
to do for my daughter.

390
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,467
You decide.

391
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,613
Oh, what has this kid
been eating every day?

392
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:36,214
The fridge's all empty, really.

393
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:13,830
What's up? Something happened?

394
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,491
You're here. You want a drink?

395
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:17,915
Did that man come again?

396
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,700
No.

397
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,885
Then tell me what happened.

398
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:24,810
You can't solve it by thinking all alone.

399
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,039
Tell me so I will know.

400
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
How can I help you, Noona?

401
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:34,441
How can you help?
Even I don't know what to do.

402
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:39,240
No matter what I hear, it's all right.

403
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:41,723
But I don't want my father, mother

404
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:47,535
and Jin Ju to hear others say awful things.

405
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:51,768
He keeps pushing me to the edge.

406
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,871
Ah... I don't know what is to do anymore.

407
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:56,969
It's all right,

408
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,536
don't worry, it will all work out.

409
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,664
What are you doing?

410
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:05,065
What are you doing here at this hour?

411
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,987
- Madam Shim, what's wrong with you?
- Who is Madam Shim?

412
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:11,006
Yun Hee, you might not like what you hear,

413
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:14,179
Kyu Han may be Yeo Jun's
friend but he's still a man.

414
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,295
It's terrible that a man
frequents your shop every day.

415
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:19,404
People will think badly of you,
it's bad for Jin Ju too.

416
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:21,745
I hear Jin Ju's dad comes here often, right?

417
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,675
Mom!

418
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:27,901
I know what you're worried about,
it's nothing like that.

419
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:30,503
Is it? That's good.

420
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:35,562
I don't want to hear unnecessary rumors,
destroying my son's reputation.

421
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,928
It's enough for people
to talk behind my back.

422
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:42,629
Yun Hee, you know very well,
how scary other people's mouths can be.

423
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,764
Yes.

424
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:48,002
Mom, what's wrong with you?
Let's talk outside.

425
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:50,266
- I'm sorry, Noona.
- You go out,

426
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,430
I want to talk to Yun Hee some more.

427
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:59,264
You know, you have Jin Ju
so you should work harder.

428
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,359
Ridiculous!

429
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,359
What did you say?

430
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,429
What's wrong with my daughter's behavior?
Mind your own business.

431
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,249
You have your own children too, is this
the way to talk to other people's children?

432
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,907
You scratch their wounds and
then you even scatter salt on it?

433
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:20,296
Why do you think only about your daughter?
What about my son?

434
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:26,004
If we switch places, a single mom
loiters around your son Yeo Jun,

435
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,638
would you be happy?

436
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:30,162
What? What did you say?

437
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:31,470
Mom.

438
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,671
- Mom, let's go out. We'll talk outside.
- Let me go.

439
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,042
- This is ridiculous.
- Really sorry.

440
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:40,144
Oh, this woman is really...

441
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,128
How could I have taken this
kind of person as my friend?

442
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,846
And you, why aren't you arguing back?

443
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:51,222
Have you done any wrong?
What can others say about you?

444
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,964
Why did you have to fall
in love with that fella?

445
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:56,565
Why must it be him?

446
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:03,175
Mom, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

447
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,176
I'm sorry

448
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,936
Why did you do that?

449
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,729
That's what I wanted to say to you.

450
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:24,891
If you keep hanging around here,
I'll get really angry.

451
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:26,456
You want some cakes,

452
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,826
go get it elsewhere,
this is not the only shop around.

453
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,589
Why must it be Yun Hee's shop?

454
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,542
- Mom!
- Don't call me.

455
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:36,826
Promise me you'll never come here again.

456
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,252
I can't promise you that.

457
00:25:39,253 --> 00:25:41,067
Why not?

458
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:44,995
Have you really fallen for her?

459
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:47,225
Why did you do that?

460
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,985
Even if you didn't do that,
she's already having such a hard time.

461
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:52,500
Why must you add to her pain?

462
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,974
You are siding with Yun Hee now, are you?

463
00:25:55,975 --> 00:26:00,318
I'm not siding her, it's a fact.

464
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,594
Someone who runs around
trying to hang onto her child.

465
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,595
You remarried 3 times because of me too.

466
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:08,026
Why can't you empathize with her?

467
00:26:08,027 --> 00:26:12,222
I can empathize but not my son.

468
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:13,623
Why?

469
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,324
What?

470
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,721
What do you mean by that?

471
00:26:18,722 --> 00:26:20,525
What do you mean by that?

472
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:22,398
Nothing.

473
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,199
Nothing?

474
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,086
Are you... and Yun Hee...

475
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,916
Mom, your son isn't such a great man.

476
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:34,347
And Yun Hee noona has
no such feelings for me.

477
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:36,728
So stop getting ahead of yourself.

478
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,429
I have to go, I have a photo shoot.

479
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:05,520
Honey, he couldn't have
fallen for Yun Hee, can he?

480
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:11,218
He didn't say he's marrying Yun Hee,
why get worried so soon?

481
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,730
I'm afraid if this goes on,
they have feelings.

482
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:18,341
Worse than a life or death love,
having feelings is even scarier.

483
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:20,747
That's true,

484
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:25,526
but Kyu Han is not
one to marry someone with a child.

485
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:29,525
Your son hates that, doesn't he?

486
00:27:29,526 --> 00:27:31,619
Is that right?

487
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,767
That should be the case, right?

488
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:36,212
Also, you said the kid's
father is back, right?

489
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,999
So of course she will
marry the kid's father,

490
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,695
why would she marry Kyu Han?

491
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,013
Isn't it?

492
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:46,252
Of course if she marries, she will marry
the kid's father since they have Jin Ju.

493
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,643
And he's not just anyone, he's from a
chaebol* family. (*conglomerate)

494
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:53,298
For the sake of the kid,
of course she should marry that man.

495
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,696
A chaebol family? Then there's
nothing to worry about

496
00:27:57,697 --> 00:28:00,232
Would such a man allow
his kid to be taken away?

497
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:03,533
Who? Who is from a chaebol?

498
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,034
Oh well, nothing.

499
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,337
You might not have understood it,

500
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:16,102
but you could even
sleep at such a place.

501
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:21,916
You try listening to that for 2 hours,
see if you will fall asleep.

502
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,871
Ah, That's...

503
00:28:23,872 --> 00:28:27,373
but I won't drool.

504
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,798
Who drooled?

505
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:32,499
Shall we do a DNA test?

506
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,095
You wait here. I'll say hello
to the professor then come back.

507
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,916
No need for me to go?

508
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:45,417
You want rumors? Then come with me.

509
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,796
Se Won!

510
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:05,213
No, Manager Kang.

511
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:09,434
Just call me Se Won, why be a stranger?

512
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:10,531
What are you doing here?

513
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,732
That's what I want to ask.

514
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,771
I had a meeting.

515
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:18,913
It's not easy to meet up like this.

516
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:22,614
Ever since the airport,
we're fated to be together.

517
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:26,626
If you're done,
how about dinner with me?

518
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:28,627
Oh! Well...

519
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,388
Shall I?

520
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:34,790
Sorry, we have an appointment.

521
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,991
Why didn't you tell him about me?

522
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,559
Tell about what?

523
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,983
We have a deal between us.

524
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:48,156
By a deal, do you mean an engagement?

525
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:49,966
It's the first time I'm
hearing that Sang Eun's engaged.

526
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:52,472
It was since long ago,

527
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:55,273
we can't go through all the details.

528
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,433
We almost forgot about it too.

529
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,834
Yeo Jun!

530
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:03,327
I'm just stating the facts, am I not?

531
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:05,731
Not engagement!

532
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:08,719
Yes, then we're betrothed.

533
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,052
But there's no difference
between the two.

534
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:14,371
No matter what,

535
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:16,464
you're not married, right?

536
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:17,865
Of course.

537
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,321
That's fine then.

538
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,004
Ah! Sang Eun,

539
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:24,366
do you still remember
that Shakespeare dialogue?

540
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:29,845
Oh! A person who knows true love, falls in
love with someone in one sight. That?

541
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,921
You still remember.

542
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:37,114
When I was 11 years old,
I fell in love with you.

543
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,500
You're putting me in a spot now,

544
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:44,701
but we were betrothed when we were born.

545
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,002
Let's go.

546
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,803
Se Won, see you back at the school.

547
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,033
<i>You made a violation.</i>

548
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,332
<i>Why?</i>

549
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,809
<i>Contract Term no. 4.</i>

550
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,381
<i>We won't behave in a manner that
elders will be suspicious of.</i>

551
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:06,259
<i>What has that got to do with my job?</i>

552
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,234
<i>Your first love is so proactive,</i>

553
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:10,543
<i>how will the elders not be suspicious?</i>

554
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:12,732
There's nothing between us.

555
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:15,173
It's best there's nothing.

556
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,112
I don't care how much you like that man,

557
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:19,938
for the sake of our future,
you just have to put up with it.

558
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:22,143
Otherwise you can marry
him straight off too.

559
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:24,598
Forget it.

560
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,872
How about dinner?

561
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:26,810
Forget it.

562
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:29,575
Our relationship is not good enough
for us to want to eat together.

563
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:31,576
I'm so thankful for that.

564
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,854
Yes, this is Kim Yeo Jun.

565
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:43,433
Yes, attorney.

566
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,094
Yes, I understand.

567
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,795
Thank you.

568
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,194
Frustrating.

569
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:03,695
Is this about Yun Hee unni?

570
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:09,333
Is it a tough fight?

571
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:12,334
The other party is far too strong.

572
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:17,924
As her brother,
there's nothing I can help her with.

573
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:23,145
If I knew this would happen,

574
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:25,646
I wouldn't have studied medicine,
I should have studied law.

575
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,747
Sang Eun!

576
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:47,293
Oh! Dad.

577
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:50,098
- The two of them look nice together.
- Yes

578
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,704
- Dad.
- Have you eaten?

579
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:53,110
Not yet.

580
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:55,915
You still haven't eaten at this hour?

581
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,007
Hello.

582
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,626
Hey, are you penniless
or was it intentional?

583
00:33:01,627 --> 00:33:03,578
We ate a late lunch, Grandfather.

584
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:06,481
What?
You didn't eat on time for lunch too?

585
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,065
Treating my granddaughter
like this is too much.

586
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,196
You really.
You must eat your meals on time.

587
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,140
You should have asked me for money.

588
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:16,763
No, I was afraid she'll be too late
getting home and the family would worry.

589
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:21,044
Don't worry.
What's wrong with eating a little later?

590
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:23,313
Yeo Jun, come on in.
Let's eat.

591
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,123
We'll go in too.

592
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:31,014
Really, he should take
good care of Sang Eun.

593
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:33,816
Yeo Jun,

594
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:37,617
I'm not happy with you.

595
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:46,618
Oh hello, brother-in-law.

596
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:48,719
Brother-in-law?

597
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,620
She still hasn't sorted out her Korean yet.

598
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:53,662
Hey, how can you call
him brother-in-law?

599
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:55,263
Why not?

600
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:57,559
Why can't she call him that?

601
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,964
You're dating, right?
You may not yet be now,

602
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:02,510
but very soon,
you'll be brother-in-law.

603
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,102
Here, here, here.

604
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:06,403
Sit down. Wait a bit for the rice

605
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:12,870
First, have some tea.

606
00:34:12,871 --> 00:34:14,508
How did it go today?

607
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:16,817
Did you have fun?

608
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,254
Just normal stuff.

609
00:34:19,255 --> 00:34:22,048
Your answer is rather stifled.

610
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:24,769
Ah! Brother-in-law,
what are you doing this weekend?

611
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,393
Nothing special.

612
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:29,375
Then let's do a Seoul tour.
Bring me along on your date, all right?

613
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,481
Han Hyo Eun!

614
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,075
Yes. Yes, Yeo Jun!

615
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:34,209
Hey, keep yourself free.

616
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,470
Show Sang Eun and
Hyo Eun around in Seoul.

617
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:39,717
What?

618
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:41,624
Ah! Okay.

619
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,877
No,

620
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:44,818
Hyo Eun can just go with me.

621
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,500
That way, Hyo Eun will
be more comfortable.

622
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,717
No,

623
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,342
I think I'd be more comfortable
if I go with brother-in-law.

624
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:52,343
Unni, you have no car.

625
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:59,349
Why are you so thick-skinned?

626
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,546
I'm not thick-skinned, I'm just honest.

627
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:04,616
of course it's more
convenient to go by car.

628
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:09,111
Unni, what did you do today?

629
00:35:09,212 --> 00:35:11,625
- I did what you said.
- What I said?

630
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,967
What did I say?

631
00:35:13,968 --> 00:35:17,768
Ah! So you two really slept together?

632
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,266
Hey!

633
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:23,596
What?

634
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:26,521
I almost took that for real.

635
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:29,597
But Unni, are you two really dating?

636
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:32,008
Certainly.

637
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,850
Then why aren't you calling him?

638
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:34,751
Call whom?

639
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:36,373
Yeo Jun oppa.

640
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:39,667
To ask if he got home safely.

641
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:43,291
From our place to his is not that far,
it's too troublesome to call.

642
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:44,785
Of course he'll be home safely.

643
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:46,886
You sure you're dating?

644
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:54,949
Yes, Se Won.

645
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,347
Tomorrow?

646
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,636
I'm not free tomorrow morning,

647
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:01,507
I have something on.

648
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,418
Sorry.

649
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,719
Unni,

650
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,519
let me give you an advice.

651
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,098
If you really want to
hide it from everyone,

652
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,156
you need a cellphone.

653
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:15,757
<i>You can't even call each other,
how can that be dating?</i>

654
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,609
I got mine already.

655
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,162
The newest model.

656
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,648
Your brain sure works fast
for such stuff, Hyo Eun.

657
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:37,102
Yeo Jun,

658
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:37,915
Yes?

659
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:41,231
You must be treat your noona well.

660
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,443
Not because you're the eldest son,

661
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:47,103
but because we're family.

662
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,404
I know.

663
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:55,953
<i>I just met with father,</i>

664
00:36:55,954 --> 00:36:59,854
<i>what exactly are your plans?</i>

665
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:01,681
Hyung, I really can't accept
you behaving like this.

666
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:02,945
Collaborating with Seoul Electronics...

667
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,946
The walls have ears, watch what you say.

668
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,711
Who is that man?

669
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:38,612
What is it you want?

670
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:42,951
<i>I have no way out.</i>

671
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:44,693
<i>You won.</i>

672
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:47,694
Other than Jin Ju,
you can have whatever you want.

673
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:50,188
So stop bothering my
family members from now on.

674
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:54,989
That grandfather is
part of your family too?

675
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,354
Sang Eun's grandfather?

676
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:59,358
Whoever he is.

677
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
Of course he's family.

678
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:05,340
I'm not family,

679
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:07,389
yet that grandfather who's not even
blood-related,

680
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,675
he's family to you?

681
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:12,147
He's different from you.

682
00:38:12,148 --> 00:38:15,007
Just tell me, what is it you want?

683
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:19,839
I told you the other time,

684
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,910
I want you to tell Jin
Ju about my existence.

685
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:30,625
Fine.

686
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:33,693
That is all.

687
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:35,983
You have no demands to make of me?

688
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:37,285
Of course I do.

689
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:39,675
Stop coming to bother me and Jin Ju,

690
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:42,962
but you just wouldn't agree to it.

691
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:51,115
Let's start over again, Yun Hee.

692
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:53,843
<i>I'm sorry but I cannot accept that item.</i>

693
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:58,465
Ah! If you can give up everything
including your family and come back to me,

694
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,411
I will give it some thought,

695
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:03,512
but I don't think you
will agree to that, right?

696
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:08,818
After Jin Ju is done with her ballet class,
come to the shop.

697
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:11,819
You should know very well
what time that is, right?

698
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:34,953
Thank you but I have to reject it.

699
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:38,406
My blablah is never going
to withstand this thing.

700
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:40,813
Blablah?

701
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,914
Jin Ju's favorite teddy bear.

702
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,403
Jin Ju,

703
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:47,638
I told you before,

704
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,770
where is Jin Ju's dad now?

705
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:51,371
America.

706
00:39:56,353 --> 00:40:00,291
I thought you told her I was dead.

707
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,589
I told you,

708
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,492
I never lie to a kid.

709
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:07,806
What did you tell her
I went to America for?

710
00:40:07,807 --> 00:40:10,387
Why? You're worried now?

711
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:13,902
Then you ask her yourself.

712
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,451
<i>Jin Ju,</i>

713
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:18,531
why did your dad go to America?

714
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:22,908
Mom and I are not his family,
he has another family there.

715
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:26,643
He's living with that family there.

716
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:27,996
That's right,

717
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:32,497
but your dad's here to see you now.

718
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,422
This ahjussi is my father?

719
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:44,223
Yes.

720
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,636
I see.

721
00:40:46,637 --> 00:40:49,314
<i>Hello.</i>

722
00:40:49,315 --> 00:40:51,565
Yes, hello.

723
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:56,142
So from now on, we will live together?

724
00:40:58,043 --> 00:41:00,248
- Well...
- That will not happen.

725
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,714
I told you,

726
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:03,229
Jin Ju, you will live with me,

727
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,090
your dad will live with his family.

728
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:10,140
<i>Then Mom, can I go over
to Kyu Han ahjussi now?</i>

729
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:12,141
Yes, go ahead.

730
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:17,490
Dad, goodbye.

731
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:22,097
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

732
00:41:22,098 --> 00:41:24,817
This is all you can do
for your duty as a father.

733
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,777
Ah! Jin Ju is a girl,

734
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:31,398
she doesn't quite like
blue, nor huge dolls.

735
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,737
Grandma, I saw my dad today,

736
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:45,084
he came back from America.

737
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:49,506
Jin Ju, go get grandpa
some juice, all right?

738
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,417
Grandpa!

739
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:56,510
What does she mean by 'dad'?

740
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:00,624
Today, I arranged for
the two of them to meet.

741
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,282
Why did you go to that fella?

742
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,397
What are you planning to do?

743
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,611
No matter how, he's Jin Ju's dad.

744
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:09,054
Yeo Jun found out from the lawyer,

745
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:13,951
no matter how unwilling we are,
we can't take away his right to see Jin Ju.

746
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:16,799
How is Jin Jun? Is she shocked?

747
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,428
Better than I expected, I guess.

748
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:21,379
Maybe she's used to not living with her dad.

749
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,085
Aigoo! Who knows how she thinks?

750
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,114
Father,

751
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:32,681
stop lowering
yourself in front of that man.

752
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:34,682
For the sake of my own child,
can't I do that?

753
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:38,323
Even so, I don't like you doing that.

754
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:42,909
Whether it's for me or for Jin Ju,
don't do that again.

755
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,864
It's nothing big,

756
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:49,165
as long as you can be happy,
what is it I won't do?

757
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:14,080
I'm sure I saw that man before,

758
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,081
where was it?

759
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:25,382
<i>And he's not just anyone,
he's from a chaebol family.</i>

760
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:28,583
That's right.

761
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:38,984
<i>The number you dialed is engaged,
please call again later.</i>

762
00:43:43,177 --> 00:43:45,509
Got it, I think it'll take 20 minutes.

763
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,977
Remember to call Doctor Lee.

764
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:53,422
Sorry for doing that to you.

765
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,499
Why be sorry for an
emergency situation like this?

766
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,254
Yes but luckily you didn't
have any other appointment.

767
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:03,155
Ah! Lend me your cell phone.

768
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:12,669
Noona, help me get in
touch with Sang Eun.

769
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,110
Ask her to call me.

770
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:19,717
I arranged to meet her this afternoon
but I think I'm going to be late.

771
00:44:19,718 --> 00:44:22,968
Hyo Eun has a cell phone?

772
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,869
That's better than someone else we know.

773
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:31,870
We'll talk later.

774
00:44:32,857 --> 00:44:36,871
Sang Eun?
That was Sang Eun the other time, right?

775
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:43,152
Something's fishy.

776
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:44,878
Oh, Hye Rim!

777
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:48,052
You said Yeo Jun oppa
came to work, where is he?

778
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,695
I have something important to tell him.

779
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:52,115
He'll be right out,
do you want to wait at the lounge?

780
00:44:52,116 --> 00:44:53,189
Lounge?

781
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,500
Can I get you something?

782
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:58,964
Hye Rim, if you're interested
in Dr. Kim Yeo Jun,

783
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:00,588
I'd advise you to drop the idea.

784
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:02,956
He's dating his betrothed now,

785
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:04,492
they have a date today too.

786
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,637
Date?

787
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:06,842
That's right.

788
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:08,788
Why would he push aside Hye Rim
and go for the overseas-returnee?

789
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,589
That's not the right thing to do!

790
00:45:13,063 --> 00:45:16,668
Have you always liked to talk
about others behind their backs?

791
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:17,651
What?

792
00:45:17,652 --> 00:45:21,584
Yeo Jun oppa takes you as his
junior so he looks after you,

793
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,594
you shouldn't be doing this.

794
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,612
Ah... Well...

795
00:45:24,613 --> 00:45:26,606
Anyhow, I'm disappointed in you.

796
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:28,696
But...

797
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:29,729
I'm not...

798
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:50,500
Where are you?

799
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:52,192
<i>You're looking for Yeo Jun oppa?</i>

800
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:55,230
<i>Oh dear, oppa's busy at the moment.</i>

801
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:57,009
I already told you the other time,

802
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,310
you're not supposed to pester oppa.

803
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:01,524
What?

804
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,759
When he comes back,
I'll let him know you called.

805
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,760
But I'm not sure
if we'll have the time for that.

806
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:10,961
Oppa.

807
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,627
What? He's so busy at the hospital,

808
00:46:15,628 --> 00:46:17,258
yet he has time to be with a girl.

809
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:18,473
Who is that girl?

810
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:20,462
There's a girl who is rather nasty.

811
00:46:20,463 --> 00:46:22,463
Is she prettier than you, Unni?

812
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:25,493
So, brother-on-law's not coming?

813
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,236
He's not coming.

814
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:31,237
Oh yes, stop calling him brother-in-law,
puts me in a bad mood.

815
00:46:37,246 --> 00:46:38,238
Hello?

816
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,492
That man with Yun Hee unni is
from Sung Hyun Group, correct?

817
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:44,690
How did you know that?

818
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:47,178
I'm a model for that department store,

819
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:52,742
so I recognize most
people from that company.

820
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:57,012
I've been pondering
whether to tell you or not,

821
00:46:57,013 --> 00:47:00,026
I still think you
have the right to know.

822
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,787
What is it?

823
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:05,289
It's about Sang Eun.

824
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,206
I think Sang Eun made a blunder.

825
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,858
maybe it wasn't intentional.

826
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:12,980
What?

827
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:17,773
Jin Ju...
How did they find out about her?

828
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:21,758
Oppa, you know Sang Eun is
seeing other men too, right?

829
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:32,879
Sang Eun.

830
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,086
Oh! You're here.

831
00:47:35,087 --> 00:47:36,471
She's your younger sister?

832
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:37,698
I'm Kang Se Won.

833
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:39,094
Ah... Yes,

834
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:41,350
Hello.

835
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,850
But how did you know Hyo Eun's number?

836
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:45,477
I haven't memorized it yet myself.

837
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:47,407
I called back and someone
gave me her number.

838
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,576
It was written on your memo notebook.

839
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:50,877
Ah!

840
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:55,682
Unni, we did the right
thing coming to Seoul.

841
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:56,696
Why?

842
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,855
If we were in Australia,

843
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:01,730
how could you have so many men?

844
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:03,179
Se Won...

845
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,455
Se Won is only my boss, that's all.

846
00:48:06,456 --> 00:48:11,090
Ah... You're the same whether
you're there or here.

847
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,031
Who is it?

848
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:17,068
Who else will call you
now except Yeo Jun oppa?

849
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:19,369
Forget it, the bus has
left the stop already.

850
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:30,717
This has no syrup.

851
00:48:30,718 --> 00:48:33,061
- Thanks.
- Cappuccino for Hyo Eun.

852
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:35,494
How did you know my unni likes it black?

853
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,795
That's right, how did I know that?

854
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:48,760
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

855
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,855
<i>Se Won oppa, thanks for today.</i>

856
00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:10,443
Why say that? Remember to
call me any time you need me.

857
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:11,666
Really?

858
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:14,167
I'll take your word for it, bye!

859
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:18,076
A tiring day, right?

860
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:19,624
It was nothing.

861
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:23,625
Whenever you need me,
just call me any time.

862
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:40,726
What are you doing to this woman here?

869
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:03,055
Let go of Han Sang Eun!
Are you still pestering her?

870
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:05,933
Were you really going to sell my
noona in order to teach at that school?

871
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:08,228
Can't Jeong Kyu Han like Kim Yun Hee?

872
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:09,863
Why are you doing this?

873
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:11,964
You don't know who is her betrothed?

874
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:14,210
What do you mean by
'Jin Ju has disappeared'?

875
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,651
Hey, Kang Hae Seong, where are you?

876
00:50:15,652 --> 00:50:17,679
Tell me now, where are you?

877
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,919
Oh dear, we have a date today.

878
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,432
Are you dating only because you're
betrothed or are you sincere about it?

879
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:25,645
Don't tell me I'm
really jealous about him?

880
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:27,980
I don't like it,
I'm not comfortable with it.
