1
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,040
I was born in the Soviet Union in '58.

2
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,620
It was 13 years after
World War II was over.

3
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,960
The whole country was ruined.

4
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,430
We lost 20 million people.

5
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,920
It's a lot.

6
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,710
We was living in Stalin's buildings.

7
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,180
Probably a 400 square foot apartment.

8
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,110
No running water,
no toilets, three families.

9
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,240
It was a pretty rough lifestyle.

10
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,280
I was a happy kid.

11
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,060
I play a game. I play hockey.

12
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,870
Pucks was empty cans and stuff like that.

13
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,830
But, we had fun.

14
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,610
Our heroes played for the
Red Army Club, for the national team.

15
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,990
Vladimir Pozner
Journalist

16
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,360
TRYOUTS!

17
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,470
JOIN THE RED ARMY HOCKEY TEAM
AND SERVE YOUR COUNTRY.

18
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,650
My mom and dad,
they probably collected for two years.

19
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,910
They bought for me gloves,
helmet, and the skates.

20
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,840
On the black market,
it probably cost 250 rubles.

21
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,220
It was big money for a Soviet family.

22
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,470
There was a huge line of the boys

23
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,410
With the sticks. With the skates.

24
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,070
With the parents. With the grandparents.

25
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,540
It's unbelievable.
It's probably 3-4 miles long.

26
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,750
I was 9 years old.

27
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,780
I stayed in line probably 7 or 8 hours.

28
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,080
I was exhausted.

29
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,420
I got no chance.

30
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
They said, "Thank you very much.
Come again next year."

31
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,230
So I practiced 3 or 4 times a day.

32
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,610
Finally, they said I was good
enough to make the team.

33
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,810
I was so proud to play for Red Army.

34
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,930
<i>Skate with no fear.{\i}</i>

35
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,410
<i>We'll give you exercises
no one has ever seen.{\i}</i>

36
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,970
<i>You'll be juggling your sticks,{\i}</i>

37
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,160
<i>twisting them around your head.{\i}</i>

38
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,800
<i>Where's the smile? You're playing hockey!{\i}</i>

39
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,130
<i>Jump! Quick!{\i}</i>

40
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,290
Tarasov was the father
of the Soviet system.

41
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,350
<i>Great!{\i}</i>

42
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,920
And the head coach of the Red Army.

43
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,690
<i>You'll become great hockey players!{\i}</i>

44
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>And great men!{\i}</i>

45
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,840
This man played a big role in my life.

46
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,640
I was Red Army in my heart.

47
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,150
I came there. I was 10 years old.

48
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,340
Tarasov, he developed the program.

49
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,220
He wrote a few books about hockey.

50
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,830
These books laid next to my
bed since I was a little kid.

51
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,620
He described the game in a very simple way.

52
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,690
Our training camps were together.

53
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,860
My chess team and the national hockey team.

54
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,700
They would often come to me

55
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,730
if they had questions
on psychological training.

56
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,800
He studied the training of the Bolshoi,

57
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,970
and he applied it to hockey.

58
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,650
<i>Look at these dances, eh?{\i}</i>

59
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,720
<i>It's like the boogie woogie!{\i}</i>

60
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,760
Sport is an art form.

61
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,630
That's what Tarasov thought.

62
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,800
Creativity, a vivid mind, and constant

63
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,330
thinking are needed for greatness.

64
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,510
My father was not just a hockey coach...

65
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,950
he was a great mentor.

66
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,520
He could see the potential
in a young person.

67
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,490
He developed my patriotism.

68
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,550
For us, it's very important.

69
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,730
For me since I was ten, it was
very important what was in front.

70
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,400
The name of my team, my country.

71
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,290
I belong to the great nation.

72
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,760
If you wear the national team uniform,

73
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,330
that's your duty. To do your best.

74
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,300
To represent your country.

75
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Have you ever watched hockey?

76
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,790
<i>I like playing with dolls.{\i}</i>

77
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,410
Do you know what these letters mean:

78
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,310
K-G-B?

79
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,110
<i>No.{\i}</i>

80
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,380
Yeah, you were born much later.

81
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,610
You didn't have to deal
with this organization.

82
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,640
When we crossed the
Atlantic to play against

83
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,870
the best Ontario clubs at 16 years old,
I was happy.

84
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,380
There was one flight per week.

85
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,150
Empty because nobody was flying.

86
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,520
Of course, regular people cannot leave

87
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,030
the country because that's the system.

88
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,770
I used to go with them to provide security,

89
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,150
and to prevent any "escapes" to the West.

90
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,300
The "special people" who traveled with us,

91
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,970
they give your passport before you
get to passport control,

92
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,040
and they collect the passport
when you cross the border.

93
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,080
The Canadians put us in a five-star hotel.

94
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,790
Chandeliers. Marble.

95
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,090
One room per player,

96
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,550
and a hundred TV channels.

97
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,160
Fruits, vegetables in the wintertime.

98
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,070
I've never seen it before for us.

99
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,480
In the Soviet Union,
we got fish only one day a week.

100
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,210
It was "Fish Thursday."

101
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,480
When people went abroad,
especially for the first time,

102
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,790
they were so surprised by the differences.

103
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,520
We got $48.

104
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,120
They gave us pocket money.

105
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
I bought 2 jeans, 3 pair of shorts.

106
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,130
Lots of stuff which just didn't
exist in Moscow.

107
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,870
However, they never saw

108
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,810
the negative side of the other countries.

109
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,280
Control was intense.

110
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,690
Without such intense control, there
was no point in the work at all.

111
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,390
I was never even thinking about to defect.

112
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,300
Never. What's that mean?

113
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,670
I'm happy.

114
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,590
The building was 12,000 people. Packed.

115
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,380
I was so nervous, y'know?

116
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,080
We got shitty gear.

117
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,670
We beat them in all 5 games.

118
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,510
<i>Which players do you like the best?{\i}</i>

119
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,790
Okay, Gabe. Let's go. Let's go. Work!

120
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,060
You guys are used to doing
nothing over there in America.

121
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,280
Tarasov disagreed and stopped the game.

122
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,740
We didn't play for 40 minutes.

123
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,560
And there sat Brezhnev.

124
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,190
And Brezhnev was saying,
"What the hell is this?"

125
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,400
They removed him from the national team.

126
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,990
They punished him for this.

127
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,130
The KGB Chief was a fan
of the Red Army Club.

128
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,170
Tikhonov was his protégé.

129
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,080
What do you mean powerful?

130
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,050
What do you mean powerful?
He's a part of the system.

131
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,890
The Chief of the KGB put
him in the position.

132
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,030
If we didn't obey,
he would punish us severely.

133
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,900
He would take your salary
or bar you from playing.

134
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,530
<i>I'm very volatile.{\i}</i>

135
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,730
<i>That's how I am.{\i}</i>

136
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,940
<i>And the guys know that.{\i}</i>

137
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,880
<i>They know when to approach me.{\i}</i>

138
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,550
Tikhonov was in a very advanced
position from the beginning.

139
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,180
He got the best team in the world.

140
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,190
He got all kinds of support
from the government.

141
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,530
In the Soviet Union, you
can get any player.

142
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,300
You draft him into the army
and he becomes a Red Army player.

143
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,170
Can Tikhonov be successful without us?

144
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,570
I don't know.

145
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,910
We being successful without him?

146
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,710
I think so.

147
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,560
<i>Destiny.{\i}</i>

148
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,620
It was tough.

149
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,340
After the Olympic games,

150
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,040
Tikhonov fired the veterans.

151
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,960
It's wrong.

152
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,460
All these guys, all these supporting staff,

153
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,360
this is the successful team.

154
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,050
Not him.

155
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,340
After that game,
the workload became tremendous.

156
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,430
There were players who pissed blood.

157
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,970
We practiced four times a day
in the summertime.

158
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,380
Four times.

159
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,740
We're working at a heart rate of 220.

160
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,510
Can you imagine? 220.

161
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,430
<i>You win by being merciless in training.{\i}</i>

162
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,450
<i>The coach must perpetuate this tradition.{\i}</i>

163
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,610
A coach must find a player's pressure

164
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,480
points to achieve maximum results.

165
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,580
It's the carrot and the stick,
like an animal trainer.

166
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,160
To get masterpieces from the beasts,

167
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,420
you have to force them a little bit.

168
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,600
Did I respect him?

169
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,100
As my coach? Yes.

170
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,930
As a person? No.

171
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,720
You have to be born a goalie.

172
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,450
I am a destroyer.

173
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,690
I destroy the plans of the adversary.

174
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,190
<i>Vladislav Tretiak in the net.{\i}</i>

175
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,440
<i>The best goalie in the world.{\i}</i>

176
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,730
<i>Tretiak is almost unbeatable.{\i}</i>

177
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,640
The greatest goaltender
the game has ever seen.

178
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,050
Tikhonov was given ready-to-use material.

179
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,160
Tarasov had created stars.

180
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,150
It was to his credit that
he created a five-man unit.

181
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,090
They were the best.

182
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,510
<i>...are the strike force of the Soviet team.{\i}</i>

183
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,760
When the five got together,
no one knew how to play them.

184
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,500
He was the most dangerous
player in the world.

185
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,590
He can make the goal from nowhere, anytime.

186
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,450
He scored more goals than
anybody in our hockey history.

187
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,860
He was a Russian tank.

188
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,140
He was the soul of the five-man unit.

189
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,110
Igor was the professor.

190
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,690
Because he was skinny like that.

191
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,240
Not a professor, maybe nerd.

192
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,890
Skinny but tough.

193
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,000
It kind of misleads lots of guys.

194
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,070
He was my best friend.

195
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,790
He was teammate. He was roommate.

196
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,530
Alex became my younger brother.

197
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,860
My mom cooked for him,

198
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,790
and my grandpa was like his grandpa.

199
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's tough to find any closer relationship
between two men.

200
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,780
Alex is probably the best all-around
defenseman ever to play the game.

201
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,620
I believe he (Slava) was the best
defenseman in the history of world hockey.

202
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,980
Slava was our leader, of course.

203
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,480
In the way he skated, his character.

204
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,210
Tikhonov came from the Politburo and said:

205
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,050
"Slava, I got good news.

206
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,670
"You're going to be captain of
the Soviet National Team."

207
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I said, "Thank you, but I'm not."

208
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,880
He said, "You stupid?"

209
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,360
I said, "I'm not."

210
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,130
But when I talked to the guys,

211
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,430
they said, "We want you to be our captain."

212
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,600
I said, "Okay."

213
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,910
Why they choose me, I don't know.

214
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,020
But I become the youngest ever
captain of the national team.

215
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,430
We were great friends in real life.

216
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,800
I tell you, they were good people,
kind and always ready to help.

217
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,270
We never let each other down.

218
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,690
We were all practically the same, you know?

219
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,900
We'd celebrate the birthdays,
the family things.

220
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,160
We went to restaurants together.
We would spend vacation time.

221
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,430
We were all the same.

222
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,290
We were the same.

223
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,510
Why are you asking me the same thing?

224
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,730
Sometimes you feel without a look.

225
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,030
Your partner must be there.

226
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,370
Fetisov was number two in scoring,

227
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,640
even though he was a defender.

228
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,670
He would go forward
and Makarov would draw back.

229
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,780
Everything was like this.

230
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,190
The opponents did not know who to cover.

231
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,970
No one could hold them back.

232
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,450
What they did on the ice...

233
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,450
Yes, they were the best.

234
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,790
It was the greatest moment in my life.

235
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,200
My childhood dream come true.

236
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,910
I got this gold medal.

237
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,770
I was the happiest man in the world.

238
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,100
My brother, his name was Anatoly.

239
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:36,340
I think he would be one of the
best forwards ever to play the game.

240
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,710
He was like a son to me.

241
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,540
We got almost 10 years apart.

242
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,120
He was killed in a car accident in 1985.

243
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,260
I was driving the car.

244
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,480
To be in a situation like that,

245
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,740
I didn't want to live.

246
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,980
<i>I share everything they go through.{\i}</i>

247
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,460
<i>All the training, all happiness and sadness.{\i}</i>

248
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,430
<i>Losses and victories, all the positive,{\i}</i>

249
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,050
<i>and the negative, too.{\i}</i>

250
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,910
Andrei Khomutov found out
his father was going to die soon.

251
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,670
He came to him and said,

252
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,810
"Viktor, can you let me
go to see my father?"

253
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,080
He said, "No.

254
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,520
"You have to get ready for the next game."

255
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,650
Andrei never saw his father again.

256
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,020
This was tough to imagine for me,

257
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,120
that Tikhonov can do something like that.

258
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,260
<i>The players often ask,
"What is this all for?{\i}</i>

259
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,890
<i>"Why get maximum scores?{\i}</i>

260
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,660
<i>"Maybe we should rest a little."{\i}</i>

261
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,830
<i>It's absurd.{\i}</i>

262
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,740
They was eleven months at camp.

263
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,910
Training camp.

264
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,040
And thirty-six nights, they was home.

265
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,510
They never get out of that camp.

266
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,720
We always fight against Tikhonov
to let us live at home.

267
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,530
But he said, "This is the style of my team.

268
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,560
"And this is the style of Soviet sport
in the Soviet Union."

269
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,270
I'm by myself in the apartment.

270
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,310
And when he talks on the phone with me,

271
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,370
it's like lines staying behind him,

272
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
and everybody listening.

273
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,650
Because it's one phone
and it's like twenty-five guys.

274
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,690
We get together, the Russian 5,

275
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,600
and said, "Can we lose
the World Championships next?

276
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,600
"Maybe they'll kick his
ass out of the team.

277
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,230
"And we can live a better life."

278
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,430
I'm telling you,
so many times we asked ourselves,

279
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,940
"Why are you suffering so much?

280
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,970
"Why play for a guy who doesn't
respect us as a human being?"

281
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,800
<i>So many competitions
and you are never home.{\i}</i>

282
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,000
<i>At first, I'd get home
and Dima wouldn't recognize me.{\i}</i>

283
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,700
<i>I'd ask him, "Where's your dad?"{\i}</i>

284
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,980
<i>And he would show me photographs.{\i}</i>

285
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,210
Your youth is wasted.

286
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,310
New Year's Eve, holidays, birthdays...

287
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
You're always alone with the team,

288
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,960
without your wife and kids.
It's a tough life.

289
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,800
At 32, I felt old and worn out.

290
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,270
I wanted freedom to train
on my own, or to stop playing.

291
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:36,110
So I was forced to quit.

292
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,680
<i>Dear comrades, delegates,{\i}</i>

293
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,420
<i>a new democratic era is upon us.{\i}</i>

294
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,220
What's the Cold War?

295
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,290
<i>The Cold War.{\i}</i>

296
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,660
No, I know. What's the Cold War?

297
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,830
What's it about?

298
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,020
About the money?

299
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,130
About business?

300
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,070
I think so.

301
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,170
Nothing else?

302
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,770
Fear of what?

303
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,590
That's bullshit.

304
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,740
Tikhonov came from the Politburo
to the training camp and said,

305
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:47,600
"Slava, if you do good in Calgary, in the
Olympics, you win the gold medal,

306
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,040
"you're gonna be the first Soviet player
who go play in National Hockey League."

307
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,440
I said, "Okay."

308
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,320
I was so happy.

309
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,800
When I landed in Moscow,
they called me to the Ministry.

310
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,560
They give me in the Kremlin,
the Lenin Award.

311
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,200
The biggest award in the country.

312
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,230
And then I was called for private talk
between three men:

313
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,500
The Minister of Sport, Tikhonov and myself.

314
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,910
When the Minister said,
"Slave, finally you deserve it.

315
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,480
"We'll let you go. Good luck
and I wish you all the best."

316
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,820
And he said, "Am I right, Viktor?"

317
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,620
You know what Viktor said?

318
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,860
"Yeah, you're right. But I need
him for another year.

319
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,600
"Because we can't replace him."

320
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,340
He said, "January 2nd, we got the
Super Series against New Jersey.

321
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,150
"And we promise you after
the game against New Jersey,

322
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,660
"you're going to finish
the season in the NHL."

323
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,030
ls Slava Fetisov coming to the NHL?

324
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,670
<i>It's possible for him to stay here.{\i}</i>

325
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
<i>Now?{\i}</i>

326
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,990
See what happened?
Publicly he said, "He can go."

327
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,020
But inside, not behind my back,
in front of me he said, "No."

328
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:15,280
Lou Lamoriello showed me around New York.

329
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:21,450
He said, "Slava, I learned today
they'll never let you go."

330
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,360
He said, "This is the life.

331
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,360
"You should stay here."

332
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,870
No.

333
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:37,600
I cannot run away from my country.

334
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,470
I cannot

335
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,970
do something illegal.

336
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,280
When I get back,
I called a press conference.

337
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,850
And I said, "I'm never going to play
for the Tikhonov team anymore.

338
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,480
"Because they cheated me."

339
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:17,330
The day his article went out,

340
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,280
our phone stopped ringing.

341
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,490
People who we know stopped talking to us.

342
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,650
The sports facilities in the country,

343
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,920
nobody let me in.

344
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,480
You come there, the people know you,
they admire you.

345
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,230
They put their head down and said,

346
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,640
"No, Slava.
You cannot come and skate here.

347
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,970
"No, if we let you skate,
they are going to kill me."

348
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,280
Agents were placed in their social circle

349
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,840
so we could know the situation from within.

350
00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:02,880
These people were just
pawns on a chess board.

351
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,930
When you sit at home and you know

352
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,530
some car is sitting down
near your entrance,

353
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,730
and they're going to follow you,

354
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,210
and they're going to try to listen. It you
meet someone, what do you talk about?

355
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,380
Anything.
Anything.

356
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,680
If they try to put Slava in prison,
what do you think?

357
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,190
In Kiev.
In Kiev.

358
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,860
They tried to put Slava in a car
and take him to the police station.

359
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,750
They put the cuffs on him,
and cuffed him to the battery.

360
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,550
And they just beat him up
until four o'clock in the morning.

361
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,580
When they called Tikhonov,
and Tikhonov came and picked him up.

362
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,820
That's when we heard
when Tikhonov was screaming,

363
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,950
"Do anything, just put him in prison.

364
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,260
"Just don't let him out of the country."

365
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,490
<i>If Slava will not be included on the team,
what will be your next move?{\i}</i>

366
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,050
<i>Most likely, we'll all refuse to
participate in the world championship.{\i}</i>

367
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,760
<i>You are three. Who else will join you?{\i}</i>

368
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,460
<i>There are others who will support us.{\i}</i>

369
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,370
Krutov stood up for me,

370
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,840
with my teammates Makarov and Larionov.

371
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,820
Krutov has always been quiet.

372
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,810
When you see the situation get crucial,

373
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,350
he steps up.

374
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,680
And from him, when he said something,

375
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,990
it sounds different when you're not
talking all the time. It's very powerful.

376
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,200
It was that.

377
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,300
Slava was leaving.

378
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,230
I stayed to play.

379
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,380
It was a big surprise for me that

380
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,680
Alex Kasatonov didn't go
with the boys on TV.

381
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,440
You know, my best friend

382
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,850
said, "No, I'm not going."

383
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,540
So it was a big surprise.

384
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,300
It's a very long story.

385
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,800
It's the story of our country, I think.

386
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:45,540
He said publicly I wasn't
right to leave the team.

387
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:52,050
He took the position of
Coach Tikhonov in this situation.

388
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,190
That's the funniest part.

389
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,890
It's not the time.

390
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,270
To be continued.

391
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:38,160
A special department was
created in the KGB.

392
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,270
Do you want to say anything?

393
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,810
<i>Take your glasses off.{\i}</i>

394
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,410
You can't even see me in dark glasses.

395
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,640
Come on, they are transparent.

396
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,190
I can see you well.

397
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,410
<i>Look at the sun.{\i}</i>

398
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,050
I just did. I looked.

399
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,420
<i>I have sunglasses, too.{\i}</i>

400
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,290
<i>They are white.{\i}</i>

401
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,190
<i>Like this color white.{\i}</i>

402
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,450
<i>Continue.{\i}</i>

403
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,860
<i>Continue.{\i}</i>

404
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,710
<i>'When did things start to go wrong?{\i}</i>

405
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,630
Maybe it was

406
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,980
the incident with Mogilny.

407
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,980
<i>Were you in Sweden to bring him out?{\i}</i>

408
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,670
Mogilny was considered a traitor,

409
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,970
especially because he was
in the Soviet Army.

410
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,610
He escaped, as they say.

411
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,080
But it was kind of...

412
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,210
How do you say... Illegal.

413
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,510
<i>Here, people enjoy life.{\i}</i>

414
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,250
<i>Everyone has their own home,
their own cars.{\i}</i>

415
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,850
<i>But that's not the point.{\i}</i>

416
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,950
<i>Here, people live for themselves.{\i}</i>

417
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,810
<i>And there, I lived like a homeless dog.{\i}</i>

418
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,740
Well...

419
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,610
It's difficult to speak
about hockey separately.

420
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,080
It wouldn't be like,

421
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,950
"Oh my God! Hockey players are leaving!"

422
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,820
The regime wouldn't put it like that.

423
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,220
One defection could lead to a wave.

424
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,250
This was a big threat to Soviet power.

425
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,260
Then they start to negotiate.

426
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,860
They said, "Okay, it looks like the
high authority agreed to let you go.

427
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:06,430
“But you have to understand
You'll make $1000 a month.

428
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,640
"Doesn't matter how much is your contract.

429
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,240
"You're gonna bring money
back to the embassy."

430
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,980
I said, "No way. I'm not going.

431
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,210
"I mean, are you crazy?"

432
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,280
They said, "You crazy."

433
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,410
I said, "Okay."

434
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,420
They called me in a couple days
and said, "Slava,

435
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,660
"you got special permission
from the Politburo.

436
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,630
"Because you were so good for
hockey, for the national team,

437
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,560
"and you were captain,
we'll give you 10% of your salary.

438
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,980
"This is a special offer
made especially for you.

439
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,710
"Nobody has to know about the 10%."

440
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,720
I said, "No."

441
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,880
Then it was 20%.

442
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,720
Then it was 25%.

443
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,200
They called my mom. They called my wife.
They tried to scare them.

444
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,730
Momma said, "Son, the people called me.
They explained you got no chance.

445
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:08,790
"They'll not let you go.
They'll make something bad for you.

446
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,770
"You should not fight anymore."

447
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,770
And Igor Larionov signed a deal and left.

448
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,400
He was happy with a 50/50
split with the system.

449
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,710
Igor, and Sergei and Vladimir.

450
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:56,120
They was happy to split 50/50.

451
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,090
I said, "No."

452
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,660
And I was alone.

453
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,070
They said, "What do you want?"

454
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,270
I said, "I want my contract."

455
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,950
Yazov. Dmitry Yazov.

456
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,760
The Minister of Defense.

457
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,630
The second most powerful man
in the country.

458
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:46,640
They called me to the Ministry of Defense.

459
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,190
Tried to straighten me out.

460
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,430
They put my uniform on me.

461
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,450
It was a huge, huge office.

462
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,140
He said, "America? This is my enemy.

463
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,650
"No way you're going to America."

464
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,050
He said, "You don't wanna play?

465
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,350
"You're not gonna play
anymore, anywhere, anyhow."

466
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,130
Something clicked inside of me.
I have to do something.

467
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:18,460
I have to provoke some result
out of this visit.

468
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,230
Because I knew I'd never get back here.

469
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,430
Never.

470
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,530
Ever.

471
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,110
I said, "Mr. Minister,

472
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:32,810
"if you don't do what you promised to me,
you're not a Minister. You're not an officer.

473
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,940
“Release me from the army.

474
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,680
"Thank you very much."

475
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,240
I turn and go.

476
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,050
He was screaming, yelling.

477
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:45,060
"You ----sucker.
You try to play for our enemies?

478
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,190
"You know what I can do with you? I'll
send you to Siberia. You'll never get out."

479
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,290
But I never turned back.

480
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,460
I left.

481
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,400
You know what?

482
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,600
In ten days, they give me a passport.

483
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,370
And I was free of the Army.

484
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:05,060
The first multiple working entrance
visa to United States.

485
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,560
I'm not a historian.

486
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,930
My feeling was the country tried to change

487
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:30,130
something because it's Perestroika time.

488
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,300
But he doesn't want changes.

489
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,570
Everybody was afraid. It's understandable.

490
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,210
It's like in a dark room,

491
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,250
try to find a dark cat.

492
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,650
You know, it's not funny.

493
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:00,200
<i>You'll go play our nation's hockey.{\i}</i>

494
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,670
<i>Skillful and effective hockey.{\i}</i>

495
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,140
<i>You'll be great.{\i}</i>

496
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,770
Nobody like me in the United States.

497
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,840
Nobody knew what I went through.

498
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,610
They would think in clichés.

499
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,620
I'm a bad guy, a communist.

500
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,350
When I walk in the wives'
lounge, it was like

501
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:28,860
I was staying in one corner,

502
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,660
and the rest were staying
in the other corner.

503
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,130
And was looking at me,
and talking in their own language.

504
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,860
I understand nothing they're talking about.

505
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,920
Looking at me again.

506
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:41,370
Laughing and looking and talking.

507
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:43,130
And I think, "What are they talking about?"

508
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,200
I have no idea.

509
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,030
There was no style.

510
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,290
They're so simple.

511
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,060
They're not creative.

512
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,730
It was the worst team in the league.

513
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,540
Somebody gets open
and they skate away from you.

514
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
And you end up on your ass.

515
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,550
They look at you like
you never played before.

516
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,180
Life challenged me all the time.

517
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,450
All of a sudden,
he was drafted by the New Jersey Devils.

518
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,500
Nobody gave a shit about our relationship.

519
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,130
They sign him. We have to play.

520
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,310
It wasn't friendship anymore.
It wasn't team spirit.

521
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,410
It was kind of competition.

522
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,080
It was tough, trust me.

523
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,760
I came to the United States
to play the hockey game.

524
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,960
Not to be involved in this bullshit.

525
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,400
It didn't work out for me,
staying in the NHL.

526
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,770
But that's okay, I think.

527
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:06,810
All in all, my life worked out.
I think everything's okay.

528
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,810
I was 36.

529
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,480
And they trade me from
New Jersey to Detroit.

530
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,380
<i>Of course..{\i}</i>

531
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,220
<i>We spent so many years
playing and living together.{\i}</i>

532
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:55,090
<i>You miss the ones you're close to.{\i}</i>

533
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:58,560
I think, "Oh my God. I did something wrong.

534
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,330
"You've been successful.
You've always been on top.

535
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,630
"Now you're a loser?"

536
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:15,440
I get out of the dressing room
and see my wife by herself.

537
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,580
Crying.

538
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,420
I said, "Why are you crying?"

539
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,430
She said, "Oh, we got probably
our last chance."

540
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,930
I said, "No."

541
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,590
We've got two choices:

542
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:31,730
To pack the stuff, go back

543
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,400
or to fight through.

544
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:24,410
<i>I hereby resign my post
as President of the USSR.{\i}</i>

545
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:31,760
<i>An end has been put to the
Cold War and the arms race,{\i}</i>

546
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,420
<i>and the mad militarization of this country.{\i}</i>

547
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,790
<i>The threat of nuclear war is over.{\i}</i>

548
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,810
<i>I wish everyone all the best.{\i}</i>

549
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,440
Together again on the same team.

550
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,070
It was like a fish put back in the water.

551
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:45,520
You become younger right away,
and enjoy the game.

552
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,270
Scotty comes to the dressing room and said,

553
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,330
"Guys, I don't know who teach you
to play this way,

554
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:33,840
"but I wanna ask you one thing.

555
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,000
"Don't change anything."

556
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:32,430
I start looking for Igor right away.

557
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,900
And I said, "Igor, we'll go together."

558
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:01,320
It's true American dream, you know?

559
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:11,070
Afterwards, I went to Gary Bettman.
I said, "Gary, I need the cup in Moscow."

560
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:13,610
He said, "You crazy? We'll never
let the cup go to Moscow.

561
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,300
"It's mafia. It's a bad country."

562
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,210
I said, "Listen, I want the cup
to be in Moscow."

563
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,180
He said, "Slava, it's impossible."

564
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,450
I said, "What do you mean impossible?"

565
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,320
<i>it's great to be home.{\i}</i>

566
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,460
<i>For me, the Red Army Club
is home, of course.{\i}</i>

567
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,630
<i>I started here when I was 8 years old,{\i}</i>

568
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,170
<i>and I left when I was 31.{\i}</i>

569
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:45,810
It's very strange.

570
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,570
When you're born in the Soviet Union,

571
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:50,940
and you left one country
and come back to another.

572
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,210
It does not feel comfortable, you know?

573
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,850
When I get back to Moscow,

574
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:02,150
it's totally different.

575
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:03,690
Different mentality.

576
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,500
Different culture.

577
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,550
Different... Everything's different.

578
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,660
Country's got no heroes. Got no system.

579
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,060
No structure. Nothing.

580
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,190
Everybody runs around
trying to get something.

581
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,860
It's not the way I want to live.

582
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,070
<i>Everything is about the material
side of things: money, finance.{\i}</i>

583
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,040
<i>Our country's crisis
is now reflected in hockey.{\i}</i>

584
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:18,590
<i>Teams have very little money to
keep players from leaving.{\i}</i>

585
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:31,710
We kinda forget about the patriotism.

586
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,150
We are ashamed of what we were before.

587
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,100
We lost something.

588
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,970
We lost our pride.

589
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,870
We lost...

590
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,440
Our soul.

591
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,660
Gabe...

592
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,320
It's not a proper question.

593
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,970
I'm a politician now.

594
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:25,960
I get my feeling twenty years ago, right?

595
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,590
I was sad.

596
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,730
I played for the country for many years.

597
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:32,730
I was proud to play and
be captain of the national team.

598
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,270
When Putin invited me it was 2002.

599
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:43,950
It's 11 years it's no Soviet Union.

600
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:48,280
President Putin said, "Slava, it's enough.

601
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,620
"Get back home."

602
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,330
Vladimir Putin gave me the position
of Minister of Sport.

603
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,480
Sport should be a way of life.

604
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,010
I'm a little guy in a big system,
but I try to do my best.

605
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,340
It's a huge amount of work.

606
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,850
It's twenty hours working day. Every day.

607
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,780
Y'know, we got lots of problems.

608
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:58,550
I need to build infrastructure.

609
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,820
I need to find the money.

610
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,870
I need to think about my people now.

611
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,830
The kids, the veterans...

612
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:08,730
Try to build something good
out of what's happened.

613
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,500
We built a junior league.

614
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,720
We built 300 new skating arenas.

615
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:24,720
We brought the Olympic Games to Sochi.

616
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,690
We are happy to be back in our country.

617
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,300
I think our country and people need us.

618
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,920
We went through a lot,

619
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,170
and I'm happy today we are
again like brothers.

620
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:02,520
Very close friends.

621
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,750
We're friends.

622
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:12,730
It's very important to get the people
you went through a lot with next to you.

623
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,610
It's better than finding somebody else.

624
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,570
We're still friends.

625
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,450
And when we played, we were even closer.

626
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:29,160
I dream about how we used to play together.

627
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,330
<i>First, a round of applause for this great
Soviet coach.{\i}</i>

628
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:23,900
<i>The word "great" hardly begins to describe
this great coach!{\i}</i>

629
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,100
<i>Unfortunately, Viktor says
he's unable to talk today.{\i}</i>

630
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,760
The most important thing for me

631
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:53,030
is to stress to the kids how it's
important to be teammates.

632
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,160
How important to do stuff collectively.

633
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,500
