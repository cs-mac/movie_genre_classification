11

Yeah, I just figured I'd, you know,
put some of your things in.

44
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,604
I tried froggy style for a while once with
a girl I was dating. Fucked up my back.

45
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,234
I don't even want to ask what that is.

46

You haven't had sex in three weeks?

Well, she had a yeast infection, and then
she had her period right afterwards.

51

- Which has got to be done by now.
- You can't fuck with a yeast infection?

You can fuck with a yeast infection
or period.

53

- No. No, it hurts.
- It does?

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,461
- Well, that's what she says.
- I think that's bullshit.

55
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,137
No, but I've heard that before
from other girls.

56
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,683
Has she been sucking on your dick?
Been giving you blow jobs?

57

No, she doesn't like to.

58
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,980
She doesn't?
No fucking shit she doesn't like to.

59
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,308
Who likes putting dicks in their mouth?
You do it 'cause...

60
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,482
That's why they're called blow jobs.

61
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,151
- Don't get hysterical.
- It's a job.

62
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,696
I'm not hysterical. I think it is...

63

She leaves her fucking shit everywhere.

when you're dating a hot girl.

Truthfully, that's why, if you recall,
in high school,

67
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,122
I didn't date any hot girls, ever.

- Yes, that's why.

Well, we're not in high school anymore.

70

The relationship that I have with Rachael
is about more than sex.

71
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,433
- What is it about, Adam?
- It's about each other.

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,227
You know, we care about each other,
we talk to each other. It's great.

73
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,351
Wouldn't it be nice if you could do that,
and then bang the hell out of each other

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,431
- afterwards?
- Ideally, yes.

- But the narration

Whoever did it, he kept clearing his throat.

And he doesn't take a pause, he just keeps
talking. And if there was a pause

Is there something wrong with me?

Yes. Well, if you look here on your MRI,

Actually, your case
is really quite fascinating because

135
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,645
your cancer is the result of an incredibly
rare gene mutation in chromosome 17,

(VOICE FADING) the P53 gene that causes
the growth of malignant cells...

I think that given the placement and size
of your particular tumor,

138
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,079
the wisest course of action is to see
if we can possibly reduce this thing

00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,643
and it brings up a lot of emotions.

464
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,144
So you're trying to make me freak out
or something, right? Is that the goal here?

465
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,526
I'm not trying to make you freak out.

466
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,939
I do want you to get in touch with
what you're feeling inside.

467
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,025
- So, if you're angry...
- I'm not angry! Okay? (SIGHS)

468
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,236
Let's just do the relaxation things, okay?

469
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,868
Can we do that? I want to hear sitars,

470
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,242
and go to my happy place
and feel the warm beam of light.

471
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,037
- Can we do that?
- I see.

472
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,717
I'm sorry. I'm just being an asshole.

473
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,547
I didn't need to say that.

474
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,553
I don't need you to take care of me.

475
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,061
I'm trying to take care of you.

476
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,181
You're right.

477
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:25,150
Listen, there are a couple of books
I want you to check out.

478
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,027
A lot of people find them really helpful.

479
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,736
You don't have to read them cover-to-cover.

480
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,039
Just take a look
and see if anything resonates.

481
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,241
- Okay?
- Okay.

482
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,674
Sorry. Are you gonna, like,
keep touching me like that?

483
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,251
- This?
- Yeah.

484
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,085
I'm, uh...

485
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,796
I'm trying to make you feel more at ease.

486
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:56,010
That's gonna make me feel more at ease?
It's like being slapped by a sea otter.

487
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,935
Touching promotes trust.
It's one of the key ways

488
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,765
that hospital practitioners
make their patients

489
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,224
feel more secure in stressful situations.

490
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,561
Yeah, but it's just...
That's not gonna help.

491
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,111
Really? A sea otter?

492
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,032
Is this... Is that kind of better?

493
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,860
- Okay, this is getting creepy.
- I'm sorry.

494
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,445
Okay, you don't like that. That's fine.

495
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,034
You shouldn't do this.
You're making a mistake.

496
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,365
You're gonna look weird, man.

497
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,700
- What do you mean?
- It's gonna look fucking weird.

498
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,035
What are you talking about?

499

Who knows if you've got some big
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your head.

500
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,587
- You said that you liked this idea.
- I liked the idea in theory.

501
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,008
Now that we're standing here
about to do it,

I think you're gonna look like fucking
Michael Stipe or something.

503
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,589
- We have to do it.
- I'm not doing it, man.

504
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,344
- We have to do it.
- You do it. I'm not fucking doing it.

505
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,515
- Come on. Do it.
- No way.

506
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,718
- You said you would.
- I don't want to,

507
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,178
'cause if it looks fucked up
you're gonna blame me

508
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,228
every time you look
at your weird-looking bald head.

514
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,243
Like brand new.

00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,332

No, looks really weird.

- We shouldn't have done this.
- Yeah, big mistake.

532
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,505
Why didn't we go to a barber?

533
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,883
That would have been a good idea.
If we paid someone to do it.

534
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,091
Using your fucking balls trimmer
instead of going to the barber.

535
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,099
I never wash them, ever.
And it's not my balls, it's my asshole.

Not at all.

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,738

- Yeah, what the fuck?

539
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,863
Yeah, hospitals kind of freak her out, so...

Well, Adam,
nobody likes going to the hospital.

That's not why people go.

544
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:34,877
No, no, you don't get it. it's like she doesn't
want to mix the negative and the positive.

Sounds to me like a bullshit thing.

547
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,894
Well, you can meet her if you want.
She's gonna pick me up right after this.

548
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,596
If you want to meet her.
I'm sure she would love to meet you guys.

00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,771
Sure.

555

Oh, no, she's gonna come.
I'm sure she is just hung up or something.

556
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,998
You guys should probably go, though.
You could meet her next time.

557
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,127
Yeah, sure.

558
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,629

Claire, the girl I met at the bookstore?

665
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,259
My date did not go well, unfortunately,

666
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,510
due to a lack of chemistry and, I think,
an overuse of profanity on my part.

- No.

769
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,255
I'm Kyle. How's it going?

770
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,306
- Allison. This is Jackie.
- Allison? Jackie.

771
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,850
ALLISON: Nice to meet you.
KYLE: Nice to meet you guys.

772
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,223
- It's my birthday today!
- ALLISON: Happy birthday!

773
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,514
Cheers!

774
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,110
- I'm here with my buddy, actually.
- The skinny one?

775
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,357
- One second.
- Yeah.

776
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,115
Look, I met two nice girls.
They're right there.

777
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,487
- Yeah, they're cute.
- Yeah, let's go over.

778
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,658
- Are they nice?
- They're very nice.

779
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,282
- They're talking to you?
- Yeah.

780
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,613
- Really?
- Take the hat off.

781
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,699
- Take it off. Take it off.
- I'm not taking it off.

782
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,620
What do you guys do?

783
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,748
I just designed the website for the Swiffer.

784
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,454
- The Swiffer? Really?
- Yeah.

785
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:45,588
Sorry, I got excited. I'm a fan. I
kike Swiffer. I use it for everything.

786
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,885
Mopping and sweeping.

787
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,968
I just got a dog and he sheds a lot.

788
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,519
And when there's hair all over the place
I just use a wet cloth. Taken care of.

789
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,187
That's cool. What's your dog's name?

790
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,642
His name is Skeletor. Cool guy.

791
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,650
- It's kind of...
- Warm in here, isn't it?

792
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,078
- Oh, you're so bald.
- No, no. It's just cancer.

793
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,530
- I'm sorry, what?
- Cancer.

794
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,788
Yeah, I have cancer. It's not contagious.

795
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,916
Oh, my God.
Well, what Kind of cancer is it?

796
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,169
It's spinal.

797
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,295
It's in his spine.

798
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,549
I didn't even know that was possible.
How did you get it?

799
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,181
Bad mattress.

800
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,138
- He's joking. It was a joke.
- Oh!

801
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,264
- He's just kidding.
- Oh, my God.

802
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,974
See. He still has a sense of humor about it.
He's inspirational.

803
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,480
- It's an inspiration.
- Very cute.

804
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,437
Can I... May we touch it?

805
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,864
JACKIE: Is that weird?

806
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,694
- Yeah, if you want to.
- You can do more than touch it. Come on.

807
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,872
Oh... Oh, this is a really nice head.

808
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,370
KYLE: Play with it a little.
Let's all rub it together.

809
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,417
It will grow if you rub it enough.

810
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,915
VENDOR: There you go.

811
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,381
What are you doing? Are you okay?

812
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,049
(CLEARS THROAT)
I've got to go to sleep.

813
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,049
No, man. You can't.
We have to be awake when they're awake.

814
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,471
That's how we have sex.

815
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,300
That's the whole purpose of this.
Don't throw all this away.

816
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,056
Don't waste my time, man.

817
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:24,641
Okay. Can you give me an approximate time
when I'll be having sex?

818
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,236
Ninety-five minutes from now,
we'll be having sex.

819
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,735
- I'm not gonna make it.
- That's how fucking long it's gonna take.

820
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,908
I wish it was sooner.
These girls, 96 minutes.

821
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,656
Hey, what's happening? Look at that.

822
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,988
- Got a wiener.
- You got one!

823
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,369
So, you guys want to hit up Lash?
I know the DJ.

824
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,543
- Oh, nice.
- I'm gonna have to crash out.

825
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,624
Sorry, I'm just exhausted.
The chemo just takes it out of you.

826
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,925
But, you know, I have some really potent
medical weed at my house

827
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,010
if you want to come over?

828
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,642
- That sounds fun.
- That does sound fun!

829
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,098
That's a great idea. I love that.

830
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,105
- Game on!
- Yeah, let's do it. Nice!

831
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,858
Let's do it. Let's get a cab.
There's cabs over here.

832
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,151
Sensational. That's pimping.

833
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,079
That was actually very pimp.
That was impressive.

834

(GROANS)

835
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,039
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

836
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,045
- No, no, keep going.
- Okay.

837
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,384
Are you sure? 'Cause you just don't really
look like you're having a good time.

838
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,179
Mmm. No, but it does...
It hurts. I'm sorry. Yeah, my back is...

839
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,356
- Yeah, maybe you should just...
- I'll get off you.

840
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,899
Maybe...

841
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,900
- Yeah, if you don't...
- Sorry.

KYLE: I wonder what the machine gun
budget on this film was.

845
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,541
You can't afford actors,
but you need one million machine guns.

846
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,337
- Can we watch something else?
- No, I want to see how this ends.

850
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,989
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

851
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,240
What are you doing?

852
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,701
Good old chemotherapy.

853
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,834
Oh. Waiting for the bus.

854
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:41,091
I'm on my way home right now.
I have my car if you want a ride.

855
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,671
I'm used to the bus.

856
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,846
- Thank you.
- No, I can't just let you...

857
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,676
I can't make you wait for the bus.

858
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,806
I live kind of far away.

859
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,138
I won't take no for an answer.

860
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,029
Sorry about the mess.
I'm not good at getting rid of stuff.

861
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,530
Yeah, I see.

862
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,578
Let me know if you need to pull over,
or anything.

863
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,078
Like if the chemo's...

864
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,037
If you feel nauseous, just say the word
and I'll pull right over.

865
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,712
Okay, thanks.

866
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,800
So you don't have a car.

867
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,969
No, I don't even have a license actually.

868
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,262
Why not?

869
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,092
It's incredibly dangerous.
It's like the fifth leading cause of death.

870
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,513
Which is, I guess, just a few behind cancer.

871
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,983
Still, the bus?

872
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,818
The bus after chemo?

873
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,989
Yeah. Well, usually Rachael drives me.

874
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,569
But we broke up.

875
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,575
She kind of cheated on me.

876
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,081
Oh, um...

877
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,209
Adam, do you want to talk about this?

878
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,760
You know what? Actually, no.
Let's not do the therapy in the car.

879
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,588
- You're just giving me a ride as a friend.
- Yeah, Adam, if...

880
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,925
You know, what we should really talk about
is, you have trash on your floor.

881
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,509
And there's no reason.

882
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,471
You know, at least have a bag in the back
to put the trash in.

883
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,147
Adam, your girlfriend cheated on you.

884
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,276
We don't have to talk about it.
We don't have to.

885
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,235
I just broke up with somebody
recently myself.

886
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,862
- You did?
- Yeah, it sucks.

887
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,537
- Sorry.
- No. Well, it's good because...

888
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:38,288
- We actually shouldn't be talking about it.
- Why not?

889
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,794
It's not appropriate for me
to tell you personal things

890
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,875
because the patient-therapist relationship
doesn't really work

891
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,382
if you know all my problems.

892
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,720
Admittedly I do check his Facebook
like every day

893
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,224
to see if he's dating somebody new,
which is so pathetic.

894
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,895
I shouldn't have said that.
I should have stopped.

895
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,098
Yeah.

896
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,021

- Yes.

The cancer is not responding to the chemo.

Considering the placement
and the size of the tumor,

1215
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,904
a surgery of this nature
is always very dangerous

and potentially life-threatening itself.

The surgeons will attempt to be
very aggressive.

1218
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,542
However if we are not successful
in removing the cancer,

1219

we will be out of options.

You knew how to pick them.

- Even then I think you knew.
- Yeah.

No, she didn't. She always sucked.

- You just always hate my girlfriends.
- That's not true.

there were some unforeseen complications.

The bone erosion was much greater
than initially anticipated.

1422
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:10,652
We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis,
as well as most of the right psoas muscle.

1423
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:15,482
We also had to remove a good amount of
the sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve.

1424
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,820
It's not gonna be an easy road back,
but he's gonna be okay.
