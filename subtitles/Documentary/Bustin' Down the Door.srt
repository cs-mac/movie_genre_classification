1
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:48,173
Oh, that's good. Yeah, just....
Just get comfortable.

2
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,053
I'm a little nervous.

3
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,763
You're doing great.

4
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,477
A little to the right there,
gorgeous.

5
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,064
-Okay. Like this?
-Oh, that a girl.

6
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,864
Yeah. Okay.

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
-You ready?
-Yeah.

8
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,785
-You're blushing, Dorothy.
-Don't blush, Kathy.

9
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,787
Oh, Kathy.

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,291
Okay, and big smile.

11
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,376
Kathy Regan.

12
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,253
I will always remember...

13
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,380
...the game against Fairfield.

14
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,382
That one final kick.

15
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,177
State champion, senior year.

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,262
Hunter McCaffrey.

17
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,181
I will always remember...

18
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,184
...all the great times
with the dirty dozen...

19
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,561
...and macking all
the honeys.

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,564
Cindy K. Tina B.

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,858
Michelle H. Goddamn!

22
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,568
Just too many to remember.

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,364
I'll always remember
lacrosse champions.

24
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,576
All the glory days with
the boys.

25
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,161
I will always remember...

26
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,663
...the math-club madmen...

27
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,791
...making the perfect
fake ID's...

28
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,586
...which lasted six seconds

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,381
-Troy Cochran.
-Troy Cochran.

30
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,091
-Troy gives good head.
-Fuck you!

31
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,968
I'll always remember...

32
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,762
Seniors!

33
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,181
...the senior prank.

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,958
Matthew Kidman.
I will always remember....

35
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,592
YEARBOOK MEMORIES FORM
SENIORS ONLY!

36
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,178
NAME: MATTHEW KIDMAN
I'll always remember...

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,690
Yeah, well, I told you
I wanted to try out.

38
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,654
We'd like to honor
a student...

39
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,074
...who has shown outstanding
leadership.

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,952
We have no doubt that
he will be one...

41
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,787
...of the great politicians
in Washington.

42
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,289
Georgetown
UNIVERSITY

43
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:11,084
The award for
the brightest leader...

44
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,170
...of tomorrow,
Matthew Kidman.

45
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,258
-I'm in! I'm in!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

46
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,178
Georgetown!
They gave it to you!

47
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,968
Hey, Jenny.

48
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,264
Yeah, dude, come on.

49
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,360
SENIOR PROM
DO YOU HAVE THE FEVER?

50
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,573
-Do you have the fever?
-No.

51
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,284
Why? Do you?

52
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,953
I don't know. Maybe.

53
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,455
How about you?

54
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,791
I just gotta fuck something.

55
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,586
I said, everybody say, "Ho!"

56
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,759
You know what I say?

57
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,889
I say, this prom is gonna be
off the hook! Do you feel me?

58
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,856
Security's gonna be tight.
Get wasted before you show up.

59
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,984
That's enough!

60
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,653
That's enough. I can wait.

61
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,489
I can wait, people.

62
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,577
Now, it is your
student-council president...

63
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,163
...who has a few announcements
to make.

64
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,666
Thanks, Mr. Salinger.

65
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,882
All right, how you doing?

66
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,762
Okay, let's start off
with Operation Get Samnang.

67
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,972
Sam Young, baby!

68
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,391
Yeah.

69
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,271
Well, we did it.
We raised the 25,000 dollars...

70
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,691
...so now we can bring the genius
Samnang out of Cambodia...

71
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,777
...and bring him here
to study at Westport.

72
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,283
Speaking of which,
Samnang sent us a new tape.

73
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,285
Show that shit!

74
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,872
Show it!

75
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,084
Hi, everyone, it's Samnang.

76
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,879
Sam Young!

77
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,883
I am very excited to be
coming soon. Are you excited?

78
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:12,975
I told my class that I am coming
to America. They were sad.

79
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,560
I am so happy.

80
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,271
-I wanna bang you!
-Go, Cougars!

81
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,080
How do they just skip class
every day and go to the beach?

82
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,457
Because they just don't care.

83
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,387
Let's go with them.

84
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,183
-Seriously, let's just do it.
-Why?

85
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,060
Because, I mean,
we never do anything.

86
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,272
I mean, we're graduating. We
should be going nuts right now.

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,773
Let's just do something.

88
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,984
I am doing something,
I'm going to class.

89
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,361
Klitz, you already got
into Yale.

90
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,071
I mean, it doesn't
matter anymore.

91
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,781
Yeah, Klitz, you pussy.

92
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,784
-Well, why don't you go?
-Yeah, come on. Let's go.

93
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,870
Beach is for fags, man.

94
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,581
-The beach is for fags?
-Yeah.

95
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,668
You know what?
You guys are fags.

96
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,674
Everyone to the beach!

97
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,054
Let's go! Lock them
and load them, dude.

98
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,765
WESTPORT HIGH SCHOOL

99
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,060
Fuck it.

100
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,580
SCHOOL
SECURITY

101
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,583
Personal power means
the ability to act...

102
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,378
...the ability to take action.

103
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,463
STOP
CHECK-OUT WITH SECURITY

104
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,258
Three steps to personal power
are necessary for results.

105
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,093
Here's number one step
to personal power.

106
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,762
It's called energy.
Energy.

107
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,765
When you wake up feeling
really lethargic, really lousy...

108
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,184
...do you usually
jump up and go--?

109
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,653
Oh, shit.

110
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,593
Hey! Pull it over!

111
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,263
Pull it over! Pull--

112
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,754
Oh, well, you're home early.

113
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,256
I postponed yearbook.
I gotta work on my speech

114
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,759
-Hi, Mr. Peterson.
-Mr. President.

115
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,969
-Mrs. Peterson.
-Congratulations.

116
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,056
-Oh, thank you.
-Congratulations. Georgetown.

117
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,059
Wow, you must be flying.

118
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,185
It's cool.

119
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,686
What's the speech
you're working on?

120
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,689
Oh, it's for this scholarship
I need to get so I can...

121
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,858
...actually go to Georgetown.

122
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,652
It's pretty expensive.

123
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,862
What kind of scholarship
is it?

124
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,571
What do they give it for?

125
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,368
It's for the student who best
demonstrates moral fiber.

126
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,453
Oh, moral fiber. Well, that's--

127
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,456
-Oh, I'm sure you'll get it.
-Thanks. I mean, I hope so.

128
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,083
I mean, there's some stiff
Competition...

129
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,669
...and they only pick
one of us...

130
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,256
...so I'll just have to blow
them away with my speech.

131
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,179
Okay, so why do I deserve
this scholarship?

132
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,390
1 . MAKE EYE CONTACT
2. BE CHARMING 3. JFK!

133
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,184
...can do for you
but what you can do...."

134
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,854
John F. Kennedy once said,
"Ask not what

135
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,182
Look, I don't know
who she is.

136
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,476
I'm just saying that
this girl was unbelievable.

137
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,062
I mean, she was
like this angel.

138
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,858
I mean, she had this smile.
I mean, you should have seen it.

139
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,278
-So did you bang her?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. I banged her.

140
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,155
That's what a man does,
okay?

141
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,366
-Yeah. Okay, Eli.
-Good.

142
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,580
Oh, my God. She's so hot.

143
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,666
-What channel, dude?
-No, the girl next door.

144
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,460
I can see her through
my window.

145
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,961
How's the rack?

146
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,465
-God, who is this girl?
-How's the rack?

147
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,383
-Hold on. Relax.
-No. You relax.

148
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,552
Be a man and go over there.

149
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,179
Okay. Say what?

150
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,973
I don't know. Get off your
ass and do something. Fuck!

151
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,772
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

152
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,774
Hey, dude, seriously,
I told you...

153
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,193
...it really freaks me out
when you watch that while...

154
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,569
...you're talking to me.

155
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,072
Just learn to like it.

156
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh, my God.

157
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,582
What? Matt, what?

158
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,084
Matt!

159
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,384
Dude, what the fuck?

160
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,154
Shit!

161
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,854
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

162
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,275
-Dan.
-What's going on?

163
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,484
Matthew!

164
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,779
Matthew, come down here.

165
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,877
-What are you doing up there?
-Nothing.

166
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,087
Come down here.

167
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,888
This is Danielle.

168
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,975
You know Mrs. Clark from
next door. Danielle's her niece.

169
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,062
Danielle just told us
something very interesting.

170
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,691
Mrs. Clark is in Africa for
two weeks with her church group.

171
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,193
Did you know that?

172
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,072
Anyway, Danielle just came
in from Los Angeles...

173
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,075
...and she's housesitting
while her aunt's away.

174
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,785
Why don't you show
her around.

175
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,256
Such a long road, you know.

176
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,976
-What are we doing?
-Did you like what you saw?

177
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,353
What are you talking about?

178
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,692
Okay, I saw you for,
like, an instant.

179
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,360
-An instant?
-Yeah.

180
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,070
It was no big deal.

181
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,451
No, no, it was-- It was a
big deal, but it's just that....

182
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,453
I didn't....

183
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,083
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,877
I'm sorry.

185
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,172
So, what are we gonna
do about this?

186
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,092
I mean, I said I was sorry.

187
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,764
What?

188
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,266
You saw me....

189
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,979
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna
strip right here?

190
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,067
Are you serious?

191
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,989
No.

192
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,784
No. No, never gonna happen.

193
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,789
The whole package.

194
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,583
No, come on,
this is good enough.

195
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,463
Jesus! Come on,
will you relax?

196
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,467
Frigging psycho.

197
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,268
There. You happy now?

198
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,775
Yep.

199
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,279
Hey! Wait!

200
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,990
No!

201
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,953
Jesus. Sorry.

202
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,755
You're an asshole.
It's not funny.

203
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,966
It's a little funny.

204
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,387
Come on.

205
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,889
Let me in. Let me in.

206
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,278
It's not funny.

207
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,154
It's a little funny.

208
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,460
So, what else do you do
besides torture people?

209
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,882
-Seriously, what's your story?
-I don't know.

210
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,676
I kind of just quit my job.

211
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,555
I want to start over.
Maybe go to college.

212
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:26,690
So are you here
alone or what?

213
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,984
-What?
-Just ask.

214
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,784
Do you have a boyfriend?

215
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,162
No.

216
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,084
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I have a girlfriend?

217
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,254
No.01:18:45.04\01:18:46.13
Okay.

218
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,591
So you're about to graduate.
You must be going nuts right now.

219
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,761
Yeah.

220
00:18:55,969 --> 00:19:00,182
I mean, it's just been
off the hook, you know?

221
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,059
-Really?
-Yeah.

222
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,562
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

223
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,273
Oh, I mean, it's hard to tell,
you know, because we--

224
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,068
I've just done so much
nuts stuff. I mean....

225
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,488
It's just off the hook,
off the walls. I mean....

226
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,282
You haven't done anything,
have you?

227
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,785
No.

228
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,455
It's kind of-- It's kind
of been my problem lately.

229
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,083
Come on, there's gotta
be something.

230
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,377
What about your girlfriend?

231
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,589
Okay.

232
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,759
We can figure this out.
You just need a girl.

233
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,178
What kind of girl?

234
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,390
Definitely someone cute.

235
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,559
Definitely.

236
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,062
Someone who can make
him laugh.

237
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,775
But he also needs someone
who's gonna push him.

238
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,153
Someone who's gonna
make him do...

239
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,155
...things he never thought
he could do.

240
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,868
Like stripping
in the middle of the street?

241
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,560
-Well, thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

242
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,278
Well...

243
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,072
...good night.

244
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,657
Good night.

245
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,872
"Good night"?
What are you, gay?

246
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,085
-I would have nailed her.
-Ok, you wouldn't have nailed her.

247
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,588
-Whatever, dude.
-And, you know, secondly...

248
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,466
...you know,
the vibe was not right.

249
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,969
The vibe wasn't right? She comes
to your house and makes you strip.

250
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,680
What does she have to do,
sit on your face?

251
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,266
Come on, bitch.

252
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:10,187
-Damn. Should have kissed her.
-Are you okay? Dude?

253
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,066
All right, you all have
this graph, correct?

254
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,652
Good. Let's move along then.

255
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,654
Now, it's a very simple
equation here.

256
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,073
Somebody give me
the answer to this.

257
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,370
All right, if no one knows
the answer to this....

258
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,791
Looking at this calculation,
what does this make us think of?

259
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,756
Questions on this?

260
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:08,161
Good news, ladies and gentlemen.
Pop-quiz time.

261
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:55,459
That's Samnang Sok.
He's this complete genius.

262
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,669
So we raised all
this money for him...

263
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,880
...to come here and
study at our school.

264
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,258
-Who's "we"?
-Well, I mean, I did...

265
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,969
...but he could be
the next Einstein, you know.

266
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,680
You know,
he could cure cancer.

267
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,857
Let's go.

268
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,364
So, what do you wanna do?

269
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,868
What?

270
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,289
I'm not stripping again.

271
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,875
Come on.

272
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,975
Danielle!

273
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,978
Come on.
Where are you going?

274
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,869
Hey, come on,
let's get out of here.

275
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,788
How do you know
no one's home?

276
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,582
-I don't.
-Come on.

277
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,292
Seriously, this is nuts.

278
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,263
Oh, boxers.

279
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:36,268
I always wear boxers. You just
caught me on a weird day.

280
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,658
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

281
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,163
This is right up there.

282
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,178
Oh, my God.

283
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,766
-That's Mr. Salinger.
-Who?

284
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,976
That's my principal.
Seriously, let's go.

285
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,272
-It's not funny.
-It's a little funny.

286
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,777
Hey.

287
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,156
Just go with it.

288
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,471
Dude, I'm kind of uncomfortable
watching this with you.

289
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,182
Dude, learn to like it.

290
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,189
I'm all wet. Can I come in?

291
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:14,157
Hey, guys. This is Danielle.

292
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,578
You must be Eli. And Klitz.
Right.

293
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,663
Hey, come on,
we're all going out.

294
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:24,585
-Can I use your bathroom first?
-Oh, it's over here to the left.

295
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,385
-Dude.
-I know.

296
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,387
Dude.

297
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,889
I know.

298
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,573
-Dude, what are we doing here?
-Yeah, I know.

299
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,158
Guys, seriously, it's gonna get...

300
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,076
...broken up, like,
any second now, right?

301
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,288
Guys?

302
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,969
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Sorry.

303
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,275
Go.

304
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,987
-So, what do you wanna do?
-Let's just chill.

305
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,864
Hi, guys.

306
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,953
-Is this your party?
-No, it's a friend of mine's.

307
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,580
-I'm Hunter.
-Danielle.

308
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,582
This is Matthew.

309
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,085
-Hey, Matt, what's up?
-What's up?

310
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,254
Can I get you something
to drink?

311
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,172
-Yeah.
-Hey, man, what's up?

312
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,174
-Can you come here for a second?
-Yeah.

313
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:56,468
No, it's cool. They're pals.

314
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:58,679
What's up?

315
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,473
Yeah, man, this party's
getting kind of full, bro.

316
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:05,060
-Yeah, so?
-So you're gonna have to take off.

317
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,688
-Really?
-Yeah.

318
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,276
Okay, but I'm with her.
I mean--

319
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,486
Oh, it's cool, dude.
She's taken care of.

320
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,492
There's the door.

321
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,768
Yo, man!

322
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,354
When's Samsung getting here?

323
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:52,191
-Samnang.
-Yeah!

324
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,276
I love him.

325
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:58,655
Dude, I'm gonna do that little
guy when he gets here.

326
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,657
Hard.

327
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,286
Cool, dude.
I'm sure he'll like that.

328
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,663
Sam Young!

329
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,169
Excuse me.

330
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:30,854
-Dude.
-I know.

331
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,688
-What?
-You're coming with me. Right now.

332
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,567
Everybody out. Let's move.

333
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:25,492
I said out, minions! Move! Move!
Faster, you little maggots.

334
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,956
-So how's everything going?
-Fine.

335
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,792
Is everything, you know,
okay at home?

336
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,752
All right, what?

337
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,088
Perhaps you should have a seat.

338
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:40,757
Perhaps you should bite me.

339
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,968
Perhaps.

340
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,472
Matthew...

341
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,684
...we live in a crazy,
mixed-up world.

342
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:54,271
Crazy, but, oh, so beautiful.

343
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,458
Excellent, grasshopper.

344
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,253
And now for the final task
of your training.

345
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,469
You're gonna need a harder piece
of wood than that, cowboy.

346
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,681
-That's not her.
-Yeah, it is.

347
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,485
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

348
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,872
Matt! Matt! Dude, you're
missing the best part.

349
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,085
Fuck! Fuck!

350
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,880
Settle down, tiger.
I know. I know.

351
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,174
It's not funny.
Seriously, get away from me.

352
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,760
-Dude, don't mess this up.
-Mess what up?

353
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,554
Matt, she's a porn star,
okay?

354
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:11,557
Take her to a motel room
and bang her like a beast.

355
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,559
Eli, I like this girl.

356
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,562
And you can still like her
with your penis inside her.

357
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,356
I'm telling you,
you're gonna regret this.

358
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,775
What would JFK do?
You know he'd tap that ass.

359
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,986
Eli, I'm never gonna
see her again.

360
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,362
Oh, you know what? Fine.

361
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:26,989
-Fine.
-Fine!

362
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,991
Goddamn it, Matt.

363
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:32,160
I swear to God, if you don't
fuck her, I'll kill myself!

364
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:38,292
Matt, please. Please, Matt.
Fuck her for me. For me!

365
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,764
-Oh, Marci, you're so funny.
-Oh, thanks.

366
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,353
-I just saw you naked.
-What?

367
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,064
Don't worry, honey,
you were only 2 days old.

368
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,483
-Let's see what else we have.
-Why are you here?

369
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,068
I just came here to say hi.

370
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,654
Hi.

371
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,364
Look at this one of him.

372
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,791
Hey, buddy.

373
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,253
-That one's the best.
-It is. He looks so adorable.

374
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,589
He looks really--
Oh, that's such a good one.

375
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,467
-Here you go, Danielle.
-Oh, thanks.

376
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,685
-Thattagirl.
-This is a cute one.

377
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,687
Oh, who's your daddy?

378
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,358
So you were going to school
in Los Angeles?

379
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:47,361
For a while. But then I started
working on other things.

380
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,780
Oh, what kind of things?

381
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,283
Let me show you.

382
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,877
Jesus!

383
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,884
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I don't know, I....

384
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,178
I don't feel so good.

385
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,352
What can I do to make you
feel better?

386
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,160
I think I'm feeling
a lot better now.

387
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,372
-We can go out another night.
-No, we're going out tonight.

388
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,292
-You sure?
-Positive.

389
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:50,090
-I don't know if I can do this.
-Yes, you can.

390
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,051
But tonight, be the man.

391
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:56,763
First off, act like
you don't even like her.

392
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,558
-Hey.
-Hey.

393
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:04,354
Second, get her drunk.
Really drunk, okay?

394
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,191
That way the true porn star
will come out in her.

395
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,989
Here, I... I got us something.

396
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,077
Bourbon?

397
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:22,581
-Are you trying to get me drunk?
-No, what?

398
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,668
-I thought you like to rock.
-"Like to rock?"

399
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,755
Last and most important...

400
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,257
...always be touching her,
Matt.

401
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,052
That tells her you came here
to get down tonight.

402
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:40,891
What are we doing?

403
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,977
Just chilling.

404
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,983
Hey, look.

405
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:51,777
MOTEL
Glen Capri

406
00:35:54,571 --> 00:36:00,285
Maybe we should get a room.

407
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,788
Okay.

408
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,755
Here it is.

409
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,652
This is-- This is really nice.

410
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,988
TV.

411
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,865
Air conditioner.

412
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,993
Got a little lamp there.

413
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,954
Is that Monet?

414
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,668
What?

415
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,380
-What are you thinking?
-What are you thinking?

416
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,676
I don't know.

417
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:09,563
Do you wanna fuck me?

418
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,281
Come here.

419
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,175
How do you want me?

420
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,386
Why are you doing this?

421
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,264
What?

422
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,558
This.

423
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,854
Isn't this what you want?

424
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,274
To fuck a porn star
in a cheap motel room?

425
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,865
So this is what
you think of me.

426
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,286
-Danielle, wait. I'm sorry.
-Let me guess.

427
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,080
You saw a tape,
and you thought:

428
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:10,582
"What the hell?
She does it for a living, right?"

429
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,086
-Eli told me to do it.
-Oh, now that's a mature response.

430
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,464
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-Because I didn't want to, okay?

431
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,262
Because I loved the way
you looked at me.

432
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:28,058
God, do you have
any idea how--?

433
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,978
Forget it.

434
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,690
-Hold on.
-Fuck you.

435
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,956
ONLY 9 DAYS LEFT!
SAMNANG

436
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,754
You're done.

437
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,262
WHY DO I DESERVE
THIS SCHOLARSHIP?

438
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:27,659
Look, I'm an idiot, okay?
I saw the tape, and I freaked out.

439
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,662
Hi. I'm coming in.
Can I come in?

440
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,082
Look, I've just
been crazy lately.

441
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:37,669
I mean, the whole scholarship
thing, you know, I mean....

442
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,463
It's killing me, you know?

443
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:42,466
But I'm not even
thinking about that.

444
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:47,054
The only thing I care about
is you, you know?

445
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,890
All I want is just for us
to go back to normal again.

446
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:53,185
It's a real nice place
you got here, D.

447
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,188
I...

448
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:09,952
Can we...

449
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,455
-...talk about this later?
-Yeah.

450
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,376
Sure.

451
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,561
I like that.

452
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:39,273
-What?
-What you said in there.

453
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,066
Thanks.

454
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,865
Kelly.

455
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,492
Matthew.

456
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,791
-So you're friends with D, huh?
-Yeah.

457
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:02,087
Well, we're-
We're kind of going out.

458
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:09,469
Look at you.
You are a forest fire.

459
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,889
-Are we going?
-Yeah.

460
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,765
You coming with us?

461
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:16,560
-Where are you going?
-Can't. He's got school tomorrow.

462
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,062
No, no, I'm cool.
Like, where are we going?

463
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,092
Hey, there.
What can I get for you?

464
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:51,178
We'll get two Scotch
rocks and....

465
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:55,057
Make it three. Actually, I'll
have a Long lsland iced tea.

466
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,187
So, what grade are
you in, man?

467
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,065
I'm a senior.
But I'm about to graduate.

468
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,484
Congratulations. What's next?

469
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,277
Georgetown, hopefully.

470
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,364
-Matthew wants to be president.
-Really?

471
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:12,157
-That's great, man.
-Yeah.

472
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,368
How do you
two know each other?

473
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,371
How do we know each other?

474
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:21,792
-We used to work together.
-So you're, like, an actor?

475
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,379
No. Strictly producer.

476
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:29,466
But D and I also used to go out.
Excuse me a sec.

477
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:32,678
So you guys went out?

478
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,473
Thank you.

479
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,684
Look, can we just talk?

480
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,769
Talk.

481
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:44,356
I don't know if this
is really the place.

482
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:49,152
-Why? What's wrong with it?
-No, nothing. It's fine, you know.

483
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,363
It's one of my favorites.

484
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,579
Hey, you got one for me?

485
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,256
-What are you doing?
-What?

486
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,966
Here.

487
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,761
And you turn it like so:

488
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:25,564
-Hey, where are you going?
-The bathroom. Is that okay?

489
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,566
Yeah.

490
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:33,280
So you're really into her,
huh?

491
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:37,576
Hey. I get it, man, believe me.
She's gorgeous.

492
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,370
I just think you'd want
someone more your age.

493
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:45,375
-She's my age.
-Yeah, I meant experience-wise.

494
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,252
No offense.

495
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:51,089
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna take care of you.

496
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,385
Oh, my God.
That's Mr. Peterson.

497
00:43:55,552 --> 00:44:56,655
That's my dad's
friend.

498
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:58,889
He comes over all
the time with his wife.

499
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:00,682
Really?

500
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:01,892
Hey, Peterson.

501
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:05,270
What? Dude,
what are you doing, man?

502
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,981
Yeah, you. Get over here.

503
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:12,486
Goddamn, Peterson, haven't
seen your black ass in ages.

504
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,781
-Do I know you?
-What the fuck's your problem?

505
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,493
-I....
-Just fucking with you, man.

506
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:23,163
Hey, you know my friend
Matty here, right?

507
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:32,464
-Matthew. Hi.
-Peterson, this is Matty's first time.

508
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:35,676
Why don't you buy him a dance.

509
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:44,476
So did you hear about
that scholarship yet?

510
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,564
No, big dinner's on Thursday.

511
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,864
So, what's it for again?

512
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,157
The scholarship.

513
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,369
It's for...

514
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,663
...moral fiber.

515
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:10,377
Me? A Teenage Daddy?

516
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:13,088
Who is this guy?
Is he a porn producer?

517
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:15,257
Klitz, shut up.
Now, the strippers.

518
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,760
When you get a lap dance, were they
cool with you grabbing their ass?

519
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,054
Dude. I'm trying to talk
about Danielle here.

520
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,891
Fine. Selfish bitch.

521
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:27,978
For teenagers, sexual intercourse
can be dangerous.

522
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,771
Jesus, what hack made this?

523
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,858
I could make a better sex-ed
film with my mom.

524
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,860
Why don't they update this thing?

525
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,362
Special events,
such as your senior prom...

526
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:40,657
...place added pressure on young
teens to lose their virginity...

527
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,368
...and also engage
in unprotected sex.

528
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,370
9 months later...

529
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,790
-Hello?
-Hey, Bob.

530
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,167
We're all going
to the creek tonight.

531
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:53,170
It's gonna be a gas.
You're coming, right?

532
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:55,380
I can't, guys.

533
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:59,468
I have a baby now.

534
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:03,180
Because of prom.

535
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,182
Dude.

536
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:10,187
-What?
-Yeah, right.

537
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,775
-You guys ever thought about it?
-No.

538
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,362
I just think you guys
would be really hot.

539
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:20,364
-You girls are 18, right?
-I am.

540
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,574
-I will be in a month.
-Really?

541
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,160
-You ever been photographed?
-A couple of times.

542
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:27,788
Hey, you guys know Matty?

543
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:30,874
I hung with him last night.
Guy's the tits.

544
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,669
Here's my man.

545
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:37,256
-How you doing?
-What's up, fellas?

546
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:43,053
Matty, you didn't tell me
you got some serious burners...

547
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:44,263
...at your school here.

548
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,265
Oh, shut up.
You did not say that

549
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:49,268
Hey, you know who's got
the killer bud?

550
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,772
This fucker right here.

551
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:57,568
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah, come on.

552
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,570
Yeah, you have some?

553
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,280
Yeah, come on.

554
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:04,283
-Holy shit.
-You guys should party.

555
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,577
-Can I--?
-All right, we're out.

556
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,954
-Hold on a sec.
-Where are you guys going?

557
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:11,290
-We got things to do.
-Do you wanna hang out?

558
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:15,252
-Hop in, fellas.
-Aren't you gonna photograph us?

559
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,965
Always leave
them wanting more.

560
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,967
Punch it!

561
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,986
Man, there is
some talent here.

562
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:44,573
You get those girls together
with those ass-bags there...

563
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:47,075
...shoot them humping at,
like, a football...

564
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,578
...game or at a prom,
that video would sell.

565
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,788
Fuck, I'm good!

566
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,168
How do I get these ideas?
It's like a gift, you know?

567
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:57,878
It's like I can't control it.

568
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:05,469
So, what are we doing, man?

569
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,683
You know, you really didn't
have to come with me.

570
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:15,562
It's cool.
I like running errands.

571
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,192
So you raised 25 G's just
to bring this Chinese guy over.

572
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:22,569
No, he's Cambodian.

573
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:26,365
Okay, so that's 25,000
total deposited...

574
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:29,159
...into the Operation
Get Samnang account.

575
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:31,870
Hey, so you raised
all the money you needed.

576
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,664
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

577
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:36,083
So is this Samnang
really as smart as they say?

578
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:39,086
Well, he did teach himself
calculus without even using...

579
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,671
..his textbooks, so....

580
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:44,758
Those crazy little fuckers, man.
They sure know their numbers.

581
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:50,973
Jeannie, this is my--
This is my student advisor.

582
00:48:50,180 --> 00:49:03,569
They really compliment
your coloring.

583
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:53,559
Oh, you're Mr. Salinger?

584
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:57,354
Just here to make sure
everything's up to par. Wow.

585
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,566
-What?
-I love those earrings.

586
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:01,066
Oh, thank you.

587
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:05,654
Thanks. I just got back
from Cabo.

588
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:07,364
-Did you?
-Yeah.

589
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:10,367
Okay, well, we gotta go.
Thanks, Jeannie.

590
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,787
Man, what were you doing--?

591
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,081
There's a bar,
you sit with the people.

592
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:17,082
You have been there.

593
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,376
-See? I knew it.
-No, no.

594
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:22,671
-This guy is unbelievable.
-You.

595
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,683
-Where you guys going?
-Vegas, baby.

596
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:39,855
We got the convention. Gotta press
the flesh, meet the fans.

597
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,983
So that's it?
You're just going back?

598
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:45,152
I don't belong here.

599
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,989
What do you--? What do you mean?
What about starting over?

600
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:50,991
This is what I am.

601
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:57,372
All right, D, let's roll.

602
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:18,852
-Dude, it's not your fault.
-No, it is my fault.

603
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,481
If I hadn't been such a dick and
taken her to that motel room....

604
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,067
Yeah, it was a little forward,
don't you think?

605
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,653
-Dude.
-What?

606
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,572
Matt, the point is,
she made her decision.

607
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:33,492
There's nothing
you can do about it now.

608
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,165
Yeah, there is.

609
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:48,882
-Hey, Dad?
-Don't wait up.

610
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:51,385
-I'll be late tonight.
-I'll watch it tomorrow.

611
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:54,763
-Shark Week is all week long.
-God, I just wanna bang hot chicks.

612
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:13,073
LAS VEGAS WELCOMES
THE ADULT FILM CONVENTION

613
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,856
-Move it.
-Sorry.

614
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,066
Big smile.

615
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,154
-Sasha!
-Sasha!

616
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:01,788
-Yo, man, no press.
-No, no. No, I'm not press.

617
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,665
I'm still in high school,
okay?

618
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,667
This is for my high school
video yearbook.

619
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,169
I swear to God.

620
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,174
That's right, bitch.

621
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,057
Jesus, is that her?

622
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,558
Athena.

623
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,081
Give me a second, guys.

624
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,958
-Athena!
-Athena!

625
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,460
-Danielle.
-Athena! Athena!

626
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,754
-Danielle.
-Come on! Athena, right here!

627
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:54,383
-Work it, Athena.
-You are so hot, Athena.

628
00:52:57,177 --> 00:53:01,473
-Look, I'm sorry. I had to come.
-Asshole, I'm next.

629
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:05,185
-I feel like this is all my fault.
-Who is this guy?

630
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:09,982
-Will you at least look at me?
-Bend over.

631
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,693
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me, okay?

632
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,778
-Me too!
-Oh, Danielle.

633
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,864
He's so sweet.

634
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,869
Danielle.

635
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,580
Nice job, dickwad.

636
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,457
-Danielle.
-Hey, man, get me out of this thing.

637
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,293
-Take me with you, dude.
-Danielle.

638
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,087
Just leave me alone, please.

639
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:34,464
Danielle.

640
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:39,386
-Danielle, Danielle.
-Hugo, hi.

641
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,055
Look at you.
You look fantastic.

642
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,477
Just starting out,
and everyone knows your name.

643
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:49,188
No, they don't.

644
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:51,773
-So how's Kelly treating you?
-Okay.

645
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,984
Just okay?

646
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,361
Danielle, what do we know?

647
00:53:57,154 --> 00:54:00,991
What do we know? We know
that you should be with me.

648
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:05,162
At the top.
Where the air is crisp.

649
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,372
-Nice tan.
-Kelly.

650
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:10,459
-What do we say?
-Fuck you.

651
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,754
Always with the big words.

652
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:17,674
Danielle,
where the air is crisp.

653
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:22,679
-What does that mean?
-Nothing. He's just being Hugo.

654
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,974
Matty. What are you doing here?

655
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:31,271
Look, Kelly, no offense, but I
really don't think Danielle...

656
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,856
...wants to be here right now.

657
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,989
Matthew, please just go home,
okay?

658
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,785
Hey, D.

659
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:49,790
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

660
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,587
What's up?

661
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,590
It's not cute anymore.

662
00:54:58,757 --> 00:55:00,968
-What?
-Stop filling her head with that--

663
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:04,680
-Do not piss me off.
-Hey, I thought we were friends.

664
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,267
Friends don't fuck
with each other's business.

665
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,353
And that's what this is,
my fucking business.

666
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,858
What?

667
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,152
What are you gonna do?

668
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:27,452
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Stay the fuck away from her.

669
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:34,084
Matt, seriously, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

670
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:37,754
What about your thing tomorrow?
Okay, the scholarship dinner?

671
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,091
Sorry, I gotta do this.

672
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,184
Oh, by the way, if things get
bad, just bolt, okay?

673
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,352
What? What do you mean,
"if things get bad"?

674
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,854
Just bolt.

675
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:55,480
Wait, what's he
talking about?

676
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:02,070
You wanna get me a drink?
No, I'm just kidding.

677
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:15,667
Hi.

678
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:22,758
Dude...

679
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:24,593
...am I ugly?

680
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:29,389
What? No. No, man,
you're fine. Just relax.

681
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,391
No, I'm ugly. I know it.

682
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,189
-So, what do you guys do?
-I get freaky.

683
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:42,486
-We're directors.
-Really?

684
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,781
Would you guys ever wanna
use me in one of your movies?

685
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,784
Hell, yeah, we'll use you.

686
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:52,955
Baby, I'll do things to you
I wouldn't do to a farm animal.

687
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,959
-What the fuck did you just say?
-Honey. These guys are directors.

688
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,878
-And they wanna use me.
-Use you?

689
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,881
Guys, this is my boyfriend,
Mule.

690
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,386
Hi, Mule.

691
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:12,975
Let's do it.

692
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,354
Man, you gotta use my girl, bro.
She's so good.

693
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,273
I am. I really am.

694
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:23,068
-You wanna give her a throw?
-Yeah, try me out.

695
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,071
No, you know, no, I'm okay,
though, thank you.

696
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,866
Well, come on.
At least feel her tits.

697
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:32,286
I'm okay. I can't.
Thank you, though.

698
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,873
Fuck it. I'll feel one.

699
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,468
We're all set for tomorrow.

700
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:52,472
Athena will be there,
ready to shoot. Right, babe?

701
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:57,769
Not bad, huh?
Suckers cost me 6 grand.

702
00:57:57,978 --> 00:58:01,481
Yo, Mule, what the hell
are you doing?

703
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:06,653
Steel, check it out, man.
These guys are directors.

704
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,280
Man, these punks ain't
directors.

705
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:11,283
They're in high school,
you idiot.

706
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,454
Okay, here's the thing--

707
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,464
Oh, shit!

708
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:30,177
-Come on, Klitz, come on.
-Get off.

709
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:41,980
Matty, time to go, time to go.
Time to go.

710
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:44,274
-What happened?
-It got bad. Bolt. Bolt!

711
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:46,777
-Dude, wait up.
-Fuck you, dude!

712
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:55,369
Excuse me.

713
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:58,664
I just wanna let you know,
I know who you really are.

714
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,961
And you're better than this.

715
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:42,958
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM....

716
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,086
Yeah?

717
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:54,761
Need a ride to school?

718
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:02,853
It's all you now. I mean,
now you can do whatever you want.

719
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,856
Why do you believe
in me so much?

720
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,775
I don't know. Maybe I'm stupid.

721
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:17,284
-Good luck tonight.
-Thanks.

722
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:20,662
-Bye.
-Bye.

723
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,055
Will you go to prom with me?

724
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,184
What?

725
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:49,858
I would love to.

726
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:56,573
Now for the scientific
explanation. Anybody?

727
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,575
JOHN F. KENNEDY once said:
ASK NOT....

728
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:03,163
That's your speech?

729
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:05,666
Yeah.

730
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,252
You ready for tonight?

731
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:11,672
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're gonna be great.

732
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:13,966
I have to be.

733
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,188
That bitch can't just
run away because...

734
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,065
...she don't wanna fuck
on film anymore.

735
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:31,984
May I help you?

736
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:36,363
-Get up.
-Okay, okay.

737
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,082
Stay in school.

738
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:53,589
Look, I have the most important
dinner of my life tonight...

739
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,257
...so wherever we're going,
you know...

740
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:57,259
...we just have to be
home by 6.

741
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:59,678
Just so you know.

742
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,891
Here he comes.

743
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,478
-It's a cool ride, huh?
-Yeah, if you're a fag.

744
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:11,773
-Jesus!
-It's cool, it's cool.

745
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,775
Get in.

746
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,790
-Where are we going?
-I thought you were cool, man.

747
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,084
I tried to be your friend,
and what do you do?

748
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:32,961
-You fuck me.
-I didn't fuck you.

749
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,672
She didn't show up on set
because of what you said.

750
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,382
Now I'm out 30 grand.

751
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:42,679
-Guess who's paying me back.
-What? I don't have 30 grand.

752
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:45,682
-Get your folks to help.
-They don't have that kind of money.

753
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:51,688
Look, Kelly, I'm a problem solver,
all right? This is what I do. Okay?

754
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:55,984
Let's just-- Let's just think
outside of the box here.

755
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,654
Look, she'll get a job,
I'll keep mowing...

756
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:01,365
...lawns, and over time
we'll pay it down.

757
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,284
You know? This can work.
We can do this.

758
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:06,870
It'll be like a payment plan.

759
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,381
-You really care about her, huh?
-Yeah, I really do.

760
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:21,093
Yeah, I don't know. If I'm gonna
do this payment-plan thing...

761
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,554
...I need a show of good faith,
you know?

762
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:27,266
-Something concrete.
-Well, like what?

763
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:30,769
A blowjob.

764
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:35,357
No. I told you she's not gonna
do that anymore.

765
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:38,277
Who said anything about her?

766
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,993
Yeah, we're definitely
outside the box now, huh?

767
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:51,290
Now, you gotta ask yourself,
how far are you willing to go?

768
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:56,170
How much do you
really care about her?

769
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:02,968
I'm joking, man.

770
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:06,972
Relax.

771
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:11,560
-Damn. Do I look gay to you?
-No, but, Jesus--

772
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,986
You wanna be president?

773
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,488
Let me tell you the first
rule of politics:

774
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:27,951
Always know if the juice
is worth the squeeze.

775
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,163
You know what that means?
It means you don't steal my girl...

776
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,790
...unless you're ready
to accept the consequences.

777
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:41,757
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

778
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,679
That's gonna swell up like
a bitch. Here, take this.

779
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,353
I'm telling you,
it's gonna hurt like shit.

780
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:06,573
I'm sorry I got upset.
I felt taken advantage of.

781
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,577
Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.
I know she loves you.

782
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,080
I'm gonna leave you guys alone.

783
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,374
But now you're doing
something for me.

784
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:28,554
Remember that ass-bag, Hugo,
from the convention?

785
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,056
We used to be partners
a long time ago.

786
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,268
One day, I had this killer
idea to make films set...

787
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:35,269
...in real-life situations.

788
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,564
You know, Real World porn.

789
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:41,775
I told the idea to Hugo.
He says he'll think about it.

790
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,986
And what does
that motherfucker do?

791
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:47,781
Takes my best girl, starts
his own company with my idea...

792
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:50,367
...and the guy makes millions.

793
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:51,785
It's not the money
that pisses me off.

794
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:54,079
I mean, fuck,
it does piss me off...

795
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:56,290
...but that's not it.
It's the perception.

796
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:59,293
Everybody thinks Hugo's
the genius. It was my idea.

797
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:03,255
It's like he's Simon,
and I'm Garfunkel.

798
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:08,385
Look at me, man.
I'm fucking Garfunkel.

799
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:16,476
-Look, seriously, I can't do this.
-Don't be a pussy. Nobody's home.

800
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:24,860
-Why do you want this thing so bad?
-Because it should've been mine.

801
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:27,487
-I'll grab it and leave.
-You don't understand...

802
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,573
...l have to be at
a dinner in an hour.

803
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,575
My whole life depends on it.

804
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:33,452
You want me out
of Danielle's life?

805
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:34,870
Yes, I do.

806
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,581
-Then let's go.
-But wait, seriously.

807
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,875
Sometimes, if you wanna do
something good...

808
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,960
...you gotta do
something bad.

809
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,463
Yeah, but this is breaking
and entering.

810
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,090
This is politics.

811
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,888
Hey.

812
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,891
After this, we're cool, okay?

813
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,479
You're all right, man.

814
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:29,967
Yes.

815
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:31,969
I'd like to report a robbery.

816
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:43,564
AVN BEST PICTURE 1999
"CHITTY CHITTY GANG BANG"

817
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,065
HUGO POSH PRODUCER

818
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:48,485
Bang me.

819
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:52,155
Cradle the balls.

820
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,379
Stop! Stop! Help me!

821
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:10,174
Help! Oh, fuck!

822
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,471
Wait!

823
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,056
Come on!

824
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:39,077
Okay, so what time
does the dinner start?

825
01:08:39,286 --> 01:08:40,579
Six o'clock.

826
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,665
-Why? What time is it now?
-6:30.

827
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:46,251
-Oh, my God.
-Dude, don't worry, all right?

828
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,754
We'll get there.
You know what? Try and--

829
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:52,758
-Dude, what are you doing?
-I don't know. I just...

830
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,677
...feel so good.

831
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,480
Oh, my God.

832
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:10,192
I just feel so weird.

833
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,653
Don't worry.
Ecstasy is not that bad.

834
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:15,864
-What?
-Kelly likes dosing people with E.

835
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,493
Oh, my God. Am I gonna die?

836
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,664
No, no, no. It's okay, Matt.
You're gonna be fine. I promise.

837
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:27,584
You're such a good friend, Klitzy.
I love you.

838
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,962
I love you so much.

839
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,257
This is gonna be amazing.

840
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:36,552
Wait a second.

841
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,679
Oh, my God.

842
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,889
WELCOME TO THE SHERIDAN
SCHOLARSHIP BANQUET

843
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,978
You don't understand. It's
really kicking in right now.

844
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,355
Just try not to talk
so much, okay?

845
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,357
Talk so much?
I'm giving a speech.

846
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:52,693
-It's okay. Just go with it.
-Wait, wait.

847
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,777
In a few minutes, we'll begin
the speeches, and we hope....

848
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,664
Thank you again
for coming to what...

849
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:08,667
...promises to be a
very eventful evening.

850
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,880
Matthew Kidman?

851
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:18,468
My competition.

852
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:21,972
-Hey, what's up, Ryan?
-Jesus, what happened to you?

853
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:24,683
Just living life, my man.

854
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,852
Mina, how are you?

855
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,979
Okay. Just a little nervous.

856
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:31,481
But you're a little temptress,
though, aren't you?

857
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,574
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

858
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,785
Hey. Thanks a lot,
thanks a lot.

859
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,354
Hey, there's the big daddy.

860
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:13,190
Matthew, what has been
going on with you?

861
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:15,067
Some serious shit.

862
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:18,153
But, Jesus, man,
it's good to see you.

863
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:20,781
Will you excuse us, please?

864
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:23,784
Oh, my God.
Am I blowing it?

865
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:25,786
Just try and control yourself.

866
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:29,289
-Just breathe, okay?
-All right.

867
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:36,672
I have learned a lot
from my teachers.

868
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:41,176
But my best teacher
has always been my mother...

869
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:44,054
...a woman who worked three
jobs trying to support me...

870
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:46,390
...ever since
I was a little nia.

871
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:49,560
I will never forget the day
she said to me:

872
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,566
And that is why I have always
tried to answer the call...

873
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:57,484
...of the great
John F. Kennedy...

874
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,280
...who urged us to
"Ask not what your country"--

875
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:12,791
Let's see here....

876
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:15,169
I can't speak a
foreign language...

877
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,670
...so that's out.

878
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:20,757
And I-- I certainly
can't quote J.F.K. now...

879
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:23,468
...can I, Ryan? You know what?

880
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,763
It's funny, I have this whole
speech prepared...

881
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:29,474
...and I've been
practicing for weeks...

882
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,560
...but you know what?

883
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,270
I'm just gonna go with it.

884
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:38,984
Moral fiber.

885
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,778
So, what is moral fiber?
I mean....

886
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:45,365
It's funny, I used to think
it was always telling the truth...

887
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,159
...doing good deeds.

888
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,786
You know, basically
being a fucking Boy Scout.

889
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,957
But lately, I've been seeing
it differently.

890
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:57,377
Now I think that moral
fiber's about...

891
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:59,880
...finding that one thing
you really care about.

892
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:02,591
That one special thing
that means more...

893
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:05,052
...to you than anything
else in the world.

894
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:08,180
And when you find her...

895
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:12,684
...you fight for her.
You risk it all.

896
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:17,064
...your future, your life...

897
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:17,064
You put her in front of
everything...

898
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:18,857
...all of it.

899
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:23,487
And maybe the stuff you do
to help her isn't so clean.

900
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,864
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

901
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,285
Because in your
heart you know...

902
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,163
...that the juice
is worth the squeeze.

903
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:38,085
That's what moral
fiber's all about.

904
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,570
First, I'd just like to commend
the candidates on...

905
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:06,864
...their impressive remarks.

906
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:11,159
This year was a
very tough decision.

907
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:15,873
And as much as we'd love to give
you all scholarships, we can't.

908
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:19,585
And so I am proud to announce
the winner...

909
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,879
...of this year's
Sheridan scholarship:

910
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:29,970
Ryan Winger.

911
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,554
Oh, God, what happened?

912
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,390
Yeah, I slipped.

913
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:18,185
Listen, Jeannie,
Samnang's coming on Monday.

914
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,771
-I know. How exciting.
-Yeah.

915
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:22,981
So I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

916
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,775
What do you mean?

917
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,486
I mean I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

918
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:30,489
-But it's already closed.
-What are you talking about?

919
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,659
Your teacher came by yesterday
and cleared out the account.

920
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:35,160
Who? What-- What teacher?

921
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,079
Your student advisor.
Mr. Salinger.

922
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:39,081
The one you were
with the other day.

923
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:42,668
Mr. Salinger? What are you--?

924
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:54,763
Cambodia

925
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,558
Samnang, what's wrong, my son?

926
01:15:57,975 --> 01:16:00,060
That Matthew Kidman.

927
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:05,357
He fucked me, Mom.
He fucked me so bad.

928
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:07,192
Son of a bitch.

929
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:11,780
Oh, my God.

930
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,866
-What's wrong?
-Jeannie...

931
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:16,577
...didn't you ask
for ID or anything?

932
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:20,581
You said he was
your student advisor.

933
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:21,957
Oh, my God.

934
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:26,587
-Jeannie, where are you going?
-To get the manager.

935
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:28,380
No, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

936
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,674
Matthew, what's going on?

937
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,885
Look...

938
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:35,762
...that guy wasn't
my student advisor.

939
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:40,058
No, I know, I know.
I can get the money back.

940
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:43,979
We just need to keep this
between me and you for now, okay?

941
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:47,774
That's a great blouse, by the way.
Have you lost weight?

942
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:49,860
No? No, wait, wait.

943
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,279
Jeannie.

944
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:56,783
You think about this.
This is your fault too. Right?

945
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,578
You didn't ask for ID.
You didn't do anything.

946
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,788
And I saw you flirting
with him too...

947
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:02,956
...all right?
So unprofessional.

948
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,083
You'll lose your job
over this.

949
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,460
Don't threaten me,
you little shit.

950
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,587
I could give a fuck about you
and your rice boy.

951
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,088
I'm not getting fired.

952
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:13,175
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Just-- Please, I....

953
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,552
Just-- No one can ever
find out about this.

954
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:18,555
If this gets out, I'll be expelled.
My life will be over.

955
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:20,557
If that money isn't
back by Monday...

956
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,684
...I wouldn't worry about
being expelled.

957
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:24,478
I'd worry about going to jail.

958
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:28,273
-Jeannie....
-Hi, Jeannie.

959
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:30,275
Hi, Martin.

960
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:41,286
BANK MANAGER

961
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:00,764
Matthew, what's wrong?

962
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:04,685
Matt, is there something
you want to talk about?

963
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:07,980
Matthew, honey, what is it?

964
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:17,990
-Hi.
-Come here.

965
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:27,583
I'm in so much trouble.

966
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:43,390
I can't believe
we're even thinking about this.

967
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:49,188
Well, if you need that kind
of money by Monday....

968
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,481
Yeah-- What are we doing?

969
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:53,358
I mean, I can't get you
involved in this.

970
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:55,485
I want to do it.

971
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:57,487
Why?

972
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,491
Moral fiber.

973
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:04,077
I'm in.

974
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:05,954
You haven't heard
the whole plan yet.

975
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:07,456
Doesn't matter.

976
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:09,583
Fuck film school.

977
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:13,378
This is gonna be huge.
This is gonna be my calling card.

978
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,882
-No.
-Klitzy....

979
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,884
-No way.
-Klitz...

980
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:21,970
...you know I wouldn't ask for
this unless I really needed it.

981
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:24,681
Matt believe me,
I want to help you, but-- No.

982
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,975
-We'll get expelled and--
-Klitz, shut up.

983
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:29,478
Do me a favor, okay?

984
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:33,190
Take a look at us, okay?
Take a good look at us.

985
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,276
Do you know what we are,
the three of us?

986
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:43,367
-What?
-We're a fucking tripod.

987
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,786
-A tripod?
-Yeah.

988
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:47,788
And you know what that means?

989
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:51,667
That means that if you kick out
one of our legs, then we all fall.

990
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:55,254
Come on, baby.

991
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:01,969
Fuck.

992
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:05,681
I know it was you, Klitzy.

993
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:11,270
-Where is she?
-Oh, there they are. Hey.

994
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,274
-Hey!
-Hi, Danielle.

995
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:18,986
Hi.

996
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:20,988
-Hey, let's get our luggage!
-Yeah.

997
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:22,865
-Yeah!
-All right?

998
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:25,284
-I'll be there in a minute.
-Okay!

999
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,974
So if I pull this off,
I get the 25 grand on Sunday?

1000
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,853
Kid, you pull this off I'll
take care of your little Samsung.

1001
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,062
Samnang.

1002
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,564
Whatever.

1003
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:57,482
Have a nice prom, kid.

1004
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:04,281
-All right, minions, over here.
-Good luck.

1005
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,877
Relax, relax.

1006
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:19,087
You know what?
Go wait in the car. Go.

1007
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,677
Jesus.

1008
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:32,059
Gentlemen, these are your
prom dates, April and Ferrari.

1009
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:36,980
Ladies, we have Eli and Klitz.

1010
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:39,358
Your name is Klitz?

1011
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:41,860
With a K.

1012
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:46,073
Okay, get a two-shot. Minions.
All right, guys, get closer.

1013
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:49,868
Yeah, that's right. Show me
the love. Oh, feel it. Feel it!

1014
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,787
-Nice.
-Eli?

1015
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,289
Do those girls go to
your school?

1016
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:56,458
Actually, no.

1017
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,168
Mrs. Kidman...

1018
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:02,589
-...they're porn stars.
-Oh, yeah, right.

1019
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,857
You look....

1020
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:22,192
You-- You look really nice.

1021
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,570
Thanks.

1022
01:22:24,778 --> 01:22:27,155
You really do, hon.
You look so beautiful.

1023
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:28,782
Really?

1024
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:30,367
Thanks.

1025
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:50,888
WELCOME
TO THE SENIOR PROM

1026
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,667
What are all these cameras for?

1027
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,378
For video yearbook.

1028
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:51,156
So, what should we do?
Should we start setting up?

1029
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:54,159
Yeah, look, we just gotta
keep this low-key, okay?

1030
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:55,661
Okay. What are you gonna do?

1031
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:59,164
I'm gonna get our actors.

1032
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:05,379
-Dude, make sure they can act.
-Yeah, all right.

1033
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:08,966
-Just get out of here, okay?
-Hey, I got this taken care of.

1034
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:12,177
You just show this little lady
a good time tonight, all right?

1035
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,888
-Minions, let's move.
-Wait. So, what are we doing?

1036
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,390
Relax, relax.

1037
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,355
Come on, play it cool,
play it cool.

1038
01:24:38,662 --> 01:24:40,581
Look, they're coming to you.

1039
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:42,875
I, Matt.

1040
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,085
-What's up?
-What's up?

1041
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:49,381
-Can we talk to you for a second?
-Dude, I'm with my girl here.

1042
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:52,467
-Sorry, man.
-Should we come back?

1043
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:54,970
No, I'll leave you guys alone.

1044
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:09,067
What's up?

1045
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:11,069
Hey, man, what's up
with those girls?

1046
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:14,990
-What about them?
-Are they, like...?

1047
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:17,492
Are they porn stars?

1048
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,787
-Yeah.
-Shit.

1049
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,790
I knew I recognized them.
I knew it.

1050
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,960
-Can we meet them?
-Yeah.

1051
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:32,758
How'd you boys
like to be in a movie?

1052
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:34,760
-What are these?
-Your scripts.

1053
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:36,762
Sign the release
form at the top.

1054
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,264
Come on, you guys, wait up!

1055
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:43,560
PHOTO RELEASE

1056
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:49,066
Are these our actors?

1057
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:51,860
Just these two.

1058
01:25:52,069 --> 01:25:53,987
What about me, dude?

1059
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:57,866
Sorry, bro.
Party's all full.

1060
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:01,161
Gentlemen.

1061
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:09,461
As an artist, I want it
to come from a truthful place.

1062
01:26:10,379 --> 01:26:13,257
Holy shit.

1063
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,971
-Ferrari. Ferrari. Focus. Listen.
-Oh, okay.

1064
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:21,265
-Are we...?
-No, I can do this. Don't worry.

1065
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:23,475
Think Meryl Streep,
Sophie's Choice.

1066
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:34,278
Hey.

1067
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:35,988
Hey.

1068
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,662
Next location! Come on, move!

1069
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,456
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1070
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:55,257
-I gotta be in this.
-Shut up. Take this.

1071
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:13,358
Oh, come on! Take the pain!

1072
01:27:13,567 --> 01:27:15,068
Take the pain!
Get up. Come on!

1073
01:27:18,864 --> 01:27:20,490
May I have a word with you?

1074
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,661
-What's up?
-I found this in the hallway.

1075
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,663
Do you know what this is?

1076
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:28,582
No, what is it?

1077
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:31,084
Looks like a release
form for something.

1078
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:33,962
Yeah, I don't
know what it is.

1079
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:38,175
Have a good night.

1080
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,861
You're strong.

1081
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,571
You're firm.

1082
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:02,074
But you have a secret.

1083
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:04,284
Show that to me.

1084
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:19,675
Thank you.

1085
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,052
For what?

1086
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:24,471
I never went to prom.

1087
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,370
Excuse me, sir?

1088
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:50,372
We have a problem.

1089
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:55,252
-What's wrong?
-Derek didn't work out.

1090
01:28:55,669 --> 01:28:57,963
-What happened?
-Let's just say he wasn't strong...

1091
01:28:58,255 --> 01:28:59,965
...or firm.

1092
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,259
Guys, I can't work like this.

1093
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:04,678
Okay, relax.
We'll just get somebody else.

1094
01:29:04,887 --> 01:29:05,554
There is nobody else.

1095
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,973
I thought everyone's
dying to be in this.

1096
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:10,392
Not this scene.

1097
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,062
All right.

1098
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:16,481
This is the key scene.

1099
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,776
If we don't get this,
Hugo's not gonna buy it.

1100
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,988
Yeah, well, somebody's
gotta step up.

1101
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:26,074
-Why are you looking at me?
-Because you're doing it.

1102
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:28,577
Whoa, whoa,
Mr. I-Just-Wanna-Bang-Hot-Chicks.

1103
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,954
Here's your first chance.

1104
01:29:31,455 --> 01:29:33,373
Klitz, I can't act
and direct, okay?

1105
01:29:33,582 --> 01:29:34,958
Oh, okay, fine. I'll direct.

1106
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,752
-You're a director now?
-Yeah, I am.

1107
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,879
Okay, Spielberg,
what lens will you use?

1108
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:40,464
-It's a video camera.
-So?

1109
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:43,467
Dude, you don't need to change
the lens on a video camera.

1110
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:46,678
You know what? Take this camera
and shove it up your ass!

1111
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,555
I'll do it.

1112
01:29:51,266 --> 01:29:52,893
I'll do it.

1113
01:29:53,852 --> 01:29:56,188
You guys have been great,
but this is my mess.

1114
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,273
-I'll clean it up.
-Matt. Matt.

1115
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:00,984
Your face is gonna be in this.
Think about that.

1116
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:36,687
-Come here, baby.
-Let's....

1117
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:39,356
Picture's up, people.

1118
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,579
Are you ready, hon?

1119
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:55,080
Yeah.

1120
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:57,082
Okay, let's do this.

1121
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:07,176
And...

1122
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,886
...action.

1123
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,975
What the hell
is going on in here?

1124
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:20,355
-Nobody move!
-Oh, shit.

1125
01:31:20,564 --> 01:31:22,357
Who is in charge of this?

1126
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,777
I asked you people
a question!

1127
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:27,988
Who is in charge here?

1128
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,462
Fuck it.

1129
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:16,662
All right, everybody,
take five.

1130
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:19,081
What's wrong?

1131
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:20,958
I can't do this.

1132
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,793
What happened?

1133
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:36,890
What are you gonna do?

1134
01:32:39,393 --> 01:32:41,478
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

1135
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:47,484
No.

1136
01:32:47,693 --> 01:32:49,361
I'll do it.

1137
01:32:49,987 --> 01:32:51,655
Klitz, it's cool.
You don't have to-

1138
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,156
No, no, I'm doing it.

1139
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:55,868
Why?

1140
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,787
Because we're
a fucking tripod.

1141
01:33:00,163 --> 01:33:03,166
All right, here we go, people.
Picture's up.

1142
01:33:04,585 --> 01:33:07,588
Listen, I know this
is unprofessional...

1143
01:33:07,754 --> 01:33:09,882
...but I think
you're really cute.

1144
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:11,675
Yeah, right.

1145
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:14,678
I'm serious.

1146
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:16,972
Really cute.

1147
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:19,057
How we doing, Klitzy?

1148
01:33:20,893 --> 01:33:22,352
Fucking great, man.

1149
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:23,854
Let's do this.

1150
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:26,356
And action!

1151
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:18,784
See you guys.

1152
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,163
Good night, guys.

1153
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:29,878
So...

1154
01:34:30,087 --> 01:34:32,673
...what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

1155
01:35:48,373 --> 01:35:50,375
-Hello?
-We're dead.

1156
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:52,878
-Eli?
-Dude, the tape's not here.

1157
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:54,379
-I can't find it.
-What?

1158
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:57,758
Dude, I'm not kidding, okay?
I've looked everywhere, okay?

1159
01:35:58,091 --> 01:35:58,884
All right,
calm down.

1160
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,886
No, dude, you calm down!
It's gone!

1161
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:03,764
-What do you mean it's gone?
-I mean it's freaking gone.

1162
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,058
Somebody stole it!

1163
01:36:06,266 --> 01:36:07,559
Jesus Christ!

1164
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:09,186
Matthew, could you
come in here?

1165
01:36:14,983 --> 01:36:17,069
This is Mr. Simon.

1166
01:36:19,071 --> 01:36:22,157
He says he has something
very important to discuss with us.

1167
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:27,663
Why don't you sit down.

1168
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,585
Actually, if you don't mind...

1169
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:36,088
...may I have a word
with the boy alone first?

1170
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:39,258
Sure.

1171
01:36:48,267 --> 01:36:49,476
So how was prom?

1172
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:54,273
-That's mine.
-You know, we were fine.

1173
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:57,568
But now you go and do this?
This was my idea.

1174
01:36:57,776 --> 01:36:59,570
Now I'm really gonna
fuck your shit up.

1175
01:37:00,654 --> 01:37:02,281
I'm gonna need that back.

1176
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:07,369
Take it from me.

1177
01:37:10,956 --> 01:37:12,875
Yeah...

1178
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,085
...what are you gonna do?

1179
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:18,463
I don't have to do anything.

1180
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:20,966
Hugo Posh will.

1181
01:37:21,175 --> 01:37:24,052
Yeah, he's my partner
on this, 50-50.

1182
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:27,556
So could I please
have my tape back?

1183
01:37:27,764 --> 01:37:29,558
Fuck you!

1184
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:33,187
Fuck you.
I'm taking your half then.

1185
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:36,982
No. That money's going to Samnang.
The money you stole from him.

1186
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,569
You say that like I care.
I don't give a shit.

1187
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:42,571
You're giving me your half.

1188
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,157
And if I don't?

1189
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:47,159
Showtime.

1190
01:37:53,665 --> 01:37:56,251
-Okay.
-"Okay," what?

1191
01:37:57,878 --> 01:37:59,671
Show them the tape.

1192
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:01,673
I'm not fucking around.

1193
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,260
I just don't care anymore.

1194
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:08,680
This...

1195
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:11,475
...is gonna be interesting.

1196
01:38:15,354 --> 01:38:17,856
Dan, Marci, Mr. Salinger...

1197
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:21,193
...would you mind joining me
in the living room for a second?

1198
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,861
Great.

1199
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:33,872
Matthew, is there anything you want
to say before we watch this?

1200
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:39,878
Okay, then. On with the show.

1201
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:45,467
Hello. I'm April.

1202
01:38:45,676 --> 01:38:47,261
And I'm Ferrari.

1203
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:51,056
You may recognize us as stars of
the adult entertainment industry.

1204
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,559
And today we're taking time
out to talk about...

1205
01:38:53,684 --> 01:38:55,352
...a very important subject.

1206
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:57,062
-Sex.
-Sex.

1207
01:38:58,272 --> 01:39:00,566
Special events
such as senior prom...

1208
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:01,859
...place added pressure
on young teens...

1209
01:39:02,067 --> 01:39:05,070
...to lose their virginity
and engage in unprotected sex.

1210
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:07,656
I know I lost my virginity
at my senior...

1211
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:09,658
...prom. When'd you
lose yours, April?

1212
01:39:09,867 --> 01:39:12,870
-When I was 10.
-Moving on.

1213
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:15,581
In this video,
we'll go through.

1214
01:39:15,664 --> 01:39:17,165
...everything from kissing
to foreplay.

1215
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:21,170
And for our finale, we'll show you
how to put a condom on properly...

1216
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,589
...using a real person.

1217
01:39:23,672 --> 01:39:26,258
No cucumbers or bananas
in this video.

1218
01:39:26,466 --> 01:39:28,552
So for those of you
naughty boys...

1219
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:30,387
...expecting to see a
raunchy porn video...

1220
01:39:30,762 --> 01:39:33,891
...you might as well
turn this off now...

1221
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,767
...because you're not
gonna see sex.

1222
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:37,477
What the fuck is this shit?

1223
01:39:37,686 --> 01:39:40,480
You're gonna see sex education.

1224
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:44,276
The ELI EXPERIENCE
presents

1225
01:39:45,652 --> 01:39:48,864
ADULT EDUCATION
Sex Education for the 21st Century

1226
01:39:51,992 --> 01:39:53,952
This is interesting, Matthew.

1227
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:58,790
Yeah.

1228
01:39:58,957 --> 01:40:01,376
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea.

1229
01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:08,091
Well, you remember those
sex-ed films back in our day.

1230
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:11,970
Well, I'll tell you, if
they were anything like this...

1231
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:15,265
...we sure would've paid
more attention, don't you think?

1232
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:19,186
I think it's atrocious.

1233
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:23,482
But...

1234
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:25,484
...the hell with it.

1235
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:29,071
The kids today
are so goddamn screwed up...

1236
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:32,282
...maybe this is the only way
you can reach them.

1237
01:40:35,285 --> 01:40:37,579
You just might
have something here, Matthew.

1238
01:40:38,163 --> 01:40:39,957
I think it's pretty wild.

1239
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:43,168
This could really sell,
don't you think?

1240
01:40:44,586 --> 01:40:46,755
How'd you come up
with such an idea, Matthew?

1241
01:40:48,257 --> 01:40:49,591
What can I say?

1242
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:53,053
It's like a gift, you know?

1243
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:56,056
It's like I can't control it.

1244
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,353
We've Only.
Just Begun.

I will always remember wrestling
and the great memories we had.

I will always remember...

1252
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,669
...the three legs of
the tripod.

1253
01:41:26,086 --> 01:41:29,464
I'm here with Hugo Posh,
the producer of Adult Education...

1254
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:32,968
...the hottest-selling
sex-education video ever made...

1255
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:35,971
...being utilized in classrooms
across the globe.

1256
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:40,475
Hugo, you're known primarily as
a hard-core pornographer, correct?

1257
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:41,977
My business partner.

1258
01:41:42,186 --> 01:41:43,562
Let me break it down for you

1259
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,857
See, Hugo Posh isn't just tits.
He isn't just ass.

1260
01:41:47,983 --> 01:41:51,862
I mean, yes, he is those things,
but Hugo Posh is also heart.

1261
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:54,281
What an ass-bag.

1262
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:56,491
THE JUICE WAS
WORTH THE SQUEEZE

1263
01:41:56,992 --> 01:41:59,077
Fucking kid.

1264
01:41:59,286 --> 01:42:01,079
My student advisor.

1265
01:42:01,288 --> 01:42:03,290
All right, people.

1266
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,292
Let's make some fucky-fucky.

1267
01:42:05,459 --> 01:42:08,253
Now, Hugo, you and your partner
have made millions on this.

1268
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:10,172
So who is this silent partner?

1269
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:14,551
Well, he prefers to remain
anonymous.

1270
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:25,187
You better cure cancer, kid.

1271
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:26,980
The next Einstein.

1272
01:42:27,356 --> 01:42:29,274
All right.
Yeah, next question.

1273
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:32,486
-All right.
-Eli's calling card.

1274
01:42:32,653 --> 01:42:34,780
-How about you, buddy?
-Yeah, Mr. Brooks...

1275
01:42:34,988 --> 01:42:37,074
...why did you decide
to skip film school?

1276
01:42:37,282 --> 01:42:39,159
Don't you think you're
a little young?

1277
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:40,577
Shut the fuck up!

1278
01:42:40,786 --> 01:42:42,287
Next question! Faster!

1279
01:42:42,454 --> 01:42:44,873
I got the tape! Can you see?
I got the tape!

1280
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:48,877
For our finale,
I will now demonstrate...

1281
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:49,878
...the proper technique...

1282
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:51,672
...for putting a condom
on the real thing.

1283
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:53,590
Is my volunteer ready?

1284
01:42:53,757 --> 01:42:55,592
Klitz's big debut.

1285
01:42:55,884 --> 01:42:57,761
Shut up, shut up!
Here he is, here he is.

1286
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:08,063
Jesus, look at that guy.

1287
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:11,692
He is huge.

1288
01:43:16,363 --> 01:43:19,658
My own scholarship
to Georgetown.

1289
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,957
And of course,
I'll never forget...

1290
01:43:27,165 --> 01:43:28,458
...the girl next door.

1291
01:43:36,466 --> 01:43:38,552
As for me...

1292
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:41,763
...I'm just going with it.
