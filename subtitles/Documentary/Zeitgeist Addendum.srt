1
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,970
The more you begin to investigate 
what we think we understand,

2
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,820
where we came from, 
what we think we're doing,

3
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,420
the more you begin 
to see we've been lied to.

4
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,650
We've been lied to by every institution.

5
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,540
What makes you think for one minute 
that the religious institution

6
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,310
is the only one that's never been touched?

7
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,950
The religious institutions of this world 
are at the bottom of the dirt.

8
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,960
The religious institutions in this world 
are put there by the same people

9
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,180
who gave you your government, 
your corrupt education,

10
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,450
who set up your international banking cartels.

11
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,890
Because our masters don't give a damn 
about you or your family.

12
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,260
All they care about is 
what they have always cared about

13
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,200
and that's controlling the whole damn world.

14
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,690
We have been misled away from the true 
and divine presence in the universe

15
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,413
that men have called god.

16
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,830
I don't know what god is but I know what he isn't,

17
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,130
and unless and until you are prepared 
to look at the whole truth,

18
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,520
and wherever it may go, whoever it may lead to,

19
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,586
if you want to look the other way or if you want to play favorites,

20
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,480
then somewhere along the line you're going to find out 
you're messing with divine justice.

21
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,230
The more you educate yourself 
the more you understand where things come from

22
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,460
the more obvious things become 
and you begin to see lies everywhere.

23
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,600
You have to know the truth and seek the truth 
and the truth will set you free.

24
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,442
They must find it difficult..

25
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:58,716
Those who have taken authority as the truth,

26
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,589
Rather than truth as the authority

27
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:05,605
-G. Massey, Egyptologist

28
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,820
Because I gotta tell you the truth, folks, I gotta tell you the truth.

29
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:55,580
When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit,

30
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,860
you have to stand in oh,

31
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,850
 of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims - 

32
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
religion.

33
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,090
Think about it.

34
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:15,420
Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky

35
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,210
who watches everything you do, every minute of every day.

36
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:25,080
And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do.

37
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,260
And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire

38
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,970
and smoke and burning and torture and anguish,

39
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,930
where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry

40
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,080
forever and ever 'til the end of time!

41
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,148
But He loves you.

42
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,320
He loves you, and he needs money! He always needs money!

43
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,820
He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money!

44
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,490
Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more.

45
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,600
Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!

46
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:47,860
Part 1: The Greatest Story Ever Told

47
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,300
This is the sun.

48
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,755
As far back as 10 thousand B.C.,

49
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,540
history is abundant with carvings and writings reflecting peoples respect and adoration for this object.

50
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,077
And it is simple to understand why as every morning the sun would rise,

51
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,330
bringing vision, warmth, and security, saving man from the cold, blind,

52
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,200
predator-filled darkness of night.

53
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,780
Without it, the cultures  understood the crops would not grow, and life on the planet would not survive.

54
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,780
These realities made the sun the most adorned object of all time.

55
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,230
Likewise, they were also very aware of the stars.

56
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,510
The tracking of the stars allowed them to recognize

57
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,270
and anticipate events which occurred over long periods of time,

58
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,630
such as eclipses and full moons.

59
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,420
They in turn catalogued celestial groups into what we know today as constellations.

60
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,030
This is the cross of the Zodiac, one of the oldest conceptual images in human history.

61
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,948
It reflects the sun as it figuratively passes

62
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:11,301
through the 12 major constellations over the course of a year.

63
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,720
It also reflects the 12 months of the year, the 4 seasons, and the solstices and equinoxes.

64
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,970
The term Zodiac relates to the fact that

65
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,500
constellations were anthropomorphized, or personified, as figures, or animals.

66
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,420
In other words, the early civilizations did not just follow the sun and stars,

67
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,990
they personified them with elaborate myths involving their movements and relationships.

68
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,197
The sun, with its life-giving and life-saving qualities was personified as a representative

69
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,470
of the unseen creator or god.

70
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,630
It was known as "God's Sun," the light of the world, the savior of human kind.

71
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,240
Likewise, the 12 constellations represented places of travel for God's Sun

72
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,790
and were identified by names, usually representing

73
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,720
elements of nature that happened during that period of time.

74
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,150
For example, Aquarius, the water bearer, who brings the Spring rains.

75
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,200
This is Horus.

76
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,240
He is the Sun God of Egypt of around 3000 BC.

77
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,940
He is the sun, anthropomorphized, and his life

78
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,710
is a series of allegorical myths involving the sun's movement in the sky.

79
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,500
From the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt, we know much about this solar messiah.

80
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,670
For instance, Horus, being the sun, or the light,

81
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,160
had an enemy known as Set and Set was the personification of the darkness or night.

82
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,100
And metaphorically speaking, every morning Horus would win the battle

83
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,670
against Set - while in the evening, Set would conquer Horus and send him into the underworld.

84
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,190
It is important to note that "dark vs. light" or "good vs. evil" is one of the most ubiquitous

85
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,560
mythological dualities ever known and is still expressed on many levels to this day.

86
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,260
Broadly speaking, the story of Horus is as follows:

87
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,390
Horus was born on December 25th of the virgin Isis-Meri.

88
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,830
His birth was accompanied by a star in the east,

89
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,550
which in turn, three kings followed to locate and adorn the new-born savior.

90
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,410
At the age of 12, he was a prodigal child teacher,

91
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,520
and at the age of 30 he was baptized by a figure known as Anup and thus began his ministry.

92
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,230
Horus had 12 disciples he traveled about with,

93
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,340
performing miracles such as healing the sick and walking on water.

94
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,990
Horus was known by many gestural names such as The Truth, The Light, God's Annointed Son,

95
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,046
The Good Shepherd, The Lamb of God, and many others.

96
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:42,545
After being betrayed by Typhon, Horus was crucified, buried for 3 days, and thus, resurrected.

97
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,510
These attributes of Horus, whether original or not, seem to permeate

98
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,858
in many cultures of the world, for many other gods are found to have

99
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,253
the same general mythological structure.

100
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,730
Attis, of Phyrigia, born of the virgin Nana on December 25th, crucified, placed in a tomb

101
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,540
and after 3 days, was resurrected.

102
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,860
Krishna, of India, born of the virgin Devaki with a star in the east signaling his coming,

103
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,630
he performed miracles with his disciples, and upon his death was resurrected.

104
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,100
Dionysus of Greece, born of a virgin on December 25th, was a traveling teacher

105
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,820
who performed miracles such as turning water into wine, he was referred to as the "King of Kings,"

106
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,963
"God's Only Begotten Son," "The Alpha and Omega," and many others, and upon his death,

107
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:32,680
he was resurrected.

108
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,350
Mithra, of Persia, born of a virgin on December 25th, he had 12 disciples and performed miracles,

109
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,235
and upon his death was buried for 3 days and thus resurrected, he was also referred to as

110
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,340
"The Truth," "The Light," and many others.

111
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,460
Interestingly, the sacred day of worship of Mithra was Sunday.

112
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,360
The fact of the matter is there are numerous saviors, from different periods,

113
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,670
from all over the world, which subscribe to these general characteristics.

114
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,710
The question remains: why these attributes, why the virgin birth on December 25th,

115
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,730
why dead for three days and the inevitable resurrection, why 12 disciples or followers?

116
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,500
To find out, let's examine the most recent of the solar messiahs.

117
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,700
Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary on December 25th in Bethlehem, his birth was announced

118
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,410
by a star in the east, which three kings or magi followed to locate and adorn the new savior.

119
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,460
He was a child teacher at 12, at the age of 30 he was baptized by John the Baptist,

120
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,577
and thus began his ministry.

121
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:39,966
Jesus had 12 disciples which he traveled about with performing miracles such as healing the sick,

122
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:44,184
walking on water, raising the dead, he was also known as the "King of Kings," the "Son of God,"

123
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:47,570
the "Light of the World," the "Alpha and Omega," the "Lamb of God," and many others.

124
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,260
After being betrayed by his disciple Judas and sold for 30 pieces of silver, he was crucified,

125
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,280
placed in a tomb and after 3 days was resurrected and ascended into Heaven.

126
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:05,737
First of all, the birth sequence is completely astrological.

127
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,300
The star in the east is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, which, on December 24,

128
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,811
aligns with the 3 brightest stars in Orion's Belt.

129
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:21,900
These 3 bright stars are called today what they were called in ancient times: The Three Kings.

130
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,300
The Three Kings and the brightest star, Sirius,

131
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,738
all point to the place of the sunrise on December 25th.

132
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:34,032
This is why the Three Kings "follow" the star in the east, in order

133
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:38,590
to locate the sunrise -- the birth of the sun.

134
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:47,922
The Virgin Mary is the constellation Virgo, also known as Virgo the Virgin.

135
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:52,920
Virgo in Latin means virgin. The ancient glyph for Virgo is the altered "m".

136
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,530
This is why Mary along with other virgin mothers,

137
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,420
such as Adonis's mother Myrra, or Buddha's mother Maya begin with an M.

138
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,123
Virgo is also referred to as the House of Bread,

139
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:08,980
and the representation of Virgo is a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat.

140
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,510
This House of Bread and its symbol of wheat

141
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,420
represents August and September, the time of harvest.

142
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,520
In turn, Bethlehem, in fact, literally translates to "house of bread".

143
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,140
Bethlehem is thus a reference to the constellation Virgo, a place in the sky, not on Earth.

144
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,380
There is another very interesting phenomenon

145
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,730
that occurs around December 25th, or the winter solstice.

146
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,970
From the summer solstice to the winter solstice, the days become shorter and colder.

147
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,313
From the perspective of the northern hemisphere,

148
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,656
the sun appears to move south and get smaller and more scarce.

149
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,710
The shortening of the days and the expiration

150
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:49,750
of the crops when approaching the winter solstice symbolized the process of death to the ancients.

151
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,953
It was the death of the Sun.

152
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,260
By December 22nd, the Sun's demise was fully realized,

153
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,060
for the Sun, having moved south continually for 6 months,

154
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,562
makes it to it's lowest point in the sky.

155
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:13,040
Here a curious thing occurs: the Sun stops moving south, at least perceivably, for 3 days.

156
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,810
During this 3 day pause, the Sun resides

157
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:21,000
in the vicinity of the Southern Cross, or Crux, constellation.

158
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,550
And after this time on December 25th, the Sun

159
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:31,580
moves 1 degree, this time north, foreshadowing longer days, warmth, and Spring.

160
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,147
And thus it was said: the Sun died on the cross,

161
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:40,816
was dead for 3 days, only to be resurrected or born again.

162
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,500
This is why Jesus and numerous other Sun Gods

163
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,440
share the crucifixion, 3-day death, and resurrection concept.

164
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
It is the Sun's transition period before it shifts

165
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,900
its direction back into the Northern Hemisphere, bringing Spring, and thus salvation.

166
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,200
However, they did not celebrate the resurrection of the Sun until the spring equinox, or Easter.

167
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,759
This is because at the spring equinox,

168
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,956
the Sun officially overpowers the evil darkness, as daytime thereafter becomes longer in duration

169
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:18,229
than night, and the revitalizing conditions of spring emerge.

170
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:22,840
Now, probably the most obvious of all the astrological symbolism around Jesus

171
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,670
regards the 12 disciples.

172
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,750
They are simply the 12 constellations of the Zodiac,

173
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,310
which Jesus, being the Sun, travels about with.

174
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:38,302
In fact, the number 12 is replete throughout the Bible.

175
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:47,651
This text has more to do with astrology than anything else.

176
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,337
Coming back to the cross of the Zodiac,

177
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,850
the figurative life of the Sun,

178
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:00,720
this was not just an artistic expression or tool to track the Sun's movements.

179
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,755
It was also a Pagan spiritual symbol, the shorthand of which looked like this.

180
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,700
This is not a symbol of Christianity.

181
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,650
It is a Pagan adaptation of the cross of the Zodiac.

182
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,030
This is why Jesus in early occult art is always shown with his head on the cross,

183
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:39,640
for Jesus is the Sun, the Sun of God, the Light of the World, the Risen Savior,

184
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,050
who will "come again," as it does every morning,

185
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:51,364
the Glory of God who defends against the works of darkness, as he is "born again" every morning,

186
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:54,645
and can be seen "coming in the clouds,"

187
00:20:54,645 --> 00:21:02,848
"up in Heaven," with his "Crown of Thorns," or, sun rays.

188
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,810
Now, of the many astrological-astronomical metaphors in the Bible, one of the most important

189
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,990
has to do with the ages.

190
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,440
Throughout the scripture there are numerous references to the "Age."

191
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,770
In order to understand this,

192
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:27,060
we need to be familiar with the phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes.

193
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,880
The ancient Egyptians along with cultures long before them recognized that approximately

194
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,870
every 2150 years the sunrise on the morning

195
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,350
of the spring equinox would occur at a different sign of the Zodiac.

196
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,960
This has to do with a slow angular wobble that the Earth maintains as it rotates on it's axis.

197
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,420
It is called a precession because the constellations go backwards,

198
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,680
rather than through the normal yearly cycle.

199
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,296
The amount of time that it takes for the precession to go through all 12 signs

200
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:59,120
is roughly 25,765 years.

201
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,590
This is also called the "Great Year," and ancient societies were very aware of this.

202
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,237
They referred to each 2150 year period as an "age."

203
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:16,697
From 4300 B.C. to 2150 B.C., it was the Age of Taurus, the Bull.

204
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:21,464
From 2150 B.B. to 1 A.D., it was the Age of Aries, the Ram

205
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:25,700
and from 1 A.D. to 2150 A.D. it is the Age of Pisces,

206
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,490
the age we are still in to this day.

207
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,380
And in and around 2150, we will enter the new age.

208
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,670
The Age of Aquarius.

209
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,544
Now, the Bible reflects, broadly speaking, a symbolic movement through 3 ages,

210
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:43,644
while foreshadowing a 4th.

211
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:48,372
In the Old Testament when Moses comes down Mount Sinai with the 10 Commandments,

212
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:52,890
he is very upset to see his people worshiping a golden bull calf.

213
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
In fact, he shattered the stone tablets

214
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,880
and instructed his people to kill each other in order to purify themselves.

215
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,530
Most Biblical scholars would attribute this anger

216
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,370
to the fact that the Israelites were worshiping a false idol, or something to that effect.

217
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,710
The reality is that the golden bull

218
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,930
is Taurus the Bull, and Moses represents the new Age of Aries the Ram.

219
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,440
This is why Jews even today still blow the Ram's horn.

220
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,650
Moses represents the new Age of Aries, and upon the new age, everyone must shed the old age.

221
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,856
Other deities mark these transitions as well, such as Mithra

222
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:34,358
a pre-Christian god who kills the bull, in the same symbology.

223
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:39,215
Now Jesus is the figure who ushers in the age following Aries,

224
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:42,327
the Age of Pisces, or the Two Fish.

225
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,460
Fish symbolism is very abundant in the New Testament,

226
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,380
as Jesus feeds 5000 people with bread and "2 fish."

227
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:58,358
When he begins his ministry walking along Galilei, he befriends 2 fishermen, who follow him.

228
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,920
And I think we've all seen the Jesus-fish on the backs of people's cars.

229
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,586
Little do they know what it actually means.

230
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:13,710
It is a Pagan astrological symbolism for the Sun's Kingdom during the Age of Pisces.

231
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:19,740
Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is essentially the start of this age.

232
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,580
At Luke 22:10 when Jesus is asked by his disciples

233
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,530
where the next passover will be after he is gone, Jesus replies:

234
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,210
"Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there

235
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:39,020
shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water... follow him into the house where he entereth in."

236
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,660
This scripture is by far one of the most revealing of all the astrological references.

237
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,900
The man bearing a pitcher of water is Aquarius,

238
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,110
the water-bearer, who is always pictured as a man pouring out a pitcher of water.

239
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,090
He represents the age after Pisces,

240
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,840
and when the Sun (God's Sun) leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus),

241
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,910
it will go into the House of Aquarius,

242
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,160
as Aquarius follows Pisces in the precession of the equinoxes.

243
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,550
All Jesus is saying is that after the Age of Pisces will come the Age of Aquarius.

244
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:21,253
Now, we have all heard about the end times and the end of the world.

245
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:24,867
Apart from the cartoonish depictions in the Book of Revelation,

246
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:29,023
the main source of this idea comes from Matthew 28:20,

247
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:33,614
where Jesus says: "I will be with you even to the end of the world."

248
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:40,350
However, in King James Version, "world" is a mistranslation, among many mistranslations.

249
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,840
The actual word being used is "aeon", which means "age."

250
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:49,333
"I will be with you even to the end of the age."

251
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:54,140
Which is true, as Jesus' Solar Piscean personification will end when

252
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,770
the Sun enters the Age of Aquarius.

253
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,900
The entire concept of end times and the end of the world

254
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,223
is a misinterpreted astrological allegory.

255
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:06,430
Let's tell that to the approximately

256
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,820
100 million people in America who believe the end of the world is coming.

257
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,440
Furthermore, the character of Jesus, being a literary and astrological hybrid,

258
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,070
is most explicitly a plagiarization of the Egyptian Sun-god Horus.

259
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:29,230
For example, inscribed about 3500 years ago, on the walls of the Temple of Luxor in Egypt

260
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:37,330
are images of the enunciation, the immaculate conception, the birth, and the adoration of Horus.

261
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,310
The images begin with Thaw announcing to the virgin Isis that she will conceive Horus,

262
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:49,740
then Nef the holy ghost impregnating the virgin, and then the virgin birth and the adoration.

263
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,500
This is exactly the story of Jesus' miracle conception.

264
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:02,220
In fact, the literary similarities between Horus and Jesus are staggering.

265
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,170
And the plagiarism is continuous.

266
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,380
The story of Noah and Noah's Ark is taken directly from tradition.

267
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,780
The concept of a Great Flood is ubiquitous throughout the ancient world,

268
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,540
with over 200 different cited claims in different periods and times.

269
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,990
However, one need look no further for a pre-Christian source than the Epic of Gilgamesh,

270
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,700
written in 2600 B.C.

271
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:41,490
This story talks of a Great Flood commanded by God, an Ark with saved animals upon it,

272
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:47,420
and even the release and return of a dove, all held in common with the biblical story,

273
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,340
among many other similarities.

274
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,830
And then there is the plagiarized story of Moses.

275
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,790
Upon Moses' birth, it is said that he was placed

276
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:03,280
in a reed basket and set adrift in a river in order to avoid infanticide.

277
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,660
He was later rescued by a daughter of royalty and raised by her as a Prince.

278
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:16,670
This baby in a basket story was lifted directly from the myth of Sargon of Akkad of around 2250 B.C.

279
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:23,340
Sargon was born, placed in a reed basket in order to avoid infanticide, and set adrift in a river.

280
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:27,780
He was in turn rescued and raised by Akki, a royal mid-wife.

281
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:33,715
Furthermore, Moses is known as the Law Giver, the giver of the Ten Commandments, the Mosaic Law.

282
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:40,562
However, the idea of a Law being passed from God to a prophet on a mountain is also a very old motif.

283
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:45,562
Moses is just a law giver in a long line of law givers in mythological history.

284
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,510
In India, Manou was the great law giver.

285
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,932
In Crete, Minos ascended Mount Dicta, where Zeus gave him the sacred laws.

286
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:59,095
While in Egypt there was Mises, who carried stone tablets and upon them the laws of god were written.

287
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:04,904
Manou, Minos, Mises, Moses

288
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,930
And as far as the Ten Commandments,

289
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,140
they are taken outright from Spell 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

290
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,650
What the Book of the Dead phrased

291
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,570
"I have not stolen" became "Thou shall not steal,"

292
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,500
"I have not killed" became "Thou shall not kill,"

293
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,794
"I have not told lies" became "Thou shall not bare false witness" and so forth.

294
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:26,320
In fact, the Egyptian religion is likely

295
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,040
the primary foundational basis for the Judeo-Christian theology.

296
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:37,850
Baptism, afterlife, final judgment, virgin birth and resurrection, crucifixion,

297
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:43,600
the ark of the covenant, circumcision, saviors, holy communion, the great flood,

298
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,580
Easter, Christmas, Passover, and many many more, are all attributes of Egyptian ideas,

299
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,490
long pre-dating Christianity and Judaism.

300
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:59,460
Justin Martyr, one of the first Christian historians and defenders, wrote:

301
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,820
"When we say that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, was produced without sexual union, was crucified

302
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,410
and died, and rose again, and ascended into Heaven, we propound nothing different from what

303
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,830
you believe regarding those who you esteem Sons of Jupiter."

304
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:18,718
In a different writing, Justin Martyr said:

305
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:24,610
"He was born of a virgin, accept this in common with what you believe of Perseus."

306
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,990
It's obvious that Justin and other early Christians knew how similar Christianity

307
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,400
was to the Pagan religions.

308
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:38,229
However, Justin had a solution. As far as he was concerned, the Devil did it.

309
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:41,104
The Devil had the foresight to come before Christ,

310
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:44,660
and create these characteristics in the Pagan world.

311
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,090
Fundamentalist Christianity, fascinating.

312
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,750
These people actually believe the World is 12,000 years old.

313
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,530
I actually asked one of these guys: "OK, dinosaur fossils?"

314
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:07,990
He says: "Dinosaur fossils? God put those there to test our faith!"

315
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,420
"I think God put you here to test my faith dude!"

316
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,800
The Bible is nothing more than an astro-theological literary fold hybrid,

317
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,900
just like nearly all religious myths before it.

318
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,380
In fact, the aspect of transference,

319
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,370
of one character's attributes to a new character, can be found within the book itself.

320
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,290
In the Old Testament there's the story of Joseph.

321
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,630
Joseph was a prototype for Jesus.

322
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,280
Joseph was born of a miracle birth, Jesus was born of a miracle birth.

323
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,260
Joseph was of 12 brothers, Jesus had 12 disciples.

324
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,651
Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver, Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver.

325
00:31:54,651 --> 00:32:02,150
Brother "Judah" suggests the sale of Joseph, disciple "Judas" suggests the sale of Jesus.

326
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:07,060
Joseph began his work at the age of 30, Jesus began his work at the age of 30.

327
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,450
The parallels go on and on.

328
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,710
Furthermore, is there any non-Biblical historical evidence of any person, living with the name Jesus,

329
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,230
the Son of Mary, who traveled about with 12 followers, healing people and the like?

330
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,150
There are numerous historians who lived in and around the Mediterranean either during or soon

331
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,710
after the assumed life of Jesus.

332
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,040
How many of these historians document this figure?

333
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,750
Not one.

334
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,190
However, to be fair, that doesn’t mean defenders

335
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,310
of the Historical Jesus haven’t claimed the contrary.

336
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,180
Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus’s existence.

337
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,880
Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Tacitus are the first three.

338
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,140
Each one of their entries consists of only a few

339
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,190
sentences at best and only refer to the Christus or the Christ,

340
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,490
which in fact is not name but a title. It means the “Anointed one”.

341
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,350
The fourth source is Josephus and this source has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years.

342
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,770
Sadly, it is still sited as truth.

343
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:15,382
You would think that a guy who rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven for all eyes to see

344
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:20,729
and performed the wealth of miracles acclaimed to him would have made it into the historical record.

345
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:23,560
It didn't because once the evidence is weighed,

346
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,305
there are very high odds that the figure known as Jesus, did not even exist.

347
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:46,062
We don't want to be unkind, but we want to be factual.

348
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,890
We don't want to cause hurt feelings, but we want to be academically correct,

349
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,540
in what we understand and know to be true.

350
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,320
Christianity just is not based on truth.

351
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:08,280
We find that Christianity was in fact nothing more than a Roman story, developed politically.

352
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,770
The reality is, Jesus was the Solar Deity of the Gnostic Christian sect,

353
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,960
and like all other Pagan gods, he was a mythical figure.

354
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,400
It was the political establishment that sought to historize the Jesus figure for social control.

355
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:34,220
By 325 A.D. in Rome, emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicea.

356
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,090
It was during this meeting that the politically motivated Christian Doctrines were established

357
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,160
and thus began a long history of Christian bloodshed and spiritual fraud.

358
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,330
And for the next 1600 years, the Vatican maintained a political stranglehold on all of Europe,

359
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:54,700
leading to such joyous periods as the Dark Ages,

360
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,450
along with enlightening events such as the Crusades, and the Inquisition.

361
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,230
Christianity, along with all other theistic belief systems, is the fraud of the age.

362
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,600
It served to detach the species from the natural world, and likewise, each other.

363
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
It supports blind submission to authority.

364
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,201
It reduces human responsibility to the effect that "God" controls everything,

365
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:28,320
and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name of Divine Pursuit.

366
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,270
And most importantly, it empowers those who know the truth but use the myth

367
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,620
to manipulate and control societies.

368
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:45,470
The religious myth is the most powerful device ever created, and serves as the psychological soil

369
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,670
upon which other myths can flourish.

370
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:59,082
A myth is an idea that, while widely believed, is false.

371
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:10,770
In a deeper sense, in the religious sense, a myth serves as an orienting and mobilizng story for people.

372
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,918
The focus is not on the story's relation to reality but on its function.

373
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:24,959
A story cannot function, unless it is believed to be true in the community or the nation.

374
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:34,274
It is not a matter of debate if some people have the bad taste to raise the question of the truth of the sacred story.

375
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,848
The keepers of the faith do not enter into the debate with them.

376
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:41,385
They ignore them, or denounce them as blasphemers.

377
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:46,693
It is wrong, blasphemous and sinful for you to suggest, imply or help other people

378
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:50,426
to come to conclusion that the U.S. government killed 3.000 of its own citizens.

379
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:04,805
Part 2: All The World's a Stage

380
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,130
...as if a demolition team set off, when you do the demolition of an old building.

381
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:44,546
It looks like one of those scenes of an old building being purposely dynamited and blown up.

382
00:37:44,877 --> 00:37:49,668
Anybody who ever watched a building being demolished on purpose knows that if you're going to do this

383
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:53,634
you have to get the under-infrastructure of the building and bring it down.

384
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,170
The way the structure is collapsing,.. this was the result of something that was planned.

385
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,970
It's not accidental that the first tower just happened to collapse

386
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,010
and then the second tower just happened to collapse in exactly the same way.

387
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,440
How did they accomplish this, we don't know.

388
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,870
The building collapsed to dust.

389
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:18,200
You don't find a desk, you don't find a chair, you don't find a telephone or computer.

390
00:38:19,448 --> 00:38:23,483
The biggest piece of a telephone I found was half of the keypad,

391
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:25,330
and it was about this big.

392
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,460
What happened to the concrete?

393
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
The concrete was pulverized.

394
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,720
Rivers and rivers of this dust powder, two or three inches thick.

395
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,620
The concrete was just uh... pulverized!

396
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,190
Reminiscence of pictures we've all seen too much in TV before,

397
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,900
a building is deliberately destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down.

398
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,690
It's as if they had detonators, yes, detonators, planted to take down the building, boom, boom, boom.

399
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,258
I heard a second explosion.

400
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,250
There was a heavy-duty explosion.

401
00:38:53,494 --> 00:38:56,120
There was a secondary explosion and then a subsequent collapse.

402
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:58,630
...explosion blow and then it knocked everybody over.

403
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,497
To me it sounded like an explosion.

404
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:05,302
It sounded like gun-fire, bang-bang-bang. And then all of a sudden three big explosions.

405
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,102
...and we heard big explosion coming down.

406
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,855
...and then the entire top of the building just blew up.

407
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,188
We saw some kind of explosion.

408
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,021
...by the force of the explosions...

409
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:15,248
...big explosion...it blew up back at the 8th floor...

410
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:17,556
...then we got to lobby, there was a big explosion.

411
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,451
The lobby looked as if a bomb had exploded there.

412
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:22,944
...huge explosion, now raining debris...

413
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,004
...there's been a huge explosion...

414
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:27,785
...huge explosion that we all heard and felt.

415
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,676
We just witnessed some kind of explosion...

416
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:33,744
...it was very loud...it blasted...explosion...

417
00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:36,809
...smoke and secondary explosion in Tower 1...

418
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:41,013
...there is another bomb going off... he thinks that there were actually devices

419
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:42,802
that were planted in the building...

420
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:44,055
...planted in the building...

421
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:51,044
The 9/11 Myth

422
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,040
19 hijackers, directed by Osama Bin Laden, took over 4 commercial jets

423
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,620
and, while evading the Air Defense System (NORAD), hit 75% of their targets.

424
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,820
In turn, World Trade Towers 1, 2 and 7 collapsed due to structural failure through fire in a "pancake" fashion,

425
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,780
while the plane that hit the Pentagon vaporized upon impact, as did the plane that crashed in Shanksville.

426
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,820
The 911 Commission found that there were no warnings for this act of terrorism,

427
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,190
while multiple government failures prevented adequate defense.

428
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:21,364
"no warnings"

429
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:26,797
I don't think anybody could have predicted

430
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:31,016
that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile.

431
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:32,582
...nobody in our government at least,

432
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,540
and I don't think the prior government could have envisioned flying airplanes into the buildings.

433
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,820
No specific threats involving, really domestic operations involving what happened obviously, the cities, airlines and so on.

434
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,547
There were no warning signs that I am aware of.

435
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:52,228
USA Today reports that in the two years before the attacks on September 11th

436
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,958
NORAD conducted exercises using hijacked airliners as weapons.

437
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,700
And one target was the World Trade Center.

438
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,570
Cover of FEMA Response Manual, 1997

439
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,550
Operation "Mascal", October 2000: Simulated a plane crash into the Pentagon

440
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:16,510
In confidential documents from the Philippines obtained by CNN, the plan was clear:

441
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:23,896
He would board any American commercial aircraft, control its cockpit, and dive it on the CIA headquarters.

442
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:27,565
Other buildings targeted - the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.

443
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,900
Security and counter terrorism was blinking red, in the words of George Tenet,

444
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:39,042
that the warnings of an imminent attack was so severe, that something dramatic should have been done.

445
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,780
It was unparalleled.

446
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,320
Instead, our president went on a month long vacation?

447
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,135
19 hijackers

448
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:56,699
The head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) Mahmood Ahmed

449
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:04,089
requested Omar Sheikh to wire $100.000 to Mohammed Atta who was the lead hijacker.

450
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,837
...hijacker Mohammed Atta received wire transfers via Pakistan.

451
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:14,206
The man sending the money to Atta is believed to be Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.

452
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:20,182
Omar Sheikh admitted he was supported by the Pakistani Government's intelligence service - the ISI.

453
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:27,190
No inquiry was ever made as to why General Ahmad ordered $100K to be sent to Mohamed Atta.

454
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:34,288
On the morning of September 11, Government officials were having BREAKFAST with General Ahmad in Washington.

455
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,430
The 911 Commission deemed the financing of the attacks was 'of LITTLE significance" in their official report.

456
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:44,622
Although we are told that 4 or 5 of the alleged hijackers were on each of the flights,

457
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:47,591
if so their names should have been on the flight manifest.

458
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:52,826
But the flight manifest that had been released contained neither the names of the alleged hijackers

459
00:42:53,229 --> 00:42:55,087
nor any Arab names whatsoever.

460
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:57,921
We know that the men who were supposedly the hijackers

461
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:02,131
had their houses, cars, credit cards paid for by the U.S. Government.

462
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,306
They were, in truth - agents.

463
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:07,120
Evidence was also apparently planted.

464
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,509
The passport of one of the hijackers on flight 11 was allegedly found in the rubble.

465
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:14,345
...it goes through the fireball, through the side of the plane

466
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,030
and comes down on the ground unscathed.

467
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,029
But something happened.

468
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:22,717
For 6 months they reported they had this passport. We thought if we got it, we got the proof

469
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:25,037
and then the guy stood up and was alive.

470
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:28,542
Several of these 19 men are still alive.

471
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:35,252
I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list. They gave my name and my date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber.

472
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,425
I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane

473
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:42,164
At least 6 of the "hijackers" are still alive.

474
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:46,330
The FBI has to this day not revised their list.

475
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,104
No evidence has ever linked any of the alive or dead "hijackers" to Osama bin Laden.

476
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,660
Osama Bin Laden

477
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:04,457
Of course we're after Saddam Hussein, I mean bin Laden, he's, he's, he's...

478
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:13,746
January 2001. The Bush Administration orders the FBI and intelligence agencies to back off investigations

479
00:44:14,145 --> 00:44:18,798
involving the bin Laden family, including two of Osama bin Laden's relatives

480
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,399
who were living, guess where! - in Falls Church, Virginia

481
00:44:22,754 --> 00:44:24,457
right next to CIA headquarters.

482
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:27,102
When he was already America's "most wanted criminal"

483
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:31,374
he reportedly spent two weeks in the American hospital in Dubai,

484
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,144
was treated by an American doctor and visited by the local CIA agent.

485
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:41,081
We have not seen one piece of evidence that links Osama bin Laden

486
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,683
directly to the planning stages of September 11th.

487
00:44:44,028 --> 00:44:47,104
This failure to provide proof was later said to be unnecessary

488
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,109
because bin Laden in the video allegedly found in Afghanistan admitted responsibility for the attacks.

489
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,816
This confession is now widely sided as proof.

490
00:44:56,468 --> 00:45:00,499
But the man in this video has darker skin, fuller cheeks and a broader nose

491
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:02,784
than the Osama bin Laden of all other videos.

492
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:05,303
We again seem to have the planted evidence.

493
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:14,030
In 1976 Osama's older brother Saleem bin Laden hired a man in Texas by the name of Jim Bath

494
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:17,745
to handle all the investments in the United States for the bin Laden family.

495
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:24,390
Jim Bath also happens to be a personal, almost life-long friend and former international guard pilot, with George W. Bush.

496
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:29,750
The connections between the Bushes and the bin Ladens become much more clearer when

497
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:34,624
George Herbert Walker Bush made trips to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000

498
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,630
to meet with the bin Laden family on behalf of the company called the Carlyle Group.

499
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:50,980
George H.W. Bush was meeting with Osama's older brother, Shafig bin Laden, on the morning of 9/11 in a Carlyle Group function.

500
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:57,805
The Carlyle Group is one of the world's largest defense contractors, which continue to reap massive profits off of the post 911 "War on Terrorism" and Afghan/Iraq Wars.

501
00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:05,943
Pentagon

502
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:14,263
How could anyone fly a 60 ton, 125 ft wide, 44 ft tall plane through this obstacle course.

503
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:21,132
The aircraft before striking the Pentagon reportedly executed a 270 degree downward spiral

504
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:27,977
and yet Hani Hanjour was known as a terrible pilot who could not safely fly even a small plane.

505
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,861
"He didn't care about the fact that he couldn't get through the course" - Flight school employee

506
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:38,949
"I am still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon... he could not fly at all." - Flight school employee.

507
00:46:40,017 --> 00:46:44,719
No seats, no luggage, no bodies. Nothing but bricks and limestone.

508
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:49,215
The official explanation is that the intense heat from the jet fuel vaporized the entire plane.

509
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:53,354
Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines made of steel and titanium alloy

510
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:55,227
and weighed 6 tons each.

511
00:46:55,687 --> 00:47:01,276
It is scientifically impossible that 12 tons of steel and titanium was vaporized by jet fuel.

512
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:05,040
We're also told that the bodies were able to be identified

513
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,594
either by the fingerprints or by the DNA.

514
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:16,269
So what kind of fire can vaporize aluminum and tempered steel and yet leave human bodies intact?

515
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:22,268
From my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon

516
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:28,068
and as I say the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you can pick up in your hand

517
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,165
Shortly after the strike, government agents picked up debris and carried it off.

518
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:38,287
The entire lawn was covered with dirt and gravel so that any remaining forensic evidence

519
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:40,127
was literally covered up.

520
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,584
The videos from security cameras which would show what really hit the Pentagon

521
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:48,343
were immediately confiscated by agents of the FBI.

522
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:52,297
And the Department of Justice has to this day refused to release them.

523
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:57,462
If these videos would prove that the Pentagon was really hit by a 757

524
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,732
most of us would assume the Government would release them.

525
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:12,703
Shanksville

526
00:48:13,663 --> 00:48:16,634
It looks like there's nothing there except for a hole in the ground.

527
00:48:16,966 --> 00:48:18,123
Basically that's right.

528
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:23,120
The only thing you could see from where we were a big gouge in the earth and some broken trees.

529
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:26,742
You could see some people working, walking around in the area,

530
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,677
but from where we can see there wasn't much left.

531
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:31,677
Any large pieces of debris at all?

532
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,930
No, there was nothing.

533
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,860
Nothing, that you can distinguish that a plane had crashed there.

534
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:41,227
Commercial plane crash in Nigeria.

535
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:49,344
Flight 93 "Crash" in Shanksville.

536
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,868
World Trace Center Towers 1, 2 and 7

537
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:06,471
Pancake theory according to which the fires, although not melting the steel,

538
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:10,400
heated up sufficiently to cause the floors weakened by the airplane strikes

539
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:14,127
to break loose from the steel columns, and this started a chain reaction.

540
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:17,940
So, you would expect then from that theory, which is the official theory,

541
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:21,536
to see a whole stack of floors piled up on top of each other

542
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:24,572
and then a spindle of core columns standing too.

543
00:49:24,883 --> 00:49:29,220
The core of each of the Twin Towers consisted of 47 massive steel columns.

544
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:31,345
If the floors had broken loose from them,

545
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,995
these columns would have still been sticking up in the air a thousand feet.

546
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:38,206
The plane did not cut all those core columns.

547
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:46,035
We designed the buildings to take the impact of the Boeing 707 hitting the building at any location.

548
00:49:46,313 --> 00:49:51,343
The building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners.

549
00:49:51,879 --> 00:49:53,795
...that the plane flew straight into the building.

550
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,216
Straight through, right.

551
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:59,392
So you're saying that the building was actually designed to cope with a hole like that

552
00:49:59,614 --> 00:50:00,519
and would still survive?

553
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:01,515
Yes, it was.

554
00:50:02,038 --> 00:50:07,979
If you would drop, say a billiard ball from the top of the World Trade Center, 110 floors up there

555
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:13,065
it would have taken 8 to 10 seconds to hit the ground encountering no resistance whatsoever.

556
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:15,893
The Twin Towers came down in nearly free fall speed.

557
00:50:16,374 --> 00:50:20,878
200.000 tons of steel shatters and explodes outwards over 500 ft.

558
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:26,239
This means that floors shattered at an average rate of about ten floors per second.

559
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:29,810
There is no scenario for a pancake effect of buildings falling

560
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,856
that allows them to fall at a rate of free fall.

561
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,906
And what can do that? What can move mass out of the way?

562
00:50:35,488 --> 00:50:36,489
Explosives.

563
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:47,993
47 huge steel columns going up the core that are interconnected,

564
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:52,877
how do you get them to fail simultaneously so the core disappeared.

565
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,267
It looks like those core columns were cut.

566
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,270
The way we do this is by cutting the beam out at angle.

567
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:10,844
WTC core column after the collapse.

568
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:16,638
Notice the "cut" shape and the melted... or "Molten Metal".

569
00:51:17,018 --> 00:51:19,221
I started looking at the molten metal.

570
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:25,076
All three buildings, both towers in the rubble, in the basement areas, and Building 7

571
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,460
there were these pools of molten metal.

572
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,510
For well over 6 weeks after the collapse, Hot spots of 2000F were documented in the debris.

573
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:37,504
That is 500F hotter than Jet fuel even burns.

574
00:51:38,574 --> 00:51:44,714
You get down below and you see molten steel. Molten steel running down the channel wheels.

575
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:49,275
Like you were in a foundry. Like lava of a volcano.

576
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,220
The molten steel was found 'three, four and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed'. He said that molten steel was also found at WTC7.

577
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:59,013
He said that molten steel was also found underneath World Trade Center 7.

578
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,630
So I'm looking through the official reports, what do they say about the molten metal?

579
00:52:03,868 --> 00:52:05,190
They say nothing.

580
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:08,897
Wait a minute. This is important evidence.

581
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:10,558
Where did that come from?

582
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:19,153
Thermite is so hot that it'll just cut through steel, through the structural steel for example,

583
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:20,807
like a knife through butter.

584
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:27,852
The products are molten iron and aluminum oxide which goes off primarily as a dust.

585
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:31,175
You know, there's enormous dust clouds

586
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:34,671
you can imagine, when you assemble these chemicals on a large scale.

587
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:40,498
Through Electron Microscope Analysis of the molted WTC Steel and the iron-rich microspheres in the dust,

588
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,190
Dr. Jones found exact traces of not only the "Thermite" explosive compound, but, due to the high sulfur content, "Thermate",

589
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:49,740
a patented brand of Thermite used in the demolition industry.

590
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,250
Molten metal pools under both towers after they collapsed, and Building 7.

591
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,820
Now, Building 7 wasn't even hit by a jet.

592
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,458
Part of the problem is that most people simply don't know much about Building 7.

593
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:05,907
due to the extraordinary secrecy surrounding its collapse.

594
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:08,870
This was a 47 storey skyscraper.

595
00:53:09,237 --> 00:53:12,706
This building fell at 17:25

596
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:14,240
It was not hit by a plane.

597
00:53:15,018 --> 00:53:18,029
This building had fires on only 2 or 3 floors.

598
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:22,475
...and it was brought down by what we know was a controlled demolition.

599
00:53:22,668 --> 00:53:25,137
Demolitions look just like that, kink in the middle,

600
00:53:25,421 --> 00:53:28,832
and then that building just comes straight down almost at free fall speed.

601
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:33,664
They first blow one of the central columns so the building falls in on itself.

602
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:36,891
Building 7 had a classic crimp or wedge.

603
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:39,051
Its central column was blown out first

604
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,939
so it didn't structurally damaged buildings just a few feet away from it.

605
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,529
The Government's explanation for all three collapses was FIRE.

606
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:51,192
NEVER before or after 9/11, has any Steel building collapsed from fire.

607
00:53:51,192 --> 00:53:55,190
Collapse characteristics of WTC 1, 2 and 7, fit the CONTROLLED DEMOLITION model EXACTLY.

608
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:02,520
Oh… Did I mention the sub-basement explosions? THAT OCCURRED SECONDS BEFORE THE FIRST PLANE HIT.

609
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,980
Our office was on the B-1 level. As I was talking to a supervisor at 8.46

610
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:15,232
and all of a sudden we hear - BOOM! An explosion so hard that pushed us upwards.

611
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:20,760
And it came from the basement, between the B-2 level and the B-3 level.

612
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:26,866
And when I went to verbalize we heard - BOOM! That impact of the plane on the top.

613
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:34,163
As I'm walking by the main freight car of the building in the corridor, that's when I got blown.

614
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:39,170
I mean, the impact of the explosion threw me to the floor

615
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:40,993
and that's when everything started happening.

616
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:42,797
All of a sudden a big impact happened again

617
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,791
and all the ceiling tiles were falling down, the light fixtures were falling

618
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:50,856
You know, you gotta go clear across the hall from 1 to 2 World Trade Center

619
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,409
and then all of a sudden it happened all over again.

620
00:54:53,756 --> 00:54:57,043
It was something else, hit us to the floor, right in the basement you felt it,

621
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,288
the walls were caving in on everything that was going on.

622
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:02,668
I mean, I know people that got killed in the basement,

623
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,278
I know people that got broken legs in the basement,

624
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:08,758
people got reconstructive surgery because the wall hit them in the face.

625
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:17,519
NORAD

626
00:55:18,742 --> 00:55:23,199
According to standard operating procedure if an FAA flight control notices anything

627
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:25,065
that suggests a possible hijacking,

628
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:26,916
controllers are to contact the superior.

629
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:29,172
If the problem cannot be fixed within about a minute

630
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:32,758
the superior should ask NORAD (North American Aerospace Command)

631
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:36,054
to send up or scramble jet fighters to find out what is going on.

632
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:40,611
NORAD then issues a scramble order to the nearest air force base with fighters on alert.

633
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:44,672
And although interceptions usually occur within 10 or so minutes,

634
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:50,162
in this case 80 or so minutes had elapsed before the fighters were even airborne.

635
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,468
It's a mind-bending anomaly.

636
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:57,180
Not a single US Air Force interceptor turns a wheel until it's too late.

637
00:55:57,683 --> 00:55:59,445
There are no jets at all.

638
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,130
What if they were so confused, and had been so deliberately confused that they couldn't respond?

639
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,000
The reason that they didn't know where to go

640
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,560
was because a number of conflicting and overlapping war game exercises were taking place

641
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,840
that involved the insertion of false radar blips on the radar screens in the north-east air defence sector.

642
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:27,111
FAA: "Hi, Boston Center TMU, we have a problem here. We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York.

643
00:56:27,111 --> 00:56:30,566
We need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out."

644
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,141
NORAD: "Is this real world or exercise?"

645
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:38,880
There was another exercise - "Vigilant Warrior", which was in fact according to a NORAD source

646
00:56:39,183 --> 00:56:42,235
a live-fly hijack drill being conducted at the same time.

647
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:46,765
With only 8 available fighter aircrafts, and that have to be dispatched in pairs,

648
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,510
they were dealing with as many as 22 possible hijacks on the day of 9/11

649
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,342
and they couldn't separate the war game exercises from the actual hijacks.

650
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:03,107
In 2000, NORAD had 67 intercepts. 100% accuracy. On 9/11 they failed 4 times in one day.

651
00:57:03,107 --> 00:57:08,590
On the morning of 9/11 he was in charge of all NORAD orders from the command bunker under the White House.

652
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:15,670
In at least one of the many war games going on the morning of 9/11, planes being flown into building was a scenario.

653
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,675
9/11 Commission

654
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,900
Page 172:

655
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,897
"The US Government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks.

656
00:57:31,388 --> 00:57:34,090
Ultimately, the question is of little practical significance."

657
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:39,065
The American authorities have not managed to trace the source of the funding.

658
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:45,076
And then the most amazingly disingenuous statement "ultimately is it of little consequence".

659
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:47,376
It is of massive consequence!

660
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:49,235
Doesn't it matter who paid for 9/11?

661
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:55,000
The collapse of Building 7 has been recognized as a specially difficult to explain.

662
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:01,099
The 9/11 Commission Report implicitly admitted that it could not explain the collapse of this building

663
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:03,049
by not even mentioning it.

664
00:58:03,535 --> 00:58:08,550
Mr. President, why are you and the Vice President insisting on appearing together before the 9/11 Commission?

665
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,000
Because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that's why we are meeting,

666
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,900
and I look forward to meeting with them and answering their questions.

667
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,240
The question was, why are you appearing together rather than separately, which was their request?

668
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:25,978
Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 Commission

669
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:30,564
is looking forward to asking us, and I am looking forward to answering them.

670
00:58:32,186 --> 00:58:35,690
Do you think they should be able to stand up and speak their own words?

671
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:36,931
They should go under oath.

672
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,520
Yeah. In public.

673
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:42,700
When Bush and Cheney met with the 9/11 Commission, they did so only on their own terms

674
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,828
They appeared together

675
00:58:44,828 --> 00:58:47,318
They were not under oath

676
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:49,803
No press or family members were allowed to attend

677
00:58:49,803 --> 00:58:51,960
No recording of any kind was allowed

678
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,860
No transcript was allowed

679
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:58,500
Don't you think that the families deserve to have a transcript or to be able to see witnessing?

680
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,557
Adam, you asked me this question yesterday, I got the same answer.(Next question).

681
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,270
The final report was a unanimous report.

682
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:10,040
That means that if there was a single commissioner who had any objection about anything,

683
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,410
that fact would be dropped from the report.

684
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:18,080
We have found out that he not only served on the transition team of the Bush Administration,

685
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,608
that he was a person who wrote a draft memo

686
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:24,133
for the setup of the Bush Administration's National Security Council,

687
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:27,316
that he was an individual who wrote the pre-emptive war strategy

688
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,810
that was eventually used for the war on Iraq,

689
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,460
that he's a close friend of Condoleezza Rice's,

690
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,681
we want him to resign.

691
00:59:35,047 --> 00:59:40,124
There is literally nothing in the 9/11 Report that the Bush Administration did not approve of.

692
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:44,689
We can understand therefore why that commission under Zelikow leadership

693
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:48,527
would have ignored all the evidence that would point to the truth

694
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,643
that 9/11 was a false flag operation

695
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:58,393
intended to authorize the doctrines and funds needed for a new level of imperial mobilization.

696
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:08,122
Terrorism

697
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:13,929
Terrorism: 1) systematic use of terror, manifesting itself in violence or intimidation, for generating fear.

698
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,434
for generating fear

699
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:20,420
Armed with knives. Armed with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

700
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,062
Fanatics. Terrorists. September 11th. September 11th. Killers.

701
01:00:23,062 --> 01:00:25,625
September 11th. Terrorists. Terrorists. Al Qaeda. Terrorists.

702
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,390
Nuclear weapons. Terror. 9/11. Terror. Terror. Terror. Evil.

703
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,757
September 11th. September 11th. The terrorists. War and danger.

704
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:36,254
September 11th. Terrorism. Global terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorism.

705
01:00:36,254 --> 01:00:39,306
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist. The terrorists.

706
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:43,285
Terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorism. September 11th. Global terrorism.

707
01:00:43,285 --> 01:00:47,318
Terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorists. September 11th. World terrorism.

708
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:49,870
Terrorists. Terrorism. September 11th. Global Terrorism.

709
01:00:50,227 --> 01:00:52,513
September the 11th. Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist.

710
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:55,315
Terrorist. Weapons of mass destruction. September the 11th.

711
01:00:55,315 --> 01:00:59,112
September the 11th. Terrorists. The evil terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists.

712
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:02,670
Terrorism. The words are hypnotically repeated:

713
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:09,925
Terrorism. Terrorists. Terrorist threat. And of course, believe-to-be-linked-to-al-Qaeda.

714
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:15,636
But, it's the so-called "War on Terrorism" that's in our faces practically 24/7

715
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:18,473
as the inescapable focus of our existence.

716
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:22,137
One day our grandchildren will look back on this time and ask:

717
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,030
"How was the War on Terror won?"

718
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:28,101
The entire US ruling class, ruling elite

719
01:01:28,596 --> 01:01:32,921
comes to see terrorism as the preferred means, indeed the only means,

720
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,910
to provide social cohesion,

721
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,350
to provide an enemy image for the society, to keep it together.

722
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,540
According to neocon theory from Carl Scmitt, you have to have an enemy image

723
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:43,851
in order to have a society.

724
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:46,850
A very dangerous thing because now it means that the entire social order,

725
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:50,094
the political parties, intellectual life, politics in general

726
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,010
are all based on a monstrous myth.

727
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:04,142
Nearly all terror suspects detained are released without charges.

728
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:09,857
..but that's after they make it to the front page for you to see.

729
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:12,843
Terror Threat..

730
01:02:14,885 --> 01:02:18,154
Bull Shit

731
01:02:20,065 --> 01:02:26,748
Terrorism: 2) technique used by Governments to manipulate public opinion in order to further an agenda.

732
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,694
Look what the CIA has done in this country. What they done to us is unbelievable.

733
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:36,551
Look at the terrorist acts that have occurred. The CIA behind most if not all of them.

734
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:40,085
We had the Marine Barracks, then embassy in Kenya.

735
01:02:41,154 --> 01:02:45,181
We had Pan Am 103, we had the USS Cole,

736
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:50,188
we had Oklahoma City, we had the World Trade Center in 1993.

737
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:54,757
...they helped the terrorists to blow up the WTC the fist time.

738
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:58,201
They built the bomb, they got the driver's license.

739
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:04,619
The informer Emad A.Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer,

740
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:10,531
he was given the assignment to put the bomb together and he went to the supervisor, that's the FBI supervisor,

741
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:12,219
and he said, "we're gonna put a dummy bomb",

742
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:15,586
and the FBI supervisor says "no, we're gonna put a real bomb."

743
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:21,285
The FBI actually carried out the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.

744
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:26,013
They actually hired Emad Salem and paid him 1 million dollars

745
01:03:26,381 --> 01:03:30,559
and gave him real explosives, a detonator and told him to build a bomb

746
01:03:30,912 --> 01:03:33,671
and to give it to the foolish people that he was controlling

747
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:38,300
to allow them to attack the World Trade Center complex.

748
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,211
Unfortunately for them, there were only six people killed,

749
01:03:42,535 --> 01:03:44,032
not enough to pass the legislation.

750
01:03:44,392 --> 01:03:46,512
So , what happened is two years later,

751
01:03:47,037 --> 01:03:52,016
April 19, 1995 down comes Oklahoma City, the Murrah Building

752
01:03:52,234 --> 01:03:57,648
168 people killed... a year later, the anti-terror legislation,

753
01:03:57,648 --> 01:04:01,455
which takes away many of our constitutional rights and civil liberties, is passed.

754
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:16,730
7/7/2005 London

755
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,341
Three trains and a bus were bombed, killing 56 people.

756
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,840
That morning, an "Anti-terror exercise" just happened to be taking place as well

757
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,080
Dealing with...

758
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,420
THE EXACT SAME BOMBING SCENARIO.

759
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,060
AT THE EXACT SAME TRAIN STATIONS.

760
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,140
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.

761
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,490
It was at half past 9 this morning.

762
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:38,300
We were actually running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London

763
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,638
based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning,

764
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:45,287
so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up right now.

765
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:48,746
To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise

766
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:51,843
to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were running the exercise?

767
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,025
Precisely.

768
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,130
Yeah... that's right.

769
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,550
THE EXACT SAME BOMBING SCENARIO.

770
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,140
AT THE EXACT SAME TRAIN STATIONS.

771
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,816
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.

772
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:01,441
We're supposed to believe that there were some kind of coincidence.

773
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:05,766
There was also an anti-terrorist drill going on on 7/7.

774
01:05:06,259 --> 01:05:07,949
And again, just like on 9/11

775
01:05:08,524 --> 01:05:12,417
they were talking about attacks on the same targets, the same tube stations

776
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:16,462
at the exactly the same time as the actual attack happened

777
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:23,930
providing some kind of cover for what must be operations orchestrating in some way by the States.

778
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:34,678
The 9/11 Truth

779
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:41,272
Criminal Elements within the US government staged a "false flag" Terror attack on its own citizens,

780
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:45,342
in order to manipulate public perception into supporting its agenda.

781
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:48,033
They have been doing these for years.

782
01:05:48,033 --> 01:05:52,528
9/11 was an Inside Job.

783
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:57,990
I am absolutely appalled about how much people in this country do not think.

784
01:05:58,857 --> 01:06:05,321
We are given to understand that an Arabic guy out there up in the mountains

785
01:06:05,912 --> 01:06:09,530
financed the most elaborate attack on this country.

786
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:16,052
Do you think some people in a cave were able to have NORAD stand down?

787
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:20,946
Do you think that people in the cave were able to have all of this happen?

788
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:26,113
And when I think about how many Americans were killed in New York City

789
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:30,606
and believing as I do that this thing was a set up job,

790
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:37,239
this is a textbook operation that Nazis used and they've used it over and over again.

791
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:41,959
America has been suckered in one more time.

792
01:06:45,498 --> 01:06:48,683
I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad.

793
01:06:49,194 --> 01:06:52,136
The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust.

794
01:06:52,325 --> 01:06:56,287
Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street.

795
01:06:56,505 --> 01:07:00,009
There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.

796
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:04,825
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.

797
01:07:05,394 --> 01:07:08,694
We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us

798
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:13,863
that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be!

799
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:17,779
We know things are bad. Worse than bad. They're crazy.

800
01:07:18,044 --> 01:07:20,723
It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.

801
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:24,438
We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller.

802
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:28,026
And all we say is, "Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.

803
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:33,521
Let me have my toaster and my TV, my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone."

804
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:37,312
Well I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad!

805
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:40,377
I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot.

806
01:07:40,653 --> 01:07:43,431
I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.

807
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:48,022
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.

808
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:51,053
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!

809
01:07:51,465 --> 01:07:54,163
You've got to say, "I'm a human being, goddamn it!

810
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:57,590
My life has value!

811
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:35,280
There's smoke - real bad - 105. Two tower.

812
01:08:38,358 --> 01:08:40,765
It's real bad, it's black, it's arid.

813
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:47,741
My wife thinks I'm all right. I called and said I was leaving the building. I was fine, and then BANG!

814
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,260
Three of us - two broken windows.

815
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:53,556
Oh God!

816
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,190
We interrupt this program for a message from the President.

817
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,670
Ladies and gentleman,

818
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:24,640
The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society,

819
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,650
and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies,

820
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:35,130
to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.

821
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:40,940
For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy

822
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:46,950
that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence.

823
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:52,370
On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections,

824
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,380
on intimidation instead of free choice.

825
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:05,380
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit,

826
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:11,880
highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, 

826
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:15,240
economic, scientific and political operations.

827
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,700
Its preparations are concealed, not published.

828
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,000
Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.

829
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,270
Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.

830
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,540
No expenditure is questioned, no secret is revealed.

831
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,770
That is why the Athenian lawmaker Solon

835
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:38,512
decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy.

832
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,040
I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.

833
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:50,940
Confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be:

834
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,390
free and independent.

835
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:12,320
Part 3: Don't mind the men behind the curtain

836
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:18,850
There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.

837
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:25,360
The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.

838
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:32,150
The real truth of the matter is that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson.

839
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:37,330
1775, the American Revolutionary War began,

840
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:41,650
as the American colonies sought to detach from England, and it's oppressive monarchy.

841
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:44,030
Although many reasons are cited for the revolution,

842
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,300
one in particular sticks out as the prime cause:

843
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:55,280
that King George III of England outlawed the interest free independent currency the colonies were producing and using for themselves,

844
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,630
in turn forcing them to borrow money from the Central Bank of England at interest,

845
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,550
immediately putting the colonies into debt.

846
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:06,240
And as Benjamin Franklin later wrote:

847
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:10,780
The refusal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system,

848
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,070
which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators

849
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:17,350
was probably the prime cause of the revolution.

850
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:21,000
In 1783 America won its independence from England.

851
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:28,050
However, its battle against the central bank concept and the corrupt, greed-filled men associated with it, had just begun.

852
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,310
So what is a Central Bank?

853
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:35,470
A Central Bank is an institution that produces the currency of an entire nation.

854
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:41,170
Based on historical precedent, two specific powers are inherent in central banking practice.

855
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:46,920
The control of interest rates, and the control of the money supply, or inflation.

856
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,780
The central bank does not simply supply a government's economy with money,

857
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,230
it loans it to them at interest.

858
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,750
Then, through the use of increasing and decreasing the supply of money,

859
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,630
the central bank regulates the value of the currency being issued.

860
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:09,210
It is critical to understand that the entire structure of this system can only produce one thing in the long run:

861
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,070
Debt.

862
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:14,560
It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity to figure this scam out.

863
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,520
Every single dollar produced by the central bank is loadned at intrest.

864
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:26,520
That means every single dollar produced is actually the dollar plus a certain percent of debt based on that dollar.

865
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:32,320
And since a central bank has a monopoly over the production of the currency for the entire country,

866
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,190
and they loan each dollar out with immediate debt attached to it,..

867
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,160
Where does the money to pay for the debt come from?

868
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,210
It can only come from the central bank again.

869
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:50,540
Which means the central bank has to perpetually increase its money supply to temporarily cover the outstanding debt created,

870
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:54,860
which in turn, since that new money is loaned out at interest as well,

871
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,860
creates even more debt!

872
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,060
The end result of this system without fail is slavery.

873
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,910
For it is impossible for the government and thus the public, to ever come out of the self-generating debt.

874
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:10,140
The founding fathers of this country were well aware of this.

875
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,320
"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies..

876
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,130
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency..

877
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:23,830
the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property

878
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:27,940
until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered." -Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826

879
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,520
"If you want to remain the slaves of the bankers and pay for the costs of your own slavery,

880
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,880
let them continue to create money and control the nation's credit." -Sir Josiah Stamp

881
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:42,920
By the early 20th century, the US had already implemented, and removed a few central banking systems,

882
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:46,980
which were swindled into place by ruthless banking interests.

883
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:50,530
At this time, the dominant families in the banking and business world were:

884
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,770
the Rockefellers, the Morgans, the Warburgs, the Rothschilds.

885
01:14:55,770 --> 01:15:01,780
And in the early 1900's, they sought to push once again, legislation to create another central bank.

886
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,970
However, they knew the government and public were weary of such an institution.

887
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:12,210
So they needed to create an incident to affect public opinion.

888
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:16,900
So, J.P. Morgan, publicly considered a financial luminary at the time,

889
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,350
exploited his mass influence by publishing rumors that a prominent bank in New York was insolvent, or bankrupt.

890
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,120
Morgan knew this would cause mass hysteria which would affect other banks as well, and it did.

891
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,070
The public, in fear of losing their deposits, immediately began mass withdrawals.

892
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:40,270
Consequently the banks were forced to call in their loans, causing the recipients to sell their property,

893
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:44,680
and thus a spiral of bankruptcies, repossessions, and turmoil emerged.

894
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,310
Putting the pieces together a few years later, Fredrik Allen of LIFE Magazine wrote:

895
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:53,450
"The Morgan interests took advantage to precipitate the panic of 1907

896
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,600
guiding it shrewdly as it progressed."

897
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:02,770
Unaware of the fraud, the Panic of 1907 led to a Congressional investigation, headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich,

898
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,720
who had intimate ties to the banking cartels, and later became part of the Rockefeller family through marriage.

899
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,300
The Commission led by Aldrich recommended a Central Bank should be implemented,

900
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,660
so a panic like 1907 could never happen again.

901
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:21,240
This was the spark the international bankers needed to initiate their plan.

902
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:27,190
In 1910, a secret meeting was held at a J.P. Morgan estate on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.

903
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:31,370
It was there that the central banking bill called the Federal Reserve Act was written.

904
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:35,650
This legislation was written by bankers, not law-makers.

905
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:39,760
This meeting was so secretive, so concealed from government and public knowledge,

906
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,970
that the 10 or so figures who attended disguised their names in addressing each other.

907
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:50,980
After this bill was constructed, it was then handed over to their political front-man, Senator Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress.

908
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:58,460
And in 1913 with heavy political sponsorship by the bankers, Woodrow Wilson became President,

909
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:03,970
having already agreed to sign the Federal Reserve Act in exchange for campaign support.

910
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:08,390
And 2 days before Christmas when most of Congress was at home with their families, the Federal Reserve Act was voted in,

911
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,970
and Wilson in turn made it law.

912
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,360
Years later, Woodrow Wilson wrote, in regret:

913
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,870
"(Our) great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit.

914
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:23,640
Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men who,

915
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,780
even if their action be honest and intended for the public interest,

916
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:31,850
are necessarily concentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is involved and who necessarily,

917
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:36,350
by very reason of their own limitations, chill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom.

918
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,930
We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments in the civilized world-

919
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:43,730
no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority,

920
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,480
but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men. -Woodrow Wilson

921
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:51,600
Congressman Louis McFadden also expressed the truth after the passage of the bill:

922
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,830
"A world banking system was being set up here.. a superstate controlled by international bankers.

923
01:17:56,830 --> 01:18:02,670
acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure. The Fed has usurped the government."

924
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:08,040
Now, the public was told that the Federal Reserve system was an economic stabilizer.

925
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,620
And inflation and economic crises were a thing of the past.

926
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:16,270
Well, as history has shown, nothing is further from the truth.

927
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:22,400
The fact is the international bankers now had a streamlined machine to expand their personal ambitions.

928
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:30,680
For example, from 1914 to 1919, the Fed increased the money supply by nearly 100%.

929
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:35,830
Resulting in extensive loans to small banks.

930
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,550
Then in 1920, the Fed called in massive percentages of the outstanding money supply,

931
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:45,880
thus resulting in the supporting banks having to call in huge numbers of loans,

932
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,700
and just like in 1907: bank runs, bankruptcy, and collapse occurred.

933
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:54,350
Over 5400 competitive banks outside of the Federal Reserve System collapsed.

934
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:58,280
Further consolidating the monopoly to a small group of international bankers.

935
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:03,260
Privy to this crime, Congressman Lindbergh stepped up, and said in 1921:

936
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:07,070
"Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created.

937
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:13,560
The present panic is the first scientifically created one, worked out as we figure a mathematical equation."

938
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:17,090
However, the panic of 1920 was just a warm-up.

939
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:21,080
From 1921 to 1929 the Fed again increased the money supply.

940
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,350
resulting once again in extensive loans to the public and banks.

941
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,860
There was also a fairly new type of loan called a margin loan in the stock market.

942
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:33,490
Very simply, a margin loan allowed an investor to put down only 10% of a stocks price,

943
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:36,810
with the other 90% being loaned through the broker.

944
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,070
In other words, a person could own $1000 worth of stock with only $100 down.

945
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,760
This method was very popular in the roaring 1920's,

946
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,480
as everyone seemed to be making money in the market.

947
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,390
However, there was a catch to this loan.

948
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:52,520
It could be called in at any time, and had to be paid within 24 hours.

950
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,680
This is termed a margin call,

951
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:59,180
and the typical result of a margin call is the selling of the stock purchased with the loan.

952
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:06,470
So, a few months before October of 1929, J.D. Rockefeller, Bernhard Barack, and other insiders quietly exited the market,

953
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:14,020
and on October 24th, 1929, the New York financiers who furnished the margin loans started calling them in, in mass.

954
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:17,000
This sparked an instantaneous massive sell-off in the market,

955
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,000
for everyone had to cover their margin loans.

956
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:25,540
It then triggered mass bank runs for the same reason, in turn collapsing over 16,000 banks,

957
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:30,180
enabling the conspiring international bankers to not only buy up rival banks at a discount,

958
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:33,450
but to also buy up whole corporations at pennies on the dollar.

959
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,480
It was the greatest robbery in American history.

960
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,430
But that didn't stop there.

961
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,090
Rather than expand the money supply to recover from this economic collapse,

962
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:45,570
the Fed actually contracted it, fueling one of the largest depressions in history.

963
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:51,360
Once again outraged, Congressman Louis McFadden, a long-time opponent of the banking cartels,

964
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:54,490
began bringing impeachment proceedings against the Federal Reserve Board,

965
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,740
saying of the crash and depression:

966
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,290
"It was a carefully contrived occurrence.

967
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,340
International bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair,

968
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,240
so that they might emerge the rulers of us all."

969
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,570
Not surprisingly, and after 2 previous assassination attempts,

970
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,910
McFadden was poisoned at a banquet before he could push for the impeachment.

971
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:19,470
Now, having reduced the society to squalor, the Federal Reserve bankers decided that the Gold Standard should be removed.

972
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,970
In order to do this, they needed to acquire the remaining gold in the system.

973
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:28,840
So, under the pretense of helping to end the depression came the 1933 gold seizure.

974
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:34,880
Under threat of imprisonment for 10 years, everyone in America was required to turn in all gold bullion to the Treasury,

975
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:38,170
essentially robbing the public of what little wealth they had left.

976
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,510
At the end of 1933, the gold standard was abolished.

977
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:47,210
If you look at a dollar bill from before 1933, it says it is redeemable in gold.

978
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:49,220
If you look at a dollar bill today,

979
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:53,650
it says it is legal tender, which means it is backed by absolutely nothing.

980
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,410
It is worthless paper.

981
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:59,330
The only thing that gives our money value is how much of it is in circulation.

982
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:05,240
Therefore the power to regulate the money supply is also the power to regulate its value,

983
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:10,530
which is also the power to bring entire economies and societies to its knees.

984
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:15,060
"Give me control of a Nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws."

985
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:17,930
-M.A. Rothschild, Founder of Rothschild banking dynasty.

986
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:22,320
It's important to clearly understand: the Federal Reserve is a private corporation.

987
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,450
It is about as "Federal" as "Federal Express."

988
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,740
It makes its own policies, and is under virtually no regulation by the US government.

989
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:35,020
It is a private bank that loans all currency at interest to the government,

990
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:40,430
completely consistent with the fraudulent central banking model that the country sought to escape from

991
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,870
when it declared independence in the American Revolutionary War.

992
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,930
Now, going back to 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was not the only unconstitutional bill pushed through Congress.

993
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:53,650
They also pushed the federal income tax.

994
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,080
It's worthwhile to point out that the American public's ignorance towards the federal income tax

995
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:03,270
is a testament to how dumbed-down and oblivious the American population really is.

996
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:07,840
First of all, the federal income tax is completely Unconstitutional,

997
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,300
as it is a direct, unapportioned tax.

998
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:14,540
All direct taxes have to be apportioned to be legal based on the Constitution.

999
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:20,150
Secondly, the required number of states in order to ratify the amendment to allow the income tax was never met,

1000
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,950
and this has even been cited in modern court cases.

1001
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:28,450
"If you examined 16th amendment carefully, you would find that a sufficient number of states never ratified that amendment." - U.S. Disctrict Court Judge James C. Fox, 2003

1002
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,310
Third, at the present day, roughly 25% (35 is mistake) of the average worker's income is taken from them through this tax.

1003
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:37,960
That means you work three months out of the year to fulfill this tax obligation,

1004
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,360
and guess where that money goes.

1005
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:46,160
It goes to pay the interest on the currency being produced by the fraudulent Federal Reserve Bank,

1006
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:49,000
a system that does not have to exist, at all.

1007
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:56,120
The money you make working four months out of the year goes almost literally into the pockets of the international bankers,

1008
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,450
who own the private Federal Reserve Bank.

1009
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:03,860
And fourth, even with the fraudulent government claim as to the legality of the income tax,

1010
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:10,550
there is literally no statute, no law in existence, that requires you to pay this tax.

1011
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,450
Period.

1012
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,690
I really expected that of course there's a law,

1013
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:20,210
that you can point to in the law book that requires you to file a tax return.

1014
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,120
Of course there is.

1015
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:26,730
I was at that point where I couldn't find the statute that clearly made a person liable,

1016
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:30,830
at least not me, and most people I know,

1017
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:34,610
and I had no choice in my mind except to resign.

1018
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:39,360
Based on the research that I did throughout the year 2000 and that I'm still doing,

1019
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,710
I have not found that law.

1020
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,500
I've asked Congress, a lot of people, we've asked the IRS Commissioner's helpers,

1021
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:51,720
they can't answer, because if they answer, the American people are gonna know that this whole thing is a fraud.

1022
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,750
I haven't filed a federal income tax return since I left.

1023
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,420
I have not filed a tax return since 1999.

1024
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:04,170
The income tax is nothing less than the enslavement of the entire country.

1025
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,520
Now, the control of the economy and the perpetual robbery of wealth

1026
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:12,240
is only one side of the Rubik's Cube the bankers hold in their hands.

1027
01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:16,190
The next tool for profit and control is war.

1028
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:19,780
Since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913,

1029
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,580
a number of large and small wars have commenced.

1030
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:27,520
The 3 most pronounced were World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.

1031
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,240
World War I.

1032
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:33,480
In 1914, European wars broke out centered around England and Germany.

1033
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:36,170
The American public wanted nothing to do with the war,

1034
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:39,860
in turn President Wilson publicly declared neutrality.

1035
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,820
However, under the surface,

1036
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,350
the US administration was looking for any excuse they could find to enter it.

1037
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:48,500
In a noted observation by Secretary of State William Jennings:

1038
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:52,130
"The large banking interests were deeply interested in the world war,

1039
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,600
because of the wide opportunities for large profits."

1040
01:25:55,270 --> 01:26:00,630
It's important to understand that the most lucrative thing that can happen for international bankers, is war.

1041
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:06,070
For it forces the county to borrow even more money from the Federal Reserve Bank at interest.

1042
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,670
Woodrow Wilson's top adviser and mentor was Colonel Edward House,

1043
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:15,520
a man with intimate connections with the international bankers who wanted in the war.

1044
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:19,110
In a documented conversation between Colonel House, Wilson's Advisor,

1045
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:24,630
and Sir Edward Grey, The Foreign Secretary of England, regarding how to get America into the war.

1046
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:25,990
Grey Inquired:

1047
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:30,020
"What will Americans do if Germans sink an Ocean Liner with American Passengers on board?"

1048
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,230
House responded:

1049
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,210
"I believe that a flame of indignation would sweep the united states

1050
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:39,130
and that by itself would be sufficient to carry us into war."

1051
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:44,380
So, on May 7th 1915 on essentially the suggestion of Sir Edward Grey,

1052
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:51,440
a ship called the Lusitania was deliberately sent into German controlled waters where German Military Vessels were know to be.

1053
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,570
And, as expected, German U-boats torpedoed the ship,

1054
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:58,420
exploding stored ammunition, killing 1200 people.

1055
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:03,910
To further understand the deliberate nature of this setup,

1056
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:07,460
the German Embassy actually put advertisements in the New York times,

1057
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,470
telling people that if they boarded the Lusitania, they did so at there own risk,

1058
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:16,670
as such a ship sailing from America to England through the war zone, would be liable to destruction.

1059
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:23,100
In turn and as anticipated, the sinking of the Lusitania caused a wave of anger among the American population

1060
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,190
and America entered the war a short time after.

1061
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,030
The 1st world war caused 323 000 American deaths.

1062
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:34,130
J.D. Rockefeller made about 200 million dollars off of it.

1063
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:41,660
Not to mention the war cost about 30 billion dollars for America,

1064
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:45,250
most of which was borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank at interest,

1065
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,000
furthering the profits of the international bankers.

1066
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,850
World War 2.

1067
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:54,630
On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor,

1068
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,640
triggering our entry into that war.

1069
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,920
President Franklin D Roosevelt declared that the attack was a "day that will live in infamy".

1070
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:03,640
A day of infamy indeed,

1071
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:06,540
but not because of the alleged surprise attack on Pearl harbor.

1072
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:13,180
After 60 years of surfacing information, it is clear that only was the attack on Pearl Harbor known weeks in advance,

1073
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:15,790
it was outright wanted and provoked.

1074
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,020
Roosevelt, whose family had been New York bankers since the 18th century,

1075
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:23,960
whose uncle Fredrik was on the original federal reserve board,

1076
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:26,690
was very sympathetic to the interests of the international bankers

1077
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,280
and the interest was to enter the war.

1078
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:33,510
And as we have seen, nothing is more profitable for international bankers, than war.

1079
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:40,040
In a journal entry by Roosevelt's Secretary of War Henry Stimson dated November 25th, 1941,

1080
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,460
he documented a conversation he had with Roosevelt:

1081
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:45,940
"The question was how should we maneuver them into firing the first shot.

1082
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:49,250
It was desirable to make sure the Japanese be the ones to do this

1083
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:53,170
so that there should remain no doubt as to who were the aggressors."

1084
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:55,800
In the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor,

1085
01:28:55,950 --> 01:29:00,550
Roosevelt did everything in his power to anger the Japanese, showing a posture of aggression.

1087
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,980
He halted all of Japans import of American Petroleum.

1088
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,800
He froze all the Japanese assets in the United States.

1089
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,000
He made public loans to Nationalist China and supplied military aid to the British,

1090
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,170
both enemies to Japan in the war..

1091
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,350
Which, by the way, is completely in violation of international war rules.

1092
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:19,170
And, on December 4th, 3 days before the attack,

1093
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:25,210
Australian intelligence told Roosevelt about a Japanese task force moving towards Pearl harbor.

1094
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,480
Roosevelt ignored it.

1095
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:31,350
So, as hoped and allowed, on December 7th 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,

1096
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,270
killing 2400 soldiers.

1097
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:38,500
Before Pearl Harbor 83% of the American Pubic wanted nothing to do with the War.

1098
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,840
After Pearl Harbor, 1 million men volunteered for the war.

1099
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:49,680
It is important to note, Nazi Germany's war effect was largely supported by two organizations,

1100
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,720
one of which was called I.G. Farben.

1101
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:56,180
I.G. Farben produced 84% of Germany's explosives and even the Zyklon B

1102
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,590
used in the concentration camps to kill millions.

1103
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,310
One of the unspoken partners of I.G. Farben was J.D. Rockefeller's Stand Oil Company in America.

1104
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:10,400
In fact the German Air force could not operate without a special additive patterned by Rockefeller's Standard Oil.

1105
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,980
The drastic bombing of London by Nazi Germany for example

1106
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:20,220
was made possible by a 20 million dollar sale of fuel to I.G. Farben by the Rockefeller standard oil company.

1107
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:26,050
This is just one small point about how America business funded both sides of World war 2.

1108
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:31,710
One other treasonous organization worth mentioning is the Union Banking Corporation of New York City.

1109
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,450
Not only did it finance numerous aspects of Hitler's rise to power,

1110
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,510
along with actual materials during the war,

1111
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:40,010
it was also a Nazi money laundering bank.

1112
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:44,390
Which was eventually exposed for having millions of dollars of Nazi Money in its vaults.

1113
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:50,140
The Union Banking Corporation of New York was eventually seized for violation of the Trading with the Enemy Act.

1114
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,110
Guess who the director and Vice President of the Union Bank was.

1115
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,790
Prescott Bush, our current presidents Grandfather,

1116
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,590
and of course our former Presidents father.

1117
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,900
Keep that in mind when considering the moral and political dispositions of the Bush family.

1118
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,990
Vietnam.

1119
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:13,430
The United States official declaration of war on North Vietnam in 1964,

1120
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:21,260
came after an alleged incident involving US destroyers being attack by North Vietnamese PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

1121
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,920
This was known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

1122
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:29,960
This single situation was the catalystic pretext for massive troop deployment and full fledged warfare.

1123
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:31,730
One problem however.

1124
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:35,470
The attack on the us destroyers by PT boats..

1125
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:37,060
never happened.

1126
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,190
It was a completely staged event to have an excuse to enter the war.

1127
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:44,870
Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated years later

1128
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:47,920
that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a "mistake",

1129
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,520
while many other insiders and officers have come forward

1130
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:54,720
relaying that it was a contrived farce, a complete lie.

1131
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:57,220
Once in the war, it was business as usual.

1132
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:00,040
In October 1966, president Lyndon Johnson

1133
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,460
lifted trading restrictions on the soviet black,

1134
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:07,950
know full well that the Soviets were providing upwards of 80% of North Vietnams war supplies.

1135
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:12,290
Consequently, Rockefeller interests financed factories in the Soviet Union,

1136
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:17,310
which the Soviets used to manufacture military equipment and send to North Vietnam.

1137
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:21,870
However, the funding of both sides of this conflict was only one side of the coin.

1138
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:26,170
In 1985, Vietnam's  Rules of Engagement were declassified.

1139
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:30,200
This detailed what American troops were and were not allow to do in the war.

1140
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,890
It included absurdities like:

1141
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:35,820
North Vietnamese anti-aircraft missile systems could not be bombed

1142
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:38,490
until they were known to be fully operational.

1143
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:42,650
No enemy could be pursued once they crossed the border of Laos or Cambodia.

1144
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:47,550
And most revealing of all, the most critical strategic targets were not allow to be attacked,

1145
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,640
unless initiated by high military officials.

1146
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:53,310
Apart from these imposed ludicrous limitation,

1147
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,760
North Vietnam was informed of these restrictions

1148
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,180
and therefore could create entire strategies around the limitation of the American Forces.

1149
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:05,400
This is why the war went on so long and the bottom line is this:

1150
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:08,050
The Vietnam war was never meant to be won..

1151
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:10,410
Just sustained.

1152
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:16,490
This war for profit resulted in 58000 American death and 3 million dead Vietnamese.

1153
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:23,480
So, where are we now.

1154
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:29,020
September 11th was the jumpstart for what is now an accelerating agenda by the ruthless elite.

1155
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:33,510
It was a staged war pretext no different than the sinking of the Lusitania,

1156
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,830
the provoking of Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.

1157
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:41,970
In fact if 9/11 wasn't a planned war pretext it would be an exception to the rule.

1158
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,430
It has been used to launch two unprovoked illegal wars.

1159
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,490
One against Iraq and one against Afghanistan.

1160
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,540
However, 9/11 was the pretext for another war as well.

1161
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,050
The war against you.

1162
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:58,100
The patriot act, homeland security, the military tribunals act and other legislations,

1163
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:02,390
are all completely and entirely designed to destroy your civil liberties

1164
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,800
and limit your ability to fight back against what is coming.

1165
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:10,100
Currently in the United states unannounced to most brainwashed Americans,

1166
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:13,750
you home can be searched without a warrant, with you being home,

1167
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:17,120
you can in turn be arrested with no charges revealed to you,

1168
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,920
detain indefinitely with no access to a lawyer and legally tortured.

1169
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:26,090
All under the suspicion that you might be a terrorist.

1170
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:29,290
If you need a painted picture of what is happening in the country,

1171
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,860
let's recognize how history repeats itself.

1172
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:37,660
In Feb 1933, Hitler staged a false flag attack,

1173
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:44,410
burning down his own German parliament building the Reichstag and blamed it on communist terrorists.

1174
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,190
Within the next few weeks he passed the Enabling Act,

1175
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,410
which completely eradicated the German constitution destroying people's liberties.

1176
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,260
He then let a series of preemptive wars

1177
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:59,830
all justified to the German people as necessary to maintaining homeland security.

1178
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:06,260
"An evil exists that threatens every man woman and child in this great nation.

1179
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:10,490
We must take steps to ensure our domestic security and protect our homeland."

1180
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:13,970
George Bush?

1181
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:22,360
No, Adolf Hitler when announcing gestapo to the people.

1182
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:32,160
On the matter of communism and its front organizations should not obscure the issues.

1183
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:38,870
Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.

1184
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,770
It's time to wake up.

1185
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,710
The people in power go out of their way

1186
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,470
to make sure you are perpetually mislead and manipulated.

1187
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:55,730
The majorities perception of reality, especially in the political arena is not there own.

1188
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:59,960
It I shrewdly imposed upon them, without them even knowing it.

1189
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:05,420
For example, the public at large actually believe the invasion of Iraq is going badly,

1190
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,580
as sectarian violence doesn't seem to stop.

1191
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,440
What the public fails to see,

1192
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:16,060
is that the destabilization of Iraq is exactly what the people behind the government want.

1193
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,980
This war is to be sustained, so the region can be divided up,

1194
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:24,840
domination of the oil maintained, continual profits reaped for the defense contractors

1195
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:28,530
and most importantly, permanent military bases established

1196
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:34,970
to be used as a launching pad against other oil bearing, non-conforming countries, such as Iran and Syria.

1197
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:39,950
For further implication that the civil war and destabilization is purely intentional -

1198
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:45,490
In 2005, 2 elite British SAS officers were arrested by Iraq police

1199
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:49,140
after being caught driving around in their car shooting at civilians,

1200
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,810
while dressed up as Arabs.

1201
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,980
After being arrested and taken to a jail in Basra,

1202
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,900
the British army immediately requested the release of these men.

1203
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:01,580
When the Basra government refused, British tanks came in

1204
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,020
and physically broke out the men from the Basra prison.

1205
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:10,710
If you wish to destroy an area, how do you do it?

1206
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:14,690
Well there are two ways - you can go in there and bomb it, and so forth, but that is not very efficient.

1207
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:18,290
What you do is try to get the people in that area to kill each other

1208
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,330
and to destroy there own territory, their own farms.

1209
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:24,280
And that's what has been done in that area.

1210
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:29,940
The way in which you destroy an opponent is get him to destroy himself,

1211
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,350
by dividing his ranks against one another.

1212
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:37,370
Then you feed both sides, you have agents feeding both sides, inflaming both sides.

1213
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:39,700
And they kill each other off.

1214
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:43,830
And it's time that some of us woke up to this reality.

1215
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:49,780
To understand that people who try to maintain empires and create empires,

1216
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:54,750
do it by manipulating the people they are trying to conquer.

1217
01:37:55,130 --> 01:38:02,500
You might to ask yourself why the entire culture is utterly saturated by mass media entertainment from all sides,

1218
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:07,560
while the educational system in America continues it stupefying downward slide

1219
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:11,950
since the US government decided to take over subsidize the public school system.

1220
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:18,010
What your government pays for it gets.

1221
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:25,300
When we understand that, then we look at government financed institutions of education

1222
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:32,420
and see the kind of student and the kind of education that is being turned out by these government financed schools,

1223
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:37,620
logic will tell you that if what is being turned out in those school

1224
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:42,160
was not in accord with what the state and the federal government wanted,

1225
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:45,180
then it would change it.

1226
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:49,580
The bottom line is that the government is getting what they have ordered.

1227
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:55,340
They do not want your children to be educated.

1228
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:59,250
They do not want you to think too much.

1229
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:04,910
That is why our country and our world has become so proliferated with entertainments,

1230
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:11,820
mass media, television shows, amusement parks, drugs, alcohol

1231
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,850
and every kind of entertainment,

1232
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,360
to keep the human entertained.

1233
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:24,480
So that you don't get in the way of important people by doing too much thinking.

1234
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:27,080
You had better wake up and understand

1235
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:30,990
that there are people who are guiding your life and you don't even  know it."

1236
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:34,040
We are in a lot of trouble!

1237
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:40,630
Because you people and 62 million other Americans are listening to me right now.

1238
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:44,630
Because less then 3 percent of you people read books.

1239
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:49,790
Because less 15 percent of you read newspapers.

1240
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,380
Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube.

1241
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:58,190
Right now there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything

1242
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,970
that didn't come out of this tube.

1243
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:05,810
This tube is the gospel, the ultimate revelation.

1244
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:10,930
This tube can make or break presidents popes prime ministers..

1245
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:17,260
This tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world and woe is us,

1246
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:19,390
if it ever falls in the hands of the wrong people.

1247
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:27,860
And when the largest company in the world controls the most awesome goddamn propaganda force in the whole godless world,

1248
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:32,240
who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network!

1249
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:34,290
So you listen to me..listen to me:

1250
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:38,100
Television is not the truth.

1251
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,540
Television is a goddamned amusement park.

1252
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:45,890
Televeision is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troop of acrobats, story tellers,

1253
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:51,090
dancers, singers, jugglers sideshow freaks, lion taimers And football players.

1254
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,850
We are in the bordom killing business.

1255
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,300
But you people sit there day after day night after night, all ages, colors, creeds..

1256
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:02,410
We are all you know.

1257
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,290
You're beginning to believe the illusions we are spinning here,

1258
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,530
you are beginning to think the tube is reality and your own lives are unreal.

1259
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,070
You do whatever the tube tells you.

1260
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:14,690
You dress like the tube, eat like the tube,

1261
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,120
raise your children like the tube, you even think like the tube..

1262
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,530
This is mass madness you maniacs.

1263
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,250
In god's name you people are he real,

1264
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:25,970
think - we are the illusion!

1265
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:31,300
The last thing the men behind the curtain want

1266
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:35,300
is a conscious informed public capable of critical thinking.

1267
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,850
Which is why a continually fraudulent zeitgeist is output via religion,

1268
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,920
the mass media, and the educational system.

1269
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,520
They seek to keep you in a distracted, naive bubble.

1270
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,940
And they are doing a damn good job of it.

1271
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:55,040
In 2005 an arrangement between Canada, Mexico and the United States was made.

1272
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:58,860
This arrangement, unannounced to the public, unregulated by congress,

1273
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:05,320
merges the United States, Canada and Mexico into one entity, erasing all borders.

1274
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:07,870
It's called the North American Union.

1275
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:10,430
You might want to ask yourself why you have never heard of this.

1276
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:14,250
In fact, there is only one mainstream reporter who has actually heard of,

1277
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,280
and has had the courage to cover this issue.

1278
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:19,070
The Bush administration's open borders policy

1279
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:24,030
and its decision to ignore the enforcement of this country's immigration laws

1280
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:26,440
is part of a broader agenda.

1281
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:30,730
President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States, as we know it.

1282
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:35,080
And he took the step without approval from either the US congress,

1283
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,670
or the people of the United States.

1284
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:39,850
It's a deal that few have even heard of.

1285
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:43,540
It's been done again, by very few people, at the very top,

1286
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:47,490
on behalf of the investment class. But the working class of people,

1287
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:52,510
political officials across our country from communities and cities,

1288
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,440
they don't know anything about this.

1289
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,600
This isn't some trade agreement.

1290
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,500
It is a total removal of soverienty from these countries

1291
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:03,210
which will also result in a completely new currency called the Amero.

1292
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:09,770
I think the one thing that people who are dollars based need to focus on is e Amero,

1293
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,760
that's the thing no one is talking about that.

1294
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:17,780
I think is going to have a big impact on everybody's life in Canada, the US and Mexico.

1295
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:21,540
The Amero is the proposed new currency for the North American Community,

1296
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:25,490
which is being developed right now between Canada the US and Mexico

1297
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:28,750
to make a borderless community much like the EU

1298
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:33,530
and the Dollar, the Canadian dollars and the Mexican Peso will be replaced by the Amero.

1299
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:38,130
By default of this agreement, the American Constitution will eventually be obsolete.

1300
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:43,130
You would think that a situation like this would be on the cover or every major newspaper.

1301
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:46,140
That is until you release the people behind this movement

1302
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:48,970
are the same people who are behind the main stream media

1303
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:51,720
and you are not told what you are not supposed to know.

1304
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:54,950
The North American Union is the same concept as the European Union,

1305
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:57,690
the African Union and the soon to be Asian union

1306
01:43:57,850 --> 01:43:59,990
and the same people are behind all of them.

1307
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:05,740
And when the time right, the north American, union, the European union, the African union and the Asian union

1308
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:12,830
will be merged together, forming the final stages in a plan these men have been working on for over 60 years.

1309
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:15,540
A one world government.

1310
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:19,370
"We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it.

1311
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:24,350
The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent."

1312
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:31,810
-Paul Warburg, Council on Foreign Relations / Architect of the Federal Reserve System

1313
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,290
"We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications

1314
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:45,010
whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years.

1315
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:50,450
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world

1316
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:54,330
if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years.

1317
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:58,830
But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government.

1318
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,820
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers

1319
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:06,280
is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries.

1320
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:10,750
-David Rockefeller, Council on Foreign Relations

1321
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:17,820
One bank, one army, one center of power.

1322
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,930
And if we have learned anything from history.

1323
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:26,860
it is that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1324
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,990
This is Aaron Russo, a filmmaker and former Politician.

1325
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:36,580
To his left is Nicholas Rockefeller of the infamous Rockefeller banking and business dynasty.

1326
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:39,980
After maintaining a close friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller,

1327
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:41,930
Aaron eventually ended the relationship,

1328
01:45:42,130 --> 01:45:45,690
appalled by what he had learn about the Rockefellers and their ambitions.

1329
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:50,770
I got a call one day from an attorney I knew and she said:

1330
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:54,440
"Would you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?" And I said: "Sure I would love to."

1331
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:00,440
We became friends and he began to divulge a lot of things to me,

1332
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,510
so he said to me one night, he said:

1333
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:08,350
"There's going to be an event, Aaron, and out of that event we are going to go into Afghanistan,

1334
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:11,390
so we can run pipelines from the Caspian Sea,

1335
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:15,650
we are gong to go into Iraq to take the oil and establish a base in the middle east

1336
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:19,640
and we are gong to go into Venezuela and get rid of Chavez."

1337
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:23,370
The first 2 they have accomplished, Chavez they didn't accomplish.

1338
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:27,390
And he said: "You are going to see guys going into caves looking for..

1339
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,720
looking for people they are never going to find."

1340
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:35,090
He was laughing about the fact that you have this war on Terror,

1341
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,980
and there is no real enemy.

1342
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,210
He was talking about how by having this war on terror you can never win it,

1343
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:46,030
because it is an eternal war, so you can always keep taking peoples liberties away.

1344
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:49,910
And I said: "How are you gong to convince people that this war is real?"

1345
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:54,340
And he said: "By the media.. the media can convince everybody that its real."

1346
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:58,130
You just keep talking about things and saying them over and over and over again

1347
01:46:58,130 --> 01:47:00,040
and eventually people believe it.

1348
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,740
You know, they create the Federal Reserve in 1913 through lies.

1349
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,400
They create 9/11,

1350
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:07,500
which was another lie.

1351
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:11,610
Through 9/11, then you are fighting a war on terror and all the sudden you go into Iraq,

1352
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,760
which was another lie,

1353
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:15,700
and now they are going to do Iran.

1354
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:18,770
It's all one thing leading to another, leading to another, leading to another..

1355
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,780
I would say to him: "What are you doing this for?

1356
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:22,290
What's the point of this thing?

1357
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:25,330
You have all the money in the world you would ever want, you have all the power,

1358
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:27,340
you're hurting people. It's not a good thing."

1359
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:30,900
And he would say: "What do you care about the people for?

1360
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,310
Take care of yourself and take care of your family".

1361
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:37,570
And then I said: "So what are the ultimate goals here?"

1362
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:42,420
He said: "The ultimate goal is to get everyone in this world chipped with an RFID chip.

1363
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:46,830
And have all money be on those chips and have everything on those chips,

1364
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,580
and if anyone wants to protest what we do or violate what we want,

1365
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:52,880
we can just turn off their chips."

1366
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:54,780
That's right - micro chipped.

1367
01:47:54,980 --> 01:48:00,650
In 2005, congress under the pretense of immigration control and the so called war on terrorism,

1368
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,320
passed the Real ID act, under which it is projected by May 2008,

1369
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:09,070
you will be required to carry around a Federal Identification card

1370
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:12,590
which includes on it a scannable bar code with you personal information.

1371
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,660
However this barcode is only an intermediary step,

1372
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:20,710
before the card is equipped with a VeriChip RFID tracking Module,

1373
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:24,930
which will use radio frequencies to track your every move on the planet.

1374
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:27,250
If this sounds foreign to you, please note

1375
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:32,170
that the RFID tracking chip is already in all new American (and also European) passports.

1376
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,350
And the final step is the implanted chip,

1377
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:41,080
which many people have already been manipulated into accepting under different pretenses.

1378
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:45,740
We have a Florida family who are really pioneers in a brave new world.

1379
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:51,380
They have volunteer to be the first ever to have microchip identification devices

1380
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:53,520
implanted into their bodies.

1381
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:57,600
After 9/11 I was really concerned with the security of my family.

1382
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:05,220
I wouldn't mind having something planted permanently in my arm, that would identify me.

1383
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:10,150
In the end, everybody will be locked into a monitored control grid,

1384
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,940
where every single action you perform is documented,

1385
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:16,200
and if you get out of line, they can just turn off your chip,

1386
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:21,180
for at that point in time, every single aspect of society will revolve around interactions with the chips.

1387
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,760
This is the picture that is painted for the future if you open your eyes to see it.

1388
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:31,490
A centralized one world economy where everyone's moves and everyone transactions are tracked and monitored.

1389
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:33,910
All rights removed.

1390
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:39,290
The most incredible aspect of all:

1391
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,870
These totalitarian elements will not be forced upon the people,

1392
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,490
the people will demand them.

1393
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,030
For the social manipulation of society through the generation of fear

1394
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:54,460
and division has completely detached human from their sense of power and reality.

1395
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:56,910
A process, which has been going on for centuries if not millennia.

1396
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,120
Religion.

1397
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:59,610
Patriotism,

1398
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:00,670
Race,

1399
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:01,580
Wealth,

1400
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,590
Class,

1401
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:07,410
and every other form of arbitrary separatist identification and thus conceit,

1402
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:12,100
has served to create a controlled population, utterly malleable in the hands of the few.

1403
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,790
Divide and Conquer is the motto,

1404
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,850
and as long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else,

1405
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:22,810
they lend themselves to being completely enslaved.

1406
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:26,170
The men behind the curtain know this. And they also know,

1407
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:30,310
that if people ever realize the truth of their relationship to nature,

1408
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:32,880
and the truth of their personal power..

1409
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:39,270
The entire manufactured Zeitgeist they prey upon, will collapse like a house of cards..

1410
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:56,480
The whole system that we live in, drills into us that we are powerless,

1411
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:01,090
that we are weak, that society is evil, that it's crime ridden and so forth.

1412
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:03,680
It is all a big fat lie!

1413
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:06,240
We are powerful, beautiful, extraordinary.

1414
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:14,070
There is no reason why we cannot understand who we truly are where we are going.

1415
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:18,360
There is no real why the average individual cannot be fully empowered.

1416
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,230
We are incredibly power beings.

1417
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:25,500
I think I spent 30 years of my life,

1418
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:28,450
the first 30 trying to become something.

1419
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:33,340
I wanted to become good at things, I wanted to become at tennis and school and grades.

1420
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:35,590
And everything I kinda viewed in that perspective,

1421
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:38,890
I'm not okay the way I am, but if I got good at things..

1422
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:41,900
I realized that I had the game wrong.

1423
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:45,350
Because the game was to find out what I already was.

1424
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:11,860
Now, in our culture we have been trained for individual differences to stand out.

1425
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,040
So you look at each person and the immediate hit is.

1426
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:17,750
Brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer poorer..

1427
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:20,560
And we make all these dimensional distinctions,

1428
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,980
put them in categories and treat them that way.

1429
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,960
And get so we only see others as separate from ourselves

1430
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,450
in the ways in which they are separate.

1431
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:33,200
And one of the dramatic characteristics of experience

1432
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:36,130
is being with another person and suddenly seeing

1433
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,560
the ways in which they are like you, not different from you.

1434
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:42,490
And experiencing the fact that which is essence in you,

1435
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,300
which is essence in me is, indeed, one.

1436
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:49,690
The understanding that there is no other. It is all one.

1437
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,860
I wasn't born Richard Albert, I was just born as a human being

1438
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:03,040
and then I learn this whole business of who I am, whether I'm good or bad, achieving or not..

1439
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:06,130
All that's learned along the way.

1440
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:11,070
When the power of love overcomes the love of power,

1441
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:14,260
the world will know peace.

1442
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:18,150
-Jimi Hendrix

1443
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:27,170
The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious shovanism,

1444
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,150
to rabid nationalistic fervor,

1445
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:32,390
are beginning not to work.

1446
01:53:32,590 --> 01:53:37,660
A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism,

1447
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:43,770
and recognizes, that an organism at war with itself is doomed.

1448
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:18,880
Bill Hicks used to finish his shows

1449
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,220
with this:

1450
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:26,010
Life's like a ride in an amusement park,

1451
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:29,840
and when you go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are.

1452
01:54:30,450 --> 01:54:32,960
The ride goes up and down and round and round,

1453
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:36,050
it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored.

1454
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:39,590
And it's very loud and it's fun for a while.

1455
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:42,590
Some have been on the ride for a long time and they begin the question:

1456
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:45,830
Is this real? Or is this just a ride?

1457
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:48,950
And other people have remembered and they back to us and they say:

1458
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:52,250
Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid ever.

1459
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:55,080
Cause this is just a ride.

1460
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:57,880
And we kill those people.

1461
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:01,420
Shut him up I have got a lot invested in this ride, shut his up!

1462
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:03,140
Look at my frowns of worry.

1463
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,750
Look at my big bank account and my family,

1464
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:07,520
this has to be real..

1465
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,110
It's just a ride.

1466
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,320
But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that,

1467
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,230
you ever notice that?

1468
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:15,840
And we let the demons run a muck..

1469
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,130
But it doesn't matter, because it is just a ride

1470
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:21,580
and we can change it anytime we want.

1471
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:22,850
It is only a choice.

1472
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:26,110
No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money.

1473
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:29,100
Just a choice right now.

1474
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:32,120
Between fear,

1475
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:35,320
and love.

1476
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:58,420
The revolution is now.
