1
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm so glad
you arrived in time to film me

2
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,133
at the most humiliating low point
imaginable of my entire existence.

3
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,075
I've spent 50 years
drowning in pleasure,

4
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,079
more pleasure than most people
ever experienced in a day,

5
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,672
and now that I'm like a monk
trapped in a monastery,

6
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,411
here comes the film crew.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,183
There is no way you can hear this.

8
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,690
No one knew my past.

9
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:00,953
I popped up out of nowhere,

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,029
and I was forever marked
as like, you know,

11
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,029
a self-hating enemy to gay people.

12
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,764
- Great.
- That's gonna come off.

13
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,532
All right. Don't!

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,541
I don't care. Butch.
It's butch to be sloppy.

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,242
Don't film me smoking,
'cause I told my family I quit.

16
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,475
- Okay.
- Fuck 'em.

17
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,390
I really don't feel comfortable
telling you this.

18
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,518
I would make them get down
on their knees and suck my di...

19
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,529
- I mean, I'm 51 years old, Daryl.
- I know, I know.

20
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,189
- It's just, you know.
- I know...

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,927
I can't think of anything
more unsexual

22
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,002
than listening to some old fart

23
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,264
talk about how he got
his dick sucked in 1979.

24
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,338
No, it's really interesting.

25
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,176
I really get under people's skin
because I've broken every rule,

26
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,016
I've done everything my own way,

27
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,581
I've done everything you can do
to kill yourself,

28
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,524
and I'm still standing.

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,863
Safe sex came about
because of three people.

30
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,835
Dr. Joseph Sonnabend,
who had the scientific background.

31
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,771
Michael Callen, who was
a beloved activist, who really...

32
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,570
gay men connected to
when he spoke

33
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,200
because he was so brutally honest.

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,871
And me, because I had
the health and the anger

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,414
to stay on top of the two of them.

36
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,040
Joe, who was busy with patients.

37
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,177
Michael who was, you know,
not in the best of health.

38
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,652
I had the energy and time

39
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,313
to make sure
the words got on the page,

40
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,357
the writing got done,
and the book got out.

41
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:58,903
It was Joe and Michael and Richard
who walked in and said it.

42
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,415
They said directly to men
that this was happening

43
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,076
and how to keep it from happening.

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,882
I think Richard and Michael
knew what they were talking about.

45
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,890
They were speaking
from the epicenter of the epidemic

46
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:19,124
and speaking truths
that people didn't want to hear

47
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,597
and didn't want to listen to.

48
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,731
The idea that gay men would wear
condoms was ludicrous in 1982.

49
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,775
They were using a...

50
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,506
...a vernacular, a vocabulary

51
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:41,076
that was very politically incorrect
in terms of the moment.

52
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:46,523
No matter what, the idea
of reducing exposure to fluids,

53
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,062
reducing exposure to fluids
that may contain infectious agents,

54
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,291
both are really, you know,
the cornerstones of safer sex.

55
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,926
I think people should know
who Richard Berkowitz is,

56
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,061
and I should hope that Richard

57
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:03,609
will come out
and say what it's done to his life.

58
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,072
What all of these people
just, you know,

59
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,911
not wanting to accept
what he had to say.

60
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,612
The frustration
and how he dealt with it.

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,204
The first week
that I had moved into my apartment,

62
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,505
you know, I suddenly felt like the kid
in the proverbial candy store,

63
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,979
because I was 23 years old,

64
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,982
I had my own place in Manhattan,

65
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:49,043
and the city was exploding
with sexual playgrounds.

66
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,713
I mean there were places
to go and have sex

67
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,983
morning, noon, and night.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,368
A lot of gay men
who lived the lifestyle I did...

69
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,800
it was who they were,
it was our identity.

70
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,701
It was what we lived for.

71
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,366
Gay liberation
began about men loving men,

72
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,308
but it became about so many men,
so little time.

73
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,109
And what that meant was,
so much dick, so little time.

74
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,447
It got taken over by this explosion
of commercial sex establishments

75
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,851
where the only thing that brought
gay men together was sex.

76
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,922
One night,
I was at the Rawhide Bar.

77
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,426
This was the beginning of the end.

78
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,657
And I met this really hot guy.

79
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,129
And we got it started.

80
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,722
We took one look at each other and
we knew we were gonna walk out

81
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,732
and go home and have sex.

82
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,097
And just as we turned
to leave the bar,

83
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,832
he said, "What is that bump
under your ear?"

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,432
I had completely blocked it
out of my mind.

85
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,139
And I could feel like the earth
quaking all around me,

86
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,477
and I didn't know what to say.

87
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,780
And he said, "Listen, I think
I'm gonna call it a night."

88
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,083
And I remember, like, leaning back
on the Pac-Man machine

89
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,182
feeling like a fucking leper,
like an abandoned leper,

90
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,354
and thinking, "Something's changing.
Something bad is happening."

91
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,829
<i>Atlanta, Georgia.</i>

92
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,093

98
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,874
<i>is a natural,
inevitable result of sin.</i>

99
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:29,717
incurable
and, so far, 100 percent fatal

100
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,848
because of promiscuous
homosexuality.

101
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,386
<i>Washington, D.C.</i>

102
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,521
<i>20,000 gay men marched

106
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,270
<i>and 70 percent of the victims have
been homosexual or bisexual men.</i>

107
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,844
At the very least,
there should be a quarantine

108
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:57,143
of all homosexuals, drug abusers,
and prostitutes

109
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,844
with the frank disease AIDS.

110
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,816
- Right now.
- A quarantine?

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,409
A quarantine.

112
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,013
They should be confined to quarters
or hospital if that is necessary.

113
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,524
AIDS was more
complicated than just a new germ.

114
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,061
There may be a new germ.
There may not be a new germ.

115
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,427
But there's a lot of things going on
in an urban-gay-male lifestyle

116
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,760
that are bad
for the immune system.

117
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,924
Let's look at what we know

118
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,265
and keep an open mind
for what we have yet to discover.

119
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,134
But it was an indictment
of urban promiscuity.

120
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,606
There is a new case
and a half each day

121
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,870
in New York City alone.

122
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,209
Do you know what it's like
to have 18 of your own friends

123
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,249
in a year and a half die?

124
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,184
Men who are at the height of
their creative usefulness to society?

125
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,882
All men under 50 years old?

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,054
In one year, I am asked to live
with the kind of problems...

127
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,631
or problems is the wrong word...

128
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,327
experiences that my mother,
at 84 years old,

129
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,030
is now having to learn to live with
when her friends are dying,

130
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,437
and I am only 47 years old.

131
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:00,342
Now, I don't think the straight
community has any concept

132
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,643
of what it's like to be a gay man
in this city.

133
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,410
It's like living in war time.

134
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,281
You don't know
when the bomb is gonna fall.

135
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,512
Who's it gonna hit next?

136
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,351
A friend of mine that I had
dinner with two months ago,

137
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,187
three weeks ago checks himself
into the emergency room

138
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,351
at St. Vincent's Hospital

139
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,985
and in 10 days is dead.

140
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,893
He seemed perfectly healthy.

141
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,933
What is this mysterious thing
that is in... who?

142
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,092
Do I have it?

143
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,433
This was
a gay white man's disease,

144
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:32,842
and that straight people like myself
didn't have to be bothered with it,

145
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,574
except with those of us
who had loved ones who were dying.

146
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,310
There were a lot of gay men

147
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,149
who wanted the straight world
and the media world

148
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:50,128
to believe that it was a virus
that any of us could catch

149
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,562
and that it wasn't a direct reflection

150
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,693
on their sexual behavior
or their lifestyle.

151
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,703
I do think
it is gross irresponsibility

152
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,468
for homosexuals active who go to
these bathhouses and the rest of it

153
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:08,172
to cry out that the government's
got to do research to save us

154
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,715
when they continue indulging
in the kind of activity

155
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,147
that spreads the disease.

156
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,946
It's the height of irresponsibility.

157
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,682
You've got to realize
the atmosphere of the times.

158
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,849
You know, we were trying
to get attention.

159
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,893
We were trying to get sympathy.

160
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,521
And you're not going to get sympathy
easily by going out and saying,

161
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,964
"I've slept with 500 people.

162
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,433
That's why I've got it."

163
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:36,566
Well, I mean most people would say,
"You deserve it," and, "Get lost!"

164
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,906
And that's what we were
trying to prevent.

165
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,587
I was a pretty
fucking angry 23-year-old.

166
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,179
I was politically angry.

167
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,987
I wanted America
to accept gay rights overnight,

168
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,222
and I had absolutely no patience
for the kind of time it takes

169
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,458
for social change to happen.

170
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,831
I grew in a family of Northeastern
liberal Jewish Democrats,

171
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,403
and that provided
very fertile ground

172
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,132
for my accepting of the whole
gay-liberation movement,

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,141
because, you know, we were
empathetic on social issues.

174
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,337
Someday,
you'll see me on television.

175
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,881
For my good looks and my shape.

176
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,813
Anything you want to know.

177
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,906
What do you want to know?

178
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,315
But he didn't tell me everything.

179
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,548
Richard was a delight growing up.

180
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:30,118
He gave me absolutely
no problems, and I had three sons.

181
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,129
They weren't bad either.

182
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,755
We weren't particularly wealthy.

183
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,855
We were kinda working class,

184
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39,904
and we were a family of five
living in a 41/2-room apartment.

185
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,473
And as the '60s were on,

186
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,771
and the Civil Rights Movement
started to emerge

187
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,639
and the anti-war movement
against Vietnam happened,

188
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,408
all of this was
just grist for the mill,

189
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,812
for, like, our family dinner.

190
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,579
We were compassionate about...
concerned for poor people.

191
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,450
We were working class ourselves.

192
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,353
You know, we were for Humphrey
and Johnson and Kennedy.

193
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,325
I mean, Kennedy
was really the one, you know,

194
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,420
because for family values
in the early 1960s,

195
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,796
we consider the Kennedy family
"family values."

196
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,334
We loved everybody,

197
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,064
and we felt that's the way to live.

198
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,901
And if anybody
didn't have a place to stay,

199
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,599
they came and stayed with me.

200
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,034
In between
my grandmother's death

201
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,908
and Kennedy's assassination,

202
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,915
which suddenly made it seem as if
the entire world was in mourning,

203
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,008
something happened
that I didn't understand

204
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,610
but it seemed to forever change
the course of my life.

205
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,522
My aunt started taking me
to Puerto Rico and Miami

206
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,752
on school vacations.

207
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,030
Somehow, being
a thousand miles away from home

208
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,863
with men I'd never see again

209
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,097
and didn't know my mother
or my father or my congregation,

210
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,664
I suddenly felt like, you know,
"I can do this. I won't be found out.

211
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,437
It's just another form
of masturbation,

212
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,308
and I want the blow job."

213
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,109
I did not like Richard being gay.

214
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,776
I don't like any of my sons to be gay.

215
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,718
But once I found out,
I'm getting used to it.

216
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,484
The whole world is gay.
We must be getting gay.

217
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,115
I was fascinated by the scene.

218
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,490
I was fascinated
by the whole cruising thing.

219
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,584
I mean, I was 15 years old.

220
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,993
I was innocent as can be.

221
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,998
They were all coming after me,

222
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,364
but I went with who I wanted
to go with,

223
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,731
I did what I wanted to do,

224
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,566
and I walked away when I wanted.

225
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,970
Richard had
a wonderful time when he went there,

226
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,770
But that's not
the only place he went to.

227
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,708
He went to other places.

228
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,143
I remember that
very first day pacing the driveway,

229
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,380
waiting for my father
to get home from work

230
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,687
so I could take the station wagon
and go to Howard Johnson's.

231
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,921
If you're going there every night
and just not knowing what to do

232
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,726
and being completely soaked
in sexual desire and yearning

233
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,733
and absolutely terrified
of the consequences

234
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,462
of being discovered here,

235
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,300
you know, it still didn't stop me
from going back.

236
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,806
And it was like this moment
where I said, you know,

237
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,367
"All my life I've tried to be a good
son, a good student, a good Jew,

238
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,937
a good American, a good brother,
a good everything.

239
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,577
This is bad, and it feels good."

240
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,646
The transgression
of doing something so forbidden

241
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,727
that had the potential
for so much desire,

242
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,194
so much sexual desire, you know?

243
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,321
When I go to college,

244
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,898
I'm not going to end up
like one of these guys

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,627
cruising seedy parking lots all night.

246
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,202
I had no idea there were
any other options.

247
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,533
And there weren't
many other options in 1973.

248
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,630
"I'm gonna go to college,
I'm gonna find myself a wife,

249
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,969
I'm gonna get married.

250
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:30,769
So you know something?

251
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,969
Until I go away to college
in September,

252
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,773
let me have my nine months

253
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,905
where I get this gay stuff
out of my system."

254
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,218
It was the first year

255
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,813
that they had completely
overhauled the curriculum

256
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,758
and replaced it
with all these radical theories

257
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,321
about social psychology and
the social construction of reality.

258
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,401
What is reality?
It's man-made.

259
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,835
And the question is,
if reality is man-made

260
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,907
and values are man-made,

261
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,237
why can't every person change?

262
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,503
You know,
it was a period of activism,

263
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,670
it was a period of extreme hopes
that you have

264
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,714
when you are
an undergraduate in college,

265
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,751
and he wanted to make
a statement, and he did.

266
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,649
I got swept up

267
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,950
into this whole Jane Fonda,
Gloria Steinem political thing.

268
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,922
I'm writing political things
for the paper,

269
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,357
and I'm organizing marches
and protesting.

270
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,055
You know, I finally felt
like I'd come home.

271
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,733
I mean, there was an
activism among the gay community,

272
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,205
but I think it was more urban.

273
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,333
It was certainly not
at a campus level.

274
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,241
And I think one of the things
that Rich did

275
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,611
was that he indeed
took that on as a banner.

276
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:48,653
And that continued on
for the second and/or third year,

277
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,948
with increments.

278
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,785
And there were a lot
of homophobic acts that occurred,

279
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,951
and Rich took them on,

280
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,357
took them up in a public forum,

281
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,225
which would have been writing
in the campus newspaper

282
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,763
and becoming known for that.

283
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,665
When the gay league
at school declared a Gay Day,

284
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,532
a National Gay Day,

285
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:10,337
and the Deke fraternity,
which was the frat for jocks,

286
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,239
to protest the Gay Day thing,

287
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:16,280
they hung an effigy from a tree
on their lawn on College Avenue

288
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,009
with a pool stick impaled through it.

289
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,985
And on the front of the effigy,
it said, "Back to your closet, homos."

290
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,386
And an the other side, it said,
"The only good gay is a dead gay."

291
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,949
And Rich
was very disturbed about it

292
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,020
and wanted to write about
what it meant and to take 'em on.

293
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,033
So I ran up
to the school paper and I thought,

294
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,693
"You know, I can either
get Walter and Trish

295
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,271
to go down and join
the lesbians on the stoop,

296
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,999
or I could write something."

297
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,974
He was very active
in organizing student groups

298
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,045
to lead a march in protest

299
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,842
of what this effigy that had been
hung on College Hall...

300
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,850
which was the main drag
of Rutgers College at the time.

301
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,715
Hundreds of people
marched in front of these frat...

302
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,654
this fraternity for these jocks,
took the effigy down,

303
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,487
marched in circles,
humiliated them,

304
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,652
made them retreat
inside their frat house.

305
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,962
It was an act of valor.

306
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,506
It's not easy to do that,
and Rich did.

307
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,803
It really was
the first gay-rights demonstration

308
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,740
in New Jersey.

309
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,072
Sparked by my article.

310
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,223
The first week
that I moved to Manhattan,

311
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,088
I went to the baths twice.

312
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,526
But since the one time I'd gone
to the baths in college,

313
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,995
when I missed the last bus
back to Rutgers,

314
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,260
I ended up staying overnight
in a bathhouse.

315
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,359
One guy sucked me,
and two days later,

316
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,769
I was at the school infirmary
with a case of penile gonorrhea.

317
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,001
So I remember, when I moved here,
being a little gun shy.

318
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,444
So I gave oral sex,
but I wouldn't receive it.

319
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,241
And sure enough,

320
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,942
three days later, I woke up
with piercing stomach cramps

321
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,040
and just...

322
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,744
I knew something
was really wrong.

323
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,448
So I ran like a maniac
down to Sheridan Square

324
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,458
to the Gay Men's Health Project,
which is now that Chase building.

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,428
And it was an SDT clinic
run by gay men for gay men.

326
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,227
And it was just by chance
matching walk-in patients

327
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,995
who didn't have appointments

328
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,263
with whatever doctor
was available at the moment

329
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,431
that my chart ended up in the hands
of Dr. Joseph Sonnabend.

330
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,441
I had no idea that at that moment

331
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,536
I was meeting the man who would
turn out to be my personal Moses.

332
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,359
Sonnabend was a research scientist.

333
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,429
He had actually been trained
as a virologist and a microbiologist,

334
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,430
none of which I knew

335
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,263
when I was running to him
to get my antibiotics all these years.

336
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,836
He was a lab scientist.

337
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,771
He had a background that was
absolutely perfect for AIDS.

338
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,435
I think that one
of the things that has made Joe

339
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,534
a different kind of doctor

340
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,774
is that he grew up
in what was then Rhodesia,

341
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:04,871
now is Zimbabwe.

342
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,975
His mother and his aunt were both
physicians who worked in the bush

343
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:13,286
and the circumstances
of disease and infection

344
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,555
were very different
in that environment,

345
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,629
but in some ways,

346
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:24,225
not unlike the peculiar ecosystem
of gay-male sexual culture

347
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,099
in the late '70s and early '80s.

348
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,437
People came to him in the city.

349
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,978
Not very many people
treated the diseases

350
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,809
that were being seen at that time.

351
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,213
I think the first
AIDS-related publication he founded,

352
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,182
<i>the journal AIDS.</i>

353
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,812
The first AIDS-related litigation
over civil rights issue

354
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:48,382
was when they tried
to kick him out of his office.

355
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:54,626
Joe early on questioned the
"one bug, one drug" approach to it,

356
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,701
which was how most
of the money was spent.

357
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,362
Most of the activism
was focused on the idea

358
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,871
<i>that there was a single agent</i>

359
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,535
and that it didn't have anything to do
with any other lifestyle factors

360
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,668
or anything else.

361
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,934
It became necessary to say,

362
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,008
"Why is this disease new
in all these different groups?"

363
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,441
And of course,
I suppose the most simplistic

364
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,706
and easiest way to view this

365
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,043
is that there was
a new biological agent

366
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,549
that was being transmitted
from group to group.

367
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,311
Do you believe that?

368
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,046
No, of course not.
I mean, it's absurd.

369
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,280
It's just totally absurd.

370
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,552
And it's based on a whole
superstructure of conjecture.

371
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,288
You know, Sonnabend's
idea that it's not a one-shot deal...

372
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,658
He said, "I don't know
if there's a new virus.

373
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,095
There may be
and there may not be.

374
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,430
But I can tell you this...
this lifestyle, it's killing people."

375
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,002
<i>Medical researchers seem to agree</i>

376
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,934
<i>that AIDS transmission in gay men</i>

377
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,133
<i>could be related to a sexually
promiscuous lifestyle.</i>

378
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,436
Is it a lifestyle issue?

379
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,601
I believe so, yes.

380
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,973
I think it's undoubted.

381
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,546
The disease in homosexual men

382
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:21,017
is the result of a cumulative process
resulting from lifestyle exposures.

383
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,145
The one characteristic
of this lifestyle is in fact

384
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,817
the promiscuous nature,
the sexually promiscuous nature of it.

385
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,022
Promiscuity was a bad... not a bad...

386
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,495
it was a dangerous activity.

387
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,760
No judgment.
It was no moral judgment.

388
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,633
It was just simply unhealthy
under the circumstances.

389
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,766
Joe early on argued
that it was multiple factors

390
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,173
that made someone sick.

391
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,746
Getting gonorrhea,
getting syphilis, getting hepatitis,

392
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,680
getting all these things
was a bad idea

393
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,014
because they could end up
giving you this new disease.

394
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,615
Joe was saying that
everything from multiple exposures

395
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:05,163
to sexually transmitted diseases,
to sleep, to diet, to drug use,

396
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:11,225
all these things were influencing
someone's susceptibility to disease.

397
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:16,399
And over time, that's been born out
in all sorts of different ways.

398
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,456
Gay men that were into oral sex,

399
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,124
their immune systems were fine.

400
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,499
Gay men who were tops,
their immune systems were fine.

401
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,663
Cytomegalovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus,

402
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,866
all these sexually-transmitted
virus infections...

403
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,839
these are not good for your health.

404
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,671
Running in here, getting antibiotics
to go back to the baths...

405
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,972
this is not good for your health.

406
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,173
The drugs people are doing
to have this amount of sex,

407
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,182
this kind of sex...
this is not good for your health.

408
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,252
How much more
do you need to know

409
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,685
to know that this lifestyle
has become toxic?

410
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,885
I got fucked at the baths,
and I'm sure that in New York City,

411
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,392
that's what put me at risk.

412
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,395
I mean, when you ask me to say,
you know, where I got HIV,

413
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,464
you know,
it could have been anywhere

414
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,827
between New York and Florida.

415
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:20,394
You know,
I don't think anybody can say.

416
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,802
Probably the most
important information

417
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,340
we have about AIDS is this...

418
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,876
we know who gets it,
we think we know why,

419
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,968
and we think that we can
keep people from getting it

420
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,310
by asking them
to change their behavior.

421
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,144
Now, if you think
that sounds simple, it does.

422
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,582
But, of course, getting people
to change their lifestyles

423
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,746
is just about the most difficult thing
you can ever try to do.

424
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,551
For now, there is no cure, though,

425
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,683
and prevention remains
the only hope we have

426
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,125
in keeping AIDS in check.

427
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,220
This lifestyle that these people

428
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,925
have been promoting all these years
is killing us.

429
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,296
How could I be so smart

430
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,099
and not understand something
that was right in front of my face?

431
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:54,831
I said to him,

432
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,840
"Look, I have a background
in writing and journalism.

433
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,103
I majored in journalism in college.

434
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,235
He said, "God, do I need help."

435
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,006
He said, "I've got an office
full of dying patients,

436
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,605
and no one is writing about
what people need to be saying.

437
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,013
They're throwing theme parties

438
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,211
like it's something happening
on the other side of the world.

439
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,811
Like they don't understand
this is gonna kill them.

440
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,619
There needs to be an alternative,
rational, sensible explanation

441
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,590
of what's going on

442
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,025
<i>that you are not going
to see in The Native</i>

443
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,029
and you're not going to hear
from Gay Men's Health Crisis.

444
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,760
Something that's critical
of the community that created this.

445
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,836
For gay men. For gay men."

446
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,633
So he fills my arms with all
these articles, and then he said,

447
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,604
"Oh, by the way," he said,

448
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,834
"I have another patient
that might be interested

449
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,136
in writing this article with you."

450
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,506
I'm like, "Where is he?
What's his name?

451
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,408
Give me his phone number."

452
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,276
I could swear,
about an hour or two later,

453
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:40,715
one of my phones started to ring,
and it was Dr. Sonnabend saying,

454
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,480
"Um, I didn't give him
your phone number,

455
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,645
but I spoke to Michael Callen.

456
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,881
The patient wants to write.

457
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,615
Here's his phone number."

458
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,453
He said,
"You should call him at work."

459
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,922
<i>28-year-old
Michael Callen is a singer</i>

460
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,659
<i>and accomplished pianist.</i>

461
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,234
<i>Like other ambitious artists,</i>

462
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,532
<i>he moved from the Midwest
to New York... a musician's Mecca...</i>

463
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,697
<i>to find work.</i>

464
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,708
<i>But it wasn't only music
he found here.</i>

465
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,110
By the age of 27,
after being out for 10 years,

466
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:14,151
<i>I had had hepatitis A, B, non-B,
herpes simplex types I & II, Shigella,</i>

467
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,653
<i>Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia,
nonspecific urethritis,</i>

468
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,657
gonorrhea, syphilis, um...

469
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,192
I could go on.

470
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,024
When I stepped back,

471
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,655
the question for me wasn't,
"Why am I sick?"

472
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,564
but, "How did I remain standing
on two feet so long?"

473
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,901
My getting sick has something
to do with my lifestyle.

474
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:39,636
And if I want to live,
I'm going to have to change.

475
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,336
Michael came home at some point

476
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,313
telling me that he'd met
this amazing guy

477
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,853
and that Joe had said
they ought to meet

478
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,582
and they'd been
to a support group together.

479
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:59,096
And most of the guys in the group
were all gloom and doom,

480
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:05,261
and this was the one guy
besides Mike

481
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,965
that seemed to have
some hope about surviving.

482
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,835
We decided to write an article

483
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:14,912
explaining Sonnabend's theory,

484
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,607
which became,
"We know who we are."

485
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,739
I think there
was no perception of them

486
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:56,310
because they didn't exist
as public figures at that point.

487
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,515
That was sort of the opening salvo,

488
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:06,462
was the beginning of their careers,
if you will, as AIDS activists.

489
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,098
At the twelfth hour,
as the article was going to press,

490
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,206
the publisher, Charles Ortleb,

491
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,833
had subtitled
"We Know Who We Are:

492
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,139
Two Gay Men
Declare War On Promiscuity."

493
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,941
And the minute I heard that, I said,

494
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,346
"You know, no one's even gonna
read a word of our article."

495
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,476
Richard's arrival
on the scene... and Michael's...

496
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:34,890
with that article was...

497
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,861
...unpleasant and a shock
and cold water in the face,

498
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:43,230
and I think most people
chose to disregard it.

499
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,359
I thought it
was incredibly powerful,

500
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,099
and I frankly was shocked
that people accused them

501
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,437
of sex negativity.

502
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,138
It seemed to me that the two of them
were the last people in the world

503
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,874
to be accused of sex negativity.

504
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,383
They were the paragons
of sex positivity

505
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,611
who were simply saying,

506
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,316
"We've seen what actually happened,
and it happened to us."

507
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,688
We were called the
Jerry Falwells of the gay community.

508
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,455
<i>We were attacked
over and over again in The Native.</i>

509
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,531
And Michael and I
kept responding to the attacks,

510
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,361
<i>and The Native
wouldn't publish them.</i>

511
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,925
So if you don't respond
or you're not able to respond

512
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,665
to attacks against what you've
written and what you've said,

513
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,434
people just assume
that you're wrong.

514
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,442
We also hear
some more hysterical voices.

515
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,672
They come from a tiny group of men,
some of whom have AIDS.

516
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,046
AIDS patients I know from my work
with the Gay Men's Health Crisis

517
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,948
don't agree with them.

518
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,853
They say the only responsible
alternative to monogamy

519
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,788
is virtual celibacy.

520
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,622
We who don't have lovers
are told that we have to give up sex

521
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,127
because of a new brand of ethics

522
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,097
invented by this
self-appointed group.

523
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,496
Who are these men?

524
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,798
I don't think their names are
important, but their histories are.

525
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,464
For example,
one is a former hustler,

526
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,838
an S&M hustler
who provided pain for a price.

527
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:03,277
This man probably had more sexual
contacts in 1 year than I did in 10.

528
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,178
He's not someone
who's going to lay down

529
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,444
the ethical agenda for my future.

530
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,423
I just, you know...

531
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,224
I understand your interest
in the whole hustling thing,

532
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,628
which is, like, the last thing
I want to be thinking about now.

533
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,963
It's the one thing I'm trying
to block out of my mind.

534
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,971
And it makes me uncomfortable
because it's so stigmatized

535
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,531
that not to put my life into a context
of meaningful relationships...

536
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,042
not with clients,

537
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,204
but with men that I had long term
monogamous relationships with...

538
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,910
<i>it just feels like
an Enquirer version of my life</i>

539
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,543
that I feel very uncomfortable with.

540
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,815
I'm 50 years old,
I'm all alone, and I'm broke.

541
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,855
You know, and I don't
wanna be sitting around

542
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,924
talking about being a hustler.

543
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,118
I don't.

544
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,220
I was never sure if it
was meant to discredit them

545
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,231
or to give them more authority,

546
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,427
but people talked about how
promiscuous they were, you know?

547
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,697
And Michael talked
about his promiscuity.

548
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,830
And Richard,
initially more in private,

549
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,841
but in time, became more public

550
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,538
and talked about his work
as a sex worker,

551
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,012
specifically as an S&M top.

552
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,051
He was pretty up-front
about his life,

553
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,813
including his hustling,

554
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,753
which in the beginning
of our knowing each other,

555
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,291
was not a full-time thing.

556
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,088
I'm pretty sure
he was still going to school.

557
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,927
<i>There was a national
gay newspaper called The Advocate,</i>

558
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,596
which was extremely influential
in my coming of age and coming out,

559
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,641
not just for the politics,
but also for the classified section,

560
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,801
which was really
an incredible mirror

561
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,607
on to what was happening
with gay men sexually.

562
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,773
<i>So I placed an ad in The Advocate.</i>

563
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,475
It took, like, a month or two
to come out.

564
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,178
So when the ad finally hit the stand
and the phone started ringing,

565
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,879
I was absolutely terrified.

566
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,479
Because of my fear of violence,

567
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,956
I would be very forceful
in getting them to talk about sex.

568
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,995
It kind of tapped
into something inside me

569
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,894
that I wasn't fully aware of,

570
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,899
but the guys who were
calling my ads were.

571
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,561
I didn't realize
that I exuded a quality

572
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,230
that was the essence
of a dominant S&M top.

573
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,604
They would start teaching me
how to be an S&M top.

574
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,472
They would start
buying me leather chaps

575
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,636
and cock rings and boots

576
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,577
and all these accoutrements,

577
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,775
and before I knew it, my apartment
started to look like a sex shop.

578
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,318
You know, guys would build
these homemade stockades

579
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,285
from the Pilgrims' times
and leave them here.

580
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,155
You know, with this well of anger
that I had as an activist and...

581
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,386
as the country started
moving towards the right

582
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,258
with the ascent of Ronald Reagan,

583
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,729
my anger only deepened.

584
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,927
And somehow,
there was something about S&M sex

585
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,733
that it became a channel for me
to release the anger

586
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,502
in a creative way, a sexual way,

587
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:53,608
that was liberating
and electrifying and...

588
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,980
...very lucrative.

589
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,385
What?

590
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,751
Say, "Fuck my hole."

591
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,223
I can't hear you.

592
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,089
Say it.

593
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,821
Say it, please.

594
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,829
Say, "Fuck my hole."

595
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,397
I can't hear you.

596
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,297
Say it louder.

597
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,440
We worked together a few times.

598
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,703
Yeah, he had this client Larry,

599
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,907
and Larry used to like
to watch him beat me up.

600
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:27,075
And he would bring
loads of drugs.

601
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,916
Richard could get very aggressive.

602
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,958
Richard could get... I think
Richard went into this place

603
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:41,988
where he could be
this macho hustler, you know,

604
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,900
where he's
a really sweet, gentle guy.

605
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,632
Because I know it happens for me.

606
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:53,540
He seemed to feel that
the ease with which it all happened

607
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,806
and the money it generated

608
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:00,977
was without a price to be paid.

609
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,982
I had enough ethical
standards not to hurt anybody,

610
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,358
but the more I did it,
the better I got.

611
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,122
In a matter of months,

612
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,257
I changed the ad to
"Experienced S&M Italian Top Man,"

613
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,335
and when I ran it by a client,
he said,

614
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,634
"You know what you should add?
'Who gets off on using you."'

615
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,808
And I said, "Is that what I do?"

616
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,174
And the minute
that ad appeared, it was...

617
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,712
Business boomed!

618
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,839
Pretty soon,
I started to describe it to friends

619
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,645
as like like a priest
with his own congregation

620
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,116
who came one at a time.

621
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,380
I had to put in a second phone.

622
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,082
I had to start keeping a log

623
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,022
so I could keep track
of all the people I spoke to,

624
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,184
the ones I saw,

625
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,663
and I started keeping a very
intricate log of every single client.

626
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,647
There actually was something
very intimate about S&M.

627
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,419
You had to talk,
you had to communicate.

628
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,493
You had to...

629
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,358
You know, it wasn't just like,
you know, a quickie fuck in the dark.

630
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,331
I mean, it was like a journey
that you had to take people on.

631
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:26,164
Each person ignited
a different response in me

632
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,832
that would take me
on a unique path.

633
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,494
Whatever they told me
they didn't want me to do

634
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,760
became the one thing
I had to do.

635
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,333
You know? 'Cause for a lot of guys,
it was, "I don't get fucked."

636
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,306
So the minute I had them
spread-eagled standing up, I'd say,

637
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,706
"You're gonna get fucked."

638
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,176
These hooks
were for spreading a bondage.

639
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,748
This was my favorite place
in the house

640
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,215
because there was room
to, like, walk around.

641
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,592
So I think even as gay men
were becoming liberated

642
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,162
and forming communities

643
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,062
and creating this very
sexualized community,

644
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,967
I think we kind of realized that we
were bringing a lot of self loathing,

645
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,531
a lot of insecurity, and a lot
of the culture's contempt to it,

646
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,473
that we were also
smart enough to realize

647
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,235
that while we were acting out

648
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,212
these domination,
submission, bondage,

649
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,716
humiliation,
leather fantasies in our sex,

650
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,844
that it didn't diminish
who we were as people,

651
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:55,221
that we were taking tensions from
the culture that we had absorbed.

652
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:00,193
We were using them as fodder
or grist for sexual play,

653
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,823
and when the play was over
and the curtain came down,

654
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,367
we hugged and kissed
and shook hands

655
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,563
and it was understood
that this was about sexual fantasy

656
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,197
and it wasn't about
who we were as people.

657
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,540
One day,
somebody calls me up and says,

658
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,177
"Mrs. Berkowitz,
your son was in Washington.

659
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,618
Did you hear?

660
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,715
A pin couldn't drop
when he started to speak.

661
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,454
He spoke,
and then not a soul moved.

662
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,588
A leaf didn't move.
He was so good."

663
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,564
This evening on "Freeman Reports,"

664
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:45,904
we are discussing Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

665
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,137
It is referred to as AIDS.

666
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,373
We are going to meet
two victims of AIDS.

667
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,882
First, meet Philip Lanzarotta
and then Richard Berkowitz.

668
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,783
Mr. Berkowitz is also co-founder
of the organization

669
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,446
Gay Men With AIDS.

670
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,046
And also meet Larry Kramer.

671
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,753
He's the co-founder of Gay Men's
Health Crisis, Incorporated.

672
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,556
So in December, 1982,

673
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,893
I got a phone call
from Lynne Hare,

674
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,398
a producer at CNN,

675
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,368
who asked me to appear
on a live broadcast for 40 minutes

676
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,565
discussing, you know, AIDS.

677
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,266
And I didn't want to it.

678
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,571
I was nervous, but Michael
had a singing engagement,

679
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,307
so I couldn't have him
take my place, so I had to do it.

680
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,145
So when I got down
to the CNN studios,

681
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:31,312
I was really nervous because
I knew that what I had to say,

682
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,516
gay men would find painful to hear.

683
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,458
And I was trying to stay calm,
and I had all these pages of notes,

684
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,655
and Larry Kramer
came marching up to me

685
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,254
the minute he saw me and said,

686
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,162
"I hope you're not going
on national television

687
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,327
and talking about gay promiscuity
in front of the whole country."

688
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,770
And I remember thinking,
"Of course I am."

689
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,842
I mean...
and the idea that someone

690
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,174
would tell me
not to talk about something...

691
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,746
it made me so angry

692
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,405
that as soon as the cameras
started rolling,

693
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,746
I suddenly couldn't construct
a single sentence

694
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,375
without the word "promiscuity."

695
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,282
You had mentioned earlier

696
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,413
it just happened
to the gay community.

697
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,958
It could have happened to anyone.

698
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,255
Why do you think it happened
to the gay community?

699
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,693
"No idea."

700
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,595
Mr. Berkowitz,
do you have any thoughts on that?

701
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,464
Yes, I do.

702
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,629
It's very difficult to talk about
promiscuity because as a gay man,

703
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,798
I am immediately accused
of being sex negative,

704
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:28,470
but my personal belief
is that promiscuity...

705
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,979
that homophobia
and sex negativity in America

706
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,947
is at the heart of promiscuity.

707
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,144
I don't believe that promiscuity

708
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,485
is really as liberating
as I thought it was

709
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,956
while I was being promiscuous.

710
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,323
I think it's really a response
to the fact that gay people

711
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,329
cannot be openly affectionate
in public.

712
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,367
And that kind of stigmatization
that we've all grown up with

713
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,370
has kind of led to a kind
of ghettoization of gay life,

714
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,939
especially among gay men.

715
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,874
And the urban promiscuity
of the last 15 years to me

716
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,774
seems rather unprecedented, but...

717
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,971
Yes, go ahead,
Mr. Berkowitz.

718
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,049
I just believe
that we're not fooling anyone

719
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,584
if we say that we're just
a community like anybody else,

720
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,551
and we just happened to get
a bug in our community,

721
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,919
so, you know,
"We didn't do this to ourselves.

722
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,355
Some virus is doing it to us."

723
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,016
As a victim of AIDS
who's recovering,

724
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,492
I think there's nothing
more important

725
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,723
than taking a little responsibility
for the state of my health

726
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,322
so then I can figure out
what I can do to get better.

727
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,232
Where we had difficulty
with what they were saying

728
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:30,205
was that they were tarring
and feathering everybody

729
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,798
with promiscuity,

730
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,070
and that was very hard
for people to take

731
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,475
and it made people very angry,

732
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:39,845
because we had fought
so long and so hard

733
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,080
to have the freedom that we won.

734
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,712
And suddenly it was killing us,

735
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,189
and that was very hard
for people to deal with.

736
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,784
It's not promiscuity
that's causing it.

737
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,195
It's promiscuity
that's allowing it to spread.

738
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,564
I hate to hear the word
"promiscuity" used in all of this

739
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:03,402
because it's a very,
very loaded word.

740
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,134
This is 1983.

741
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:10,407
Everybody in a major urban area
like New York and Los Angeles

742
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:17,420
and London and Paris leads
a life of more than one partner.

743
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,011
Now, can you say that everybody?

744
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,385
- Can you truly say that?
- An awful lot of people.

745
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,719
But you can't say "everybody."

746
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,225
No, I can't say everybody,

747
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,885
but I can say a great many people.

748
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,225
And what constitutes promiscuity?

749
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,764
Where do you draw your number?

750
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,096
We now have evidence.
It's not promiscuity...

751
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,794
Well, I think some of the numbers

752
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,235
that have been quoted
in a lot of the articles

753
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,137
and the numbers that came out
in that study from the CDC,

754
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,834
although it is several years old,

755
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,744
I mean, 1,000 partners?
1,100 partners?

756
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,476
The new CDC figures
are 200 and 300.

757
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,744
They have been reduced
down to that.

758
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,548
200 and 300?
That's still a lot of sexual partners.

759
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,349
It's a lot of sexual partners,

760
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,651
but I think that occurs
in the straight communities.

761
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,351
The swinging singles in New York

762
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,655
would have 200 or 300
sexual partners.

763
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,857
I realized many
years later, many, many years later,

764
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,526
that Larry was just trying
to be protective of gay men.

765
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,570
I mean, AIDS had started,
people were dying, nobody cared,

766
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,138
the community
didn't want to hear about it,

767
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,571
the media wasn't reporting on it,

768
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,336
and Larry was just trying
to be protective of gay men.

769
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,435
"Promiscuity" is a very loaded word.

770
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,174
What constitutes promiscuity,
you know?

771
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,806
One, two, three, four, five?

772
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,385
I mean, Richard came out
with these astronomical figures

773
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,783
which applied to Richard.

774
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:29,258
It didn't apply to other people who
were also getting sick and dying.

775
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,260
We believe
that AIDS are basically diseases

776
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,795
associated with poverty

777
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,195
and that through
urban promiscuity,

778
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,062
certain urban gay men

779
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,261
have managed
to recreate the disease setting

780
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,964
of Third World Nations and junkies.

781
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,061
Um...

782
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,010
How does that make you feel?

783
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,545
I can't worry
about how it makes me feel.

784
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,774
I'm more concerned
about the health of gay men.

785
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,282
I'm more worried
about disseminating information.

786
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,752
I don't believe that anyone
can defend promiscuity

787
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,551
in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
or New York City today.

788
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,116
Promiscuity in Des Moines
may be another story.

789
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,128
But right now in New York City,

790
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,629
the bottom line
has to be life and death.

791
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,427
It can't be a question
of politics or emotions

792
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,796
or public relations concerns.

793
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,301
We're talking about life and death.

794
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:18,001
I think the errors
of the government and the media...

795
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,542
Well, particularly the government
with the lack of attention

796
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:27,481
and the lack of support
and just the huge profound silence

797
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:31,043
and also,

798
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,387
a very in-your-face, like,
"We're not even gonna deal with it."

799
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,653
Before the media woke up to AIDS

800
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,227
and before the country
woke up to AIDS,

801
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,820
me and Michael and Sonnabend
knew what was coming.

802
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,296
I mean, we worked together
for an entire year

803
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,798
trying to wake up the community

804
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,869
before the country
woke up to the epidemic.

805
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,268
Probable cause
of AIDS has been found.

806
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,239
A variant of a known
human cancer virus.

807
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,900
<i>The Federal
Government announced</i>

808
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,773
<i>that it found what it was looking for.</i>

809
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,712
<i>A virus.
A virus that caused AIDS.</i>

810
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,079
<i>AIDS disappeared
from the news reports,</i>

811
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,879
<i>and people began to assume</i>

812
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,886
<i>that AIDS was finished
in this country.</i>

813
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,888
<i>But the problem of AIDS is not over.</i>

814
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,049
When people
have been told something definitive

815
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,058
such that the cause of the disease
has been found,

816
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,650
then I think it's all over.

817
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,592
It's a question of time.

818
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,458
We know what causes it

819
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,896
and therefore, it's a question
of time before the cure is found.

820
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,967
But AIDS isn't all over.

821
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:17,658
No, certainly not.

822
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,895
Nor have we found
the cause necessarily.

823
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,972
<i>One problem
has been that the virus</i>

824
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,597
<i>many people thought
was the single cause of AIDS</i>

825
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,175
<i>may not be that at all.</i>

826
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:30,577
<i>AIDS is a complex disease
that may have more than one cause.</i>

827
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,047
The perception
of the way diseases come about

828
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,881
is such that I think people
prefer simple disease models.

829
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,885
AIDS isn't simple.

830
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,080
No, I'm sure it's not.

831
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,453
<i>Research progress has been slow.</i>

832
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,925
Rich and Sonnabend
and Michael Callen's camp

833
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,495
was very small.

834
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:50,590
It was like a pup tent
compared to the big camp.

835
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,534
I think you might
be hard-pressed to even say

836
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,071
there were two camps
in terms of that.

837
00:42:56,173 --> 00:43:00,769
There was sort
of the gay community

838
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:05,872
and then there was Michael
and Joe and Richard...

839
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:06,915
on the other side.

840
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:10,009
And that's basically
how it seemed for a while.

841
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,985
They were hated

842
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:18,688
as my recollection
of Rich's stories at that time

843
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:23,631
was how they weren't even
accepted as, you know,

844
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:28,762
one possible thought or explanation.

845
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,808
What is the concept
that people deserve disease?

846
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,003
I mean, let's assume for a second

847
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,912
that AIDS is a direct result
of promiscuity

848
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,075
and the diseases associated with it.

849
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,244
Are we suggesting then

850
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,845
that we don't deserve increased
federal funding

851
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,821
because we've been bad boys?

852
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,483
It's unfortunate because promiscuity

853
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,686
did become the dogma
of gay-male liberation.

854
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,853
It's where all the money is.

855
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,225
That part of the reason
why the bath houses

856
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,561
have not really responded
to the health crisis,

857
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,430
because money is money,
and that's the bottom line.

858
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,402
Suddenly, we're thrust
into national visibility,

859
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,097
and we're just corroborating

860
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,608
a lot of the fears
and a lot of the prejudice

861
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,007
that people have about gay men.

862
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,773
It's because every time
we're on television,

863
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,178
we get to talk about our sex lives.

864
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,214
A light bulb went off in my head,

865
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,081
and I realized that there was
a lot of ways to have pleasure

866
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,848
that wouldn't involve any kind
of risk for infections.

867
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,548
We started
having this heated discussion.

868
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,592
I mean, Michael said,
"Oh, isn't that great?

869
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,354
You can whip and beat people
without spreading AIDS."

870
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:25,985
But Sonnabend said,
"Wait a second.

871
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,690
There are ways to have sex that
interrupt disease transmission."

872
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,495
And I remember thinking,
"Interrupt disease transmission."

873
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,968
I mean, it was visual,
it was captivating,

874
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,629
and it just completely propelled me.

875
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,938
I plopped down at my typewriter,

876
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,979
<i>and I remember typing
How to Have Sex in an Epidemic.</i>

877
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,945
And I remember thinking,
"That's a little arrogant."

878
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,607
And, you know, I am too arrogant,

879
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,550
<i>so I put a colon, One Approach.</i>

880
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,917
And Sonnabend said,
"This is more than an article.

881
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,284
This should be a booklet."

882
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,370
From my understanding,

883
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,340
the first document
advocating safer sex

884
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:16,402
as a way of preventing
the syndrome that looked like AIDS

885
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:21,246
was in a publication
by Mr. Callen and Mr. Berkowitz.

886
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,809
I believe, if I remember,
the name was

887
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,514
<i>How to Have Safe Sex
in an Epidemic.</i>

888
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,717
To me, it's the pamphlet
that is often cited,

889
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,761
and, you know,
is cited in the literature, as well,

890
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,228
as sort of the first
community-driven...

891
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,958
and really, only...

892
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,159
first document advocating safer sex.

893
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,362
And my recollection is '82?
So it was really early on.

894
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,633
So it's before there was
a lot of information

895
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,175
on why people were dying.

896
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,470
<i>How to Have Sex in an Epidemic</i>

897
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,409
just made such perfect sense.

898
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:55,748
You know, it said you don't have
to go to this monastic life

899
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,947
even if you thought
that might be feasible for you.

900
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:04,084
There is a way of rationally
having relationships

901
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,456
and protecting oneself.

902
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:11,967
So, tell me, Richard,
what is the theory behind this book?

903
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,833
Well, the prevailing
opinion about the cause of AIDS

904
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,396
appears to be
that there's a new AIDS agent,

905
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,976
presumably a virus,

906
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,738
that it's spreading
from group to group

907
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,144
and that one contact
with this putative agent

908
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,614
can cause the disease.

909
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:30,448
The real risk for developing AIDS
or CMV infection

910
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,284
is getting sperm up your ass.

911
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,985
It's avoiding the exchange
of certain bodily fluids

912
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,119
which could potentially
be infectious.

913
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,255
The strange thing
is that in attempting to counter

914
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,630
the claims of their opponents

915
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,999
that they were being sex negative,

916
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,904
they attempted to come up
with a regimen for safer sex

917
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:57,072
that essentially said that you can
continue the gay sexual revolution

918
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:02,141
in the midst of a fatal
sexually transmitted epidemic

919
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,686
by simply resorting
to a technological fix,

920
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,914
which is a condom.

921
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,752
There was nobody
else promoting condom use.

922
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,291
Absolutely not.
That I'm aware of.

923
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,382
I can't say there wasn't.

924
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,689
There may have been,
but I don't know of anybody else.

925
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,423
One thing
that if you were gay,

926
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,728
well, at least you didn't
have to use condoms, you know?

927
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,928
If nothing else.

928
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,473
And condoms were basically
completely foreign

929
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:27,408
to 99 percent of gay men.

930
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,603
Um...

931
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,705
So, yeah, the idea
that people would...

932
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,011
gay men would have sex
using condoms

933
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,552
was revolutionary.

934
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,350
We barely
had any official recognition.

935
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:44,120
The gay community as such
tried to actually buy us out.

936
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,786
After the book
had been out for a year

937
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,126
and was garnering
a lot of praise in the press,

938
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,565
Gay Men's Health Crisis
had to do something about it.

939
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:52,396
GMHC emerged

940
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,164
because the government
wasn't doing enough.

941
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,103
Or it wasn't doing hardly anything.

942
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:03,271
And, you know, it grew out
of just a handful of gay men

943
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,373
who were mostly from Chelsea
and Fire Island Pines,

944
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,385
who got together and said,
"We gotta start something."

945
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,579
It was like a church group.

946
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,019
It was like the Red Cross
or whatever.

947
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,454
It was not a political group at all.

948
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,923
We had people dying,

949
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,426
and we were trying to know
what to do with these people.

950
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,497
And the city wasn't helping
and the country wasn't helping

951
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,431
and how do you get 'em into
hospitals that don't want to take 'em

952
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,762
and how do you get wills drawn

953
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,862
and all of the actual
practical stuff of dying?

954
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:30,962
You know, we didn't have time

955
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:36,011
to go out
and pass out safe-sex things

956
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,877
when nobody knew
what safe sex was.

957
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,883
And unfortunately,

958
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:47,946
the Board of Directors of GMHC
was very conservative,

959
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:51,323
and they did not want
to say anything they couldn't prove.

960
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,295
So they made us
an offer to buy all our booklets

961
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,729
with one condition,

962
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:59,199
that the multifactorial theory
be deleted from the copy

963
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,670
so they could then distribute it
without raising the issue

964
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,071
of lifestyle factors
contributing to AIDS.

965
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:15,446
Tragedy is a great
source of public advancement,

966
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,919
and there are people
who get into the tragedy game

967
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,421
because it suits them.

968
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,515
It makes them famous
or it gives them money.

969
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,891
And we were
the competition, basically.

970
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,486
We were doing good for people,

971
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,828
but doing good for people,
we were doing it for nothing,

972
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:31,764
basically speaking.

973
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,701
There were people who like
to be seen doing good for people,

974
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,401
and so they took our work that did
good, like safe sex, for example.

975
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,637
The CDC was attributed
to inventing safe sex.

976
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,907
Well, they did everything
they could to stop us, actually.

977
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,040
I thought for sure
that even though the community

978
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,311
<i>hated what we said
in We Know Who We Are,</i>

979
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:53,014
that somehow they'd bite the bullet
and give us some money

980
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,784
<i>to turn
How to Have Sex in an Epidemic</i>

981
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,086
into safe-sex campaigns.

982
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,322
Year after year, we kept applying
for grants, applying for funding,

983
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,193
and everyone kept rejecting us.

984
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,597
So by the time 1985 came about,

985
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,134
our book had been out
for two years,

986
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,295
and there was still no safe sex
education being done

987
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,269
in New York City.

988
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,341
I mean, it was just infuriating

989
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,171
that personality conflicts
and political conflicts

990
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,404
could get in the way of getting
the message out to gay men

991
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,003
that there was a way
to prevent AIDS.

992
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:21,676
So a friend of mine,
a former client, said,

993
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:22,774
"You're beating your head
against the wall.

994
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:23,944
You're not getting anywhere.

995
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,487
Come live with me
for a year in Florida

996
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,319
and just do safe-sex education
in Miami."

997
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,258
So, I was kind of pissed off,
but I did.

998
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,055
I moved away.

999
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,598
I didn't want to adopt
an identity of a disease.

1000
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,030
I wanted to forget about it.

1001
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,193
I wasn't I couldn't undo
what I did before safe sex,

1002
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,362
and I felt like I was gonna be all
right for a decade or two afterwards.

1003
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,032
So my focus was just on safe sex.

1004
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,372
While Michael went off and worked
on all these other issues,

1005
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,878
I wanted to focus on the "sluts."

1006
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,745
Michael Callen was a founder

1007
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,284
of The People with AIDS Coalition,

1008
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,411
the Community Research Initiative,

1009
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,251
the People with AIDS Health Group.

1010
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:04,123
He served on the New York State
AIDS Advisory Council.

1011
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,096
<i>He was the founding editor of the
People with AIDS Coalition Newsline.</i>

1012
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,225
Michael, because
he was dying of this disease,

1013
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,996
you know, couldn't walk away from it.

1014
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,299
And by the late '80s,
he was singing at rallies,

1015
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,273
he was singing at, you know,
national marches,

1016
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,742
and, you know, he kind of became
a celebrated hero.

1017
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:29,183
<i>I have tried to sing my song right</i>

1018
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:36,787
<i>I have tried to sing my song right</i>

1019
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:44,660
<i>I have tried to sing my song right</i>

1020
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:52,174
<i>Be sure to let me hear...</i>

1021
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:59,010
<i>...from you</i>

1022
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,811
After a year in Florida,

1023
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,083
I came back to New York City

1024
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,421
because I... I don't know.

1025
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,926
I kind of felt like, you know,

1026
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:16,260
how can I walk away from a war
that's killing my community?

1027
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:22,303
I put the first escort ad in
the Advocate promoting safe sex,

1028
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:27,069
and soon after a lot of other ads
started mentioning safe sex, too.

1029
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:34,447
I just was mesmerized
by Rich's...

1030
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:39,215
by Rich's knowledge
and his quest for more knowledge.

1031
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:43,383
Oh, he was impeccably safe.
Impeccably.

1032
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:49,227
And I learned that you have to
clean off the dildo and what to use.

1033
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,732
And what he really did

1034
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:58,206
was he made safe sex sexy.

1035
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:01,402
I felt safe sex was the
one thing that could save my friends.

1036
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,102
You know?

1037
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,409
I felt it was the one thing
that could save the community.

1038
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,110
And because unlike
what gay men were being told,

1039
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,380
that once you
got exposed to the virus,

1040
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,614
there was no more hope,

1041
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,555
Sonnabend said to me,
"Even if you're exposed to the virus,

1042
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,786
safe sex will still prolong your life.

1043
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,759
Safe sex will still
protect your partners.

1044
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,330
Safe sex will still
protect your health.

1045
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,558
And no one else was saying that.

1046
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,431
And I think what was radical
about what Rich did

1047
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:31,633
was to promote safe sex
without giving up on sex.

1048
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,766
I mean, to promote safe sex,

1049
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,368
but still believe that one could have

1050
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:41,849
a varied, exciting,
satisfying sex life

1051
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,613
was a really radical thing

1052
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,121
because the two camps, you know,

1053
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,988
kind of formed themselves along

1054
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,585
what many people thought
was these hard lines.

1055
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:58,498
Like, you were either pro sex,
100 percent,

1056
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,230
in all of its unsafe forms,

1057
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:05,001
or you were anti-sex
if you believed in safe sex.

1058
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:09,238
And Rich always fought
for there to be a middle ground

1059
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:14,909
where safe sex could still
be fun sex and satisfying sex.

1060
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,144
Well, I tried
to come out and say bluntly

1061
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,846
it is caused by having sex.

1062
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,286
Please try and stop.

1063
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,187
And is that
what you've done yourself?

1064
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,554
Indeed, yes indeed.

1065
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,753
I think I would be terrified
at this point

1066
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,921
with that sort of Damocles
hanging over my head,

1067
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,089
especially in New York City.

1068
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:29,858
I don't have anybody...

1069
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,489
I don't know how anybody,

1070
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,068
how any gay man could have sex
in New York City.

1071
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,602
Mr. Callen?

1072
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,295
I just...

1073
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:39,034
It's just so incredible to me
that people cling to this myth

1074
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,770
that you can get AIDS
from a single contact.

1075
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,072
I think we have
a case here of,

1076
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,612
"What difference does it make?"

1077
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,081
It's caused by either your way
or my way or both ways.

1078
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,880
And either way, it can kill you.

1079
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:54,047
And it really is irrelevant if it's
many contacts or one contact.

1080
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:54,885
Either way,

1081
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,824
you're playing Russian Roulette
every time you have sex,

1082
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,224
and that's the issue.

1083
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,421
Well, I think it's important, Larry.

1084
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,929
It's not giving up sex.

1085
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,126
It's modifying
the kinds of sex you have

1086
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:09,569
to avoid the potential
transmission of bodily fluids

1087
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,972
thought to be infectious.

1088
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,137
They keep talking
about this disease like it's a virus,

1089
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,874
but... and it's Russian Roulette,

1090
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,108
and once you get the virus, you die.

1091
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,081
But cut down on your partners?

1092
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,050
Cut down on your partners?
What is that?

1093
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,054
You know, play Russian Roulette,

1094
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,748
but put the bullet in the gun
less often?

1095
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,451
And if they're advising people
to cut down

1096
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,121
when they believe one
sexual contact can kill you,

1097
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,221
you know, who the hell
are they talking to?

1098
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,891
Who the hell
needs advice like that?

1099
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:38,831
What are these people...?

1100
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,027
Where are their minds?

1101
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,262
Where are their ethics?

1102
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,497
Where are their brains?

1103
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,697
As it turns out,

1104
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:47,709
it's better to have safe sex
with 40 people in a back room

1105
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,803
than to have unsafe sex
with your lover in the bedroom.

1106
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:55,874
But nobody in America was prepared
to say that or even think that.

1107
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:00,115
I mean, I think
people prefer simple answers

1108
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,781
to complicated questions,

1109
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,188
even when they're wrong.

1110
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,124
I mean, that's one thing
I've learned from AIDS.

1111
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,525
It kind of astounds me.

1112
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,290
But Joe's theory was...

1113
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:11,561
And in that light, Joe's theory
was much more complicated

1114
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,260
than just saying,
"There's a new AIDS virus.

1115
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,463
If you catch it, you die.
If you don't catch it, you're okay."

1116
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,268
I have heard
of Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, yes.

1117
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:23,711
I would say his belief
was possible to hold

1118
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,075
in the early '80s,

1119
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,775
but not in the very late '80s
and through the '90s

1120
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,580
and certainly
not possible at all today.

1121
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,247
There could be
lots of multifactorial things,

1122
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,687
but at the end of the day,

1123
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,983
at least from my perspective

1124
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,719
and probably the perspective
of most folks

1125
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,456
who sort of do allopathic
medicine in the United States...

1126
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,622
most...

1127
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:47,294
HIV is the cause of AIDS and the
syndromes associated with AIDS,

1128
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,395
but there could be
a lot of cofactors.

1129
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,530
Like 100 percent.

1130
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,164
Cofactors can absolutely exist.

1131
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,676
Are there some that are infectious?
Probably.

1132
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,304
Do we know all of them?
No.

1133
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,712
There is incontrovertible evidence

1134
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:05,652
that HIV is the cause
and the only cause for AIDS.

1135
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,555
And those people
who maintain belief to the contrary

1136
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:14,528
are fantasists or they
have a political agenda.

1137
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:18,192
In the corporate community,
it either is or it isn't.

1138
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,929
In the scientific community...

1139
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:25,201
and most of the activists
that I work with...

1140
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,798
it's a matter of degree,

1141
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,741
and it seems to be different
in different people,

1142
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,403
which we are finding out
more about now

1143
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:32,174
as genetic factors and so on.

1144
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,840
There are all sorts of things

1145
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:39,718
that influence how nasty
the virus is in any given person.

1146
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,518
I think there
are probably lots of people

1147
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:45,685
who are walking around with HIV,
and they're never gonna get sick.

1148
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:51,290
And other people get it and within
two or three years, they're dead.

1149
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:55,531
So, other things are going on.

1150
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,367
I certainly still
believe that cytomegalovirus

1151
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,408
plays a role in AIDS.

1152
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,601
And, in fact,

1153
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,769
the most respected
scientific journal in Europe,

1154
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,846
<i>The Lancet,</i>

1155
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,040
posted an editorial
by all the editors

1156
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,049
about a year ago
during the summer

1157
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:12,611
saying that cytomegalovirus was
necessary with HIV to cause AIDS.

1158
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,314
So, I'm still a multifactorialist.

1159
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:18,588
I just learned the hard way,
you know, not to rule out HIV...

1160
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,186
as I so arrogantly did
for many years.

1161
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,095
Now, I would say
with what we know

1162
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,829
and a lot of clinical studies
and a lot of clinical data,

1163
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:34,103
I and most folks believe
that HIV is the infectious particle

1164
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,373
that causes the syndrome
that we call AIDS.

1165
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,175
If you go on
the Internet and do a search,

1166
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,544
a Google search on me,

1167
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,845
I'm tied in with all these lunatics,

1168
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,579
and I just wish I...

1169
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,281
I'm just glad to have the opportunity
to say that, you know,

1170
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,985
the HIV is absolutely essential
to AIDS.

1171
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,028
The AIDS drugs
have saved my life.

1172
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,562
I think that they were prescribed...

1173
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,098
based on what I've seen
with a lot of people,

1174
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,761
I think they're prescribed way
too early and in way too high doses.

1175
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,861
I mean, the great thing
that Sonnabend did with me was

1176
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,406
he didn't start me
on any AIDS drugs

1177
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,032
until I absolutely needed them.

1178
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,134
Every single drug is there

1179
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:15,081
because we went,
and we fought like tooth and nail.

1180
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,176
We made the government
study what we wanted,

1181
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:22,088
made the clinical trials
reflect what we needed.

1182
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,220
When I was
at the peak of my questioning

1183
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,090
whether or not HIV
had any kind of role in AIDS,

1184
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,493
I came down with AIDS in 1995.

1185
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,463
And Sonnabend got me hooked up

1186
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:07,730
with a protease inhibitor study
in Philadelphia in 1995,

1187
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:08,997
and I had lost all hope.

1188
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,436
I figured, "I'm covered with lesions,

1189
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,202
<i>I've got molluscum contagiosum
all over my body,</i>

1190
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,106
I've got 5 T-cells,
I'm a dead man."

1191
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:19,739
The drug companies
are giving horrible misinformation.

1192
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,817
Horrible misinformation.

1193
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:27,049
And they're avoiding a class
of people like myself who are dying,

1194
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,648
who are in agony,
in horrible pain.

1195
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,954
Under the Bush administration,

1196
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:36,896
they are co-conspirators, if you will,
with public health officials,

1197
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,401
because someone who is treated
is vastly less infectious.

1198
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,767
So, they're trying
to prevent new infections

1199
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,363
by treating everybody who has HIV,

1200
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,409
regardless of whether
they need it or not.

1201
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,273
It's independent
of whether they need or not.

1202
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:52,439
And they don't quite officially
say everything,

1203
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,609
but particularly for people
who are already marginalized,

1204
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,812
people who are poor,
people of color,

1205
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,651
when they go into their clinic,
and they find out they're positive,

1206
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,316
they're not left really with,

1207
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,553
"You have a decision to make
whether to go on treatment."

1208
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,822
They're all told they've
got to begin treatment,

1209
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,556
you know,
often with tremendous urgency.

1210
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,064
You know,
they're really anxious about it.

1211
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,133
Well, the most
important thing to say

1212
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,098
about the AIDS drugs

1213
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,135
is that we're still
tabulating their side effects,

1214
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,671
and it's a pretty long list,
and it grows longer by the year.

1215
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:20,470
So the idea that all you have
to do is pop these pills...

1216
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,840
You know, these AIDS drugs are not
like smoking something in a pipe.

1217
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:29,714
This is serious chemo,
and it's a part-time job.

1218
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,753
You know, running to doctors,
getting your blood tested,

1219
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,617
going to the pharmacy,
getting the prescriptions,

1220
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:35,714
filling out the insurance forms.

1221
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,292
You don't want this.
I'm telling you.

1222
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,724
Taking all those drugs.

1223
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,491
I take 18 to 20 different drugs

1224
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:47,228
besides the herbs that I take
and supplements.

1225
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:52,797
I mean, I'm always taking
damn pills, and it's ruining my body.

1226
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,774
There are
an awful lot of gay men

1227
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,606
who are being
responsible and safe,

1228
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,407
but there are also a lot
of gay men who aren't.

1229
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:33,573
And they're young,
and they're in their 20s.

1230
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,116
I think youth
are dealing with, you know,

1231
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,550
particularly in urban areas,

1232
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,052
a lot of stigma and silencing

1233
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:45,219
around HIV, sexuality,
desire in general.

1234
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,693
But I think certainly

1235
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:51,392
we need to start looking
at how we address homophobia

1236
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:56,666
and racism and those
sort of cultural disparities

1237
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,641
that are impacting this community

1238
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,507
and these communities which
are now disproportionately affected.

1239
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,844
Fear is the thing
that motivates people

1240
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,780
to make any difficult
behavior change,

1241
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,149
whether it's quitting smoking
or losing weight or whatever.

1242
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,313
You're afraid of the consequences
of what's gonna happen

1243
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,821
if you don't change your behavior.

1244
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:21,193
It's very difficult to imagine
how any safer-sex idea

1245
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,232
can even get promulgated
in the gay community now.

1246
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,234
If you're not afraid,
you don't even read publications.

1247
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,167
You don't read the pamphlets
that they print,

1248
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,933
because you're not afraid anymore.

1249
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,268
So why even bother to read it?

1250
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,707
If I get infected,
I'll take some pills.

1251
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,438
I know a million guys
that are infected.

1252
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:37,410
They all look great.

1253
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:38,980
They're getting steroids.
They're pumped up.

1254
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:39,740
They look terrific.

1255
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,874
You know, what's the big deal?

1256
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,317
They, of course,
had fear on their side back then.

1257
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:51,087
Unfortunately, right now,
we don't have much talk about AIDS.

1258
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,253
A lot of people think that it's over.

1259
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:57,128
Older people think that it's not
a big issue any longer,

1260
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,896
and so a lot of young people
have this fatigue and desire

1261
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,595
to have sex without condoms

1262
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,297
because yes, it feels good.

1263
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,238
You know, it feels more real.

1264
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,335
If Richard
began his crusade again today,

1265
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:15,850
if Michael Callen came back
from the dead and called a rally,

1266
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,386
I'm afraid no one would come.

1267
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,455
I think activism is dead.

1268
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,818
I was an activist.

1269
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,951
The activists that are alive,
some of us are in horrible condition.

1270
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,964
You know, we're tired,
and the rest died.

1271
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,529
I thought it was all gonna change.

1272
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,604
There was something beautiful
about the time

1273
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,104
when everybody was dying.

1274
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,471
We all came
so close to each other.

1275
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,976
We took care of people.

1276
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,555
Why wasn't Richard
more of an activist?

1277
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,549
Michael started these organizations,

1278
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,287
a couple of them,
two or three of them.

1279
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,989
Did Richard participate in those?

1280
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,963
Richard was lost for a few years

1281
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,400
to crack and God-knows-what.

1282
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,438
And he was just thoroughly useless

1283
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,700
to the extent that Michael Callen
walked out on him

1284
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,969
and just wouldn't talk to him.

1285
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,476
Then he went off to Florida,

1286
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,444
you know, this sexual craziness.

1287
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,775
He's a very fetching...

1288
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,406
you know, very appealing
and all of this,

1289
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:25,009
but it sort of hides a kind
of terrible reality in a way

1290
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,952
because you know,
as fun-loving as it is,

1291
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:29,456
it's a totally horrible profession,

1292
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,617
sex for money.

1293
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,558
It's degrading.

1294
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:38,600
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna say that to Richard.

1295
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,066
And I think it's a miracle
that Richard

1296
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,296
has come through
all of this, you know,

1297
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:46,307
with his wits about him
and with some insight.

1298
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,842
I smoked crack. I mean...

1299
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,377
- I can't just say it.
- No, but...

1300
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,446
I can't list it like a grocery list.

1301
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,276
I've gotta put it
into some kind of human context

1302
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,009
to explain why I did the drugs.

1303
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,516
I went away to Florida for a year,

1304
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,450
and when I came back
to resume hustling

1305
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,818
after AIDS was really in full force,

1306
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,982
I thought I could do it
without the drugs,

1307
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,892
but I didn't expect
to be having clients coming in

1308
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,897
with lesions
and signs of illness and...

1309
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,435
I mean, I felt so in control
of what I was doing safe-sexwise,

1310
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:17,495
but it was like death
kept entering into the scenes

1311
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,903
and into the erotic moments.

1312
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,475
I mean, before AIDS,

1313
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,340
the use of drugs was
about the inability of gay men

1314
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:24,936
to be intimate with each other.

1315
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,743
And so the drugs
was the way to, you know,

1316
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,010
to numb our vulnerability

1317
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,178
and our fear of being intimate
with one another

1318
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,553
and a kind of self-hatred
that we absorbed from the culture

1319
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,718
that made it difficult for us
to express affection with each other.

1320
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,592
So sex became a drug in itself,

1321
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,165
because we would have
all of this physical pleasure,

1322
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,258
but it was like we were afraid
to get to know who each other was.

1323
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,635
So we hid behind these fantasies
of what we wanted

1324
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,675
because, you know, the sensitive,
vulnerable gay men

1325
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,300
that most of us were,

1326
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:58,278
most of us didn't want for sex,
you know?

1327
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:03,444
After AIDS, I think drugs
were about numbing the pain

1328
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,019
of what was happening.

1329
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,611
Do you expect me to say

1330
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,885
that Richard was rendered
incapable by his use of crack?

1331
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,187
I can't. I can't do that.

1332
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,592
Was that why,
though, he didn't do more?

1333
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,289
Of course that's why! Yes!

1334
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:24,537
Throughout the '80s,

1335
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,542
I did an awful lot of work for no pay
trying to promote safe sex

1336
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:34,412
against this huge tidal wave
of, you know, the gay community

1337
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,815
just really not liking
what I was saying

1338
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,546
and really not wanting me
to be heard.

1339
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,554
And it was really hard
to get published.

1340
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:44,183
I mean, I spent years writing articles
that never saw the light of print.

1341
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,591
And I spent years carrying
booklets around,

1342
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:47,957
going to conferences,

1343
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,395
you know, helping journalists,

1344
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,466
and I never got paid
for any of that.

1345
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:56,231
I just have great admiration
for Richard Berkowitz.

1346
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:01,071
And part of me has some anger
that he didn't get that out earlier.

1347
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,644
His book.

1348
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,303
Michael had always felt that...

1349
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,382
from the conversations that we had
where we just talked about our lives

1350
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:10,816
and growing up and how a nice
Jewish boy ended up hustling

1351
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,616
that it was my...

1352
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,986
it was destiny
for me to write the book

1353
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,686
about how the three of us came
together and invented safe sex

1354
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:20,352
from the point of view
of a sex worker.

1355
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:24,126
Because I mean, who better
to write about, you know, sex

1356
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:25,700
and how safe sex came about

1357
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,962
than someone
who was a professional.

1358
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:32,837
Anyway, so...

1359
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,603
I think it should definitely
win an award

1360
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,043
for the ugliest cover ever created.

1361
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:40,047
But, I, you know, I love it.

1362
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:44,085
I mean, writing this book
was an absolute joy.

1363
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,211
For 11 months,
I got up every morning,

1364
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,187
went to my computer,

1365
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,817
and just knowing
that everything that I was writing

1366
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,988
was gonna end up published in
a hardcover book with a glossy jacket,

1367
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:59,625
after spending so many years writing
articles that never got published

1368
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,295
or got butchered
or got watered down

1369
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,632
and censored and whitewashed,

1370
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,036
to know that what I was writing

1371
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,870
was absolutely
gonna end up in a book

1372
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,810
was, as a writer, it was the pinnacle
of all my years of writing.

1373
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,473
He put an awful lot into that book.

1374
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:20,183
But I don't think it was enough sex.

1375
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,519
That's what sells books.

1376
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,649
And good-looking women.

1377
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:47,540
How do I make money?

1378
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,981
I'm on disability.

1379
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,247
I'm completely entitled to it, and
I'm not ashamed to take my check.

1380
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,120
It's $710 a month.

1381
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,193
400 and something goes to rent,

1382
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,659
100 goes to Con Ed,

1383
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:00,820
100 goes to cable,

1384
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,333
and I've got about $60-70
to live with a month.

1385
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:09,370
But I still have former clients
who help me out here and there,

1386
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,962
just send me money,
put it in my account, you know,

1387
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,098
when I need
some spending money,

1388
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,473
you know,
for an emergency or stuff.

1389
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,944
And, you know, my family's there
when I need something,

1390
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,571
but basically I'm impoverished.

1391
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,415
The biggest impact, I think,

1392
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,422
that the years of AIDS had on Rich

1393
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:32,085
was seeing so many
of his friends die

1394
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:39,362
and being a really close friend
and witness to their illness and death

1395
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:43,996
and feeling that
for so many people who died,

1396
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,097
even well beyond his friends,

1397
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,675
it was avoidable.

1398
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,539
It could have been avoidable,

1399
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:55,777
and I think he feels
a great sense of personal failure

1400
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,215
at not having been able

1401
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:04,987
to communicate his beliefs
well enough to more people

1402
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:10,293
so that they
would have taken more care

1403
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,631
in terms of their, you know,
sexual lives

1404
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,432
and be alive.

1405
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:19,063
All three of the men
I had long-term relationships with

1406
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:21,574
ended up committing suicide.

1407
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:23,867
I understand it.

1408
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,344
I do. I understand it.

1409
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,176
I understand...

1410
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:30,616
I understand, as a gay man,

1411
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,243
especially in the age of AIDS,

1412
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:36,552
that people reach a point
where they don't wanna go on living.

1413
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,717
It's too painful.

1414
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,293
It's too unendurable.

1415
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,356
No, no.
I haven't heard of Richard Berkowitz.

1416
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,830
Have you heard of Michael Callen?

1417
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,457
Oh, actually, yes.
Michael Callen.

1418
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,694
I knew Michael Callen.

1419
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,963
We were friends.

1420
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,869
I've never heard
of Richard Berkowitz.

1421
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,272
I think I've heard
about Richard Berkowitz.

1422
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,037
The name sounds familiar.

1423
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,841
I don't...
I cannot comment much.

1424
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,915
I've never heard
of Richard Berkowitz.

1425
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,745
Have you ever heard
of Michael Callen?

1426
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,512
Yes.
I've heard of Michael Callen.

1427
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,248
I think it's a testament
to how important

1428
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,290
the work we did together was

1429
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,791
that 25 years later,

1430
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,919
probably the biggest
and most important

1431
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,896
gay and lesbian health center
in the city

1432
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,331
is named for Michael Callen.

1433
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,946
My name is Richard Berkowitz.

1434
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,607
I wrote this book
about how safe sex began,

1435
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,651
and half of the book
is about Michael Callen.

1436
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:37,548
Okay.

1437
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,281
So, they're not gonna film people.

1438
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:44,553
They just want to get the shot
of him on the wall.

1439
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,456
Okay. As long as it stays...

1440
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,084
They were best friends.

1441
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,355
- Okay.
- Okay.

1442
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:48,828
As long as there's
not a patient involved.

1443
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:49,420
Right.

1444
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,362
But in the future,
if you ever want to do something,

1445
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,061
there's a... on our Internet site,
there's a communications guide,

1446
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,138
because normally,
it's very intimidating for patients.

1447
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,070
I understand.
I'm gay, so I understand.

1448
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,163
- They want their privacy.
- Right.

1449
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,333
Especially in a place like this.

1450
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,273
- Yeah.
- I understand that.

1451
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,436
- Okay.
- Okay.

1452
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,706
"In the end, for each individual,

1453
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:09,978
it is as rational to it believe he
or she will be among the survivors

1454
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,713
as it is to assume
that he or she won't.

1455
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:14,413
We must fix our hearts and minds

1456
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:18,857
on a clear image of the day when
AIDS is no longer... is no more.

1457
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,258
Make no mistake about it.

1458
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,420
That day will come."

1459
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,998
I mean, Michael's whole message
was about hope.

1460
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,293
And I think that was the one thing

1461
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,063
that Sonnabend gave
to me and Michael

1462
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,333
that most gay men,
in terms of AIDS, never got.

1463
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:36,343
I hope that this movie
helps to promote safe sex

1464
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:37,912
and to know the people

1465
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:43,315
and how they struggled
to get people to believe

1466
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:47,617
that safe sex was the only thing
that was gonna save us.

1467
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:52,319
I think no one's
ever taken a moment

1468
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,864
in the 25-plus years
since AIDS started

1469
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,659
to ever pat gay men
on the back and say,

1470
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:58,790
"You know something?

1471
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,425
There are still people
getting infected,

1472
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,471
but you've done an incredible job
and you should be proud of yourself."

1473
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,335
No one's ever said that.

1474
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,669
Everyone's always looking at,

1475
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:10,074
there's a 1 percent infection rate,
there's a 2 percent infection rate.

1476
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,841
But what about the infection rate
that isn't, you know?

1477
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,315
I think gay men have been
extraordinarily responsible

1478
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,386
in protecting themselves
and their partners

1479
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,613
for a very long time,

1480
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,155
and no one's ever once
taken a moment to say,

1481
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,249
"You know something?
You've done a good job."
