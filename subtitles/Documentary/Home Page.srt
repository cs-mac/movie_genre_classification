1
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,519
Ah, we haven't met.

2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,559
I'm putting out rubbish, obsessively.

3
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,080
Do you want me to take it downstairs for you?

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,839
No! No, no, it's fine. I'll do it later.

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,360
I've been living here for a year
and I've never caught sight of you.

6
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,760
-I'm Nancy Pierpan.
-Johnny Worricker. How do you do?

7
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,919
I'm wondering if I could ask you in for a drink.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,480
But you seem to have company.

9
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,160
Exactly.

10
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,160
That is why I am asking you in.

11
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,720
-So you started a website?
-That's right.

12
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,679
It's a place where people can make contact.

13
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,440
People find it easier to talk
to a machine than they do direct.

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,839
Is that so?

15
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,639
Couples talk best in the car

16
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,199
'cause they're side by side, they
don't have to look at each other.

17
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,960
-Was it you who noticed that?
-That was my mum, actually.

18
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,559
Well, this has been nice,

19
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,279
but, bad news, Ralph, I'm going
to have to throw you out.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,160
What, do you mean right now?

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,279
It's my fault. I'd completely forgotten that
I promised to talk to Johnny about his novel.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,039
-Johnny writes novels?
-Yes.

23
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,960
<i>Am I going to see you soon?</i>

24
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,440
Of course. I'm going to call you.

25
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,199
-It was great to see where you live.
-Yes.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,919
It was nice for me, too.

27
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh, God, I’m so sorry. I want to apologise.

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,039
There’s no need to apologise.

29
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,800
I assume you asked the young man
back and then changed your mind.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, that's what happened.

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,399
Whose novel is that?

32
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,080
I would love it if you stayed
and had a glass of wine with me.

33
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,919
I can't. I've got to go home.

34
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,679
It's because I'm out of practice.

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
You'll have to explain.

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Well, it's been a long time
since I asked anyone back.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,960
And, um... Has this ever happened to you?

38
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,919
That you suddenly realise you've made a mistake?

39
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,320
Huh.

40
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,919
And then I saw you on the landing.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,039
It was like you were sent from God.

42
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,600
It's very strange that I've never seen you before.

43
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,279
Do you live on your own?

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,720
I've got to work tonight, if that's all right.

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,839
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, I...

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,320
Call me if it happens again.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,160
It won't happen again.

48
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
What are you thinking, Johnny?

49
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,000
What have you been thinking?

50
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,799
Why did you ask me what was
I thinking? It's unbelievable.

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,079
Someone who's meant to be responsible,
someone who's meant to be my boss.

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,839
I thought it was funny. No need to tell me.

53
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,559
Well, it isn't funny. Not in a fucking lift.

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,559
Anger management, Johnny!

55
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,839
I can send you on a course if you like.

56
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,559
I don't ask you, "What are you thinking?"

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,519
'Cause my mind's a perfect blank, that's why.

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,559
Things are that bad, I got home last night
and watched the <i>X Factor</i>.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,160
Yesterday was Tuesday, <i>X Factor's</i>
Saturdays, so I know you're lying.

60
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:01,880
Not lying, testing.

61
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,279
-Jill.
-Good morning, boys.

62
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm coming your way in half an hour.

63
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,000
Jill's office.

64
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,600
-Morning, Muna.
-Good morning.

65
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,279
<i>So, there's an awful lot of stuff going on.</i>

66
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,119
<i>An awful lot of traffic.</i>

67
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,359
What does that mean? Intercept.

68
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
Among other things,

69
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,920
this building is swimming in information.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,480
We have information coming out of our ears.

71
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,559
So...

72
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,480
So, the difficult thing is to notice when someone

73
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,760
finally tells you something important.

74
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,200
No reaction.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
He thinks he can be rude to me.

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,720
He thinks he can treat me how he wants
because we had a wife in common.

77
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,640
In my case, a long time ago.

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,279
All your wives are a long time ago.

79
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,720
Is Jill need-to-know on my wives?

80
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,480
Everyone knows about your wives.

81
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,480
So my point is this. I've called
the two of you together.

82
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,399
I want to share a source.

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,399
Now, before we go any further, God's very excited.

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Why is God excited?

85
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,799
I suppose like all home secretaries,
God can't resist a file marked "top secret".

86
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,440
You're going to read this and
you're going to think, "Hold on.

87
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,160
"The Americans are meant to be our allies."

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,079
I've never suffered from that delusion.

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,920
Johnny doesn't believe in the
special relationship, do you?

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,559
They're not what you call
sharing partners, are they?

91
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,679
Even you can't claim to have read it already.

92
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,279
I've seen certain words,
I gather we're back in the Middle East.

93
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,279
-We're always in the Middle East.
-I don't like faith jobs.

94
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,079
I don't like anything to do with faith.

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
Still no faith yourself, Johnny?

96
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,320
The sun will rise in the morning,

97
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,839
I'm going to have a drink at 6:00. That's my faith.

98
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,640
Really? A lot of people in your church, are there?

99
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,119
Most people. Most people are in my church.

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,119
You're going to want to talk to me
when you've read it properly.

101
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,160
<i>This country is under threat,
it's under serious threat.</i>

102
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,640
<i>Our problem is we can't always
tell you the nature of the threat.</i>

103
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,519
<i>If we did, we'd be giving away intelligence.</i>

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>That's not something I'm willing to...</i>

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,399
This is a bit close, isn't it?

106
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
-This place is a bit close.
-Rollo.

107
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,959
Thought this place was crawling with professionals.

108
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,079
That's why we're eating at 11:30.
No one will see us, except your friend.

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
-How are you, Johnny?
-I'm well, Rollo.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,440
-And yourself?
-Trying to get used to my new profession.

111
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,399
I was hoping you could help me with an inquiry.

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,959
What inquiry is that?

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
She's called Nancy Pierpan.

114
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,920
Then she has a beautiful name.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,040
Do you know anything about her?

116
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,600
Are we going to do business before we have lunch?

117
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,959
We're going to do business over lunch.

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,239
You're not going to let me have a drink first?

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,399
-He's putting on weight.
-Well, you would know.

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,000
You haven't asked me about my new job.

121
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,600
I read what you write, but
some of it goes over my head.

122
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,760
Really? Don't you have a double first?

123
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,440
I'm not really clever, Rollo.

124
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,480
I don’t have what they call a first-class mind.
You were first class.

125
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,239
Sure. Look where it got me.

126
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,119
-I'm a journalist.
-A journalist who still works for us.

127
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
-Do I?
-Don't you get the cheques?

128
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,280
What are the cheques gonna get me, huh?
A house in Tuscany?

129
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,400
When? With whom? With the waiter?

130
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:40,159
Can't you go and do some sort of profile on her?

131
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,679
I work in the foreign desk.

132
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
What possible interest would
I have in Nancy Pierpan?

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,320
So you do know who she is.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,880
You were always quick, Johnny.

135
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,640
Not too clever, right enough, but you are quick.

136
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,760
-England's a small country, isn't it?
-You tell me.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,799
I mean, it's multicultural, sure.

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,479
There's more chaps named Shah, Patel.

139
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,840
But nothing's really changed.
It's still run by the same old crowd.

140
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,679
Is it? I don't know who runs England.

141
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,320
The bankers did, and look what happened to them.

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,359
What I'm saying is there's still
an awful lot of people named Baron,

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,719
and Worricker and Pierpan.

144
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,479
Nancy was born in Damascus.

145
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,760
Her father was an Arabist.

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,919
What sort of Arabist?
Romance of the desert, that sort of thing?

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,119
<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>?

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,679
-Why do you need to know?
-Because she's taking an interest in me.

149
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
What sort of an interest?

150
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,239
Making a play? Is she making a play?

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
She was putting out the rubbish.

152
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,559
She pretended it was a coincidence.

153
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,239
-Well, aren't you flattered?
-No.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,359
What's the file? Are you gonna show it to me?

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,239
Do you know...

156
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,960
I don't think I am.

157
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,840
What is this? They're saying I need a new pass.

158
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,919
I was given a temporary. What's going on?

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,359
Are you gonna throw a wobbly?

160
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,919
Of course I'm not gonna throw a wobbly.
When was the last time I threw a wobbly?

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,640
-7/7.
-Exactly. I threw a wobbly

162
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,039
because suicide bombers
killed 56 people on the streets of London

163
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,559
and we had no idea it was going to happen.

164
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,520
I didn't throw a wobbly
because my pass had been blocked.

165
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,719
No. You're really sweet.

166
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,479
Who changes the passes?
Who orders the passes to be changed?

167
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,200
Who do you think?

168
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,159
Take this and just make sure it's done.

169
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,479
What did you think of the file?

170
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,559
-What did I think of it?
-Yes.

171
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,599
I haven't finished it yet. I haven't absorbed it.

172
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,239
I hardly need say, on no account
is that file to leave the premises.

173
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,799
Gold standard.

174
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,400
-I didn't know if you'd make it.

175
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,080
I promised I'd make it, didn't I?

176
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,679
-I thought you were abroad.
-Who told you that?

177
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,799
Mum.

178
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,640
Mum said that she always knows where you are.

179
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,960
Does she? Paranormal, is she? Physic?

180
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,000
-Hey, Dad.
-Hello.

181
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,640
You're going to have to explain these to me.

182
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,280
<i>Do you want to have dinner afterwards?</i>

183
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,440
I thought you'd have lots of young men attendant.

184
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,960
-You don't want to have dinner with me.
-Don't I?

185
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,919
I hate these things more than you do.

186
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,840
-Hello, Johnny.
-Max.

187
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,599
Goodness, what are you doing here?

188
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,559
I collect. I collect your famous daughter.

189
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,840
If there's anything you can do
to get me a family price...

190
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,880
You still where you used to be?

191
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,679
Of course I am. I like it. Why would I change?

192
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,840
-And you, Max?
-Defence. Defence procurement.

193
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,919
Hmm.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,400
That's one business that's never
going to suffer. Recession-proof.

195
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,400
And these days I also raise a little money,
you know, for the party.

196
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,159
Don't look at me, I'm apolitical.

197
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:22,359
You're "A" everything, aren't you, Johnny?

198
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,599
You'll have to choose sides one day,
you know.

199
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,119
Remember, you'll get killed
in the middle of the road.

200
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,119
-Did you get my invitation?
-Did I? Remind me.

201
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,359
I wrote you, college reunion.

202
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,320
Oh, yes, I think I did get something.
Give me your card, I'll call you.

203
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,799
I don't have a card, I have a website.

204
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,400
Wake up, Johnny.

205
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,239
21st century.

206
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,239
-You again.
-You seem to be everywhere.

207
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,159
Why are you surprised? It's my
business, knowing people.

208
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,200
Including your daughter.

209
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,719
Beautiful.

210
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,080
That's what I do, remember? Put people in touch.

211
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,599
By the way, how did Nancy like your book?

212
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,080
How many novels have you written?

213
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,640
Why do you want to know?

214
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm asking you. I'm asking you a civil question.

215
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,520
It's my first.

216
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,599
So? You haven't said what you thought.

217
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,440
-No.
-Why not?

218
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,280
-Don't look at me like that.
-Why not?

219
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,760
Because I never could refuse you.

220
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,400
You could tell me the truth.

221
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,280
For once in your life,
you might try telling me the truth.

222
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,039
Only if you insist.

223
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,440
I insist.

224
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,320
All right. They look like works of despair.

225
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,359
If the despair isn't real, then I don't like them

226
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,359
because they're fake, they're unfelt.

227
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,359
They're avant-garde protest and nothing more.

228
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
But if the despair is real,

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,280
then that hurts, too, because...

230
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,159
Because you're my daughter,
and I don't want you to suffer.

231
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,640
-They're not fake.
-That's what I thought.

232
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:19,599
-So what bothers you?
-If I'm unhappy then it's your fault?

233
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,919
They make you feel guilty?
The absent father, the evasive father.

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,840
The pictures are morbid.

235
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,119
They're morbid, Julianne.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,080
Okay, I can see it may be my problem
to do with getting older,

237
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,559
but why do you want to piss on life
before you've even lived it?

238
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,880
I don't think you should say any more.

239
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,000
-I was wondering...
-Yup.

240
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,440
-That young man you were talking to.
-Which one?

241
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,840
I think his name is Ralph. Ralph Wilson.

242
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,359
You're working.

243
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,159
Fuck! You're not even talking to me, you're working.

244
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,760
-Oh, come on, let me take you home.
-No.

245
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,119
I don't want you anywhere near me.

246
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,119
Do you have any honest relationships at all?

247
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,640
How did I know? How did I know this?

248
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,880
Know what?

249
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,320
That you would come to my door.

250
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,479
You look unhappy. Do you want some company?

251
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,079
I'll come to your place.

252
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,319
<i>I'm getting red wine.</i>

253
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,719
I'd prefer whisky. Do you mind?

254
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,880
Mmm, you had a rough day.

255
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
-So how old’s your daughter, then?
-She's, let's see, mid-20s.

256
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,239
I split up from her mother
when Julianne was very young.

257
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,400
Here you go.

258
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,280
That's not true.

259
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm going to tell you the truth.

260
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:34,239
I split up with her when she was pregnant.

261
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,079
Why did you do that?

262
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,560
Because I was in love with someone else.

263
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,239
You fall in love easily.

264
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,719
Perhaps that's why my daughter doesn't trust me.

265
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,760
It was hard for her,

266
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,400
watching her father keep losing his heart.

267
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,119
-Hmm. Children don't like that.
-No.

268
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,319
Tonight, I felt I had the right to say
what I thought about her work.

269
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,160
Clearly I didn't.

270
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:02,199
Same thing's true with writers.

271
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,479
Well, you can say what you like
about their personalities

272
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,160
because they think,
"Oh, I can change, I can improve."

273
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,520
But work's different.

274
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,079
-What about you?
-Me?

275
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,079
Isn't your father a writer? Joseph Pierpan.

276
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,000
Writer and activist. Yeah.

277
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,119
Must be odd, having a famous father.

278
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm actually surprised you've heard of him.

279
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,719
Just how famous can you be in Syria?

280
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,199
-You were born in Damascus?
-Yes.

281
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,400
My brother was killed by the Israelis.

282
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,839
-When?
-Two years ago.

283
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,319
-What was he doing?
-Waving a white flag.

284
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:51,119
Trying to stop the Israelis
from knocking down a house.

285
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,760
The Israelis were building a wall
through the occupied territories

286
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,680
and the wall went right through the house.

287
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,400
Been in that part of the world?

288
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,920
What were you doing?

289
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,760
-Oh, you know.
-No.

290
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,119
I don't know, you're going to have to tell me.

291
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,520
I was on holiday.

292
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,199
On the West Bank?

293
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,920
Where else do you go on holiday?

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,479
Darfur? Afghanistan?

295
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,520
Maybe this is the moment...

296
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,680
to tell me what's going on.

297
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,079
Nothing’s going on.

298
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,959
My life was changed when my brother was killed.

299
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,119
He was killed by the Israeli Defence Force.

300
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,880
Nothing they say makes...

301
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,839
any sense, we don't believe
a word of the official inquiry.

302
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,920
So... It's hard enough to grieve, isn't it?

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,640
I mean, grief is hard enough anyway,

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
but when you don't know the truth,

305
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,319
everything freezes and you can't move on.

306
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,560
All right, let's just forget about it.

307
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,040
I asked you in for a drink, that's all.

308
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,439
I'm like you, I go to work, I get through the day.

309
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
Since Jake died, I haven't been
interested in making friends.

310
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,400
Please, it's nothing dramatic.
I'm not asking for anything, but...

311
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:36,239
You seem a nice man.

312
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,640
<i>You see, it's almost unbearable.</i>

313
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,479
The way she looks.

314
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,239
She's so desperately in love with Lester Young

315
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,959
she can scarcely bear it when he plays.

316
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,160
# <i>He wears high-draped pants…</i> #

317
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,920
All the same,

318
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,040
she doesn't forget when it's her turn.

319
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,719
# <i>He wears high-draped pants</i> #

320
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:27,400
Julianne, I wish I could find you.
I wish I knew where you were.

321
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,359
I made a fool of myself tonight.

322
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,520
And it's not the first time.

323
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,640
You were right to be angry.

324
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:09,520
All right, let's start the bloody meeting.

325
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,199
God knows, you're hard enough
to get hold of, Benedict.

326
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,160
You're far grander than I am.

327
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:17,640
Would you like me to get you
a cup of coffee, Home Secretary?

328
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,839
Some mineral water?

329
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,479
I had no idea you were going to be invited, Johnny.

330
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,280
Well, I am.

331
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,599
This is going to need long hours, Minister.

332
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,839
It's going to need expertise and judgement.

333
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,520
As my mother used to say,
"A problem shared is a problem halved."

334
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,760
So, what's your next move?

335
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,040
Give the whole thing to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>?
Post it on the internet?

336
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,439
I'm trying hard not to be offended, Home Secretary.

337
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,599
Please try.

338
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,319
Home Secretary, do you want
to come back in and restart this meeting

339
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,079
at a lower level of tension?

340
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
I don't know about anyone else,
but I've got a heart condition.

341
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,560
I've got fatty deposits on my arteries.
I have a stent.

342
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,599
Benedict, I can take this file out of the room,

343
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,800
across the river to SIS,
and your department will be royally fucked.

344
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,119
The service has been royally fucked many times.

345
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:02,560
Usually by your government jumping on us
like Rover with a hard-on,

346
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,359
and we've always survived the experience.

347
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,119
Oi, out!

348
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,079
With respect, Minister, politicians come and go.

349
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,319
I've counted them in and I've counted them out.

350
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,599
And if you want to get rid of me, you can.

351
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,040
That's on the record, by the way.

352
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,640
I'd like to go walking in Patagonia.
I've heard the wildlife there is extraordinary.

353
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,000
-Johnny went.
-I did.

354
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,359
<i>He loved it.</i>

355
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:26,680
So if you want a new DG, go ahead, get one.

356
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,479
I'll gather up my whole family and take them
on a packet boat to Antarctica.

357
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,479
And a double bonus, I won't be around
for the end of the Atlantic Alliance.

358
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,439
Anthea, it won't have happened on my watch.

359
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay, what are the Americans up to?

360
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
The Americans are up to
what we've always suspected they were up to.

361
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,400
This is different. This is proof. If this is true.

362
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:53,719
They have prisoners all over the world
who don't officially exist on black sites.

363
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,040
-So it appears.
-Unknown sites that don't exist either.

364
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,119
Not officially.

365
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,400
And these prisoners are telling them things

366
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,640
which they then don't have the courtesy to tell us.

367
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:04,479
Well, worse than that. Specifically,
the Americans are failing to keep us abreast

368
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,959
of things that are happening on our own doorstep.

369
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
Dangerous things.

370
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,800
If we're willing to trust intelligence
obtained by torture.

371
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
<i>Quite.</i>

372
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,680
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

373
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,520
<i>Well, I thought that might
be your next question.</i>

374
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,119
It is my next question.

375
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,280
Thought it might be.

376
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,160
And don't give me any of that Jesuitical bullshit

377
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,959
about not revealing your sources.

378
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
I can't reveal my sources.

379
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,839
Benedict, you and I can play the game...

380
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,520
Seems like we've already begun.

381
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,119
But at the end of the road, you work for me.

382
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,560
Remember, the people don't vote for you,
they vote for me.

383
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,280
They don't like the people who work in the dark.

384
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,199
They don't know the people who work in the dark.

385
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,719
If they did, would they be reassured?

386
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,760
-My view is we go to the Americans.
-<i>No.</i>

387
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,959
-We speak to the Americans direct.
-No.

388
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,280
We tell them we know what they know.

389
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,760
That they have a network of sites

390
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,760
where they're illegally
detaining and torturing prisoners.

391
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,160
We frighten them by naming the sites.

392
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:59,920
Thailand, Afghanistan, Morocco, Poland, Romania.

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,439
Show them we're not idiots.

394
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,560
-Why not?
-Because.

395
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,400
-Because what?
-Because you're going to tell your allies

396
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,959
that they've been lying to you.

397
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,119
You have to think through the implications.

398
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,280
Are you saying I haven't?

399
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,479
You also have to remember that
going back to the Americans

400
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,160
might endanger my source.

401
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:19,199
You'd need my permission.

402
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,920
What would you prefer me to do?

403
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,560
-Right now?
-Yes.

404
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,000
-If it were my call?
-Please, imagine that.

405
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,880
Right now, I'd prefer you to do nothing.

406
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,520
If you want me to do nothing,
why did you give me the file?

407
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,239
Because I don't want you to be able to say
I didn't give you the file.

408
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,199
-Further down the road?
-Exactly. I answer to you.

409
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,319
You gave me the file so that I would do nothing?

410
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
I gave you the file so that
you would know everything.

411
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,599
Makes sense.

412
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Johnny Worricker thinks it makes sense.

413
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,560
Johnny's an excellent judge.

414
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,119
Weak on tactics occasionally,
but strong on strategy.

415
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,560
Is that what you think? You back Johnny, do you?

416
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,319
Johnny's my best friend since Cambridge.

417
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,199
Well, then perhaps "best friend" can tell us
what the argument for doing nothing is.

418
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,319
The argument for doing nothing, Minister,
is that as yet you know so little.

419
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
And you shouldn't move until you know more.

420
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,160
Continue.

421
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,839
One simple thing: Her Majesty's Government
has always denied complicity in torture.

422
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,880
You've stood up in Parliament many times,
you've said it in the press.

423
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,959
Changing the story is going to be embarrassing.

424
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,680
Well, it's only going to be embarrassing
if people find out.

425
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,040
How will they find out?

426
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,479
Why would this intelligence leave this room?
Who here would leak it?

427
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,599
I hope that question answers itself.

428
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,400
I hope it does. I hope so, too.

429
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,640
And anyway, remember, I thought
the claims were true at the time.

430
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:46,319
When I made the claims,
I didn't know they were untrue.

431
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,640
That may or may not be sufficient defence.

432
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,119
These things can get messy, politically.

433
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,239
-And...
-What?

434
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,400
You said "one simple thing".
What's the second simple thing?

435
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:01,880
Oh. I haven't talked to Benedict
about this, Minister.

436
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,599
So? Does "best friend" need permission to speak?

437
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,839
Very well, it's this.

438
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,760
Has anyone actually read this thing?

439
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,880
I don't mean cast your eye over it, I mean read it.

440
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,479
-Jill?
-Yes, I believe I've read it.

441
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:18,439
Home Secretary, you say you didn't know
the Americans had these prisoners.

442
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,560
I didn't know.

443
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,760
And you had no proof they'd been torturing them.

444
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,040
I take your word. But perhaps
someone else in your government did.

445
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,239
Someone else?

446
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,119
Take another look at the bottom of page eight.

447
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,239
-Page eight?
-<i>Yes.</i>

448
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,599
-What's on page eight?
-<i>You haven't read it, have you?</i>

449
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,040
I thought not.

450
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,400
Page eight, please.

451
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:50,760
American source quoted saying,
"Downing Street already knows about this."

452
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,040
I imagine that's what bothering Benedict.

453
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,319
There are two possibilities, aren't there?

454
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,839
Either our source is wrong

455
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,959
and the Americans lied to all of us -

456
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,839
in which case,
Downing Street is going to be furious -

457
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,760
or our source is right,

458
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,199
and the Prime Minister knew everything all along,

459
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,719
he just didn't bother to tell you.

460
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,959
Now, I'm not sure which of those
two possibilities you prefer.

461
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,199
It's been an interesting meeting.

462
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,079
Thank you. It has indeed.

463
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,959
I'm going to do as you suggest
and leave this for a day or two.

464
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,119
Fine.

465
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,920
-Johnny?
-Fine.

466
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,479
We'll reconvene. Anna will be in touch.

467
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,079
You keep staring at that painting.

468
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,760
It's from the government art collection.

469
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,479
Don't blame me, I didn't choose it.

470
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,439
Actually, it was painted by my daughter.

471
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,560
Christ, then you're in more trouble than I am.

472
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,640
Thank you.

473
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm glad you said that.

474
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,880
-I'm sorry?
-About page eight.

475
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,520
I was hoping someone would say it.

476
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,800
Glad it was you.

477
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,359
Oh, okay.

478
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,560
I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure whether to speak.

479
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,920
No, that was a good move.

480
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,160
It means the game's in play.

481
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,599
You. Need to talk to you. Need a word, urgently.

482
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,079
Not here. Somewhere discreet.

483
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,599
Traditionally, it's the stationary cupboard.

484
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,400
-What were you doing?
-When?

485
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,760
At that meeting. What were you up to?

486
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,959
-What was I up to?
-Yes.

487
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,000
I was doing my job. I'm an intelligence analyst,

488
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,040
I was analysing intelligence.
What's wrong with that?

489
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,719
First thing wrong, you never mentioned it.

490
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,439
You blurt out this extraordinary allegation
before you talk to us, before you tell us.

491
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,160
What's happened to you?
Suddenly you can't speak? Well?

492
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,160
Do you know the source? Do you trust the source?

493
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,479
Of course I don't know the source. I don't need to.

494
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
You don't need to?

495
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,319
Come on, Jill. If Ben says it's good, it's good.

496
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,160
Oh, right. I forgot you were at college together.

497
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,239
That just about sums up this whole fucking place!

498
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,239
What's the problem, Jill? I don't get the problem.

499
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,959
When are you gonna wake up?

500
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,199
There's a revolution going on.
You don't seem to have noticed.

501
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,359
What sort of revolution is that?

502
00:30:54,439 --> 00:30:55,680
You live in the past.

503
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,119
You still think there's
something called pure intelligence.

504
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,719
The world's changed. Brits
are being killed by Brits.

505
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,199
They're being killed on British streets.

506
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,640
Oh, fuck!

507
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
If you don't know what I'm saying,

508
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm not gonna spell it out for you.

509
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,560
-Why don't you spell it out?
-Get your hands off me.

510
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm not one of your conquests.

511
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,160
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with assault in a cupboard?

512
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,199
You asked me in, remember?
I'll counter-sue for enticement.

513
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,199
Sure, if you're still here next week.

514
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,719
<i>The Prime Minister,
Alec Beasley, today described</i>

515
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,400
<i>Britain and America as two countries
with shared values and common purposes.</i>

516
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,520
<i>“Nothing," he said,
"could divide our two countries</i>

517
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,640
<i>“in the worldwide fight against terror.“</i>

518
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,959
<i>The Prime Minister is visiting Washington
at the request of the president.</i>

519
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,359
<i>Well, it's great to be here.
For me, it's home from home.</i>

520
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,560
-Oh, I see.
-What?

521
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,719
-You're just gonna go home.
-Yes, do you mind?

522
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,359
I was thinking of going home.

523
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:04,599
It's choir practice in 40 minutes,
and the M4 is hell.

524
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,400
And you're not going to tell me what you're up to?

525
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:08,160
Me?

526
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,040
-Yes, Ben.
-What am I up to?

527
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,920
That's my question.

528
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,599
It's pretty obvious, I would have thought.

529
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,119
I put a bomb in the water

530
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:19,040
and I'm waiting to see where the dead fish land.

531
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,000
And you didn't think it best to warn me first?

532
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,040
Or am I one of the fish?

533
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,160
If you don't trust me, Ben, who do you trust?

534
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,079
Distrust is a terrible habit.

535
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,040
Do you find that?

536
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,479
There's a fine line, isn't there,
between calculation and deceit?

537
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,520
Must do better.

538
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:53,839
You're right, I should have shown you page eight.

539
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,880
Johnny, I'm sorry.

540
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:04,439
Good. Tomorrow we're going to
talk it over, you and I.

541
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,839
And we won't do it on the fourth floor,

542
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,880
because this is about the survival
of the department and the Prime Minister.

543
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,319
-Coffee shop in Ebury Street?
-When?

544
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,560
10:00.

545
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,959
The old team.

546
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,120
<i>Well, I think...</i>

547
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
So, what did you call it?

548
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,800
-<i>Emma?</i>
-Yes.

549
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,959
<i>It's me.</i>

550
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,479
-Do you have any idea what time it is?
-<i>I knew you'd be up.</i>

551
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,639
I'm feeding the chickens.

552
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,560
The point is this. I've had a row with Julianne.

553
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,679
<i>Yes, she told me.</i>

554
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,479
She had every right to be angry.

555
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,439
She asked you to stay because
she wanted to tell you something.

556
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,080
<i>What did she want to tell me?</i>

557
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,520
That she's having a baby.

558
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,520
-I don't believe you!
-<i>It's true.</i>

559
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,959
She's pregnant.

560
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,560
<i>Do you know who the father is?</i>

561
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,080
I don't. She hasn't told me.

562
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,399
She hasn't told you?

563
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,959
Johnny, it's the 21st century.

564
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,360
How many more times? People keep
saying that like it justifies everything,

565
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,639
every piece of stupidity.

566
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,639
Julianne isn't being stupid.

567
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,919
She knows what she's doing.

568
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,639
She wouldn't take it on
if she couldn't see it through.

569
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,439
Well, is she all right?

570
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,879
<i>She was.</i>

571
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,360
When will I see her?

572
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,120
Johnny, you need to watch out.

573
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,679
-Who was that?
-Johnny.

574
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
So you gave him the news?

575
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,560
One egg, or two?

576
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,439
I'm sorry.

577
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,760
-I wanted to see you were all right.
-I'm all right.

578
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,520
It's funny, I came to find you last night.

579
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,479
Sounded as if you had company.

580
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,120
Why did you come looking for me?

581
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,360
Oh, because I bought you a CD.

582
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,479
Can I come in?

583
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,879
Yes. Yes, you can come in.

584
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,760
Wow!

585
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,679
I know.

586
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,679
It's a little overwhelming.
I started collecting years ago.

587
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,120
Believe it or not, I started with £100.
It grew from there.

588
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:03,320
You've got good taste. That's Christopher Wood.

589
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,639
It's wonderful.

590
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:08,800
There's no plan. I've just
always bought what I've liked.

591
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,360
It must be worth a fortune.

592
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,959
Yeah. But that's not why I do it.

593
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,399
My second wife had very good taste.

594
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:18,000
How many wives have you had?

595
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,000
-Fewer than five.
-Ah.

596
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,439
-Do you really have it?
-What?

597
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,600
The CD.

598
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,360
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

599
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,159
-Lester Young.
-Aw.

600
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,560
Thank you.

601
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:44,479
My daughter's pregnant.

602
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,639
It turns out that's what the row was about.

603
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,439
I thought it was about art, but it wasn't.

604
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:53,800
She knew I was going to be upset
because I don't think the father's around,

605
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:56,120
so she was frightened that I'd judge her.

606
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,760
I don't really know what is it you do.

607
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,159
I assume you're some sort of secret service.

608
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,760
The other night I was pissed off
because you wouldn't tell me.

609
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,159
What makes you think I'm in the security services?

610
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,199
Because most people can tell you
why they visit the Middle East.

611
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,199
And uh, the person I was
with last night was my dad.

612
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,919
Oh, I see. He's in London?

613
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
Did you just work that out?
Was that your professional training?

614
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,560
No, it's more my nerves.

615
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:31,040
Why are you nervous?

616
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,639
Because I find myself confiding in you.

617
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,520
Do you? Do you really?

618
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,239
Or are you just pretending?

619
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,760
Well, I think it's brilliant,

620
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,399
because I can tell everyone I know
I live opposite a spy.

621
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,919
I'd rather you didn't, but...

622
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't you think we have to be honest?

623
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:53,800
You and I?

624
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:57,639
I mean, isn't it important at this point?

625
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,479
-Yes?
-<i>Johnny.</i>

626
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,600
Emma.

627
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,560
<i>It's not about Julianne.</i>

628
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,000
Then what is it about?

629
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,600
<i>Yesterday, stock exchanges reacted sharply</i>

630
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,639
<i>to demonstrations throughout the Arab world.</i>

631
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,959
<i>The chancellor said,
"These are volatile times."</i>

632
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,080
You should come down right away.
The sooner you get here, the better.

633
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,600
Fine.

634
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,439
Hold on. Worricker's here.

635
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,879
Okay, I've got to go. Goodbye.

636
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,360
-What's the verdict?
-It's a heart attack.

637
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,600
-There's a coroner coming.
-Real coroner?

638
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,639
Of course, real coroner.

639
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,080
You're going to examine him, are you?
That's going to help, is it?

640
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,520
Who did you call first?

641
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,159
Downing Street.

642
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Are you from Downing Street?

643
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,959
I was asked to take charge.

644
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,199
You're not taking charge, I am.

645
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:33,320
Where's Julianne?

646
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,320
I'm not sure.

647
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,120
Have you rung her yet?

648
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,120
I might have guessed.
You're going through his stuff.

649
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,879
Not going through it, taking it away.

650
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,560
Then you'll go through it.

651
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,760
Do you think with his podgy fingers
he could work that thing?

652
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:13,040
I was there when he had his first heart attack.

653
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,760
I was there for the second. They were identical.

654
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,800
The doctor warned him, he said,
"You're living an injury time."

655
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:21,600
So you're not going to tell me
there's anything suspicious.

656
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,919
-I don't want a circus.
-I know.

657
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,439
And I most certainly don't want
a territorial spat with that woman downstairs.

658
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,199
Had he talked about dying?

659
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,760
He was worried about the future.

660
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,959
But he said whatever mess he left behind,
he could trust you to clear it up.

661
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,800
Benedict was honest and hard-working.

662
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,679
And he looked things in the eye.

663
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:54,439
So I'd say it's important
that you don't let him down.

664
00:41:57,879 --> 00:41:59,840
Julianne, it's your father.

665
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,919
I've got bad news. Can you call me?

666
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,600
Or call your mother.

667
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,520
I may be hard to get hold of for a while.

668
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,399
Did he say he'll take over?

669
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,840
You must be Mr Worricker?

670
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:13,959
-Joseph Pierpan.
-How do you do?

671
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,679
-My daughter's told me so much about you.
-How is she?

672
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,320
Nancy says you know a lot of influential people.

673
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:20,919
You work at the Home Office.

674
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,719
Oh, she told you.

675
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,520
My son was murdered.

676
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,000
Can you imagine?

677
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,800
And I am daily mocked by people
who refuse to admit who did it and why.

678
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,000
Do you have children?

679
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,320
A daughter.

680
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:39,919
I'm not going to detain you.

681
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,280
But it would mean the world to us
if you could help.

682
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,040
This is kind of you.

683
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,760
Why is it kind of me?

684
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,399
Don't you think it might be what I want as well?

685
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,879
What are they saying up your way?

686
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,080
Well, they're saying it was a heart attack.

687
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:42,800
Do you have any reason to think differently?
You went up there.

688
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,679
Yeah, I saw the guilty egg.

689
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,120
We were at university together.

690
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:55,959
Ben was my tutor.

691
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,919
We even went on the Vietnam marches together.

692
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,320
He recruited me.

693
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,479
First it was counter-espionage,
then counter-terrorism. There's no difference.

694
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,439
He still said it was dishonourable work
you could do in an honourable way.

695
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,840
The better man?

696
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,520
I betrayed my wife and he married her.

697
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,719
I never knew if he did it for her
or if he did it for me.

698
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,360
Whichever.

699
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,679
I'm in his debt.

700
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,479
He was an all-round decent person.

701
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,360
When's your husband getting back?

702
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:47,040
-He's not getting back.
-Why not?

703
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,360
Because we had a disagreement.

704
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,080
Yeah, I'm up the Swanee.

705
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,679
I work for an unprincipled maniac.

706
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,719
God, she's as mean as cat meat.

707
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,360
And meanwhile, I am trying to hold down
my pathetic high-powered job.

708
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,959
You want to get out?

709
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,159
I don't have the courage.

710
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,879
I don't have the guts.

711
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,320
They're gonna go after you, you know that.

712
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:21,479
-Tell me.
-What, you hadn't guessed?

713
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,840
Jill Tankard took me into a cupboard

714
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:27,239
and told me there was no such thing
as pure intelligence.

715
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,560
Well, then.

716
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,959
They don't trust you.

717
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,199
They're gonna use Benedict's death.

718
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,320
There's gonna be a departmental shake-up.
They've been setting you up.

719
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:37,719
Setting me up? How?

720
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,239
They're gonna say you put Benedict up to it.

721
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,120
It was you that gave Benedict the source.

722
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,000
I didn't. I didn't give him his source.

723
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,280
I only saw the file for the first time this week.

724
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,199
-I know that.
-I don't know the source.

725
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,760
I'm sure. But they don't care.

726
00:46:52,959 --> 00:46:58,040
They're gonna tie a tin can around your tail
and run you out of the building.

727
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,439
They don't like you, Johnny.

728
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,520
It's personal.

729
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,719
Do they have a reason?

730
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,239
Well, the usual reason.
They think you're anti-American.

731
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,040
I'm not.

732
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,000
All right, then, they just feel
that you have more fun than they do.

733
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,600
I've got a question.

734
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,239
I mean, I don't mind if you don't answer.

735
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,479
I don't mind. I'll answer anything.

736
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,040
When I said, "I only saw the file
for the first time this week,"

737
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,879
you said, "I know."

738
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:36,040
-Oh, yeah, so?
-How do you know?

739
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,760
It's important, Anna. How do you know?
How do you know I hadn't seen the file?

740
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:43,600
I know

741
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,280
because when I started sleeping with you,
I made a decision.

742
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,719
What decision?

743
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,879
I decided to trust you.

744
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:58,280
It's a bit arbitrary, isn't it?

745
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,320
Yes.

746
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,760
But so far you've never let me down.

747
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,760
<i>North Utsire, northerly,
becoming cyclonic four or five,</i>

748
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,479
<i>occasionally six in far north.
Becoming variable three later.</i>

749
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,280
<i>Fair, good.</i>

750
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,000
<i>South Utsire, north-westerly five or six,</i>

751
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,120
<i>veering easterly or
south-easterly, four or five.</i>

752
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,479
<i>Becoming variable three later.</i>

753
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,800
<i>Fair, good.</i>

754
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:48,080
Nothing if not predictable.

755
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,520
Shit!

756
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,199
Johnny? Johnny?

757
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,520
Are you there? It's Jill.

758
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:09,080
I'm answering. Good morning, Jill.

759
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,879
Have you forgotten? We're due
to meet, we've got a meeting.

760
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:12,959
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

761
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,600
<i>Problem is, I've got that tickle
you get at the back of your throat</i>

762
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:17,879
<i>when you know you're gonna be ill.</i>

763
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:19,159
<i>Where are you, exactly?</i>

764
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:21,560
<i>Aren't I at home? I'm in Battersea, aren't I?</i>

765
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:22,679
That's not what it says here.

766
00:49:23,479 --> 00:49:25,360
<i>This is hardly the day to go undercover.</i>

767
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:27,080
Goodness, you're playing with the toys.

768
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,360
Are you playing silly buggers?

769
00:49:30,479 --> 00:49:33,760
No, not at all. I thought it was you
that was playing silly buggers, very much so.

770
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,800
After what happened yesterday, we're on amber.

771
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,120
<i>Everyone's got to open their safe.</i>

772
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,439
I'm happy to open my safe.

773
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,000
There's nothing in it but half a bottle
of brandy and some shaving cream.

774
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,399
But I can't do it today.

775
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:45,879
Not if the whole department’s to avoid the flu.

776
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,280
You think with Benedict gone you move up a peg.

777
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,479
But you don't, you move down.

778
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,520
I hope to God you know what you're doing.

779
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:18,239
Oh, Mr Eliot, I thought I heard you.

780
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,399
Mrs Ashanti.

781
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,520
It's been so long since we saw you.

782
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,000
I've been traveling. I'm only
in this country for a couple of days.

783
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:35,600
<i>The death has been announced
of Benedict Baron,</i>

784
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,959
<i>the Director General of MI5.</i>

785
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,199
<i>Baron will be remembered for his policy of</i>

786
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,760
<i>making the security service more accountable.</i>

787
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,439
<i>Under his direction,
the secretive organisation...</i>

788
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,479
The Road House. Rather a come-down, isn't it?

789
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,280
Isn't this where you used to meet Gerry Adams?

790
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,280
Is it, Rollo? You'd know better than me.

791
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,399
So, who are you this time?

792
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,360
My name's Eliot, after the poet.

793
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,600
Mmm? Eliot who?

794
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:08,679
Tom Eliot, you idiot.

795
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,639
Never heard of him.
What does he do? Christmas cards?

796
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,479
-Two coffees, please.
-<i>Sure.</i>

797
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,280
-You vanished.
-I was in Israel.

798
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,639
Good. Do I owe you?

799
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,280
No, it's fine. The paper paid.

800
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,320
-You can open it.
-I'd rather hear it from you.

801
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:25,719
-Well, she's perfect, isn't she?
-Is she? Tell me.

802
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,120
Well, if they'd invented her,
they couldn't have done a better job.

803
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,800
You gonna have to tell me who "they" are?

804
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,600
I'm assuming that "she" is Nancy.

805
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:32,840
Is there anyone else in your life?

806
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,040
-Nobody at all?
-Since you ask.

807
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:39,520
Well, Nancy is a perfectly pitched creation.

808
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,199
Is she? Is she a creation?

809
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
If you want to know, yeah. It all stacks up.

810
00:51:42,879 --> 00:51:45,600
Yes, she did have a romantic-looking brother,
who was indeed killed.

811
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,040
And yeah, there was one of those
Israeli Army inquiries

812
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,479
where they concluded
the Israeli Army never does anything wrong.

813
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,320
Her father is indeed an impeccable Arab scholar,

814
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:56,040
living a quiet and saintly life in Damascus.

815
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,919
There she is, Johnny.
The wronged woman, the grieving sister.

816
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,199
Waiting for you, brilliantly rehearsed,
learnt her lines, ready to go.

817
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,120
What are you saying? Too good to be true?

818
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,679
I didn't ask you to pimp for me, Rollo.

819
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,320
Nor did I ask you to vet a girlfriend.
She's not a girlfriend, she's a neighbour.

820
00:52:12,399 --> 00:52:15,120
Oh, she's kind of a fantasy neighbour, isn't she?

821
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,919
Perfect for an old spy who's
lost faith in the old values.

822
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,479
I haven't lost faith.

823
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,280
-Haven't you?
-No, I still believe in them.

824
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,280
The purpose of intelligence is to find the truth,

825
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,080
not to confirm what we already believe.

826
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,520
We're meant to look for what's there,
not for what we want to be there.

827
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,199
Come on, Johnny! Once they wanted
communists, we gave them communists.

828
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,879
-Now they want Arabs, we give them Arabs.
-Thank you.

829
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:34,000
They decide what they're looking for,
we find it for them.

830
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,919
What has really changed? Nothing.

831
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,639
Look, I know what you're going through.
You must be in tricky place, Rollo.

832
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,959
It was a bad day for Ben.
It wasn't a great day for me.

833
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,959
Ben ran his own agents and he kept them close.

834
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,360
So there are quite a few people
waking up in your position.

835
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,600
Benedict did a good job on you.

836
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,399
The whole service believes
that you leaked security secrets

837
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:54,239
to a newspaper in return for money
because that's what Benedict told them.

838
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,639
There's a flap going on, isn't there?

839
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,320
A turf war, that's what I'm hearing.

840
00:52:58,399 --> 00:52:59,719
Are you? Where are you hearing that?

841
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,000
Don't give me that "answer a question
with a fucking question" lark, Johnny.

842
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,879
I didn't go on the interrogation course,
I wrote it, remember?

843
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:07,959
-Sorry.
-What's more, I just went to Israel for you

844
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,239
on what could be a wild-goose chase.

845
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,239
All right, I dipped into the Tel Aviv beach scene,

846
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,000
I got tanned on every inch of my sexy body.

847
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,320
But even so, you owe me this!

848
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:20,959
All right. What this is about,

849
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,159
Benedict had proof the Americans
have sites, black sites.

850
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,719
-Of course they do.
-Yes, but now

851
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,199
we can tell you exactly where they are,
we can draw the map.

852
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,040
Why is that news? That's not news.

853
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,199
You could hear the screams for the last 10 years.

854
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,000
Little bits of intelligence, we're so careful not
to enquire too closely where they came from.

855
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,040
They came from torture chambers, we knew that.

856
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,280
We guessed, we didn't have evidence.
And this is actually different.

857
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,760
Why? Why is it different?

858
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,120
Because it establishes who knew.

859
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,879
Who's known all along.

860
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,320
So, who knew? Who knew the sites?

861
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,280
Our Prime Minister.

862
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,159
Our Prime Minister knew.

863
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:08,520
I see.

864
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,199
Party of one, is it? Dining alone?

865
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,879
Too right, table by the fucking window.

866
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:18,399
Our Prime Minister had access
to American intelligence

867
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:22,840
which might have helped save
British lives, and he didn't tell us.

868
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:24,760
He didn't tell anyone.

869
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,840
Okay. Okay, I'm getting a picture here.

870
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:29,560
Good. I'm glad you're getting a picture, Rollo.

871
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:32,959
Presumably our Prime Minister
didn't tell us because he doesn't trust us?

872
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,199
Correct.

873
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,040
And he didn't tell his Home Secretary
because he doesn't trust her either.

874
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,000
-Correct.
-Our Prime Minister doesn't trust anyone,

875
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,479
-is that right?
-That's the way it looks.

876
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,879
'Cause he stands alone,
the true saviour of his nation.

877
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:47,239
And everyone else, except for him,
is a wishy-washy liberal fuck!

878
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,040
They don't believe.

879
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,760
-Then what happened?
-Benedict finds out.

880
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,360
-How?
-Through a source.

881
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,399
Yeah, but a source of his own.
A source's name you don't know.

882
00:54:55,479 --> 00:54:57,239
That's the interesting bit.

883
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:00,239
What does Benedict do, in that situation,

884
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,439
on discovering that his Prime Minister
hides secrets from his own security service?

885
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,159
Of all the things that Ben could do,
what does he do?

886
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,800
Remember your first day, Rollo.
First day in the service.

887
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,719
Of course, Monday morning, 10:00 a.m.,
you give the first lecture.

888
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,040
And what did I say?

889
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,679
"Never share intelligence you don't need to share."

890
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,439
Consider. Benedict is given lethal
information about his Prime Minister.

891
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,919
And what does he do with it?

892
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,679
He gives it to Anthea. He gives it to you.

893
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,879
What was his plan, then?

894
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,239
Bring down the government?

895
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:55,280
-Weather’s changing.
-Certainly is.

896
00:55:57,879 --> 00:56:00,080
Feels like the end of an era.

897
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,199
As for me, I'm fucked.

898
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,719
Live out my life inventing stories
for a national newspaper.

899
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,040
Can't even come to the funeral.

900
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,679
Rollo. Rollo, you have me.

901
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,239
Sure. How long are you gonna last?

902
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:04,879
I thought it would be you.

903
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,639
Don't be ridiculous. Why?

904
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:10,959
Because I dreamed of you this morning.
I had my Johnny dream.

905
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,280
Whoever taught you to lie like that?

906
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,719
Who do you think?

907
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,760
So, how many years since I saw you?

908
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,439
I guess five.

909
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,840
You sold me a little Gertler, remember?

910
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,320
You're sure? You really want to sell it?

911
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,199
Christopher Wood. Died at 29.

912
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,000
Threw himself under the train.

913
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,320
-I wouldn't sell it, if I were you.
-I have to.

914
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,840
Bad times?

915
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:48,080
Why did you bring it here?

916
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:50,479
There are places in London you would get much more.

917
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,159
Because you have a safe.

918
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,919
-Because you have cash.
-How do you know?

919
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,479
Because you showed me.

920
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,040
Well, will you take 60?

921
00:58:04,879 --> 00:58:06,159
Do I have any choice?

922
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,439
-Here.
-Thank you.

923
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,439
Well done.

924
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:38,000
-That daughter of yours, she's doing well?
-Hmm.

925
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,840
Does she still adore you?

926
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:42,959
I think she does, she's just
scared of showing it, that's all.

927
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,080
And you, Johnny?

928
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,239
Still winging it on charm?

929
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:50,239
I'm late. Thank you, Leona.

930
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,959
I've got to go.

931
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,520
Thanks, sir.

932
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:38,600
-Hi
-Hi

933
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,560
-Yes?
-<i>Dad, it's me</i>.

934
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:45,000
At last. Where are you?

935
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,439
I've been worried sick.

936
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,000
<i>I know. I couldn’t leave Mum by herself.</i>

937
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,320
Julianne, are you at the farm?

938
00:59:51,399 --> 00:59:53,639
Dad, a man came to see me.

939
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,120
<i>What man? Who?</i>

940
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,080
I don't know. He came to my studio.
He wanted to know where you were.

941
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,239
<i>What did you say?</i>

942
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,719
I told him the truth.

943
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,679
I said I hadn't seen you, then I
packed a bag and came up to Mum's.

944
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,800
Julianne, I'm going to see you so soon, I promise.

945
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:10,479
Stay at your mum's, whatever you do.

946
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,479
I need to talk to you.

947
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,919
<i>He said they're looking for you.</i>

948
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,840
Ah! Here's a surprise.

949
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:19,280
Julianne, I've got to go. I'm sorry.
Stay where you are, please.

950
01:00:22,439 --> 01:00:24,919
Blow me down. Thought the shy boy wasn't coming.

951
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,560
-I wasn't.
-What made you change your mind?

952
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:30,639
Oh, you know, whim, caprice.

953
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,879
Good evening.

954
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:07,159
<i>Amen.</i>

955
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:21,159
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

956
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:23,639
-Good evening.
-<i>Good evening, Prime Minister.</i>

957
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:54,919
The Prime Minister will now say a few words.

958
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,280
Thank you.

959
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:00,040
Thank you, thank you.

960
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,520
Well, I don't want to spoil such
a wonderful occasion with a long speech.

961
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,840
As my daughter says, "Daddy, you spoil everything."

962
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,639
But I would like to say a few words,
if I may, about liberal values

963
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:14,560
and the price of defending them in the modern world.

964
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:19,639
What do you think? What do you think of him?

965
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,120
I don't know. I've never known what to make of him.

966
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,520
At least he believes what he says.

967
01:02:27,399 --> 01:02:28,600
Is that enough?

968
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:31,320
The Prime Minister wants a word.

969
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:33,280
-Not now.
-When?

970
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,760
Afterwards.

971
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,879
We'll tell you when.

972
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,360
Sorry, it's past 1:00. He had a long phone call.

973
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,919
The White House doesn't admit
we're in a different time zone.

974
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:03,120
Ah, Johnny.

975
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,719
-It's been a long time.
-So it has.

976
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,159
I'm surprised you could make it.

977
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:10,080
-Why?
-I heard you had flu.

978
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:11,719
Really? Who told you that?

979
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,280
Why? Isn't it true?

980
01:03:14,439 --> 01:03:17,159
-Isn't it?
-Maybe the beginnings. The onset.

981
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,840
Oh, and having just lost the DG,
I didn't think you'd come.

982
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,600
I'm sorry, everyone, but we're
going to need some privacy.

983
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,959
Please.

984
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,239
I remember when peace first came
to Northern Ireland, I took Ben for a drink.

985
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,840
In those days I was just an MP.

986
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:50,919
Benedict said, "The Cold War's over.
Northern Ireland's fixed.

987
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,040
"This could be very bad news for the service."

988
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,800
Well, all honour to Ben, but
it turned out he was wrong.

989
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:57,320
-On the contrary.
-Yes.

990
01:03:57,399 --> 01:04:00,760
-We're busier than ever.
-And larger.

991
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,840
That's the problem, isn't it?
There's so much intelligence.

992
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:08,000
Ceaseless intelligence,
and there's barely time to consider it.

993
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,439
The difficult thing being to
decide what's important.

994
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,679
-That's right.
-And what's not.

995
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,399
Basic point.

996
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,000
There are times when the interests of

997
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,439
the government and the interests
of the country are coincident.

998
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,679
You can't put a cigarette paper between them.

999
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,239
Do you agree?

1000
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,399
-Do you agree?
-I don't disagree.

1001
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:34,159
So, I need to be clear.

1002
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,719
I'm contemplating reorganisation.
Had you heard that?

1003
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,120
As a matter of fact, I had.

1004
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:40,439
Oh, really. Who from?

1005
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,239
Yes.

1006
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,879
A department of Homeland Security.

1007
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:52,439
It'd be a popular move
after the failures of the last 10 years.

1008
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,360
Let's have a Royal Commission to give us cover,

1009
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:56,760
then let's reconfigure the services entirely.

1010
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,120
Why not?

1011
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:00,800
I hardly need say for everyone already in place

1012
01:05:00,879 --> 01:05:02,919
it could mean huge advancement.

1013
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,479
Johnny?

1014
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,360
Huge opportunity.

1015
01:05:07,399 --> 01:05:08,959
Or its opposite.

1016
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,439
Right. You understand me.

1017
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,439
There's one other thing I'd like to discuss.

1018
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,080
Before he died, Benedict gave you a file?

1019
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,320
My own view is that file
should not have been distributed.

1020
01:05:31,399 --> 01:05:33,679
And for that reason, I'd like it returned.

1021
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:39,320
Well?

1022
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,320
I don't know what to say.

1023
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:45,199
I don't carry secret files about my person,
so I don't have it with me.

1024
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,959
After all, I came here tonight for social reasons.

1025
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,040
I find that very hard to believe.

1026
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,800
You don't strike me as an overly
sentimental kind of person.

1027
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:56,120
<i>Didn't you come here
because you wanted to talk to me?</i>

1028
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:00,280
<i>I think we both know we have
a question to answer, Prime Minister.</i>

1029
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,040
<i>And what question is that?</i>

1030
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,760
<i>Why do you imagine Benedict gave me the file?</i>

1031
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,679
-You tell me.
-Why did he show it around?

1032
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,199
Why did he do that?

1033
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,360
I've no idea.

1034
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:12,719
-He showed it to the Home Secretary.
-Indeed.

1035
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:16,479
What's your view, given the
sensitivity of the subject matter?

1036
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,280
My guess is Benedict knew he was ill.

1037
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,000
Sorry, he'd already had a heart attack?

1038
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,199
-But also his arm was dragging.
-His arm?

1039
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,120
I noticed at a meeting with the Home Secretary.

1040
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,879
It's a familiar sign.
He couldn't pick up his papers.

1041
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:31,879
-What meeting was that?
-I think Benedict knew he was dying.

1042
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:36,239
He handed out the file because
he wanted certain issues discussed.

1043
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,120
He wanted everything out in the open.

1044
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,520
And so, whatever else, we must respect his wishes.

1045
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,879
He was my friend.

1046
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:50,560
So for me it's a matter of honour.

1047
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:52,159
Honour?

1048
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:59,639
Do you know the famous saying about the yellow box?

1049
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,560
I've not heard it, no.

1050
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:05,080
"Do not enter the yellow box
unless your exit is clear.''

1051
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:07,320
<i>I wonder where you think your exit is?</i>

1052
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:10,120
<i>I don't have an exit,
so I don't have a strategy.</i>

1053
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:11,840
<i>I'm not thinking that far ahead.</i>

1054
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,520
I’m very conscious, Prime Minister,
that I've been forced into an area

1055
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,959
closer to politics than it is to security.

1056
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,120
What I was saying earlier.

1057
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,199
In times of national emergency,
the two are the same.

1058
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,760
Nothing is more dangerous than
when people make mischief

1059
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,479
by trying to separate them out.

1060
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,040
But surely that's something
you're going to have to take up

1061
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,399
with your Home Secretary.

1062
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,600
Yes. I'm working on that.

1063
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,080
Right now, I'm working on you.

1064
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:41,600
All right. If the file is correct,
it suggests that you had intelligence

1065
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:43,439
which you failed to share.

1066
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,840
You knew the names of potential British terrorists,

1067
01:07:46,919 --> 01:07:48,479
but you failed to pass them on

1068
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,040
because you didn't want to reveal
where you'd got them.

1069
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,719
You risked lives.

1070
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:56,840
And you knowingly misled Parliament
about illegal practices.

1071
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,600
Let's look at the facts.

1072
01:08:00,399 --> 01:08:02,919
The man who compiled that file is dead.

1073
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,639
And with him died the knowledge
of who his source was.

1074
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,840
I don't know the source. Do you?

1075
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,199
You know as well as I do,
without a source your file is worthless.

1076
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,280
The allegations can't be corroborated.

1077
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,640
Therefore, the allegations can't be correct.

1078
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,759
Is that what you're telling me, sir?

1079
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:20,040
It's false?

1080
01:08:20,919 --> 01:08:22,399
The allegations are false?

1081
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,000
What time is it?

1082
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,720
Just gone 2:00.

1083
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:35,479
All other copies of the file have been returned.

1084
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,560
I want yours back within 12 hours.

1085
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,959
2:00 tomorrow, shall we say?

1086
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,399
You've been a loyal servant
to this country for many years.

1087
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,640
I'm not expecting you to throw it all away.

1088
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,439
No. Nor am I.

1089
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,879
It's late. Can we get you a room?

1090
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,240
No, thank you. I'm staying at a friend's.

1091
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,560
Goodnight, sir.

1092
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:13,000
Goodnight, Max. Goodnight, Ted.

1093
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,520
-How did it go?
-I want Special Branch.

1094
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,919
-All right?
-Yes, but I'm freezing.

1095
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,000
Where are we going?

1096
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,759
I love it.

1097
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:36,560
-Is this what you do for a living?
-Occasionally.

1098
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,839
Wow!

1099
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,799
Wow!

1100
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I had a feeling that if I asked a favour,

1101
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,279
you were the sort of person who'd come through.

1102
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:46,439
You trust me.

1103
01:11:46,839 --> 01:11:48,520
Why on earth would you trust me?

1104
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,959
Because that's the job. Deciding
who to trust. That's what the job is.

1105
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:56,520
Also, you told your father
that I work for the Home Office.

1106
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,799
-I lied.
-Yeah.

1107
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,439
You trust me because I lied.

1108
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:03,120
Hmm.

1109
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,359
Well, what were you doing in Cambridge?

1110
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,520
Why, seeing the Prime Minister, of course.

1111
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:15,200
-Anyone behind us?
-No.

1112
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:21,200
-Are we going back to London?
-No.

1113
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:38,160
-Two rooms, please.
-One room, two beds, please.

1114
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,959
Don't we need to talk?

1115
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:49,560
I don't want to spoil the
evening, but I have a question.

1116
01:12:49,759 --> 01:12:52,959
-The first time we met, the young man...
-Ralph.

1117
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:55,399
Tell me, how did you know him?

1118
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,600
-He came to the meetings.
-For the campaign?

1119
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,040
He just turned up out of the blue?

1120
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,720
Said he was keen to help.

1121
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,319
Did he?

1122
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,319
-What's this about?
-I got you something.

1123
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,879
Something to thank you for coming to fetch me.

1124
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:14,919
What is it?

1125
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,439
It's the truth about your brother's death.

1126
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:21,879
I got hold of the Shabak report.

1127
01:13:21,959 --> 01:13:23,720
How on earth did you do that?

1128
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,000
It's powerful stuff.

1129
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:30,720
You were right. Jake was killed
in cold blood. There was a cover-up.

1130
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:35,680
You have a cast-iron case for
manslaughter. You might get murder.

1131
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:36,919
It's all in there.

1132
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,399
Have you read it?

1133
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:53,640
The problem is going to be with using it.

1134
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,919
Why shouldn't I use it?

1135
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,279
Because everyone will know where you got it.

1136
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:02,399
How would they know?

1137
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:05,120
You're not cut out for
this line of work, are you?

1138
01:14:05,759 --> 01:14:07,080
Tell me what you mean.

1139
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,279
I mean you live opposite me.

1140
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:11,520
We share a landing.

1141
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:15,040
I see.

1142
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,319
<i>Do you want a drink?</i>

1143
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,319
Um...

1144
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:36,759
-Am I driving?
-Not with me, you're not.

1145
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:39,839
Brandy.

1146
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,839
They say you can only begin to mourn
once you know the facts.

1147
01:15:12,839 --> 01:15:14,839
Do you think that's true?

1148
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,879
I'm mourning, too.

1149
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,359
Who?

1150
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,560
Who are you mourning?

1151
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:27,839
My oldest friend died

1152
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:30,879
a couple of days ago.

1153
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,520
He made an allegation.

1154
01:15:35,839 --> 01:15:40,200
An allegation that, as yet,
I've failed to make stick.

1155
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:43,959
I see.

1156
01:15:49,839 --> 01:15:51,000
Must be tough.

1157
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,240
Well, it is.

1158
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:01,879
He left me a job to do.

1159
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,279
And my life's not...

1160
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,040
worth living

1161
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,399
till I see it through.

1162
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:22,919
I just got my life back.

1163
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,759
I don't suppose you'd let me thank you.

1164
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,200
I think I'd die if you thanked me.

1165
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:43,799
<i>I think some people have been quite surprised
by your new appointment.</i>

1166
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:47,000
<i>Yes. Well, as you know
the Prime Minister and I haven't always seen</i>

1167
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,319
<i>eye-to-eye on every issue,</i>

1168
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:51,759
<i>but recently events have thrown us together.
And do you know what?</i>

1169
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,759
<i>We've found we actually like each other.</i>

1170
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,479
-<i>You get on.</i>
-<i>Extremely well.</i>

1171
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,720
<i>We've always got on
on a personal level, and now…</i>

1172
01:16:58,799 --> 01:17:00,240
Didn't hear you get up.

1173
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:01,919
Good morning. How are you?

1174
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,600
-Better, much better.
-Good.

1175
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,439
Do you know the Home Secretary?

1176
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,640
The one who says, "We can't be free
because we have to be safe"?

1177
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,919
That's her.

1178
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
-Thank you, Mr Eliot.
-Thank you very much.

1179
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,680
She's our deputy Prime Minister.

1180
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:15,439
I thought we didn't have
a deputy Prime Minister.

1181
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,319
We do now. Beasley is saying he
thinks of her as his natural successor.

1182
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:20,919
She's been bought.

1183
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,439
We need to go to work. Are you coming with me?

1184
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,600
Try and stop me.

1185
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,319
<i>Well, as you know, some Prime Ministers
designate a deputy, some don’t.</i>

1186
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:29,839
<i>Obviously, it's a mark of how well
we're now working together</i>

1187
01:17:29,919 --> 01:17:32,959
<i>that the Prime Minister has wanted
to give me this particular job title.</i>

1188
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:44,319
-Emma. How are you?
-Busy.

1189
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,640
You haven't met, have you? This is Nancy Pierpan.

1190
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:50,600
-Okay.
-So sorry to hear your news.

1191
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,759
She's my neighbour.

1192
01:17:52,839 --> 01:17:55,080
She's kindly doing a stint as my chauffeur.

1193
01:17:56,799 --> 01:17:57,959
Come in.

1194
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:07,160
Go to the barn. She's waiting for you.

1195
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,919
Do you think Nancy could
possibly have a cup of coffee?

1196
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:41,799
I'm so sorry. I said terrible things.

1197
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:44,359
It's my fault. I've been stupid.

1198
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,959
I'm a bad father.

1199
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,200
Just put my mind at rest.

1200
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:52,120
It's not Ralph Wilson, is it?

1201
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,759
Ralph Wilson?

1202
01:18:54,839 --> 01:18:56,319
Why would it be Ralph?

1203
01:18:56,759 --> 01:18:58,399
Because I saw you together.

1204
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,640
-Are you out of your head?
-Thank God!

1205
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,959
Is that what you've been thinking?
Is that what you think of me?

1206
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,680
I didn't know what to think.

1207
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:06,600
If you must know,

1208
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:11,200
-it was a conceptual artist.
-Oh.

1209
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,520
Good.Well...

1210
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,160
I'm glad conceptual artists are good for something.

1211
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,839
How long did it last?

1212
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,319
It lasted a week.

1213
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,959
A good week?

1214
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,520
Well, then, your daughter’s in with a chance.

1215
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,200
How do you know it's a girl?

1216
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:34,080
Because I had a girl.

1217
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,160
I don't know why I bothered to make you all lunch.

1218
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,240
-God knows, I've got enough to do.
-It's delicious.

1219
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:01,879
Everyone says Benedict knew he was dying.

1220
01:20:01,959 --> 01:20:05,080
So why didn't he at least
leave us an order of service?

1221
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,879
Did he ask for anything in particular?

1222
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,080
Oh, you know. Stuff about England.

1223
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,000
So typical. So typical of him.

1224
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:22,560
I don't think Benedict gave a damn
about England, did he? Except...

1225
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,959
as some version of paradise.

1226
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,879
Imaginary, like all paradise.

1227
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,439
I'm sure it's what the Belgians feel about Belgium.

1228
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,959
I'm sure they do.

1229
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,600
And the frigging Albanians.

1230
01:20:36,759 --> 01:20:38,000
And you're no use.

1231
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,319
You like jazz.

1232
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,839
Johnny, can you come with me, please?

1233
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,080
-There was a politician.
-I'm sorry?

1234
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:11,279
An American politician came here for lunch.

1235
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:12,839
Couple of weeks ago.

1236
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,640
I don't suppose you remember his name.

1237
01:21:19,919 --> 01:21:22,919
He piloted his plane to the local airfield.

1238
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,359
You didn't mention this before.

1239
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,799
I was angry before.

1240
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:44,359
Is the plane enough of a clue?

1241
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:51,439
It's not certain, but there's a fair chance
that I'm going to have to leave the country.

1242
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,200
I have a feeling this week may not end well.

1243
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,120
I'm running out of rope.

1244
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,200
They're not gonna make me Deputy Prime Minister.

1245
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,759
Will I see you at the funeral?

1246
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,839
I'll try.

1247
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:19,560
"Try" as in you will, "try" as in you won't?

1248
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,680
He's on his way.

1249
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:46,799
You're going to tell me what you're doing?

1250
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:48,319
I'm doing what you do for a living.

1251
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:50,640
Aren't you in the surveillance business?

1252
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,439
Going through your things, seeing what's there.

1253
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,439
Don't worry. I don't do guns or violence.

1254
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:00,439
How did you get in?

1255
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,040
There's a dead-lock in the combination.

1256
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,839
We still have skills in the public sector
you don't in the private.

1257
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,399
Contact, contact.

1258
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,080
Nancy, you can come up now.

1259
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,640
This is an expensive outfit.

1260
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,040
I was wondering who'd stake
such a serious investment.

1261
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,479
And then I saw the photo on the fridge.

1262
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,279
I had you marked from the beginning.

1263
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:22,959
-I know you did.
-From the moment I met you.

1264
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,919
I've been taking photos of your operation.

1265
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,120
-Are they on that camera?
-And sending them to a computer.

1266
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,000
You're Jill Tankard’s little boy.

1267
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:32,959
Nothing to say?

1268
01:25:36,879 --> 01:25:40,799
This is the man who pretended
to support your campaign.

1269
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,520
I can't believe what you did.

1270
01:25:42,919 --> 01:25:44,120
I can't believe it.

1271
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:48,600
-How far would you have taken it?
-I'd have slept with you.

1272
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,279
For Queen and country, I would have done it.

1273
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:52,919
I was never interested in you,
I was interested in him.

1274
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,359
I meant to believe that it was a coincidence.

1275
01:25:55,839 --> 01:26:00,120
An MI5 man just happens to live
opposite a known subversive.

1276
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,359
I'm not a subversive.

1277
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:03,479
-Then what the fuck are you?
-Ralph!

1278
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,479
It's time to have a word with your mum.

1279
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:23,040
I'm going to leave early.
Please cancel all my appointments.

1280
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:30,479
He's back in contact.

1281
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,479
What made you choose this place?

1282
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,479
Best reason, because the food is good.

1283
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,240
Hello. I've got whisky,
but my friend usually drinks white wine.

1284
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:53,560
-Whisky.
-Of course.

1285
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:59,120
So, interesting choice.
How does it feel to be unemployable?

1286
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,080
What's in the bag? Have you brought me the file?

1287
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,839
I've been trying to calculate
how long you've been working this racket.

1288
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:04,959
What racket is that?

1289
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,640
You're running a cowboy unit out of Downing Street.

1290
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,000
Don't think you can call it a cowboy unit.
We answer to the Prime Minister.

1291
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,479
-Clearly you've forgotten, so do we.
-What's your point?

1292
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,319
The Prime Minister never liked the security services

1293
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:17,560
because we refused to tell
him what he wanted to hear

1294
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,279
and we were always bothering him with facts.

1295
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,560
So he started his own intelligence unit. Am I right?

1296
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,439
Dealing directly with the Americans.

1297
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:30,080
In traditional practice, the torturers
are meant to be held at arm's length.

1298
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:31,680
You have no proof.

1299
01:27:31,759 --> 01:27:34,319
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

1300
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,560
I found Ben's source.

1301
01:27:36,759 --> 01:27:38,879
I've spoken to Ben's source.

1302
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:42,240
-I don't believe you.
-Believe what you like.

1303
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:44,160
And will that source go on the record?

1304
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,560
-Can you produce that source?
-That's a gamble you're going to have to take.

1305
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,720
Johnny, you're bluffing with an empty hand.

1306
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,479
Is the Prime Minister willing to take that risk?

1307
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,240
I know the source.

1308
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,120
Face it, the world's changed.

1309
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:09,759
What are the British gonna do? Get new allies?

1310
01:28:09,839 --> 01:28:13,080
-Allies who behave better?
-Benedict was onto you, wasn't he?

1311
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,200
He'd worked it out. That's why he put the file out.

1312
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:17,319
Because he knew you were betraying
your own department.

1313
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:20,080
Reporting to the Prime Minister isn't betrayal.

1314
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,399
You financed a piece of private enterprise
and employed your own son.

1315
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:27,640
I've taken photographs of his premises.

1316
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:35,080
Fuck this. This isn't the student union.
I'm not here to debate.

1317
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,279
The world's moving on, and it's time it did.

1318
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:40,600
Because you guys, with your
public-school ties and your,

1319
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,560
"After you, old chap," didn't
make much of a job of it, did you?

1320
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,640
Last meeting of the club, Johnny.
Last meeting of the club.

1321
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,959
In the last 48 hours you've
broken every rule in the book.

1322
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,359
You're no longer in the service.
You will never work again.

1323
01:28:58,439 --> 01:28:59,520
Your pension’s gone.

1324
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,120
And if you blow the whistle now
you'll also go to prison.

1325
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,439
Is that what you want?

1326
01:29:04,759 --> 01:29:08,399
Because that's what lies ahead
if you don't give me that file.

1327
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,000
-I'm willing to cut a deal.
-What's the deal?

1328
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:15,120
No Royal Commission, no reorganisation.

1329
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,600
-Is that all?
-No.

1330
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:21,479
Publication of the internal Israeli report
on the death of Jake Pierpan.

1331
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,560
-You're crazy.
-We leak it.

1332
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,200
The government admits it's deeply concerned.

1333
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,240
It's shocked at the cover-up
in the occupied territories. That's the deal.

1334
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,000
-You know it's impossible.
-Is it?

1335
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,080
-Of course!
-It's the quid pro quo.

1336
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,759
You give me something, I give you something.

1337
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:42,080
Think about it. This is far worse.

1338
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:49,600
Isn't the temptation of heroism
coming a little late in your career?

1339
01:29:50,879 --> 01:29:53,359
I've watched you work. I always admired you.

1340
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,839
I thought, “Johnny's clever.
Johnny keeps out of trouble.

1341
01:29:58,879 --> 01:30:01,080
"Johnny's a lucky man, he's got a life."

1342
01:30:04,959 --> 01:30:07,439
Don't you have a life, Jill?

1343
01:30:14,839 --> 01:30:16,160
It's the girl, isn't it?

1344
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:19,240
You're doing this for the girl.

1345
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,160
They come and go. Don't they, Johnny?

1346
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,200
They come and go.

1347
01:30:29,919 --> 01:30:31,399
Not this time.

1348
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:39,040
Is the file in there?

1349
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,240
-Hello?
-Is that Allegra?

1350
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:55,319
<i>It is.</i>

1351
01:30:55,799 --> 01:30:58,640
<i>I believe my friend Rollo
gave you a document.</i>

1352
01:30:58,720 --> 01:30:59,839
He did.

1353
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,479
Go ahead, broadcast. You have my permission.

1354
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,200
-Thank you.
-<i>Good luck.</i>

1355
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,799
-What are you doing?
-Just reading.

1356
01:31:46,879 --> 01:31:48,000
Okay.

1357
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,839
Looking for the next great novel.

1358
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,640
They don't seem to understand
that feelings are interesting,

1359
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,160
but the world is interesting, too.

1360
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,759
-Want some coffee?
-I have to say goodbye.

1361
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:05,720
-Goodbye?
-Yeah.

1362
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,479
What does goodbye mean?

1363
01:32:13,799 --> 01:32:16,799
If you want a Saab, it's waiting in Cambridge.

1364
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:19,160
You'll have to pay the parking charges,

1365
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,759
but it's nicer than your Peugeot.

1366
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:26,799
This is a small painting you might like.

1367
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,680
It's by the same artist,

1368
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,560
but not as good.

1369
01:32:32,959 --> 01:32:34,399
Couldn't possibly take it.

1370
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:35,720
You can take it.

1371
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:38,879
You're going to live for
many years and be an old woman.

1372
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:42,399
And this way, you'll always have
something decent on your wall.

1373
01:32:43,919 --> 01:32:45,919
Going to tell me why you have to go?

1374
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,359
I've cut a deal.

1375
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:50,319
They've gone along with it, but they don't like it.

1376
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:52,359
They'll make my life not worth living.

1377
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:55,200
Would you like me to come with you?

1378
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,839
I couldn't ask you to do that.

1379
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:06,879
Couldn't or...won't?

1380
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:17,520
I'm not really used to the idea
of having feelings again.

1381
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:22,160
It's dangerous, isn't it?

1382
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,080
Too dangerous for you?

1383
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,640
I'm frightened. I fuck everything up.

1384
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,720
Shh.

1385
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,959
Thank you.

1386
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,120
-You're welcome.
-This is very kind of you.

1387
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:25,919
We're heading north.

1388
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,479
We're here today to remember
the life of Benedict Baron.

1389
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:51,200
The hymns and readings
have been chosen by his family.

1390
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:55,399
And the first hymn by his
oldest friend, John Worricker.

1391
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,160
<i>I Vow to Thee, My Country.</i>

1392
01:35:10,359 --> 01:35:15,640
# <i>I vow to thee, my country</i>

1393
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:20,279
# <i>All earthly things above</i>

1394
01:35:20,359 --> 01:35:25,200
# <i>Entire and whole and perfect</i>

1395
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:30,040
# <i>The service of my love</i> #

1396
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,399
<i>The government today responded officially</i>

1397
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:38,680
<i>to the document obtained by the BBC</i>

1398
01:35:38,759 --> 01:35:41,359
<i>which reveals that
the peace campaigner Jake Pierpan</i>

1399
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:43,720
<i>was gunned down in the occupied territories</i>

1400
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,919
<i>when he was clearly holding a white flag.</i>

1401
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,600
<i>The Prime Minister, Alec Beasley,
today visiting his constituency,</i>

1402
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:54,000
<i>acknowledged the strengths
of public reaction to the revelation.</i>

1403
01:35:54,080 --> 01:36:00,240
<i>Even at times of national crisis, certain
basic human freedoms have to be protected.</i>

1404
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:03,640
<i>We must never stop insisting
on telling the truth to our enemies,</i>

1405
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,640
<i>but sometimes we have to tell the truth
to our friends as well.</i>

1406
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,319
<i>That's a difficult duty, but between
democracies with shared values</i>

1407
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:13,919
<i>it's an essential one.</i>

1408
01:36:14,759 --> 01:36:19,120
# <i>And there's another country</i>

1409
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,839
# <i>I've heard of long ago</i>

1410
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,959
# <i>Most dear to them that love her</i>

1411
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,759
# <i>Most great to them that know</i> #

1412
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,479
<i>Politicians on all sides in Britain</i>

1413
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,359
<i>are today expressing their shock</i>

1414
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:42,560
<i>at the news that the Israeli Army
suppressed a highly critical Shabak report,</i>

1415
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,439
<i>which established the truth
about the death of a British peace…</i>

1416
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,759
I wonder, could we change the station?

1417
01:36:47,839 --> 01:36:49,439
<i>Anything you want?</i>

1418
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,240
I'd like some jazz.
