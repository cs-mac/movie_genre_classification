1
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,716
Man, you know, who says
you need to buy a guitar?

2
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,192
<i>It's like a piece of sculpture.</i>

3
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:44,893
<i>Wonderful span of wood varnish.</i>

4
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:49,359
<i>The whole aroma of it.
Like a woman, you know?</i>

5
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,228
<i>You can caress it like a woman.</i>

6
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,726
<i>Every element,
the wood, the finish,</i>

7
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:01,596
<i>and all the different aspects
are there in the sound.</i>

8
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:08,629
<i>Electric conveys,
like, amplification, energy.</i>

9
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,756
<i>It's all part
and parcel of who I am,</i>

10
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:17,272
is playing the electric
guitar and bonding with it.

11
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,024
It's gonna be very interesting.

12
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,625
It's gonna be very interesting

13
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:38,158
because both are really, really
strong character guitarists.

14
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,692
Both White Stripes and Zeppelin

15
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,193
<i>were able to do something that
was their own, was unique,</i>

16
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:46,692
<i>and had never been done before.</i>

17
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,024
When the three of us get
together, what's gonna happen?

18
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,553
Probably a fistfight.

19
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,489
There's a lot of
soul in this guitar.

20
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>When Jack plays it,
it just goes wild.</i>

21
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:28,092
This is Edge's main...
His main enchilada.

22
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,491
This is the brain
of the system.

23
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:34,856
<i>It's going to be interesting to
see him layering his effects.</i>

24
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,261
He's known to be
a sort of sonic architect.

25
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:42,717
I plan to trick
both of these guys.

26
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:44,858
That's basically
what I'm gonna do.

27
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:48,402
Trick them into teaching
me all their tricks.

28
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,522
We're going there
to have a chat.

29
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:03,223
But it just so happens
that the instruments

30
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,016
are sort of there
as well, so who knows?

31
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:31,322
What's this, Edge?

32
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,723
It's a little...
It's a form of yoga.

33
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,021
It's, uh...

34
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,924
It actually was
devised in Wales.

35
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,459
It's called Daboke.

36
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:45,722
Are you... What's the
BlackBerry to do with it?

37
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:49,221
It's just a little
adaptation I've made

38
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:53,156
just to make
better use of time.

39
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:55,489
Does Sting do this?

40
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,167
He doesn't do Daboke, he does
some other kind of yoga.

41
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:12,855
<i>I'm very interested
in what hardware can do</i>

42
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:15,689
<i>to an electric guitar sound.</i>

43
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,655
<i>I love effects units.</i>

44
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:21,455
<i>They've always
pushed music forward.</i>

45
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,923
When he pushes a button...

46
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:27,155
Let's say that button addresses
that unit, you know?

47
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:29,521
This button
addresses that unit.

48
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,222
And it's very rarely

49
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:37,888
that he will use the same sound
ever again in 20, 23 songs.

50
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:58,921
<i>The guitars are set per song</i>

51
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,320
<i>with their output levels.</i>

52
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,923
They're dedicated for that song
and that guitar level is...

53
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:09,720
He sets his effects to receive

54
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,389
that guitar level
in a particular way.

55
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,386
<i>I drive everyone crazy.</i>

56
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:27,054
<i>I drive myself totally crazy,
trying to get the sound</i>

57
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:31,621

to come out of the speakers.</i>

you know, their personality
comes through.

110
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:39,916
During my time as a
songwriter and performer,

111
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:44,781
I've kind of watched and felt that
I was seeing the end of the guitar

112
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:49,013
as a kind of focus
for popular music.

113
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:52,247
And yet every time I think
it's kind of counted out,

114
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:53,383
it flares up somewhere else.

115
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:58,613
I keep guitars that are, you know...
The neck's a little bit bent,

116
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,246
and it's a little
bit out of tune,

117
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,749
and I want to
work and battle it

118
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,014
and conquer it
and make it express

119
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,513
whatever attitude
I have at that moment.

120
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:07,783
I want it to be a struggle.

121
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,686
I have no idea
what these are, but...

122
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:41,146
<i>My early demos
were real sketches.</i>

123
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,756
<i>They weren't fully fleshed out.</i>

124
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:52,314
That's interesting.
That ended up...

125
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:59,514
<i>It's the music that tells us the
direction the song should go.</i>

126
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:03,180
<i>As writers,
we start with the feeling</i>

127
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,751
<i>and everything
follows from that.</i>

128
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:11,580
These guitar parts ended up
in the final version,

129
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:14,945
so this could be
discovering, you know,

130
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:20,881
those particular voicings of
the chords and what have you.

131
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:37,416
<i>Four, five, six.</i>

132
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:40,616
<i>Four, five, six.</i>

133
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:46,213
Bono's actually
calling out the timing.

134
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:48,012
That's funny.

135
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,452
Four, five, six.

136
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:56,080
'Cause the first section's in
a different time signature,

137
00:14:56,081 --> 00:15:01,411
so it was a little bit of a head
trip to go between the two.

138
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,281
One, two, three,
four, five, six. One...

139
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,011
But you can count
it in different ways.

140
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:11,444
...six. One, two,
three, four, five, six.

141
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,279
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

142
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,983
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

143
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,747
Or you can go, one, two,
three, one, two, three.

144
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:24,344
It's like a waltz beat.

145
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,813
One, two, three,
one, two, three,

146
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:28,145
one, two, three,
one, two, three.

147
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,478
<i>When you start to
treat the sound,</i>

148
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,711
<i>you start to invoke locations.</i>

149
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:29,879
<i>As I'm working, I'm often
thinking about, "Where is this?"</i>

150
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:32,482
<i>Where is this location?</i>

151
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:41,313
Wow, there was a whole science block
there when I was living here.

152
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,179
That's amazing.

153
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:49,344
We played on a kind of
flat area over there with,

154
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,716
<i>I wouldn't say

So, rehearsal was 10 minutes of
clearing away desks and chairs,

165
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,544

In those days, the drummer
would be in a little booth

00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:17,652
<i>Really paring it down
to the absolute bare minimum.</i>

451
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,314
<i>When it's so simple, you
can turn it up really loud</i>

452
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,559
<i>and it's got more aggression.</i>

453
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:47,982
Is it right to the C?

454
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,550
No, actually,
what I meant is...

455
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,050
It can't be.

456
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,432
Yeah.

457
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:09,300
And then up to the hook.

458
00:42:26,283 --> 00:42:28,249
- Right.
- Are you sure about that C?

459
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,947
- Okay.
- That sounds good, doesn't it?

460
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,849
Sounds great, guys.
Roaring, yeah.

461
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,282
Punk-rock nihilism.

462
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,214
There's a bit of the
punk rock in this man.

463
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:37,121
I think there's some
punk left in there.

<i>It was uncool to play guitar.</i>

480
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:46,945
<i>To play an instrument was</i>

481
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:50,745

482

<i>DJs and rappers.</i>

484

<i>It was very uncool to

<i>There was no record store,

your head against a wall here.</i>

504
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:27,578
<i>And I figured that it was...</i>

505
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:31,719
<i>Best thing to do at that
point was actually retire.</i>

506
00:45:37,713 --> 00:45:40,912
<i>So I went to art college.</i>

507
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:44,745
<i>Just as much
as I wanted to play guitar,</i>

508
00:45:44,746 --> 00:45:46,414
<i>I also wanted to be an artist.</i>

509

<i>It had always
been something in me.</i>

510
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:58,611
<i>I wanted to know the techniques
of oil painting, life drawing,</i>

511
00:45:58,612 --> 00:46:01,614
<i>graphic design, sculpture</i>

512
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:05,979
<i>and the techniques

513
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,180
<i>You know, I apprenticed out to a
lot of people when I was younger.</i>

514
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:27,982
<i>I was an apprentice in an upholstery
shop when I was a teenager.</i>

515
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:33,176
<i>Brian Muldoon was the master
of the upholstery shop</i>

516
00:46:33,177 --> 00:46:35,943
<i>and he was the one teaching
me, and he played drums.</i>

517
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:38,609
<i>Well, I guess
I'll play guitar then.</i>

518
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,543
<i>So when we were
done with our workday</i>

519
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:44,815
<i>we'd move the couches over, and

<i>He'd pick me up from school.</i>

523
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,841
<i>I'd start tearing down
the furniture,</i>

524
00:46:57,842 --> 00:47:00,943
<i>ripping off fabric and cotton
off of old chairs,</i>

525
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:04,777
<i>gluing fabric to foam

526
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:06,841
<i>tearing off

527
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:09,160
<i>You can imagine all the stuff

<i>M&M'S, cereal,

529
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:19,075
<i>Oh, here's how
you sew a welt cord,</i>

530
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:22,609
<i>or here's how you sew a fly
strip on the back of a decking.</i>

531
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,741
<i>He exposed me to punk music.</i>

<i>The Velvet Underground,

533
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:32,576
<i>Really took me under his wing to be an
employee and to play music together.</i>

534
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:36,374
<i>And then I started writing songs.
We kind of became a band.</i>

535
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,279
<i>We got to put out a record and
we called it The Upholsterers.</i>

536
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:44,543
<i>So, this song is
Froggy Went a-Courting,</i>

537
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:46,109
<i>you know, the folk song,
Froggy Went a-Courting.</i>

538
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,242
Mmm-hmm.

539
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:51,714
But I'd never heard it
like this before though.

540
00:47:54,711 --> 00:47:57,041

<i>Headed in, what I would have thought
at the time, backwards direction.</i>

555
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,612
<i>I had to reassess what
backwards meant in my mind.</i>

556
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:15,942
<i>That opened up a whole new
inspiration for me about the guitar.</i>

557
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,717
<i>I started to leave the
drums alone a little bit.</i>

558
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:38,273
The first guitar I ever bought.

559
00:49:38,274 --> 00:49:40,706
This was, you know,
brand-new when I bought it.

560
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:42,273
It's just been
with me ever since.

561
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:46,106
And when we recorded our first
album with Steve Lillywhite,

562
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:49,272
we were in the studio in Dublin
and we did the backing tracks.

563
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:51,606
And he said, "You know,
let's do some overdubs

- "with a different guitar."
- Mmm-hmm.

565
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:55,873
I said, "What do you mean?

<i>I was 17, I think,

<i>And my family actually
were in New York.</i>

570
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:29,971
<i>It was like
walking into a movie for me.</i>

571
00:50:29,972 --> 00:50:33,038
<i>I mean, I remember, not only did they
speak like they did in the movies,</i>

572
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:35,107
<i>but the cars looked like
they did in the movies.</i>

573
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:37,870
<i>That's actually
how people spoke.</i>

574
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,849
<i>That's actually what
the place looked like.</i>

575
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,803
<i>It's a burden when you
have a truck or a van,</i>

576
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:53,570
<i>because everybody you know wants you to
move their stuff for them, you know.</i>

577
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:55,838
<i>So every time
you get a phone call,</i>

578
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,611
<i>you're like, "Yeah, I'll come help
you move your stove or your safe."</i>

579
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:09,571
<i>I helped my brother

580
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:14,074
<i>Him and his wife started managing a St.
Vincent de Paul store.</i>

581
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:19,739
<i>It's like a Salvation Army
kind of store in Detroit.</i>

582
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,612
<i>So I helped him move
a refrigerator there.</i>

583
00:51:28,606 --> 00:51:32,606
<i>The sunburst.
Tobacco sunburst.</i>

584
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:36,405
<i>My first electric.
Just tremendous.</i>

585
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:38,770
<i>Just couldn't believe it
when I actually got it home,</i>

586
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:40,908
<i>and there it was in the house.</i>

587
00:51:42,906 --> 00:51:44,443
<i>Fantastic.</i>

588
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,741
<i>This was the one. This was
the one that I was after.</i>

589
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:57,971
<i>I went around
to the stores on the street</i>

590
00:51:57,972 --> 00:52:01,508
<i>and found Stuyvesant Guitars.</i>

591
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:06,242
<i>Guitars everywhere,
people everywhere.</i>

592
00:52:10,238 --> 00:52:13,074
<i>This instrument was just
there, calling out to me.</i>

593
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:17,543
<i>This Explorer.</i>

594
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:26,071
<i>I was really starting

595
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:29,304
<i>My technique
started to improve.</i>

596
00:52:29,305 --> 00:52:32,136
<i>It became
like a total addiction,</i>

597
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:36,238
<i>to the point where actually I was
now starting to take it to school.</i>

598
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,804
<i>And I'd be practicing
during the recess breaks.</i>

599
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:44,170
<i>And then it got to the point where
the guitar was confiscated.</i>

600
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:48,169
<i>They thought it was going to be
counterculture or something.</i>

601
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,173
<i>It wasn't doing
any harm to anybody.</i>

602
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:55,903
<i>Not then, it wasn't.</i>

603
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:59,168
<i>So, when I helped him move
the refrigerator, he said,</i>

604
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:01,335
<i>"Well, how about taking
this guitar for payment?</i>

605
00:53:01,336 --> 00:53:03,568
<i>"Thanks for helping us,"
you know.</i>

606
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:06,140
<i>And I loved it so much
I couldn't believe it.</i>

607
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:12,817
<i>I was like, "Whoa, man,
that was worth it."</i>

608
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:29,401
<i>I plugged it into an amp in
the room and just could tell.</i>

609
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:32,070
<i>This was the kind of guitar
that had possibilities.</i>

610
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:34,937
<i>There were songs
in this guitar.</i>

611
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:40,272

632
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:09,932
I had this record
at home of a guitar

633
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,798
that had a lot
of sustain on it.

634
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,101
And I got him to come around
and have a listen to it.

635
00:56:14,102 --> 00:56:16,465
I said,
"Can you get that?"

636
00:56:16,466 --> 00:56:20,436
<i>And he went away and came back
with this phenomenal thing.</i>

00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:25,768

<i>overdrive the sound and
make it sound pretty rude.</i>

639
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:07,433
This is what
I'm actually playing.

640
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:19,131
That's it. The rest is the foot
pedal, the effects, the whole thing.

641
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,998
You know, so if you're on
an acoustic, trying to say,

642
00:57:20,999 --> 00:57:23,265
"Here's my new riff. It's a
really cool riff. Listen."

643
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:35,799
Oh, my Lord.

644
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:38,364
Wow.

645
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:44,598
That's impressive.
That's great.

646
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,599
It was a single cutaway, and
I had this brilliant luthier

647
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,464
in Seattle, Randy Parsons.

648
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:52,862
And he made it
a double cutaway for me.

649
00:57:52,863 --> 00:57:55,830
And then I said, "Well,
listen, I have an idea.

653
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:32,398
<i>I got this echo unit and I
brought it back to rehearsal,</i>

654
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:35,097

totally into playing,</i>

655
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,167
<i>but listening to
the return echo</i>

656
00:58:40,164 --> 00:58:43,497

that I'm not playing,</i>

657
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:45,868
<i>like two guitar players
rather than one.</i>

658
00:58:50,863 --> 00:58:56,330
<i>The exact same thing, but it's
just a little bit off to one side.</i>

659
00:58:56,331 --> 00:59:00,497
<i>I could see ways to use it
that had never been used.</i>

660
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:02,831
<i>Suddenly everything changed.</i>

661
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:12,429
So, Jimmy, what...

662
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,996
You know, those early songs that
you played on in the studio,

663
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:16,629
- what did you actually play on?
- Yeah.

664
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,462
I mean,
that I would have heard,

665
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:20,795
like, there's all
these legends about...

666
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:22,496
Well, sometimes you
could hear what I did,

667
00:59:22,497 --> 00:59:24,796
and other times, you
couldn't hear what I did.

668
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,996
<i>But, I mean,
I was on Goldfinger.</i>

669
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,496
That was fantastic.

670
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:30,731
Yeah. She did one take and
collapsed at the end of it.

671
00:59:32,263 --> 00:59:35,129
But, you know, it was huge, huge big
orchestra in the EMI number one,

672
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,961
which was a massive,
great studio, you know.

673
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:39,164
They did a lot of
film stuff in there.

674
00:59:39,165 --> 00:59:41,130
And, like, The Kinks stuff?

675
00:59:41,131 --> 00:59:42,431
I did some Kinks stuff.

676
00:59:42,432 --> 00:59:44,230
- Really?
- Yeah. I didn't...

677
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:46,428
I mean, you know, it all got out of hand,
you know, about what I had done

678
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:47,761
and what I hadn't done.

679
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:49,520
Really, it became, like,
the stuff of legend.

680
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:52,429
You know, before you knew what
it was, you'd done everything.

681
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,261
<i>I was filling in,
in an interval band</i>

682
01:00:05,262 --> 01:00:07,794
<i>at a club called
The Marquee Club,</i>

683
01:00:07,795 --> 01:00:09,669
<i>playing on Thursday evening.</i>

684
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:19,336
<i>And somebody asked me, said, "Would
you like to play on the record?"</i>

685
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:32,161
<i>The record just bubbled in on
the lower end of the Top 20.</i>

686
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:35,595
<i>Then it moved so quickly.</i>

687
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:39,834
The invitations to do more records
were so frequent after that.

01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:19,570
<i>No life was sacred.</i>

742
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:37,589
<i>The crunch came. This one day
I went into this session.</i>

743
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,992
<i>I saw this big ream of paper
in front of me.</i>

744
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:46,460
<i>I started to get
very uncomfortable.</i>

745
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:52,728
<i>There was no run-through. They
counted you in, and off you went.</i>

746
01:05:57,723 --> 01:05:59,959
<i>It literally was Muzak.</i>

747
01:06:01,957 --> 01:06:03,788
<i>I'm not actually
creating anything.</i>

748
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:07,221
<i>I'm interpreting whatever it
is that's written down now.</i>

749
01:06:07,222 --> 01:06:09,194
<i>And I'm even
doing Muzak sessions.</i>

750
01:06:14,189 --> 01:06:15,658
<i>Tearing my hair out.</i>

751
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,300
<i>And I've got to get out of it.</i>

752
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:35,655
<i>And I thought about it
for a long time, for days.</i>

753
01:06:35,656 --> 01:06:37,889
<i>There's this whole new world that's
just opened up in front of me</i>

754
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:41,887
<i>and I have to figure out,
"How do I get there?</i>

755
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:44,700
<i>"Am I not allowed
to get there?"</i>

756
01:06:55,688 --> 01:06:59,689
<i>Bono put it to me, he said, "You
know, Edge, I think maybe if you</i>

757
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:03,029
<i>"would do a bit of time
on your own."</i>

758
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:12,691
<i>I remember feeling,
"Well, can I write?</i>

759
01:07:15,688 --> 01:07:19,193
<i>"You know, am I a writer,
or am I just a guitarist?"</i>

760
01:07:24,188 --> 01:07:28,186
<i>This is it.
This is the day of departure.</i>

761
01:07:28,187 --> 01:07:32,069
<i>I wanted to get out there, and I had
a lot that I really wanted to do.</i>

762
01:07:48,753 --> 01:07:53,193
<i>The minute that I was in The Yardbirds,
that bow was out immediately.</i>

763
01:07:58,188 --> 01:08:01,952
<i>I shed this coat off of me, and
then I wanted to try everything</i>

764
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,485
<i>that was breaking rules. I wanted
to do things that sped up.</i>

765
01:08:04,486 --> 01:08:07,604
<i>I wanted to do things that were like
playing a bow and hurting people's ears.</i>

766
01:08:14,453 --> 01:08:18,420
<i>I started to look for
ways to get away with it</i>

767
01:08:18,421 --> 01:08:22,285
<i>and not be some sort
of white-boy blues band.</i>

768
01:08:22,286 --> 01:08:24,291
<i>And we went and played
open-mic night.</i>

769
01:08:27,288 --> 01:08:29,006
<i>We were kind of in
our own little world.</i>

770
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:33,156
<i>Meg didn't really
want to do it.</i>

771
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,786
<i>I was pushing her.</i>

772
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:38,650
<i>If I put her behind the drums,</i>

773
01:08:38,651 --> 01:08:41,485
<i>then, you know, maybe something
interesting will happen.</i>

774
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:45,688
<i>She just played like a little
caveman and a little child.</i>

775
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:50,286
<i>We started to form
everything around Meg.</i>

776
01:08:50,287 --> 01:08:53,153
<i>We saw a bag of
peppermint candies.</i>

777
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:54,987
<i>I said, "Well, that should
be on your bass drum.</i>

778
01:08:54,988 --> 01:08:58,486
<i>"We should paint that
on your bass drum."</i>

779
01:08:58,487 --> 01:09:01,687
<i>By this time,
I had found a red guitar.</i>

780
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:07,419
<i>This red guitar and
the peppermint candy</i>

781
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,752
<i>dictated the aesthetic

784

White Stripes became the big
way to get away with it.

785
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,051

band that was, you know...

786
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:25,418
Red, white and black
was the complete aesthetic.

787
01:09:25,419 --> 01:09:27,083
And it was childish, and
we're presenting ourselves

788
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,350
in a real childish manner,
almost like cartoon characters.

789
01:09:29,351 --> 01:09:31,417

to keep people away

790
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:33,218
from what was really going on,

791
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:36,683
which was, we were just really
trying to play this, you know.

792
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:37,921

No, I don't think they did.

I didn't think they had a
clue what we were doing,

I can't tell you
what the process is.

869
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:10,208
It changes from
one thing to another,

870

but it usually
comes just from...

871
01:18:12,576 --> 01:18:14,708
For anybody who's writing or,

872
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:17,942
you know, whether they're writing
written word or music or whatever,

01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:21,709

I thought to myself, "How am I
going to do this on stage?"

880
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:59,042
