1
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,076
The power of the imagination.

2
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,276
Any form of human culture is the result of this unique gift.

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,191
This gift brought forth a wide variety of cultural expressions ...

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,718
of business activity and innovation, the 6000 languages ​​spoken on Earth.

5
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,958
We are also the kind that Hamlet has produced, and the works of Mozart ...

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,795
the industrial revolution, hip hop, jazz, quantum mechanics ...

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
the theory of relativity, jet ...

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,158
and all those other things that are the essence of human culture.

9
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,515
But I think we systematically destroy this talent in our children ...

10
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,752
and in ourselves.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,436
I choose my words carefully. I'm not 'intentionally'.

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,752
I do not think we do it on purpose, but systematically.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,199
We do it routinely, without thinking. And that's the worst.

14
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,476
Because we take for granted certain ideas about education and children:

15
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,590
What education is and what the social and economic usefulness is.

16
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,118
We proceed from certain assumptions, which appear to be untrue.

17
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,200
An airman stands for hope.

18
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,796
It's a metaphor for our education.

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,788
We compare our children with kites ...

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,151
which are held by parents and school in the air.

21
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,788
We hope they always fly higher ...

22
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,519
but in reality we do everything to keep the reins.

23
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,593
And education by the parents works exactly.

24
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,076
I'm Yang Dongping, a professor of pedagogy at the University of Beijing.

25
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,713
I stand at the head of the working group 'Education in the 21st Century. "

26
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,032
I recommend the government ...

27
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,794
about legislation regarding education.

28
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,196
China was in the past ...

29
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,990
not in favor of competitive thinking.

30
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,713
The motto was equality. Everyone ate from the same pot.

31
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,955
Since the reform and open door policy, the market economy has been introduced ...

32
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,955
and competition in education has expanded.

33
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,955
Since then, any education, from high to low ...

34
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,479
sucked into a spiral cut-throat competition.

35
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,590
I do not know what I'm after.

36
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,959
The parents of these children have made great sacrifices for this city.

37
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,353
They have the high rise and the new town built with their own hands.

38
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,679
The children in these migrant schools ...

39
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,071
are different than urban children.

40
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,598
Here the children can still be real child.

41
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,990
In the city, especially at elite schools ...

42
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,234
there is great competition ...

43
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,949
and a huge exam pressure.

44
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,796
Both the government and the parents aspire to it ...

45
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,709
that the children achieve great things ...

46
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,758
and win important prizes.

47
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,359
But we now know ...

48
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,592
that this enormous pressure to perform ...

49
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,514
does not correspond to the nature of a child.

50
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,593
Everyone is now convinced of ...

51
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,039
but we strive for upward mobility and access to top universities.

52
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,670
So keep everyone stuck ...

53
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,515
this unhealthy system.

54
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,754
Now we are again stuck in traffic. Then think you do, a ring road is being built ...

55
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,072
Just a few years later ...

56
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,834
we are back to square one.

57
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,796
I work for the OECD ...

58
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,629
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

59
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,758
We think hard about how politics ...

60
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,549
can improve the living conditions of people.

61
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,510
Education occupies a key position.

62
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,552
I will introduce you to our guest.

63
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,272
Here on the right for you ...

64
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,718
zit Mr Andreas Schleicher.

65
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,990
Mr Andreas Schleicher is one of our great experts ...

66
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,118
and the driving force behind PISA.

67
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,513
In his native Germany, he is known as Mr. PISA.

68
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,389
We went together to the US.

69
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,111
We've been in LA and New York.

70
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,716
We also visited Yale and Harvard.

71
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,952
That is beautiful. That was great.

72
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,597
That is beautiful. Here you get so good chances.

73
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,838
Normally it strikes twelve years. Why do you do it in nine or ten years?

74
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,551
We want to see if we can handle this educational system.

75
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,475
So you make the same examinations, but in less time.

76
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,278
At a younger age.

77
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,477
Do you also have a life outside of school?

78
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,349
Of course. There are all sorts of activities.

79
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,308
Here you can see all extracurricular activities.

80
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,349
You finished school two years earlier, but you are ten years older.

81
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,196
Would it be worth it?

82
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,557
The future is worth more here than the present.

83
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,955
Each family will give his last penny to get the child to the best school.

84
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,150
We see that it is possible for all children to have very good performance.

85
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,193
Preselection international math olympiad Sichuan

86
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,077
In China exams become an important economic factor.

87
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,952
Extra classes and refresher courses for primary and secondary education ...

88
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,476
are very common.

89
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,278
Since 2009, all 14 of these specialized companies listed on the stock exchange in the US.

90
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,512
Are made huge profits.

91
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,039
There are schools where children receive early as four years of homework.

92
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,279
The economic stakes are very high.

93
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,231
There is a new phenomenon: the "mathematics olympiad.

94
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,949
It is a disaster for all young people.

95
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,273
Look, these two form a straight line. Not true?

96
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,353
This is 16, and 4. The umpteenth part of 64 that?

97
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,794
1,5.

98
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,754
The baselines are there.

99
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,117
Now we must define the goal. How do we do that?

100
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,956
We connect the lines, and then we get A.

101
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,951
Is that right?

102
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,954
We can connect B1 with A. But can it also with C1?

103
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,079
If you do, the drawing has no lines.

104
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,753
I've signed it.

105
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,309
Then there are no lines. -Not.

106
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,632
Kun je C1 met D verbinden?
-Ja.

107
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,951
That's right. And with BO?

108
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,270
Now we can calculate the new point.

109
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,037
Can you calculate the surface division? -1 At 5. No, wait.

110
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,476
2 at 4.

111
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,995
Let's see ... three to two.

112
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,549
And the plane of triangle BOE?

113
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,075
3A.

114
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,073
En driehoek COE?
-2A.

115
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,595
And added that? 8a.

116
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
Can you figure out what one Ais? -Yes.

117
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,119
The plane of 1E min ...? -4A.

118
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,396
Now they just need still count. -Yes.

119
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,393
Can we also divide by a whole?

120
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,590
A feature of exam-driven education ...

121
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,799
is that there is not asked to differing opinions.

122
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,390
Its sole purpose is to generate standard responses.

123
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,554
And the standard response kills the creativity of the Chinese people.

124
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,078
Children who have grown up thus lacks independence ...

125
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,951
the ability to adapt to social changes ...

126
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,516
or the ability to ask critical questions.

127
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,036
I still am in a sense optimistic that countries such as China is concerned.

128
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,432
I hope they will see where the road leads to go ...

129
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,478
and that they are also prepared ...

130
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,998
with respect to the future and the present to make other considerations than us.

131
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,314
We have definitely achieved a lot.

132
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,794
We have a long tradition on which to build. But...

133
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,389
in this world where we face new challenges every day ...

134
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,028
that is not sufficient.

135
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,271
Chinese students get compared to other students the least sleep ...

136
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,152
studying the longest, have the biggest examination pressure and are the least happy.

137
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,598
In essence, they are jealous of their parents ...

138
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,629
which can sleep late on weekends and evenings can watch TV.

139
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,397
Their being deprived of the right to relaxation.

140
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,269
Since given the first class they hate learning.

141
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,110
There is also much to be desired.

142
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,274
There's a tremendous pressure to perform in school.

143
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,831
High demands are placed on the students.

144
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,156
That is certainly not what you want for your children ...

145
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,039
and what you yourself would not accept.

146
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,752
But against these demands ...

147
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,357
is on the other side all the support ...

148
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,796
you can wish.

149
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,951
This is the high jump.

150
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,749
Thus he took fifth place in the third grade.

151
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,073
This is the fourth in the high jump.

152
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,155
In the third, he finished second and fourth, he did even better.

153
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,108
In the fifth, he was third in the 400 meters.

154
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,714
'Uitmuntend student.'

155
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,155
Second place in high jump.

156
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,311
'Uitmuntend student.'

157
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,471
'"Studietopper."

158
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,760
First prize Mathematical Olympiad youth department, this year.

159
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,437
This is the fourth year.

160
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,479
No, in the fifth year he finished second. That was last year.

161
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,555
First place in the National Mathematics Olympiad ...

162
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,676
in fifth grade.

163
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,990
And this one...

164
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,588
Hang him to.

165
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,955
Nice.

166
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,957
Let me see.

167
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,679
Beautiful, huh?

168
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,273
Which is from 2012. The first prize.

169
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,557
Win there are only a few.

170
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,188
The next time you're there again.

171
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,589
Nowadays you often hear the following statement:

172
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,320
"Children can not lose at the starting line."

173
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,597
That shows that very small children ...

174
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,356
take part in the competition. The consequences are clear:

175
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,277
Our children win at the starting line, but ended up losing them.

176
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,591
Our students are not educated ...

177
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,435
to curious creative people ...

178
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,319
but to test machines.

179
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,273
Every year there are suicides around the entrance exams of universities.

180
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,954
And there are quite a lot.

181
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,789
The situation has historically never been as bad as now.

182
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,154
China reaches all parts of the highest scores in the PISA test ...

183
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,959
and serves as great example.

184
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,638
The OECD in the 90s education as an economic factor put on the agenda.

185
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,793
To foster competition the PISA test was developed.

186
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,993
I'm Gerald Hüther. I once studied biology ...

187
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,993
and have become a brain scientist.

188
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,470
The scientific name is a neurobiologist.

189
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,997
I have done twenty years experimental brain research.

190
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,152
In recent years, my interest is especially ...

191
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,269
how to put scientific findings into practice.

192
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,554
Around this church was during the Thirty Years War the village.

193
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,113
The Catholic and Protestant forces have done here so many raids ...

194
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,953
that the whole village has been wiped out.

195
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,316
Actually sees our history like this.

196
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,270
War, misery, expulsion, and always fear again.

197
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,595
We now know that parents pass fears on to their children.

198
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,150
They are afraid that their children do not end up well ...

199
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,676
and that fear is passed.

200
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,628
That's called transgenerational transmission.

201
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,951
The fear is internalized into the essence.

202
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,478
They must come from somewhere and that could be only in our history.

203
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,235
Also our school system is formed by such suffering histories.

204
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,110
To conduct the wars of the last century ...

205
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,955
were needed youths who functioned well.

206
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,079
The school had to tame and train people.

207
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,550
A cadet training. Otherwise it was nothing made.

208
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,188
And not just the military ...

209
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,148
had well-functioning and-trained people are needed.

210
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,278
That was true for the whole economy.

211
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,353
In the so-called Age of Machines ...

212
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,798
people had to actually function as machines.

213
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,710
To that end, schools were set up ...

214
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,235
and so it was taught.

215
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,589
The people who delivered the school had to function properly.

216
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,799
If people were needed all day a lever servants ...

217
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,195
than they did.

218
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,751
And as in the Auschwitz gas chambers had to be filled ...

219
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,797
then it was done.

220
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,074
I believe that we finally have to recognize ...

221
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,550
it is not good to people in such a way off ...

222
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,713
they always do what they are told.

223
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,998
McKinsey is a leader in the field of management consultancy.

224
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,996
We help big companies to answer strategic questions ...

225
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,958
to further develop their businesses ...

226
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,398
and thus maximize their economic opportunities adequately.

227
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,030
We want to ensure that young top talents get the chance ...

228
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,035
to leave in the form of a competition to see what they have to offer ...

229
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,475
and what is important.

230
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,674
They need to learn to get out of their comfort zone.

231
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,552
I like it when everyone is willing to work hard and a lot ...

232
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,553
because they want to achieve something for the company.

233
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,518
That is at Porsche very present.

234
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,356
That is in the best interest of the company itself.

235
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,511
Dictates the market.

236
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,195
And if you look into the future ...

237
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,310
what does your ideal senior executive, male or female, look like?

238
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,076
Competitive. The rest does not matter.

239
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,629
Regardless of how?

240
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,795
A major study has been done on divergent thinking.

241
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,198
Divergent thinking is not the same as creativity ...

242
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,672
but it is an essential condition for creativity.

243
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,953
It is the ability to see many answers to a question ...

244
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,594
many ways to interpret a question ...

245
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,958
and not to think only linear or convergent.

246
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,796
They have 1500 people have a test.

247
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,436
If you scored above a certain level ...

248
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,479
you was labeled as a genius divergent thinker.

249
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,952
What percentage of the 1,500 people who took part in the test ...

250
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,669
achieved the level of genius divergent thinker?

251
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Age: 3-5 years

252
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,231
98 percent ingenious thinking level

253
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,194
It was a longitudinal study, five years later it was repeated.

254
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,318
The children were 8 to 10 years.

255
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,153
Age: 8-10 years

256
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,154
32 percent ingenious thinking level

257
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,958
Five years later they were examined again. They were 13 to 15 years.

258
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,993
Age: 13-15 years

259
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,199
10 percent ingenious thinking level

260
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,591
200 000 adults aged 25 years and older were tested once ...

261
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,354
as a control group.

262
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,988
Age: 25+

263
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,628
2 percent ingenious thinking level

264
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,588
This is interesting. We can conclude two things:

265
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,551
We all have this ability, but usually disappears.

266
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,952
A lot is happening in the lives of children as they grow up.

267
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,160
But one of the most important things is that they go to school.

268
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,112
They go to school and learn a decade that there is only one answer is possible.

269
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,956
It is not that teachers want. It just happens.

270
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,550
Because our education system that works.

271
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,276
If so, we have to think very differently.

272
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,750
Then you can not believe anything can ...

273
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,788
and seek ways to make education even better ...

274
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,436
to score better on the PISA test.

275
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,435
You'll have to instruct people, but invite to learn.

276
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,592
That is what I mean by self-management.

277
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,194
People can not develop.

278
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,957
That does not work. That brains can only himself, and only if they want to.

279
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,955
You can not force people to do so. You can only invite them.

280
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,593
Dat is de kunst.

281
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,757
Well, I'm going to read the first chapter.

282
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,790
What's that chapter? -'It Game and rail.

283
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,313
It is an introduction.

284
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,758
"I have been working for over sixty years with children.

285
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,152
Although not in an educational environment.

286
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,632
As a teacher, I had long since been retired. "

287
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,518
That is funny-

288
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,477
Funny. -It's true.

289
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,556
"Then I had to recover from a tough career.

290
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,955
I'm not going to stop my activities.

291
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,353
I still work continuously, like when I was young. "

292
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,789
If you look at the drawings of little children ...

293
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,594
you see how rich they are fantasy.

294
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,672
Once they go to school, hold on.

295
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,150
Then it's over and there will be something else.

296
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,470
Then comes what they have learned.

297
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,560
They are no more spontaneous ...

298
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,669
but carry out assignments to please the adults.

299
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,308
They meet their expectations.

300
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,629
A child can do what it wants ...

301
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,236
and wants nothing more than what it can.

302
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,551
In this way, gedĳt a child in a natural way.

303
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,475
This is only possible if you have a child which grants freedom.

304
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,555
That certainly does not apply to a student who must follow a curriculum.

305
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,599
The worst thing you can teach kids ...

306
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,357
is that they believe they can not do it themselves and have to execute commands.

307
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,830
My name is Arno Voice.

308
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,834
I was born in 1924 in Kassel.

309
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,954
I am a servant in the painting game.

310
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,596
That is a job created by me that previously did not exist.

311
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,628
Like the painter Oord. There it started.

312
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,951
From there, my role has evolved.

313
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,508
My serving role.

314
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,669
At this place a special game is played ...

315
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,310
where people of all ages come here.

316
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,948
The smallest participants two years.

317
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,390
The oldest are above 70.

318
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,475
Important is the variety. I think that's very important ...

319
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,838
because it thought the competition has no chance.

320
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,751
Everyone is taken seriously here, and that everyone knows.

321
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,637
Even in het water en dan in de verf.
Dat is genoeg.

322
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,954
The result is that people change here.

323
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,349
They must tolerate a lot in their lives.

324
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,595
They are compared, judged, condemned ...

325
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,835
They never got the chance to discover that they can do something good.

326
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,958
That's enough, Rose.

327
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,628
Sorry I'm late. -That does not matter.

328
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,158
Playing is not something that you need to create or produce.

329
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,836
Playing is enjoy and be active.

330
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,389
As you play, you're doing something with your whole being ...

331
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,350
and that is something which is not possible in school.

332
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,437
Children should take life seriously ...

333
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,275
but rather the game must be taken seriously.

334
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,672
In the game all the skills are utilized and developed.

335
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,190
Thus you come to yourself. That's all you need.

336
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,313
That should really be the basis in the life of each child:

337
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,349
Dance, music and painting. The rest comes naturally.

338
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,433
Once dip: one drop of water one drop of paint.

339
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,720
The so-called secondary subjects should be the main subjects of all children.

340
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,078
Would satisfy the people who can handle everything.

341
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,957
Of course that does not fit into the curriculum.

342
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,592
But what the school now knows the real needs of a child?

343
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,070
The curriculum is based on the adult world ...

344
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,392
and children must conform to them.

345
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,196
I see what is lost when children through education.

346
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:06,310
The few children who come to the Painter Oord and find themselves ...

347
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,474
and overcome all outside influences, his genius.

348
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,476
They are just as ingenious as all the people who just may go about their business.

349
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,955
Everyone should know ...

350
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,033
which is the education of people and makes something ...

351
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,158
to which they are out of the world.

352
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,712
Water?
-Water, geel en wit.

353
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,429
Grab the white only. Do you have anything? -White.

354
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,839
Probably they do not want strong people ...

355
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,754
with a strong will.

356
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,996
One wants submissive people who acquiesce in a system.

357
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,397
Can I continue with my fingers? Yeah, you know.

358
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,192
It is also the goal of the school system for people to get so far ...

359
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,390
they are a little dissatisfied, but not too much, because that causes resistance.

360
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,793
They must be so disgruntled that they flee to consume.

361
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,468
Since the school has a stake in.

362
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,476
The school destroys the best forces and values ​​that can develop a child.

363
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,356
Instead of going to create the child itself ...

364
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,988
takes what it has learned.

365
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,518
And that is very small compared with that to which it is actually capable of.

366
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,276
Please. And now white for Lucas.

367
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,476
I'll be.

368
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,750
It does not smell strongly, because it is low.

369
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,117
It smells good. -It Smells a little.

370
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,718
Until next time, Amo. -Until Sunday.

371
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,953
Where is Leona? I want her to say hello. -I'll Call her.

372
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,953
Is not she there? Hold on.

373
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,832
Parents and teachers later have a certain image of what is important.

374
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,389
What needs to learn three years.

375
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,031
In each case three languages, because that claim the neuroscientists.

376
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,159
In the native center fit namely three languages.

377
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,596
Maybe five, with a little effort.

378
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,278
But what is the most important experiences the child ...

379
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,756
it must meet many requirements? What lingers is:

380
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,549
If I need to learn in groups one and two English ...

381
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,109
even though that playfully ...

382
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,999
although I do not need English ...

383
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,470
then my first experience with teaching ...

384
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,952
I have to learn things at school that I do not need at all.

385
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,035
Therefore, we must think about ourselves and what we do with our children.

386
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,274
How we wonderful self learning in the child's brain ...

387
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,357
so manipulate and steer in a certain direction ...

388
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,709
essentially gifted people do not dare to use their talents.

389
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,076
Here in the archives I keep the painting game drawings ...

390
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,360
in 1946 in the home for war orphans arose.

391
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,958
Every year, new folders at the Painter Oord in Paris.

392
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,035
In total, 500,000 documents are stored here.

393
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,952
It not only works, but they are especially important for my research.

394
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,152
I sometimes come across people who have painted as a child with me.

395
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,759
Sometimes that's already thirty or forty, or even fifty years ago.

396
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,551
All these people say they were the best hours of their youth.

397
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,438
What wealth.

398
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,991
Sometimes they say that it was crucial for their development.

399
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,276
A flock of birds.

400
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,192
Here again.

401
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,438
Weather birds, against a different background.

402
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,718
Here is a road ...

403
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,075
and here he continues.

404
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,955
He continues.

405
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,553
March 1976.

406
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,314
A child repeats everything ...

407
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,074
because it can not be otherwise. It does again and again what it likes.

408
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,073
Another underwater scene.

409
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,591
The enthusiasm of a child to experience that ever again.

410
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,357
We saw that each child who came to the painter Oord ...

411
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:03,039
in the period from roughly 1950 to 1980.

412
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,157
Trees ...

413
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,839
And then everything changed.

414
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,118
This is a drawing from the current time.

415
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,231
From 2007.

416
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,318
It looks like a painting.

417
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,552
This should represent abstract art.

418
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,111
Or something.

419
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,750
This is no game.

420
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,834
Here speaks no mirth or pleasure.

421
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,956
Or that here.

422
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,197
A composition according to learned formulas ...

423
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,033
Applying the child ...

424
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,555
instead of play.

425
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,389
Then you wondering why a child does.

426
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,994
What is it here?

427
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,639
Here, the intention was to paint mountains ...

428
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,997
but the child does not play.

429
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,952
It is burdened by the weight of what it has learned.

430
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,669
It is clear that it is different now than in the past.

431
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,152
And there's a reason for that. The children are taxed

432
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,233
They stand for the blank sheet and wonder ...

433
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,111
or paint what they expect the adults and teachers.

434
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,432
And then the child does not play anymore. It stands for the blank sheet ...

435
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,955
and no longer a child.

436
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,795
It's a theorist. A chilly adult.

437
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,276
It is very sad to see that.

438
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,714
I'm in the third grade of a secondary school in Hamburg and I have a problem.

439
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,316
Everyone knows that school is not real life.

440
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,032
But my life consists only of school. So there is something wrong somewhere.

441
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,716
I come home at four o'clock and I'm not going to sleep before eleven o'clock.

442
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,955
That is not because I kĳk TV, I relax or have fun.

443
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,713
My head is full. Too full.

444
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,953
What do the people who make our school years?

445
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,153
What have parents that we care later for retirement ...

446
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,675
but now have no life anymore?

447
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,274
What I write here, affects everyone.

448
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,718
Pupils, parents, siblings, teachers.

449
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,350
I want to file a complaint. But how do you do that?

450
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,957
Who should I be if nobody feels responsible?

451
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:07,279
I'm Thomas Sattelberger. I am HR Director at Deutsche Telekom.

452
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,398
I've been doing this for forty years.

453
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,157
I'm probably the HR Director with the longest track record in Germany.

454
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,035
I worked for twenty years at Daimler Benz ...

455
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,150
ten years at Lufthansa, four years at Continental AG.

456
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,513
Deutsche Telekom working 250,000 people.

457
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,956
We have a turnover of nearly 60 billion ...

458
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,591
and we are the third telecommunication company in the world.

459
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,434
The Ministry of Education still comes from the old Prussia.

460
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,989
It did not work...

461
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,712
in order to adapt the teaching to conceptually a world ...

462
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,674
in which teaching in the sense of correct, adjust and conform ...

463
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,513
is not decisive.

464
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,391
We have in this country so much untapped talent.

465
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,997
But if we make that talent in a straitjacket ...

466
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,232
the talents are not developed ...

467
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,349
because they are often partly otherwise directed, non-conformist ...

468
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,956
or do not comply with social norms.

469
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,556
Of read- in onderwijsrichtlijnen ...

470
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,713
are often established by a ruling elite ...

471
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,839
her pedagogical knowledge ...

472
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,398
has garnered from teaching methods.

473
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,958
We come into work do not really move ...

474
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,430
because I am seen as a ticking tĳdbom.

475
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,592
Because I like a ticking tĳdbom given word.

476
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,672
Hierarchical harmless because my boss says:

477
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,188
That woman has passed thirty. They will soon be fixed pregnant

478
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,079
Why should I help her forward now?

479
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,518
I can now invest in her, but soon she becomes pregnant.

480
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,399
And then she is a long time away.

481
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,473
In Switzerland you have thirteen weeks maternity leave.

482
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,359
And then you come back or not.

483
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,069
There is no break in your career.

484
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,153
She is now six years. Totally.

485
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,678
Try once again to integrate her in to make the team and career.

486
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,434
That is impossible.

487
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,718
If you get your first child on your 35th ...

488
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,394
and the second with 37, which is pretty late ...

489
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,632
then you are on your 40th really no CEO.

490
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,989
The problem is that the current educational system ...

491
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,551
is designed for a different time.

492
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:31,397
It is molded to the economic demands of industrialism.

493
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,395
When we needed a lot of people who worked with their hands ...

494
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,791
a smaller group who did clerical work ...

495
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,993
and an even smaller group that ruled the country for us.

496
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,790
Those were the lawyers, judges and doctors who studied at the University ...

497
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,390
and were academically.

498
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,316
That is deeply embedded in the education system.

499
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,473
There are two kinds of people: academics and non-academics.

500
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,029
Smart and stupid people.

501
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,035
The result is that many brilliant people do not know they are brilliant ...

502
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,352
as they are laid along that particular yardstick.

503
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,594
Our company has two pillars: economic and intellectual.

504
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,719
This model has caused a lot of chaos for many people.

505
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,510
It is good for an individual. Some have benefited greatly from it.

506
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,959
But most people do not. There are major problems arise.

507
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,759
My name is Patrick.

508
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,551
I have been living since my early childhood in a deprived area of ​​Dortmund.

509
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,836
My whole life actually.

510
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,598
There is high unemployment here.

511
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,035
More than twenty percent.

512
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,592
I wanted to do a course, but that was not allowed.

513
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,276
I had to register with three employment agencies.

514
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,549
I said I wanted to do a training course and wanted to get beyond temporary worker.

515
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,840
But I had to apply. That's what I did.

516
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,755
I started working as a temp, but that was not for me.

517
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,751
I only graduate, but I had good grades.

518
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,117
I'm trying to get feet on the ground in the working life.

519
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,229
Also because I want some financial leeway, but I can not.

520
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,949
I do my very best but still go wrong.

521
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,550
Well, it's hard to get out of that spiral.

522
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,194
Many young people of my age follow work-related training.

523
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:38,310
They're in the same boat. The unemployment count not bring them.

524
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,634
Officially, there are fewer than three million unemployed, but that's not true.

525
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,989
The many people who follow a course or have a small job, do not count.

526
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,310
There are more than seven to eight million unemployed.

527
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,669
Here 03. Here are four young people, probably Russians ...

528
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,230
going toward Old Market.

529
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,708
Just ask if everything is okay.

530
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,151
0403...

531
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,591
How is it going there'?

532
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,799
Nothing wrong. It was probably a false alarm.

533
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,198
Five days a week I start at 22:00.

534
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,999
I work from ten to seven.

535
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,470
Like the people who have a permanent job.

536
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,952
The only difference is that I get a lot less money.

537
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,953
It comes down to about eight euros per day.

538
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,270
That's not very much.

539
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,470
The state forces you to go on the criminal path.

540
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,269
Will I have to steal to get food and drinks?

541
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,829
I have to do the wrong things. It makes no sense to stay on the right path.

542
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,958
This appeal will not really die.

543
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,679
On the contrary, there will be more work.

544
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,233
Dear judges deemed public.

545
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,952
Seven months ago, the annual competition "CEO of the Future '.

546
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:37,388
2000 participants have registered from which the 80 best were chosen.

547
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,554
From which 80 best we have chosen the 20 best participants ...

548
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,159
today as finalists participate in the competition "CEO of the Future '.

549
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,517
Here a billion market.

550
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,196
A market that the economic future will change dramatically.

551
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,429
We want both areas to conquer the Asian market.

552
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,957
We are undervalued. There is a risk of a hostile takeover.

553
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,557
The good news is that your shares are worth more.

554
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,078
They can be sold above market value. How do we achieve these goals?

555
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,470
With a strategic partner.

556
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,633
That is the hardest part.

557
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,078
We have heavily on marketing and distribution.

558
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,074
I already have an advertising slogan:

559
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,836
In a collision between two cars: No problem power car inside.

560
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,516
Much has been said before that undervaluation is our big problem.

561
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:48,949
It is likely therefore a danger that there will be a hostile takeover.

562
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,313
That is why we have put a preliminary communication on paper.

563
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,077
This strategy should lead to the company value increases ...

564
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,550
because it is very low at this time.

565
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,718
Thank you for your attention.

566
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,951
Our current economy is partly organized military base.

567
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,194
It's about struggle, survival, defeats and victories.

568
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,957
This military approach to the market economy ...

569
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,556
also instilled in the minds of mostly young men.

570
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,032
I believe this is a distinctly male problem.

571
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:46,999
The world is a rational approach based on simple market terms ...

572
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,950
of defeat and victory with their own careers linked.

573
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,712
I present now our strategy of how customers want to attract upwards.

574
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,440
If we go further ...

575
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,957
we walk through the department household items and gastronomy ...

576
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,950
the do-it-yourself and car department where a stylish car ...

577
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:26,837
as little experience event serves, but also as intelligent exhibition

578
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,468
with numerous products.

579
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,837
Then we come to the electronics department.

580
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,596
Here I want to point out the customer guidance system on the ground.

581
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,438
Through this system, the customer is not aware led straight aisles.

582
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:50,436
On both sides are disposed at hand height listings.

583
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,149
The customers are usually tired after work.

584
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,949
They look not up, but down, or to the center.

585
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,709
Additionally seen wearing glasses over glasses go out of focus.

586
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,236
Hence, the offers are at hand height.

587
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,679
We hope the client relaxes ...

588
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,753
and abandons the plan to buy only one product ...

589
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,348
and he does more purchases through the offers on the upper floor.

590
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,150
I hope I have put forward convincing solutions ...

591
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,959
upwards in order to lure the customer.

592
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,839
I know companies that are so exhausted ...

593
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,152
they have almost no creativity more ...

594
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,279
to hold briefly and say: Where are we going?

595
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,718
Why do not we go that way? What alternatives are there?

596
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,996
Exhaustion ...

597
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,632
for me is a clear sign ...

598
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,952
that the world is only regulated economic ...

599
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,953
with ever-shorter term goals.

600
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,954
I think a lot of managers ...

601
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,634
feel ...

602
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,555
hamsters as they are in a treadmill.

603
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,475
With the system that today is put into practice ...

604
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,996
they can not identify.

605
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,469
And then they get depressed.

606
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,995
It may sound exaggerated ...

607
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,199
but the school takes me off the most important thing I have:

608
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,669
My childhood.

609
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,799
When I come home after school, I want to see the sun.

610
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,030
It may sound crazy, but I dream that I can do for three hours what I want.

611
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,316
Because I have no hobbies.

612
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,474
Not because I have no interest, but because I have no time.

613
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,795
For my friends, is the same.

614
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,471
Is not it irresponsible to let a generation growing up ...

615
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,792
which has no hobbies? However, a hobby we all have:

616
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,629
Should I explain to my children later how Facebook works ...

617
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,553
when they ask how it was before?

618
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,475
That will probably not be necessary because they themselves will be computer geniuses ...

619
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,712
still less have a life than we do.

620
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,313
I get 510 euros. Of this I have 310 ...

621
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,472
No, not even 510 euros. That's when my transport.

622
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,954
Of which 510 Euros I pay rent at 330, 50 and 45 on energy for transport.

623
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,636
So I like 80 euros. 50 euro per week, I needed to eat.

624
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,268
That will not.

625
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,754
For me, one month ... -I would like to help, but can not.

626
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,549
Well, thanks anyway. A nice weekend.

627
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,435
I'm not going to vote.

628
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,354
All parties promise mountains of gold before the election ...

629
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,798
and then it is: Sorry, we have to raise tax rates.

630
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,959
Why should I vote? Life still nothing.

631
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:46,109
I do not live the way I live now. I need every penny four times.

632
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:52,753
I want to go shopping without having to pay attention to prices and be able to choose brands.

633
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,597
And a pair of pants from 70 euros that I like ...

634
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,438
I want to just buy it.

635
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,751
Write down license plate? -which Is more common here.

636
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,798
He let his dog out.

637
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,552
I want an apartment or buy a home and make something of my life.

638
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,230
I want my children will soon be able to offer what I have not had.

639
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,110
And especially my wife. I would later have a family.

640
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,956
I wanted to be a pastry chef.

641
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,710
At night work and take things day with my family.

642
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,190
Trips to the zoo or the zoo.

643
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,352
That's what I wanted to be a baker.

644
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,478
The view is not bad here.

645
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,037
When it's done, it gets even better.

646
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,600
There's someone at the window.

647
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,515
Those are the sheriffs. -They Make sure we control.

648
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,756
I think there is a crisis parallel to the climate crisis:

649
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,788
A global crisis in human resources.

650
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,516
I think this crisis parallels that in nature.

651
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,393
And the cost to resolve the crisis be catastrophic.

652
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,437
I'll give a few examples.

653
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,639
In California last year ...

654
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:49,352
some three billion dollars spent on university education.

655
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,957
And there's nine billion spent on the prison system.

656
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,790
I can not imagine that more criminals are born in spe ...

657
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,434
and studenten.

658
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,470
When people live in poor conditions, they slip.

659
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,119
I was regional champion ...

660
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,716
and champion of Westphalia and West Germany.

661
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,440
I was actually pretty good.

662
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:21,792
When I boxed, I could let my problems. I tried anyway.

663
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,560
When I saw the punching bag ...

664
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,952
I pounded like crazy and I hoped that the problems disappeared.

665
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,956
But they returned as soon as I left the gym, or perhaps the next day.

666
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,312
That's how it is.

667
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,435
I have to constantly watch out that I do not sliding down and I keep fighting.

668
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:50,469
I say to myself, Patrick, make your way out of this situation.

669
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,149
And I'm always afraid of what's coming tomorrow.

670
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,553
What I eat and drink tomorrow? How can I create my own place?

671
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,510
How should I feel home somewhere? That can not now. That is not in there.

672
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,630
Patrick is a training and looking for a job as a security guard at army or police.

673
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,429
His boxing career he had to give up because of injuries.

674
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:50,835
It is no longer possible to make the world by means of small reforms ...

675
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,594
to change.

676
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,275
The structures are so hardened ...

677
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,309
you only by drastic action can achieve something.

678
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,110
If you do not want a revolution from below, you must intervene hard from above.

679
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,158
There must come revolutions.

680
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,948
Structural changes.

681
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,997
We need people ...

682
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:24,153
which the old education ...

683
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,949
break off and create room for something new.

684
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,309
I do not hate school.

685
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,600
I am critical because it could be much better.

686
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,710
The task is simple: prepare students for real life.

687
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,316
But they must approach the task from a different angle.

688
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,996
No small change, but try something completely new ...

689
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:03,517
because we do not have much to lose.

690
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,036
Yakamoz Kara Kurt is a student at a Hamburg grammar school.

691
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,557
Her complaint letter was published in August 2011 in Die Zeit.

692
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,712
The motto 'faster, further, higher "...

693
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,998
economically has reached its limits.

694
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:23,233
And also in the education system, there will be limits.

695
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,994
It is an illusion to believe that people who graduate with beautiful figures ...

696
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,674
also have been developed.

697
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,670
At McKinsey see what's important.

698
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,790
It is very important to study at the right university ...

699
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,677
in order to create the right conditions for your future career.

700
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,754
Sometimes I also find it very confronting.

701
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,075
Because people can naturally escape.

702
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,108
They can say: I will not be chained.

703
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,953
But how many young people do the same?

704
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,669
And how many go there like lemmings ...

705
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,197
to schools only preach capitalism ...

706
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,514
and exclusively argue that you should make the most of your career.

707
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,832
Why are so many young people who do not point ...

708
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,958
to connect to immerse themselves in that prison?

709
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,554
Of course you're like 25 or 26 years ...

710
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,030
quite able to form their own opinion.

711
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,033
You can say: Is this what I really want?

712
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,668
This is what matters in life?

713
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,434
On the other hand, you may wonder ...

714
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:24,516
some teachers and parents gave them about what is life?

715
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,356
The focus on economics is one of the biggest problems ...

716
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,399
of the current era.

717
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,950
Thomas Sattelberger on his 63rd retired ...

718
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,073
and abides now bending with education and social projects.

719
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,676
This used to be West Germany and just across East Germany.

720
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,515
In between there was a division.

721
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,989
This was the so-called dead band.

722
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,755
Nobody would have thought that it would ever disappear ...

723
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,275
but it happened anyway.

724
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:23,351
We think competition is so important that we always used to prepare our youth.

725
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,958
As a toddler. But actually it should be the other way around.

726
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,989
Actually, we need our children for as long as possible the opportunity ...

727
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,232
to stay out of the competition.

728
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:44,358
Children come from a very different world. For a child plays no role league.

729
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,752
A child is just at the beginning of his life ...

730
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,835
very closely linked with another human being.

731
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,471
Before birth, the bond between mother and child really close.

732
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,395
In the nine months in which the brains are formed ...

733
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,951
These networks are so deeply embedded that they never disappear.

734
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:14,832
Therefore the desire for connectedness essentially never disappears.

735
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,189
It is a true work of art that our society children get so far ...

736
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,273
that they do not strive for connectedness ...

737
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,159
but that they are set up against each other.

738
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,390
The curtain goes up.

739
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:07,028
Yale keep someone engaged in infant research.

740
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,432
In her research she discovered something very special.

741
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,636
Like this?

742
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,839
It still needs a little more gradually.

743
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,958
The second time you go into here.

744
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,555
Want to play with a cube?

745
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,675
By six months of age, all babies choose the helper.

746
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:29,836
This also ties in with the first experiences of each baby.

747
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,994
Without the help of others he or she did not become six months.

748
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,792
The second part of the research is exciting.

749
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,790
The babies are six months old. They are now one year.

750
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,955
Want to play with a cube?

751
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,475
Want the yellow?

752
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:45,669
Choose twenty percent of the babies for the plunger.

753
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,274
Want to play with a cube?

754
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,079
Research shows that this behavior is not innate.

755
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,949
This behavior is also not genetically determined.

756
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,437
The children have learned from others.

757
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,959
It's not their brains. It is not heredity.

758
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,316
It is up to us. We lead by example.

759
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,989
There is a great breakthrough in the development of life:

760
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,958
The transition from single- to multi-celled.

761
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,555
You may wonder whether there has competition in the game.

762
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,837
Consequently single-celled organisms have become increasingly ...

763
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,959
but how did the transition to multicellular work?

764
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,119
The answer is simple: a few cells There stayed together.

765
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,991
And so arose larger organisms. Because they helped each other.

766
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,950
And so it also works in the brains. In the brain ...

767
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,791
it is not that small brains against the great work.

768
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,199
Or the right side to the left side. If you want to achieve something ...

769
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,989
must work together the different parts.

770
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,310
Do the brains for how.

771
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,951
You can grow continuously in a sense ...

772
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,114
and becoming anchor new experiences in your brains ...

773
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,555
without that the brain increases.

774
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,030
This type of growth we do not know in the economy.

775
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,794
It's not about growth ...

776
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,596
but the relationships between the individuals are getting better.

777
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,958
That is a new dimension, and know our brains already.

778
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,271
We have to take it alone.

779
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,989
I'm Pablo Pineda Ferrer ...

780
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,390
and I'm 37 years old.

781
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,599
I am the youngest of four brothers.

782
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,593
I studied pedagogy ...

783
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,958
and my teaching qualifications achieved.

784
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,275
I also study psychology ...

785
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:08,560
which I must pass four exams to finish the study.

786
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,830
For me there are two concepts:

787
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,993
Anxiety and love.

788
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:43,838
If we have hitherto lived under the fear concept ...

789
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,437
then it's time to get that solved ...

790
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,716
and lead us to turn the love.

791
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:58,029
Deep love for the true nature of a person.

792
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,988
Where you are no longer afraid of the differences ...

793
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,948
anyone want to know true.

794
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,556
A love which your people accept as they are ...

795
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,439
and not as you would like them to be.

796
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,591
That is the concept of love.

797
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,956
My name is André.

798
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,232
I was born in Paris and grew up.

799
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,156
German is not my mother tongue.

800
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:13,270
What characterizes my youth, is the fact that I did not go to school.

801
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,512
I also had lessons from my parents.

802
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,437
I tell the story of a happy childhood without school ...

803
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,752
because I want to show that things can be different.

804
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,599
I've always been interested in things that I have encountered in my life ...

805
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,116
and I could devote myself to it always undisturbed.

806
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,630
On my third hit I open a book and I said to my parents ...

807
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,475
I saw egg cups and eggs.

808
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:02,112
They were astonished when they saw that I pointed to the letters C and D.

809
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:07,229
They said the letters were, and I wanted to know how they sounded.

810
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,519
In no time I knew all the letters ...

811
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,468
and I was able to decipher all the words.

812
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:27,430
I was four, five, six and seven and I still could not read fluently.

813
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,034
My parents were not busy.

814
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,512
No one thought: Now he should still sometimes read.

815
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,954
I never had exams because I had never examinations.

816
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,113
I never prepared for an exam. I never applied.

817
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,999
I've never had to prove myself.

818
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,992
Is it better that way? -He Does not move now.

819
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,232
He is now firmly -Prima.

820
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,836
Do you see the cloud pattern now? -Not yet.

821
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,278
Go are more prosperous. You can not indiscriminately work.

822
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,034
You have to see what you're doing.

823
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:18,433
Teach me was something you did with it.

824
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,155
I shrugged my track train apart.

825
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,630
I wanted to know how does an electromagnet.

826
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,157
And mom's encyclopedia were things I wanted to read.

827
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,233
Therefore my reading progressed.

828
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,593
The first time I heard that I had Down ...

829
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,354
I was six or seven.

830
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:59,197
A professor, Don Miguel Garcia Velero ...

831
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,830
said in the room of the headmaster:

832
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,675
You do know that you have Down?

833
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,230
Without thinking about it, I said yes.

834
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,994
Although I had no idea.

835
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:17,597
He started talking about genetics.

836
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,957
Over genen en chromosoomparen.

837
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,350
I did not understand it.

838
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:29,117
I knew I did not understand, so I asked:

839
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:36,197
Don Miguel, I'm stupid? He said no.

840
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:42,754
When I asked Don Miguel, I can stay here at school?

841
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,592
He said Yes-

842
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:50,232
I had a third question: Can I stay with my friends?

843
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,356
But of course, he said.

844
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,954
Those were my three questions.

845
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:59,710
And so I discovered that I had Down syndrome.

846
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,474
From that moment on...

847
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,952
everything went very fast. It was very exciting.

848
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,639
That was my starting point.

849
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,834
You have to have confidence that it succeeds.

850
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,152
And in the fifties, no one had to trisomy 21 patients ...

851
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,952
certainly no high school teacher, trust that those people could do exams.

852
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,798
Nobody believed it.

853
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,719
Everyone was stuck in the mindset:

854
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:41,352
A genetic defect, abnormal brain unfit for school.

855
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,356
But then a few people that stimulated them.

856
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,958
Brilliant teachers from private schools which have entered into a relationship.

857
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,033
They invited in a different way and encouraged.

858
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:02,228
They believed in it would work, and now we see that it is so.

859
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,310
I've been very lucky ...

860
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:17,430
because I had teachers who challenged me to think independently ...

861
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,070
and myself things left to discover.

862
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,554
But there were also teachers who wanted to bring me to heel ...

863
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,836
or manipulate.

864
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,353
Each child has different characteristics with which it is born.

865
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,310
And that is why every child in being gifted. Period.

866
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,029
The only people who are not good wise ...

867
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:58,594
the people who really should be sent to school again ...

868
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,399
are the people who believe ...

869
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,031
that one talent is worth more than another.

870
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,038
Our conception of talent ...

871
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,237
is nothing more than a review ...

872
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,949
we based our application idiotic ideas.

873
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,112
Gerald Huether, hoogleraar neurobiology ...

874
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:25,035
translates results from brain research to educational practice.

875
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,679
The construction of such guitar takes 200 to 300 hours.

876
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:42,676
Such instruments are commissioned.

877
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:48,073
They correspond exactly to the expectations and wishes of the client.

878
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,153
We obviously work with air-dried wood.

879
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,031
It has 40 to 50 years are dry before it is used.

880
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:04,036
Our wood is split with respect for the natural structure of the fibers ...

881
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,352
and their sound quality. After all, we create a sound body.

882
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,271
When I was 18, I gave my father a method of teaching German.

883
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,955
Using the same method I learned other languages.

884
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,509
You do not need to learn anything from outside.

885
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:30,549
You read a page and listening to a cassette tape.

886
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:37,273
Instead of reading a lesson of ten minutes a day ...

887
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,955
I read there 10, 20 or 30 per day.

888
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,953
I spent about six hours a day in German.

889
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,389
This is difficult to bend.

890
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,955
On the spot?

891
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,508
That wood of the same tribe?

892
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,837
And he jay difficult. That was me so.

893
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,949
When I first came to the guitar builder ...

894
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,640
he asked, not a diploma.

895
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,430
He looked only at one thing, and that was my enthusiasm.

896
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,752
We will glue it to him? -As A second layer.

897
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,195
That we will not do that.

898
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,957
It was also enriching for him to teach someone the job he loves.

899
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,472
That confidence, this lack of fear ...

900
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,473
is because I've never compared.

901
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:52,156
I never had to compare my knowledge with others.

902
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,311
I've never put under pressure.

903
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,837
I never had to learn things that did not interest me ...

904
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,594
or that I could not use it ...

905
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,833
with the excuse that I now had to learn it because it will no longer could.

906
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,711
I've just experienced the opposite. There is always time to learn something new.

907
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,508
I remember ...

908
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:57,435
that the box where I had the least it was psychology.

909
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:02,355
It was always just about problems, problems ...

910
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,559
It was like a movie on Friday the 13th.

911
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,792
A terrible profession.

912
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,514
Because I learned aloud, asked my mother:

913
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,955
Pablo, what are you doing?

914
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:19,636
Her hair went stand up on end.

915
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,791
When I graduated ...

916
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,949
I tore broke all records with great pleasure.

917
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,033
What a party

918
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,477
What memories ...

919
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,757
The university is tiring.

920
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:56,109
If you are here just walking around, you will become very tired.

921
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,509
You have to have a drink in the cafeteria.

922
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,435
I worked with Amo.

923
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,958
And we had a child.

924
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,471
When a child comes into the world ...

925
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,189
it is because the time is right for him or her.

926
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,592
But after that its environment make it possible ...

927
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:07,593
it is born.

928
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,957
Once on the world needs to be born

929
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,952
First, it is the mother ...

930
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:18,955
which forms the connection with the future. That is certainly true.

931
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,949
The whole environment is cooperating. But you can learn nothing.

932
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:30,438
You must give his life to the room alone.

933
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,955
Z'n vitale energie.

934
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,111
That's all.

935
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:46,149
In this story, I do not deserve admiration ...

936
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,550
but what happened to me.

937
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,794
Admirable is the decision taken by my parents.

938
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,391
They had a belief which they have remained faithful.

939
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,957
A child who does not go to school and grow up with greater freedom ...

940
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,032
will have no rules, so they think.

941
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:15,797
Often people think that I must have nothing of discipline.

942
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,518
"How do you, as a free child about discipline?"

943
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,116
As if that were opposites.

944
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:31,389
I can imagine nothing in total freedom without structure.

945
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,518
My structure consisted of personal rules.

946
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:40,596
For example, that I get up every day at six o'clock to practice.

947
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,550
That pattern was very important for my freedom.

948
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,356
It is difficult to swim against the tide ...

949
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,590
you oppose the system.

950
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:01,596
You oppose the system but still wants more.

951
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,719
One is a little afraid of me because I say what I think.

952
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,953
I am encouraged to come forward. I am now in front.

953
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:15,990
And that does not want society. The company wants us to stand back.

954
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:22,110
And so I fought to get ahead. I just keep going.

955
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,791
I just keep going.

956
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,711
You must do everything to prevent that society says ...

957
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,634
you must connect back.

958
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,112
It's very simple.

959
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:52,274
The schools as they are, were not an option.

960
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,395
What's schooling ...

961
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:07,269
in comparison with the life ...

962
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,113
a child booty?

963
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,949
All you are a child due, is happiness.

964
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,677
We must begin to treat children with ...

965
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,753
with the respect that they deserve.

966
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:15,554
It should be banned in order to deal with children as happens now.

967
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,199
Where their lives are classified and have to learn everything.

968
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:29,110
There she is nothing to learn. We just have to let them 'be'.

969
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,959
Hey, baby.

970
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,395
He does a nap.

971
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,272
We must guide them without education goals.

972
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:58,151
We can not rob them of their childhood, for therein lies the whole world.

973
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,275
I am also a child of the Painter Oord.

974
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,989
I'm more or less born in the Painter Oord.

975
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:29,470
The Painter Refuge my father, Amos Stern.

976
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:35,716
We are in 1933, when Hitler came to power, fled Germany.

977
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,953
We had to leave everything and lived in France ...

978
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,073
initially as stateless citizens. This lasted for many years.

979
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,949
I my whole childhood was stateless.

980
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,552
After the war, I was offered a job ...

981
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:56,473
in a home for war orphans.

982
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:02,112
I had the kids engaged between meals and lessons.

983
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,590
I've just drawn.

984
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,151
I found a few pencil stubs and waste paper ...

985
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,675
and thus they played then.

986
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:17,470
I was quite excited by what has emerged so.

987
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,390
It is the painter Oord arise.

988
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,953
I can imagine that there will ever be a society ...

989
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,556
which operates in the same way as the painting game.

990
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:42,556
Without competition or stress, and without hierarchy.

991
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,951
That is what needs to change fundamentally ...

992
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,959
to make people happy again and balanced.

993
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,036
Michèle Voice quit teaching because of the rigid school system.

994
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:02,591
Amo Stern is recognized by UNESCO as an educator and scientist.

995
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,435
He 'must' for more than 65 years in his Schilder Oord.

996
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,192
Here we are.

997
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:12,319
My great passion, football.

998
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,199
This is a great match.

999
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:21,959
Malaga against Villarreal in the Rosaleda Stadium in Malaga.

1000
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,998
And we stand for, 2-1.

1001
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:28,152
It's really a passion, football.

1002
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,155
It's all about appreciation for what I can learn from others and others mine.

1003
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:23,592
That relationship is enriching for both parties.

1004
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,390
Exactly there the culture of fear and starts the culture of love.

1005
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,230
We won.

1006
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:42,957
Pablo Pineda is the first European with Down with a university education.

1007
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,834
In the film Yo, también 
he played the leading role.

1008
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:54,157
No one comes to the idea that a child will come to fruition.

1009
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:59,831
The child is born with the most perfect tool:

1010
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,039
The best invention to learning that has ever done, namely play ...

1011
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,668
and a great enthusiasm.

1012
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,834
All great things in science, art, craft ...

1013
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,755
employment and society caused by playing.

1014
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:29,357
These are the ideal conditions and they know? Long.

1015
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,152
That is my experience. And we create for my son.

1016
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,630
It is available to everyone. Always.

1017
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,553
Het is gratis.

1018
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,757
André Voice is a musician, luthier, and author.

1019
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,596
He lectures at colleges and universities learn without school.

1020
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:03,672
People do their best if they do what they like. If they are in their element.

1021
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,676
The evidence is convincing.

1022
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,389
When people start using their talents ...

1023
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:17,475
as they discover what they can, they become a different person.

1024
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:25,638
And that to me is the starting point for a new educational system.

1025
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:30,032
To this end, a shift is required from the industrial metaphor ...

1026
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,431
what I call an organic metaphor.

1027
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,714
Death Valley is de warmste streek
in de VS.

1028
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,032
It grows almost nothing because it is not raining there.

1029
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,754
In the winter of 2004 happened something remarkable.

1030
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,231
It rained. There was 175 mm of rain.

1031
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:01,269
And in the spring of 2005 was very Death Valley ...

1032
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,955
covered with spring flowers.

1033
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,589
That proved that Death Valley was not dead.

1034
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,591
It was asleep.

1035
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:15,151
Below the surface seeds waiting for the right conditions.

1036
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,796
In humans, it works exactly.

1037
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,594
If we create the right conditions ...

1038
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,276
and evaluate each child on their own value ...

1039
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,954
creates growth.

1040
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,951
Benjamin Franklin once said there are three kinds of people:

1041
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,952
People who are immobile ...

1042
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,508
those which are movably ...

1043
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,070
and people that move.

1044
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:54,677
I encourage you to get moving and to take action.

1045
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:09,798
Sir Ken Robinson as education expert by Queen Elizabeth II knighted.
