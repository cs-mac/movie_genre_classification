00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,396
Sixteen-fifty for you, 16.50 for me.


00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,836
Loretta, I'm leaving.


00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,337
What do you mean?


00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,504
Soon as I get my check, I'm gone.


00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:46,904
I'll be back.


00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,447
-Dwight, I need my check.
-Payday's at the end of the month.


00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,246
Haven't paid us for last month.
I need money, Loretta's got a kid--


00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,618
Problem with management?
Put a note in the suggestion box.


00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,482
-I'm serious. I'm quitting.
-I'll be back for the dinner shift.


00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,461
I sure as hell won't be.


00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,260
What are you doing?


00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,871
I'm taking what he owes me,
not a penny more.


00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,530
You take that money,
he's gonna come after you.


00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,469
-Gotta find me first.
-What you gonna do?


00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,279
This ought to cover that bike
for little Keith.


00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,212
You're late to pick him up.


00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,610
Go. I got everything covered here.


00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,980
You're really going?


00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,712
I'm really going.


00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,125
That bike can wait till Christmas.


00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,559
You keep what he owes you.
I'll deal with Dwight, okay?


00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,732
See you later.


00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,000
♫Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah


00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
♫(Yeah)


00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:22,500

♫(Yeah)


00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,000
♫And I just gotta tell you right now, that I


00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,800
♫That I believe, I really do believe that


00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
♫Something's got a hold on me, yeah


00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
♫(Oh, it must be love)


00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,200
♫Oh, something's got a hold on me right now, child


00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,800
♫(Oh, it must be love)


00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,500
♫Let me tell you now, I got a feeling, I feel so strange


00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,300
♫Everything about me seems to have changed


00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,000
♫Step by step, I got a brand new walk


00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,000
♫I even sound sweeter when I talk


00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,300
♫I said, oh

♫(You know it must be love)


00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,428
How much to Los Angeles?


00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,123
-One-way or round-trip?
-You're kidding, right?


00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,000
♫Let me tell you now my heart feels heavy, my feet feel light


00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
♫I shake all over but I feel alright


00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
♫I never felt like this before


00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,400
♫Something's got a hold on me that won't let go


00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,400
♫I never thought it could happen to me


00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,800
♫Got me happy when I'm in misery


00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
♫I never thought it could be this way

♫Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me


00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500

Hey, Coco. Coco Puff, you're on.
Come on. You're on, you're on.

We may not have windows...


00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,615
...but we do have the best view
on Sunset Strip.


00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,677
Twenty bucks.


00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,952
What is this place, a strip club?


00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,147
''Strip club''?


00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,386
I should wash your mouth out
with Jugermeister.


00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,992
The only pole you'll find in there
is Natasha, the shot girl.


00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,068
Babycakes, I got a club to fill here.


00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,567
Right, sorry.


00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,876

Hey, sweetheart?
You wanna do your job? Let's go.


00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,619
Who does a girl have to flirt with
to get from here to up there?

Is this you flirting?


00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,250
With someone wearing more eyeliner
than me? Yeah.

Through that door over there.


00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,753
Ask for Tess.

We're on in five minutes.
Five minutes, ladies.

-Get over there.
-All right, I'm coming.


00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,311
Ladies! Let's move it, ladies!


00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,453
Does anyone know where Nikki is?


00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,815
Both spotlights are
supposed to pull in.


00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,389
Georgia, your boyfriend is so cute.


00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,461
So tonight, takeout and a movie?


00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,654
Both.


00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,560
-Casablanca and Oreos.
-Yes.


00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,564
Tess! I lost a contact on the stage.


00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,830
Okay, if you fall off the stage,
leg extended, boobs up.


00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,906
Remember, you're a goddess.

00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,210
Come here, give me.


00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,904
-Wait.
-What? The foot?


00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,312
Yeah, the foot, the back, the neck.


00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,248
The hips, the breasts, the face....


00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,649
Vince, the sink's busted
upstairs again.


00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,951
I'm not calling a plumber, Coco.


00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,827
Tess, have you read this letter
from the bank?


00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,454
How many times have I told you?
No business during business hours.


00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,625
-Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight.
-So what?


00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,532
This isn't going away.


00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,765
You won't talk to me before the show,
after the show.


00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,500
It's like you're avoiding me.


00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,202
I didn't divorce you
to spend more time with you.


00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:31,110
I may not be ''Mr. Tess'' anymore,
but I still own half this place.


00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,784
''Mr. Tess.''


00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,616
That is so hot.


00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,585
Nice, but it won't pay the bills.


00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,681
Wait. Wait. Zip me up.


00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,457
Excuse me, I'm Looking for Tess.


00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,863
Hi, are you Tess?


00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,631
And you are in my mirror because?


00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,333
Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack,
and I'm Looking for a job.


00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,373
And where have you danced?


00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,033
At home, mostly. But I can move.


00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,771
Okay, give your name
and number to Sean.


00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,245
Let you know
when we're having our audition.


00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,050
When will that be, exactly?


00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,577
Sean?


00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,052
-Where the hell is Nikki?
-I don't know. She's Late again.


00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,088
Oh, I'm never Late. Ever.


00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,283
That's great.


00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,691
We're trying to put on a show here.
Come back another time.


00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,831
I've never seen anything like this.


00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,594
-I need a job. I wanna work here.
-Great enthusiasm, terrible timing.


00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,432
So leave your name and your number
with Jack, your friend downstairs.


00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,835
And we'll call you. Okay? Promise.


00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,568
Hey, can you fix this for me?


00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,373
Let's move it, ladies!


00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,708
-Hello.
-Oh, my God. Nikki.


00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,947
You're probably not
gonna believe this...


00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,556
...but Sean and I were talking,
and he said....


00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:50,184
I said, ''It's so sad that Nikki couldn’t
join us for the opening number...


00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,729
...but it would be so great
if she joined us for the next one.''


00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,431
Paws and claws.
Took longer than I thought.


00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,764
So is finding a new job
when I fire you.


00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,065
Yeah, right.


00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,599
-Get ready.
-Yeah.


00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,910
Hey. Bring me a martini.


00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,068
Extra dry, straight up, three olives.


00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,612
-And hurry back.
-She doesn't work here, Nikki.


00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,044
Then she's not busy.


00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,780
Twenty minutes and we're back.


00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,424
Didn't your mama tell you
it's not polite to stare?


00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,090
You're just so damn beautiful, I--


00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,930
Well, in that case, screw your mama
and stare away.


00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,998
No one would ever know.


00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,258
Know what?


00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,493
That you're a dude.


00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,262
-God.
-Can I use this?


00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,770
Goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!


00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,976
Hey, waitress!


00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,039
Sweetheart? Hey, over here.


00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,238
One second.


00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,716
Yo!


00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,854
-Ladies?
-I'll have a vodka.


00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,852
What can I get you?


00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,295
One shot of Patron...


00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,132
...and tough guy with the hat
over there, he wants a Cosmo.


00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,534
-What are you doing?
-One night.


00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,166
If I'm not twenty times better than boobs-for-brains
over there, you don't have to pay me.


00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,400
♫A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental


00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,000
♫But diamonds are a girl's best friend.


00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,143
♫A kiss may be grand. But it won't pay the rental...


00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,143
Isn't that the girl
that was backstage?


00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,136
I think so.


00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,181
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?


00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,317
She really wanted a job.


00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,613
And so she is our new waitress.


00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,519
And when did I make you
head of personnel?


00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,387
She just picked up a tray,
started working.


00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,026
-Really?
-Well, her name is Ali.


00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,723
Ali.


00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,532
Hey, Ali.


00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,867
Look, this is cute, but come on.


00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,871
Push up those boobs.
Got them, show them. Work them.


00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,968
And don't ever
go behind my back again.


00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,347
-Yes, ma'am.
-And don't ever call me ma'am again.


00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,451
-Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess.
-Get on the floor.


00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,117
''Ma'am''?


00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,781
What am I, my mother?


00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,119
Yes, ma'am.


00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,522
Up yours.


00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,500
♫Tiffany's!


00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
♫Cartier!


00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,500
♫Black Starr! Frost Gorm!
Talk to me Harry Winston. Tell me all about it!


00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,773
Excuse me.


00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,147
Dewar's rocks and a bottle
of your best champagne.


00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,686
Oh, and will you tell Nikki
that I'm here?


00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,016
And you are...?


00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,384
A member since '91 .


00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,991
Marcus Gerber. And you are?


00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,528
-Ali.
-Ali.


00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,961
I'm here.


00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,163
You're Late, you're Late
for a very important date.


00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,634
Georgia went on for you.


00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,743
What is that waitress doing here?
I want that bitch out now.


00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,437
What did she ever do to you?


00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,052
-She told me I look Like a drag queen.
-Can't be the first time that's happened.


00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,247
Get my spot.


00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,949
Nikki, what are you doing?


00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,200
♫I've heard of affairs. 
That are strictly platonic


00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,500
♫But diamonds are a girl's best friend.


00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,800
♫And I think affairs
That you must keep liaisonic


00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
♫Are better bets


00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,500
♫If little pets get big baguettes.


00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,800
♫Time rolls on,
And youth is gone


00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
♫And you can't straighten up when you bend.


00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,500
♫But stiff back, or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's.


00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
♫Diamonds! Diamonds!


00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,000
♫I don't need rhinestones!


00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,000
♫But diamonds are a girl's best...


00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
♫...best friend.


00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,630
Hey!


00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,169
Ali. Ali.


00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,410
Ali. Ali. What do you need?


00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,242
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom--


00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,644
And keep it coming.


00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,843
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?


00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,351
Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.


00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,319
Dating Nikki. This week at Least.


00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,290
I wanna be up there.
I wanna do that.


00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,094
Question is...


00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,032
-...do you have the talent?
-I do.


00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,501
-Are you sure?
-Yes.


00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,764
-Positive?
-Yeah.


00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,635
Good, because you're on.


00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,740
♫I got a dentist


00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,736
♫Who's over seven feet tall


00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,915
♫Ooh, I've got a dentist, baby


00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,253
♫The man is over seven feet tall


00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:35,156
♫His name is Dr. Long John


00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,365
♫And he answers


00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,402
♫Every call

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
♫You know

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,086
♫I went to Long John's office, I said...


00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,246
It's simple.


00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,615
I assume all
your financial obligations...


00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,253
...buy you out...


00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,722
...pay you a million
right off the top.


00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,985
Five hundred each.


00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,556
Where is the partnership that--? You
said there was gonna be a partnership.


00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,263
How about a partnership?


00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,030
Partnerships don't really
work so well with me.


00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,970
-And that deal is--
-Very generous.


00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,134
Good. Because I lead
with my final offer.


00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,180
Not that I give a shit, but why is it
that you want my club so badly?


00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,010
I Like it.


00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,548
I see something I Like,
I have to have it. Since I was a kid.


00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,588
That must have made you
very popular in the sandbox.


00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,253
I did okay.


00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,328
You know what you could
do with that?


00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,761
You know what you could
do with that money?


00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,490
-Not now.
-Don't ''not now'' me.


00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,225
The way I see it...


00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,072
...you're in a fix
and I'm in a position to help.


00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,676
We play this thing right,
and we all come out winners.


00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:52,867
Yeah.


00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,809
You got that balloon payment
due on the first.


00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,472
Did you also tell him
I have a tattoo on my ass?


00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,011
No. It's business.


00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,020
I don't think you're gonna get
another opportunity Like this.


00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,590
So take it.


00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,468
-No.
-She means not now.


00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,872
No, no.
''Not now'' means not now, Vince.


00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,444
No means no.


00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,780
Marcus, I don't care
what you're offering.


00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,815
My club is not for sale.


00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,184
Well, offer's on the table.


00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,314
Thanks.


00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,992
See you in the sandbox.


00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,092
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?


00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,528
Drinks, Ladies.


00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,869
All right, white wine.


00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,202
Tom Collins.


00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,277
Which one is Nikki's?


00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,209
-Both.
-Shit.


00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,577
That was my shot.


00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,553
Here's mud in your eye, Nik.


00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,959
All right. Now I got a buzz,
and you gotta change. You're on.


00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,261
What are you, my mother?


00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,194
In case you haven't noticed,
Vince was talking to Marcus.


00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,239
Well, that's because Marcus
is trying to buy my club.


00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,003
Mother of God.


00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,071
Tess? Probably not a good time.


00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,214
I know you're busy
and I don't mean to interrupt.


00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,442
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about
the new vocals?


00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,677
That's what I've been
thinking about. Vocals.


00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,419
-All the girls lip-synch--
-Except for Tess.


00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,818
Except for Tess.


00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,087
But wouldn’t it be great if we
actually heard the girls sing?


00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,820
No. It wouldn’t be great.


00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,021
Honey.


00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,599
People come here
to watch the dancers dance...


00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,761
...and to watch them Lip-synch
to the great singers.


00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,099
I hear you. I get it.


00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,673
I'm just thinking
of ways to make it better.


00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,867
I don't understand why we can't try--


00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,912
You don't understand
because it's above your pay grade.


00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:47,082
I don't get what that means.
Hear me out. This is a good idea--


00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,516
Ali, Ali, no-- No. No. No.


00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,519
Stop. Take her and remove her.


00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,282
Okay, let's go. Come on.


00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,188
They need you on the floor,
but thanks for visiting.


00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,793
All right. Oh, this is not for anybody.


00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,632
You Look so beautiful right now.
I can't even tell you.


00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,601
And you are so full of shit.


00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,286
Goddamn it!


00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,132
Ali?


00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,808
You can just have a seat.


00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,916
I'm gonna grab us
both a drink, yeah?


00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,916
Oh, and here.


00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,580
Call whoever you want.


00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,656
Long distance, whatever.


00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,490
-I can't.
-What do you mean?


00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,990
I don't have anyone.


00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:13,831
No parents or siblings,
aunts, uncles, anyone?


00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,029
No one.


00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,009
So you're not here to use my phone.


00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,208
No, no, stop.
It's gonna be all right.


00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,376
You can crash here.


00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,284
Just please, please, stop crying.


00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,918
Okay. Okay.


00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,622
I'll take that.


00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,394
Better?


00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,936
Good.


00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,037
Just one night.


00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,075
Till it's light out and I can
figure out my next move.


00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,236
Deal.


00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,454
That's beautiful.


00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,387
Who wrote that?


00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,290
I did.


00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,728
You wrote that?


00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,994
Jack, that's.... That's really good.


00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,070
Thank you.


00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,766
-You have more?
-Yeah.


00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,344
Nothing that's ready to be heard.


00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,778
Hey, Jack...


00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,708
...why did you Leave Kentucky?


00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,813
Why did you Leave Iowa?


00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,255
Because I Looked around
and realized...


00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,855
...there wasn't one person
whose life I wanted.


00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,056
Exactly.


00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,359
Hey, Jack.


00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,430
I'm really glad I don't have to
be alone tonight.


00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,134
Get some sleep.


00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,649
Morning.


00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,815
-Coffee?
-Black.


00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,952
Like my soul.


00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,689
I took the liberty
of making breakfast.


00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,698
I hope you don't mind.
It's the Least I could do.


00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,096
Smells great.


00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,270
She's pretty. Your sister?


00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,373
-Fiancée.
-You're straight?


00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,973
-You thought I was gay?
-Yeah.


00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,907
-Wait, why?
-I don't know. The day bed, eyeliner.


00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,740
It's a very straight Look.


00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,349
You know, it works at the club,
Tess loves it--


00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,779
Okay.


00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,585
I should put on some pants.


00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,016
Probably.


00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,180
So where is she, this fiancée?


00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,154
She's in New York doing a play.


00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,954
Now that you're straight
and engaged...


00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,030
...I feel really weird I came here
in the first place.


00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,129
I'm all right.


00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,636
-I'll be out of your hair in no time.
-You don't have to Leave.


00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,331
-Don't worry about me.
-It's pouring outside.


00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,476
I got a plan.
If you could just get the door for me.


00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,373
Thank you.


00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,916
-You're welcome.
-See you at the club.


00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,344
Ali! What are you doing?


00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,917
Come back inside!


00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,748
No, Jack, I'm fine.


00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,150
It's pouring.


00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,655
It's just water, for chrissake.


00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,217
Damn it.


00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,562
Get your ass back in my house.


00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,698
You've done enough. I'm fine.


00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,966
All right, all right, fine. Here we go.


00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,104
Put me down. What are you doing?


00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,763
You have nowhere to go
and I have a couch.


00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,409
Like it or not, you're gonna stay.


00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,643
Hey, Natalie.


00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,544
Really? That's great.


00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:39,827
Georgia?


00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,965
Yeah.


00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,245
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.


00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,372
Oh, God.


00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,617
Please have the flu.


00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,816
Why do they call it
morning sickness...


00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,893
...if it hits you at every freaking
moment of the day?


00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,324
Have you told Damon yet?


00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,264
No, not yet.


00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,700
Well, sweetheart, you know,
at some point he's going to notice.


00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,030
He's a guy.


00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,662
He's not gonna notice
until my belly's blocking the TV.


00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,102
Well, what are you gonna do?


00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,410
I don't know, Tess.
I'm really scared.


00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,810
Oh, honey, don't be scared.


00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:29,044
Whatever you decide,
we will take care of you. Okay?


00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,915
But you've got to tell Damon.


00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,080
I figured as Long
as he doesn't know...


00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,256
...I can still pretend he's gonna be
excited about it.


00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,954
He's gonna be thrilled.
Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.


00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,241
Excellent. That was great.


00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,543
Thank you very much, Ladies.


00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,447
What happened to
all the great dancers in L.A.?


00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,422
They're all dancing with the stars.


00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,824
Call Andre and ask.
He might have somebody.


00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,020
Okay.


00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,298
Don't like her, I don't like her.


00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,866
I don't love any of them.
She's the best one.


00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,401
What is that?


00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,770
What is she doing?


00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,469
I think she's auditioning.


00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,879
Hey, Dave, cut it!


00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,919
Hold on a second, I can do this.


00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,683
And I think it's sweet
that you think you can.


00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,555
-Tell me what you're Looking for.
-Someone who can do the routine.


00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,798
Excuse me? I'm talking to you!


00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,525
Oh, shit.


00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,527
Just tell me what you want.


00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,303
I can't tell you.


00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,065
Nobody can tell you.


00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,142
You gotta make me believe
that you belong up there.


00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,803
That you own that stage and that
nobody's gonna take it from you.


00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,611
That's the way it works.


00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,581
You wanna show me something,
show me that.


00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,611
All right.


00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,382
Which number do you wanna see?
I know every one.


00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,118
-Every number?
-Which one do you wanna see?


00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,290
''Wagon Wheel Watusi.''


00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,806
What's going on?


00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,910
Well, I couldn’t keep
my eyes off her.


00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,944
Try harder.


00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,806
You were off the whole Last half.


00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,352
Come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice
till I bleed. I know I can do this.


00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,489
You know, we have better dancers.


00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,955
Then say thank you very much
and goodbye.


00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,391
If you just give me a chance.
I swear I won't disappoint you.


00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,463
Didn't anybody ever
give you a shot?


00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,223
Please, I want this so bad.


00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,801
-If you just give me a chance, I'd--
-All right. God!


00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,163
You got the job.


00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,772
What are you so excited about?
She's your replacement.


00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,070
Thank you, Tess.
You won't regret it.


00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,676
I am so gonna regret this.


00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,580
What is Ali short for?


00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,748
-Alice.
-Alice?


00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,553
Well, welcome to Wonderland.


00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,930
Meet me upstairs in five.


00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,762
Well, sorry for the short notice...


00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,732
...but I quit.


00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,104
It's okay.


00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,509
And with my new raise,
I will be off your couch in no time.


00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,117
Here we go.


00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,020
Black corset, first number.


00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,991
Second number, ''Wagon Wheel,''
that's that.


00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,631
Swarovski bustier,
that's for the third number.


00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,699
And this is for ''Miss Otis Regrets.''


00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,268
And remember, with that, don't...


00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,631
...pull the trigger.


00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,800
♫Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder


00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
♫Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?


00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
♫She's got herself a universe gone quickly


00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:46,000
♫For the call of thunder threatens everyone


00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
♫And I feel like I just got home
And I feel...


00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
♫And I feel like I just got home
And I feel...


00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,553
You Like her. I know it kills you,
but you have to admit it.


00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,694
No. You know, she pulls focus,
she doesn't blend in.


00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,590
A girl that doesn't blend in?


00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,025
Oh, my.


00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,132
That is so beneath you.


00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,828
Here we go, here we go.
Don't lose those again.


00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,198
How you doing?


00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,864
My boobs are pushed up to my ears,
my thong's a mile up my butt...


00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,534
...and my eyelashes are so thick
they could kick up a stiff wind.


00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,949
Fun being a girl, isn't it?
Come on, Let’s go, Let’s go.


00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,717
-You guys wanna go grab pizza?
-Yes, please.


00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,553
-Yeah.
-I'm starving.


00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,783
Good, Let’s go.


00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,426
My day was so Long.


00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,923
Ice cream sounds so good.


00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,060
That's so bad.


00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,232
-I'm gonna get so full tonight.
-What?


00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,135
Where is everybody?


00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,498
They went out for pizza.


00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,833
I wasn't hungry.


00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,203
That brush isn't working.
It's too old.


00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,281
Well, it's the only brush I have.


00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,518
I'll Let you use mine.


00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,052
-Here.
-Thanks.


00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,520
All right, here. Let me help you.


00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,331
Wet it if you're gonna get
a clean line.


00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,004
Close your eyes.


00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,039
When you are putting on
your makeup...


00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,738
...it's Like you're an artist.


00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,277
But instead of painting
on a canvas...


00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,878
...you're painting your face.


00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,379
My mom was a model
and she was beautiful.


00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:18,954
Tall, blond.


00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,717
Not Like me.


00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,761
Body that could stop a truck.


00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:29,764
And she had these girlfriends,
beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley...


00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,698
...and they would come over
in the morning...


00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,772
...and put their makeup on together
before they went on jobs. Up.


00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,933
We had a window in the back
of our house with a ledge...


00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,912
...and they would put their mirrors
side by side and put out their makeup.


00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,916
They had lipsticks and blushes,
and it was fabulous.


00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,853
I kept thinking, ''God, I cannot wait
till I get old enough to play with this.''


00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,187
Didn't you ever watch your mom
put on her makeup?


00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,232
My mom died when I was 7...


00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,002
...and it's my first lesson.


00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,982
You know,
you won't be the new girl forever.


00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,504
Beautiful.


00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,446
Shit.


00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,913
Ali.


00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,686
Ali. Did you use my towel again?


00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,823
I found it soaking wet on the floor.


00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,584
-I don't know. Maybe.
-How's that apartment hunt?


00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,758
I've been Looking.
Everything's over 1 000 bucks a month.


00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,924
How can you put a price
on privacy Like that? Freedom?


00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,001
Your own bathroom? Clean towels?


00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,228
Okay, I get it.


00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,807
It's Natalie.


00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,603
Hey, babe.


00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:30,419
Oh, hey.
What about Beachwood Canyon?


00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,148
Great.


00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,619
If you have a car.


00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,992
I mean, truth is...


00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,654
...you really should get a car first.


00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,763
I mean, this is L.A. after all.
You know?


00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,234
I'll tell you what.


00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,674
I'm gonna suck it up...


00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,969
...and Let you stay a Little bit Longer.


00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,437
Throw in something for rent,
we're good.


00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,947
-A second ago you wanted me out.
-I don't Like my towel wet.


00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,745
I don't Like the lack of privacy...


00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,481
...but you're in a jam.


00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,020
And I'm the kind of guy...


00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,091
...when a friend is in trouble, I help.


00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,420
It's just who I am.


00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,826
What did Natalie have to say?


00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,797
Nothing. No, she....
What did she say?


00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,429
''Hi.'' That was it.


00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,070
-And?
-And....


00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,172
Her play got extended
three months.


00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,604
She has to pay
everything there in rent...


00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,744
...so I have to cover
everything here.


00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,710
So if you wanna stick around
and chip in, it would--


00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,314
-Save your ass?
-Help.


00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,450
Well, will you Look at that?


00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,114
The shoe on the other foot.


00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,121
One minute I'm a freeloader...


00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,884
...and the next...


00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,655
...I'm the only thing standing
between you and eviction.


00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,525
Just yes or no?


00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,630
What's the proposal exactly?


00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,471
Wonderful apartment.
Bathroom included.


00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:56,663
I'm listening.


00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,535
-Use of the kitchen.
-Keep going.


00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,677
-Six hundred a month.
-Closet?


00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,334
-Half.
-Oh, Look.


00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,044
''Fabulous apartment
with a great view.''


00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,616
Fine, fine.


00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,143
The whole closet.


00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,050
-I want the bedroom.
-No way.


00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,213
Oh, Look. ''Hot tub, Beverly Hills.''


00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,450
All right. You can have my bedroom.


00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:17,954
Are you in?


00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,286
Oh, Jack.


00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,057
See, I'm the kind of girl...


00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,099
...if a friend's in trouble, I help.


00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,567
That's just who I am.


00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,974
Oh, boy.


00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,179
Your dream is killing me!


00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,048
It's killing me!


00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,361
What was that?


00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,469
And what's this?


00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,475
It's something about
the two mortgages.


00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,414
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't got a goddamn clue.


00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,216
But if I can't raise
the amount of money...


00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,517
...on that paper by the end
of this month, I Lose the club.


00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,827
It's just money.


00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,189
It's just a number.


00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,296
I know...


00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,030
...but do you think I could do it?


00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,296
Okay, tell me a lie.


00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,497
I need your expert sewing skills.


00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,143
Tell me a new Lie.


00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,842
I don't Love you.


00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:56,182
Come here. Come here.


00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,395
It's okay.


00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,341
Stage right.


00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,380
Wait a minute. Hey, hey.
What's in that?


00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,577
Iced tea.


00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,453
Iced tea, my ass. Go home.


00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,625
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.


00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,555
You're not gonna go on. Go home.


00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,561
Relax. It is one drink.
What is the big deal?


00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,131
Ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.


00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,791
-She can't dance my part.
-She can and she will.


00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,870
No, no. My God, I can't do that.
It is Nikki's number.


00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,007
You said you can do
any number, right?


00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,506
-I don't wanna step on any toes.
-Then don't.


00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,076
I don't ca-- Listen to me.


00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,971
You're gonna go on,
and you're gonna go home.


00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,744
Here, put this on.


00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,254
-Dave.
-Huh?

00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,619
Tess wants to see you.
Says it's urgent.


00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,283
I can't leave right now. I'm working, girl.


00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,258
Don't say I didn't warn you.


00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:10,458
Ugh. Dave this, Dave that,
Everybody wants Dave to do something.


00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,001
Y'all gonna have me singing
by the time I'm done here. Jesus.

00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,000
♫Step on Jesse James's blue suede shoes, yeah

Oh, my God.


00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,019
Am I the only one that has no idea
what just happened?


00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,451
Whatever it was--


00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,887
The music stopped,
I didn't know what to do.


00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,526
I had to sing, I'm sorry.


00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,853
Never told me
you could sing Like that.


00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,258
I tried to tell you.


00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,728
Okay, okay, all right.


00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,766
This is what we're gonna do.
You know the songs, right?


00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,960
Oh, yeah.


00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,368
So tomorrow we're gonna rehearse,
then you're gonna sing.


00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:13,198
We're gonna go
straight through the show Live.


00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,038
-So any questions?
-No.


00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,271
Okay, good. Good.
You go with the guys.


00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,177
Find out what keys
you're comfortable singing in...


00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,719
...and I'm going to go up to my office
and plan an entirely new show.


00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,922
-Okay?
-Oh, my God.


00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,751
Thanks, Tess.


00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,122
I'm gonna build a show around her.


00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,322
''They don't come to hear us sing''?


00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,498
They'll come to hear her sing.


00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,100
So how do you feel?


00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,405
-Amazing.
-I've never seen anything Like that.


00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,144
Thanks. Are you sure Tess
really Liked it? She wasn't...?


00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,715
I was bringing down the curtain.


00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,357
She stopped me.
She's the one who Let you sing.


00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,726
-Really?
-She wants to build a show around you.


00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,063
You're crying with happiness, right?


00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,255
Good. Okay.


00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,957
Brava.


00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,907
Clearly one of us
has underestimated the other.


00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,586
I can't believe Tess has you
buried in the kick Line.


00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,949
She didn't know I sang.


00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,920
Well, you certainly can.


00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,783
And you are way too good
to be doing it here.


00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,489
How about a drink?


00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,221
The bar's right over there.


00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,558
Tell Jack I sent you.


00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,802
Where the hell did that come from?


00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,799
-Who knew that you could do that?
-Thanks, Jack.


00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,377
Who knew any white chick
could sing Like that?


00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,979
How do you do that?


00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,515
I don't know. It just happens.
I just do it.


00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:04,848
I know how that feels.
I gotta pee again, so....


00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,779
Stop.

2
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,986
We're gonna get something to eat.


00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,483
You wanna come?


00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,325
Yeah, I would.


00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,829
Let's go.


00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,960
Look at you.


00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,432
What? What?


00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,667
Well, no, just the way
you're gazing after her.


00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,743
I have a fiancée, remember?


00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,743
Yes. No, I do. I know.
Three thousand miles away.


00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:32,939
We talk every day.


00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,708
You do? About what?


00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,477
Let me guess, don't tell me.


00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,416
About her.


00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,147
Her.


00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,288
And, I don't know....


00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,854
Her.


00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,519
All I'm saying is that
that one there...


00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,359
...is beautiful
on the inside as well...


00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,968
...and she's not going to be
available forever.


00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,272
Relationship advice from
Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.


00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,463
That is....


00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,665
Forgot my purse.


00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,010
-What?
-Oh, no.


00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,810
I was just telling Jack here
how every opportunity has a shelf Life.


00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,444
Come here.


00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,050
Look there.


00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,585
Awfully pretty, but too much.


00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,855
See, I Like that.


00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,231
No, I'm not cutting my hair.


00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,201
Who said anything about you
cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.


00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,236
I'm wearing one right now.

I mean, it looks....


00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,737
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.


00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,038
It's not Like we're brother and sister.


00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,942
No, we certainly are not.


00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,678
I don't get why everyone's
having a conniption.


00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,880
She's just a tacky farm girl
from Iowa.


00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,423
And we know a cow
when we see one.


00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,224
Don't underestimate us farm girls.


00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,164
Vince.


00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,770
This round's on me.


00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,267
I don't normally do this...


00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,277
...but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.


00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,982
It's either you or the auction house.


00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,981
No, I am not selling.


00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,484
Know what happens
when you default on a Loan?


00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,712
No, hum a few bars.


00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,756
I'm not screwing around here.
Where's the money coming from?


00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,655
Ali's a hit.
We can charge 50 bucks a head now.


00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,228
Raising the admission?
That's not good enough.


00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,264
You have been saying
that the sky is falling forever.


00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,334
Everything always works out fine.


00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,663
Tell that to the people
losing everything.


00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,601
I don't wanna be one of them.


00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,798
-I Love this place too.
-No, you don't.


00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,169
-I do.
-No, you don't!


00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,243
-Yes, I do!
-Oh, no, you don't.


00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,080
Look, you have many
fine qualities, Vincent.


00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,308
And then you've got
some iffy qualities.


00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,112
But you've never been a phony.


00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,881
Just tell Marcus no.


00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:56,865
Jack?


00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,100
Yep. Just got in.


00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,745
I'm in here.
Can you come zip me up?


00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,740
Hey, where you been?


00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,612
Writing music.


00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,512
Can I hear?


00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,321
-It's not ready.
-It's not ready.


00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,017
Who's that?


00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,423
Me and my mom
on my 7th birthday.


00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,764
She died a few weeks Later.


00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,632
You must miss her.


00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,934
Every single day something happens
that I wish I could tell her about.


00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,208
And what happened today?


00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
Nothing yet.


00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,917
You should get that.
It's probably Natalie.


00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,320
Probably.


00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,398
Hey, babe.


00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,193

♫Oh, oh, oh, oh


01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:20,769
I'm starved. You ready?


01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,647
I can't. I'm so sorry.
I have to do inventory tonight.


01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:28,977
Want me to call a cab?


01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,848
No, that's okay.
I'll get a ride with Coco.


01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,511
Sorry.


01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:36,452
Watch your back. Coming through.


01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:37,650
You ready?


01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,820
-For what?
-I'll drop you off.


01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,430
Coco Left five minutes ago.


01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,828
I was coming to talk to you.
I caught the end of your conversation.


01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,268
-Talk to me about...?
-Dinner. With me. Give me that.


01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:55,709
If you ever expect to see
this bag alive again...


01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,311
...you’ll follow me.


01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,949
Hold on a second.
Where you going? Hey!


01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,825
Where are you taking me?
This is not the way to my place.


01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,220
I told you. Dinner.


01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,486
Dinner?


01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,961
I'm not going to dinner with you.
You're seeing Nikki.


01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,091
We're just friends.


01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,998
Where I come from, friends don't 
chew on each other's earlobes.


01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,695
Aren't you glad you Left?


01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,999
-Oh, damn it.
-What?


01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,502
I gotta make a quick appearance
at a party.


01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,113
You just remembered.


01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,682
It's on the way. We'll be quick.
Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?


01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,046
And if I do?


01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,653
Then you've been kidnapped.


01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,497
Hey, Marcus.


01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,132
Nice house.


01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,638
What are you doing?
You can't just take that.


01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:06,374
Put that back.
You're gonna get us kicked out of here.


01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,777
Not if we sneak out. Come on.
