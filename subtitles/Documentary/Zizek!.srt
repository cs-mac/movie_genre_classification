1
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,045
What would be my...
how should I call it,

2
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,811
spontaneous attitude
towards the universe?

3
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,352
It's a very dark one.

4
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:32,513
The first thesis would have been

5
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:34,750
a kind of total vanity:

6
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,350
There is nothing, basically.

7
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:39,429
I mean it quite literally,

8
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,864
like... ultimately...

9
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:45,367
there are just some fragments,

10
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:46,766
some vanishing things.

11
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,361
If you look at the universe,

12
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:49,530
it's one big void.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,267
But then how do things emerge?

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,835
Here, I feel a kind
of spontaneous affinity

15
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:57,380
with quantum physics,

16
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,449
where, you know,
the idea there

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,518
is that universe is a void,

18
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,247
but a kind of a positively
charged void.

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,483
And then particular things
appear

20
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,618
when the balance of the void
is disturbed.

21
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:13,219
And I like this idea
of spontaneous very much

22
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,357
that the fact that it's
just not nothing...

23
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,934
Things are out there.

24
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:19,525
It means something
went terribly wrong...

25
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:22,401
that what we call creation

26
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:26,033
is a kind of a cosmic imbalance,
cosmic catastrophe,

27
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:28,202
that things exist by mistake.

28
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:30,712
And I'm even ready
to go to the end

29
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,909
and to claim that the only way
to counteract it

30
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:37,886
is to assume the mistake
and go to the end.

31
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:40,583
And we have a name for this.
It's called love.

32
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,320
Isn't love precisely this kind
of a cosmic imbalance?

33
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:46,623
I was always disgusted
with this notion

34
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,926
of "I love the world,"
universal love.

35
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,660
I don't like the world.

36
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:51,928
I don't know how...

37
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,800
Basically, I'm somewhere
in between "I hate the world"

38
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,601
or "I'm indifferent towards it."

39
00:01:56,707 --> 00:01:59,437
But the whole of reality,
it's just it.

40
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:02,410
It's stupid. It is out there.
I don't care about it.

41
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:05,812
Love, for me,
is an extremely violent act.

42
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,044
Love is not "I love you all."

43
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,950
Love means I pick out something,

44
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:14,286
and it's, again,
this structure of imbalance.

45
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,088
Even if this something
is just a small detail...

46
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,560
a fragile individual person...

47
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:22,531
I say "I love you
more than anything else."

48
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:25,568
In this quite formal sense,
love is evil.

49
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:18,550
They inform me
they play chess. I like that.

50
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:36,832
Think about the strangeness
of today's situation.

51
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,705
30, 40 years ago,
we were still debating

52
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,573
about what the future will be:

53
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,476
Communist, Fascist,
capitalist, whatever.

54
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,379
Today, nobody even
debates these issues.

55
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:50,784
We all silently accept
global capitalism is here to stay.

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,425
On the other hand,
we are obsessed

57
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,394
with cosmic catastrophes:

58
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,591
The whole life on Earth
disintegrating

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,962
because of some virus,

60
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:07,196
because of an asteroid
hitting the Earth, and so on.

61
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,566
So the paradox is that

62
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:13,575
it's much easier to imagine
the end of all life on Earth

63
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:17,340
than a much more modest
radical change in capitalism,

64
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:21,509
which means that we should
reinvent Utopia,

65
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:23,177
but in what sense?

66
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,720
There are two false
meanings of Utopia.

67
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:38,194
One is this old notion
of imagining an ideal society,

68
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,031
which we know will never
be realized.

69
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:42,662
The other is the capitalist Utopia

70
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:45,833
in the sense of new
perverse desires

71
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,433
that you are not only allowed

72
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,139
but even solicited to realize.

73
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:55,742
The true Utopia is when
the situation is so without issue,

74
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,718
without a way to resolve it

75
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,086
within the coordinates
of the possible,

76
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,183
that out of the pure
urge of survival

77
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,262
you have to invent a new space.

78
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:08,729
Utopia is not kind of
a free imagination.

79
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,700
Utopia is a matter
of innermost urgency.

80
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:15,465
You are forced to imagine it
as the only way out,

81
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:17,666
and this is what we need today.

82
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,955
I hope I wasn't too long.

83
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,994
I thank you very much
for your patience.

84
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,677
Another very short comment
that I can make.

85
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,575
You know why I applauded?

86
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:03,016
If you watch old
documentary movies,

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,917
you will see a big difference

88
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,855
between a Fascist
and a Stalinist leader.

89
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,722
The Fascist leader,
when he is applauded,

90
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,819
he just accepts it.

91
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,200
The Stalinist leader
applauds himself.

92
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,897
The message being
"It's not at me.

93
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,670
I'm just your tool. We are all
just serving history."

94
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,972
And this was my side.

95
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,301
So we are on. Okay.

96
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:11,221
The worst thing is to play
this "We are all humans" game

97
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,415
that some intellectuals
like to play.

98
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:16,015
You project a certain
intellectual persona...

99
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,328
cold thinker, whatever...

100
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,922
but then you signal,
through small details,

101
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,260
"You know, but nonetheless,
I'm basically like you.

102
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,027
I like small pleasures of life.

103
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:25,362
I'm human like you.

104
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:28,461
I'm not human.
I'm a monster, I claim.

105
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,439
It's not that I have a mask
of a theoretician,

106
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,772
and beneath,
I'm a warm, human person.

107
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:37,108
I like chocolate cake,
I like this, I like that,

108
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,273
which makes me human.

109
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:43,251
I'd rather prefer myself
as somebody who,

110
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,549
not to offend others,

111
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,750
pretends... plays
that he's human.

112
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,040
You come in?

113
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,110
I hid it, of course.

114
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:12,810
It means "Welcome to welfare,"
to socialist wealth.

115
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,178
A good, honest guy.

116
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,685
I put everything here...
I love this... so that...

117
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,448
By everything, I mean...

118
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:21,046
Look even here it is.
You see?

119
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:22,455
Isn't it a crazy combination?

120
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,119
You have this,
and then you have...

121
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:26,355
The clothes are here.

122
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,693
But it's not only clothes.
It's more.

123
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,165
It's also...
how do you call it?...

124
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,396
covers, sheets for the...

125
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:36,063
No, no. Everything is here.

126
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:40,043
Here. Isn't this nice,
close to the kitchen?

127
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:43,212
Here are socks, underwear.

128
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,975
This is all my stuff,

129
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,812
and basically,
this is all my stuff:

130
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,545
Newspapers, journals.

131
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:52,554
These are my books
in foreign languages.

132
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:54,055
Two copies of each one.

133
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,456
So this is strictly prohibited.

134
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,891
It looks bad.

135
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:01,058
I think they are lower there,

136
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,430
because this is
mostly new stuff.

137
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:07,129
- Oh, this is...
- Do you keep everything?

138
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:10,331
I am narcissist here.
Yes, I keep everything.

139
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,375
- Do you keep...
- What is this doing here?

140
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,444
This should go elsewhere.

141
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,979
I'm sorry. I just...
I'll go far back,

142
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,072
so this is there.
Just let me...

143
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,084
Okay, if you need
the "Mladina" stuff,

144
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,848
Ah, yes, there are some of them here.

145
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,047
Let's see what's here,

146
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,317
because these are
the big format thing.

147
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:32,054
These are some early
"Mladina" from...

148
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:34,494
Ah, this is from
the dissident times.

149
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:37,396
Yes. Mid-'80s, I started
to write from time to time.

150
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,402
For two years,
some people even claim

151
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,301
that I was the most influential.

152
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,705
But then new political
divisions start,

153
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,505
and I was too combative,
attacking everyone.

154
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:49,909
This was me.

155
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:52,675
This was my fame.

156
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,375
I worked like crazy
at that time,

157
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:57,386
because I was writing
in English my first books.

158
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:01,481
I never wanted to endanger,
not even minimally, the theory,

159
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:03,219
which is why I was
never, never interested

160
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,625
in any kind of political career,

161
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,061
because it simply takes time.

162
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,503
Two days before the election,

163
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:58,342
there was a big round table
with all the candidates:

164
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,939
20 of them,
I don't know how much.

165
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:12,794
A right wing naive good guy,
but basically an idiot,

166
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:15,194
made a fatal mistake,

167
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,563
which everybody remembered.

168
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,295
Not even a mistake,
a kindness:

169
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,166
Namely, as usual,
as you can imagine,

170
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,466
I talked quite a lot,
too much,

171
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:26,702
and then this guy wanted
to censor me friendly,

172
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,072
and turned to me...

173
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:30,271
this was all live, big debate,
central TV.

174
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,995
"Listen, we all know

175
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:56,698
that your I.Q. Is twice as all
of us others combined,

176
00:11:56,807 --> 00:12:00,072
but nonetheless, could you
let us a little bit to talk?"

177
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,042
But everybody remembered
that, you know?

178
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:03,112
You see?

179
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,875
Even they admit
that he is the bright guy.

180
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,042
I remember then, you know,
after it was over,

181
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,619
when the lights went off,
the cameras went off,

182
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,622
all other candidates started
to shout at this guy,

183
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:15,919
like "Are you idiot?
Are you crazy?"

184
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,221
Because then I jumped up
immediately

185
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:19,795
and almost got elected.

186
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,920
When I first visited the States,

187
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,896
I was shocked
by your toilets here.

188
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,024
"IDEOLOG Y"

189
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,966
Romanticism onwards.

190
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,528
That was the idea
of so-called European trinity...

191
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,736
Anglo-Saxon economy,
French politics,

192
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,369
German metaphysics,
poetry, philosophy...

193
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,846
as the basic...
how should I put it?...

194
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,851
spiritual stances of Europe.

195
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:18,183
Sorry. That's it.

196
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,756
French politics, revolutionary:

197
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:23,121
Shit should disappear
as soon as possible.

198
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,854
Anglo-Saxon/American:
Let's be pragmatic.

199
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,158
German metaphysic poetry, inspection:

200
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,325
You inspect,
you reflect on your shit.

201
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,902
So isn't it totally crazy

202
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:36,769
that in a vulgar,
common phenomenon like that

203
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:40,570
you find certain differences

204
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:44,135
which you truly cannot account
in any functional terms,

205
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:45,908
but you have to evoke all this.

206
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:49,110
I mean, you claim,
"Okay, I'm out of ideology

207
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,517
at a conference
post-ideological era."

208
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,386
Then you go to the toilet,
produce shit.

209
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,958
You are up to your shit,

210
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,686
or how do you put it
in ideology, no?

211
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,672
Who believes what today?

212
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:14,835
I think this is
an interesting question,

213
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:19,211
much more complex
than it may appear.

214
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:23,184
The first myth to be
abandoned, I think,

215
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:26,119
is the idea that we live
in a cynical era

216
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:28,919
where nobody
believes no values,

217
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:32,484
and that there were some times,
more traditional,

218
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:34,564
where people still believed,

219
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,634
relied of some sort
of substantial notion of belief,

220
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:38,826
and so on and so on.

221
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:42,462
I think it's today
that we believe more than ever,

222
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:45,541
and, as Fuller develops it
in a nice, ironic way,

223
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:48,611
the ultimate form of belief
for him is deconstructionism.

224
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,805
Why? Again, I'm going back

225
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,779
to that question
of, quote, Marx, no?

226
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:56,046
Look how it functions,
deconstructionism,

227
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:59,179
in its standard version,
already at the texture of style.

228
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,417
You cannot find
one text of Derrida

229
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,653
without "A,"
all of the quotation marks,

230
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,460
and "B," all of this
rhetorical distanciations.

231
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,090
Like... I don't know.

232
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,601
To take an ironic example,

233
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,332
if somebody like Judith Butler

234
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,271
were to be asked "What is this?"

235
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,038
She would never have said,
"This is a bottle of tea."

236
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:23,476
She would have said
something like,

237
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,608
"If we accept
the metaphysical notion

238
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,018
of language identifying
clearly objects,

239
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:34,420
and taking all this into account,

240
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:35,889
then may we not"...

241
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,960
she likes to put it
in this rhetorical way...

242
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,756
"...reach the hypothesis that,

243
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:42,388
in the conditions
of our language game,

244
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:47,732
this can be said to be
a bottle of tea?"

245
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,606
So it's always this need
to distanciate.

246
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,073
It goes even for love,

247
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:56,543
like nobody almost dares
to say today "I love you."

248
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,876
It has to be,
as a poet would have put it,

249
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:00,973
"I love you," or some kind
of a distance.

250
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,676
But what's the problem here?

251
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:05,186
The problem is that...

252
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,279
why this fear?

253
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,880
Because I claim that,

254
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:13,258
when the ancients
directly said "I love you,"

255
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:14,990
they meant exactly the same.

256
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:17,328
All these distanciations
were included.

257
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,403
So it's we today who are afraid

258
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:23,735
that, if we were to put it
directly, "I love you,"

259
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,171
that it would mean too much.

260
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,243
We believe in it.

261
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:37,070
You know what I learned
in the high school?

262
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,408
- What?
- English and Russian.

263
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,812
- You know why Russian?
- Why?

264
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,111
It's so disgusting,
the reasoning behind it.

265
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,777
Because all my friends...
most of my friends...

266
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,788
took either French or German
as a second language.

267
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,721
Okay, my idea was, you know,

268
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,055
there was a code word
to superpowers.

269
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,628
Isn't it good to play it safe?

270
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,459
Whoever wins, I will
speak their language.

271
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,329
There were three levels
of dissidents.

272
00:17:58,435 --> 00:17:59,595
The first in theory...

273
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,934
I mean, if you dealt with theory
or whatever or writing.

274
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,974
The first level was,
"Were you allowed to teach?"

275
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,907
This was the first level
of exclusion.

276
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,569
The second level were,

277
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,239
"Are you allowed to publish books?"

278
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,839
The third level was,

279
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,386
"Are you allowed to get a job
at all in your domain?"

280
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,545
And the fourth level is,

281
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,452
you are arrested
or whatever, no?

282
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,457
I was between the second and third.

283
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,958
My God, I was unemployed.

284
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,288
It was humiliating.

285
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:30,128
I was 27, and my parents
supported me, my God.

286
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,359
Then for two years,

287
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,959
it was that humiliating job
at the central committee.

288
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,038
They knew that I am not
an idiot

289
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:38,039
and that I will probably succeed.

290
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:41,872
So they were afraid
that I would simply move abroad

291
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:42,945
and succeed there.

292
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,843
This would then be bad for...

293
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,472
you know, another victim
who wasn't allowed

294
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,880
to make a career in Slovenia.

295
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:50,953
So they want me
to vegetate on the margin,

296
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,248
but there in Slovenia.

297
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,789
It was in a way
an intelligent move,

298
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:57,155
but they didn't know
that the way they did it,

299
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,353
they made it even easier
for me to move abroad.

300
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:06,226
Give him 7. It's okay.

301
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,496
Oh, sorry.

302
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:09,731
Okay. "Gracias."

303
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,233
- This is it.
- Yeah.

304
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:16,642
- Oh, my God!
- Spectacular.

305
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:18,907
I thought this would be
some kind of old building

306
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:20,107
with Peron and...

307
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:22,480
not Peron, with Borges
and so on.

308
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,018
Oh, yeah. No, it's super-modern.

309
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,556
Oh, my God, I didn't like
the way that guy looked at me.

310
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:30,854
It's only an idiot coming.
I hate this. Let's move there.

311
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,020
- I really hate this.
- What do you hate?

312
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,222
I hate when...

313
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,529
I think that idiot...
friendly, bright person...

314
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,432
recognized me,
and I hate this,

315
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:43,028
because then they stare.

316
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,231
They descend on you?

317
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,206
Oh, my God.
Okay, for you.

318
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,742
- To whom do I put it to?
- Flora

319
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

320
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:59,517
Did you ever expect this,
to have all these fans?

321
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,522
No, but that's what
I really hate this.

322
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,525
I cannot tell you
how much I hate it.

323
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:06,492
You don't love it
just a little bit?

324
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,722
No, no, no, no, no.

325
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,991
I think people are evil.

326
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,262
This is horrible.

327
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:15,395
You see all these creeps,
all these creeps here?

328
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,494
This is horrible.

329
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:18,198
Who's that hysterical woman?

330
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,900
She's a fan, Slajov.

331
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,103
Yeah, but what is she doing here?

332
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,180
She should go up there
and wait in line,

333
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,941
not annoying me here.

334
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:42,154
It was simply made
as a documentary

335
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:45,159
supposed to present
Lacanian theory

336
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,660
to a wide public,

337
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,163
I think for
the second channel

338
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,096
of the French state TV.

339
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,878
What I appreciate

340
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:14,753
is this inversion...
reversal of the role

341
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:17,360
between public image and private.

342
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,295
It's this total denigration...

343
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:24,093
disappearance of this
warm, human person.

344
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,933
This for me is the idea
of ideology.

345
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,233
The central idea
of ideology for me

346
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:34,003
is not these ideas determine you...

347
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,510
you are a Christian,
you are a Marxist, whatever,

348
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:37,944
today liberal, I don't know.

349
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,345
But the idea is precisely

350
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,149
that ideological propositions
do not determine us totally.

351
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:48,622
We cannot be reduced
to our public image:

352
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:51,489
There is a warm human being behind.

353
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:53,721
I think this is ideology
at its purest.

354
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,924
The most horrible
and ideological act for me...

355
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,330
and really horrible, terrifying...

356
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:02,803
is to fully identify
with the ideological image.

357
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:07,866
The ultimate act is what we think
is our true self.

358
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:09,239
There is the true acting,

359
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,939
and usually, our truth

360
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:16,451
to that to which we are
really committed existentially

361
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,679
is in our acts

362
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:21,188
more than importance
supposed to be behind the act.

363
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,225
So again, my point
is that I'm...

364
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:26,420
I like philosophy
as an anonymous job,

365
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,089
not as this kind of...

366
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,532
look at the way he moves now,
these gestures.

367
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,466
I find this ridiculous.

368
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:36,038
He emphasizes

369
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:40,405
"One cannot say all the truth.

370
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,810
It's impossible materially."

371
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,779
This ridiculous emphasis.

372
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,477
I think it's pure fake,
an empty gesture,

373
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,747
as if he makes a deep point there.

374
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,048
He does not.

375
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:00,618
I think Lacan,
in a very classical way...

376
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,028
what interests me
are his propositions:

377
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,930
The underlying logic,
not his style.

378
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:08,970
His style is a total fake, I think.

379
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,700
I try to forget it.
I try to repress it.

380
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:13,435
Maybe it works as a strategy.

381
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:15,272
At a certain point,
why not?

382
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:16,572
First, you have to seduce people

383
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:17,703
with obscure statements,

384
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,475
but I hate
this kind of approach.

385
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:21,311
I'm a total
enlightenment person.

386
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,442
I believe in clear statements.

387
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:27,045
And I'm for Lacan because, again,
I think, to make it very clear,

388
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,124
it's not that Lacan
is just bluffing

389
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:32,854
in the sense that there is
nothing behind this obscurity.

390
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:35,294
The whole point of my work

391
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:39,266
is that you can translate Lacan
into clear terms.

392
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:44,097
Well, I've just had enough of this.

393
00:24:52,382 --> 00:24:55,874
<i>Now, live from the CN8 Studios,</i>

394
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:59,045
<i>This is CN8 Nitebeat,
with Barry Nolan.</i>

395
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:02,147
Jacques Lacan was
a French psychoanalyst.

396
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,988
He makes Freud sound
like a simple Valley girl.

397
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,221
Lacan's theory
of how the self works

398
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,524
is so complicated,

399
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,758
it makes my teeth hurt
to think about it.

400
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,597
Slavoj Zizek is a philosopher

401
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:17,195
at the University
of Ljubljana, Slovenia...

402
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,140
I think I said this fairly close
to the way it's pronounced...

403
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:23,474
<i>who has written a book called
The Puppet and The Dwarf.</i>

404
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:26,912
The book takes a look
at modern Christianity

405
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:30,110
from the viewpoint
of Lacanian psychoanalysis,

406
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,483
or at least that's
what I think it's about.

407
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:34,215
Welcome, Mr. Zizek.

408
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,690
Did I say that...
Tell me the right way.

409
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:40,695
Slavoj Zizek, but again,
I prefer it the wrong way.

410
00:25:40,797 --> 00:25:43,459
It makes me paranoid
if I hear it the right way.

411
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,091
This is the most complicated book
I have ever tried to read.

412
00:25:46,202 --> 00:25:48,363
Strange, because the goal
of the book

413
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:49,631
is, on the contrary,

414
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:53,038
to make Lacan back into someone

415
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,043
whom even your grandma
could understand.

416
00:25:56,145 --> 00:25:58,579
Let's say you have a good
old-fashioned father.

417
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,673
It's Sunday afternoon.
You have to visit Grandma.

418
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,514
The father would...
old-fashioned totalitarian father...

419
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,919
will tell you, "Listen,
I don't care how you feel"...

420
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,389
if you are a small kid, of course...

421
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:11,426
"I don't care how you feel.

422
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:13,791
- You have to go"...
- "You're going."

423
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,796
"Going Grandmother
and behave there properly."

424
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,923
- Okay.
- That's good. You can resist.

425
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,127
Nothing is broken.

426
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:21,498
But let's say you have

427
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:23,731
the so-called tolerant
post-modern father.

428
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,831
What he will tell you
is the following:

429
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,537
"You know how much
your grandmother loves you,

430
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:32,478
but nonetheless, you should
only visit her

431
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:34,106
if you really want to."

432
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,117
Now, every child
who is not an idiot...

433
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,277
and they are not idiots...

434
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,480
know that this apparent
free choice

435
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:44,458
secretly contains an even more
stronger, much stronger order:

436
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,085
"Not only you have
to visit your grandmother,

437
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:48,322
but you have to like it."

438
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:50,956
I'm beginning to like this book
all the more.

439
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,035
That's one example

440
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:56,697
of how apparent tolerance,
choice, and so on,

441
00:26:56,806 --> 00:27:00,572
can conceal a much stronger order.

442
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:01,973
So we should go back

443
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,638
to more like the dad that just says
"Because I said so!"

444
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,112
Absolutely. It's more honest.

445
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,649
You went to the McDonald breakfast?

446
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,344
This is not so ridiculous.

447
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:12,751
Look what you get.

448
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,089
You know, you get this
with Happy Meal.

449
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:20,492
Yeah, to make you happy.

450
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:21,893
Yeah, but this is for the kids.

451
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:23,932
I go there to make him happy.

452
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,729
He pretends to be happy there
not to disappoint me,

453
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,667
But what the hell.
The game functions.

454
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,932
This means that, again, you know,

455
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,806
I love him, but my perspective
is time, you know.

456
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:38,074
We go there, up and down,
one hour passes.

457
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:41,582
No, it's pure desperate
strategy of surviving.

458
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,618
- Right.
- How to pass the time

459
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,516
without getting
too nervous without...

460
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:47,452
and this is easy,
because he eats

461
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:50,082
and shuts up for 20 minutes
after he eats.

462
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:52,457
- What does he get nervous about?
- No, I get nervous.

463
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,530
Okay, this will go.

464
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,461
He's perplexed, as you can see.

465
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,338
Now he's narcissistically amused.

466
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,423
It's just to keep him calm,
in a non-demanding state,

467
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,015
so it's eating, it's this,
it's whatever, no?

468
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:26,060
Or at least negotiating.

469
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,562
Yesterday, he was building
some Lego castles.

470
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:30,461
He wasn't satisfied with them,

471
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:32,158
but then he gave me the role

472
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:35,704
of just collecting a certain type
of these small plastic cubes.

473
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:38,069
I start to shoot at the animals,

474
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:41,337
then... I love this one,
American Army.

475
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:42,672
You know, this one,
I bought it.

476
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:44,405
I don't know where,
but it's beautiful.

477
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,448
You can open it, you see?

478
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,846
And put soldiers in

479
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,317
so that then he attacks me
from there.

480
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,480
He destroyed this castle
that I had here.

481
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,184
This was his original,

482
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:59,693
but destruction is very precise.

483
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,956
It's incredible how you think
it's chaotic, no?

484
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:04,658
But he's the big wise guy.

485
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:05,927
He observes.

486
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:09,368
Here, he's very profane.

487
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:13,841
He wanted to have a woman
as the boss, the queen.

488
00:29:13,943 --> 00:29:16,207
Then he said,
"But she will be alone.

489
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:18,041
Why not have two girls?"

490
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,910
This is the two girls talking.

491
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:23,474
You see, lesbian, progressive,
politically correct, no?

492
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:27,044
Two lesbians, and...

493
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,181
but I like this one.

494
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,554
Isn't this a beautiful one?

495
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,752
I bought it in Greece.

496
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:35,262
A kind of a nice old Roman.

497
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,740
Over. Let's show them all, huh?

498
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:03,920
Okay, philosophy.

499
00:30:05,728 --> 00:30:06,990
This, I can do it,

500
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,826
at least traditionally,
in two lines, no?

501
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:20,468
Philosophy
does not solve problems.

502
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:23,704
The duty of philosophy
is not to solve problems

503
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,008
but to redefine problems,

504
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,016
to show how what we experience
as a problem

505
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,244
is a false problem.

506
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:33,151
If what we experience
as a problem

507
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:34,313
is a true problem,

508
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:35,856
then you don't need philosophy.

509
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,482
For example, let's say

510
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:40,391
that now there would be
a deadly virus

511
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:42,225
coming from out there in space,

512
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,822
so not in any way mediated
through our human history,

513
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,198
and it would threaten all of us.

514
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,931
We don't need, basically,
philosophy there.

515
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,406
We simply need good science
desperately to find...

516
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,602
We would desperately
need good science

517
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:58,077
to find the solution,
to stop this virus.

518
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,704
We don't need philosophy there,

519
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:02,807
because the threat
is a real threat, directly.

520
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,079
You cannot play
philosophical tricks

521
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:06,677
and say "No, this is not the"...

522
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,120
You know what I mean.

523
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,418
It's simply our life would be...

524
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,493
or okay, the more vulgar, even,

525
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:14,529
simpler science fiction
scenario.

526
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,190
It's kind of "Armageddon"
or whatever.

527
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,459
No, "Deep lmpact."

528
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:20,967
A big comet threatening
to hit Earth.

529
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,799
You don't need philosophy here.

530
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:23,929
You need... I don't know.

531
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,974
To be a little bit naive,
I don't know.

532
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:29,340
Strong atomic bombs
to explode, maybe.

533
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:31,276
I think it's maybe too utopian.

534
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,608
But you know what I mean.

535
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,239
I mean the threat is there,
you see.

536
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,251
In such a situation,
you don't need philosophy.

537
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:41,084
I don't think that philosophers
ever provided answers,

538
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,385
but I think this was
the greatness of philosophy,

539
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:44,686
not in this common sense

540
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:47,422
that philosophers
just ask questions and so on.

541
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,895
What is philosophy?

542
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:51,432
Philosophy is not
what some people think,

543
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,765
some crazy exercise
in absolute truth,

544
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,963
and then you can adopt
this skeptical attitude:

545
00:31:57,073 --> 00:31:58,734
We, through scientists,

546
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:01,901
are dealing with actual,
measurable solvable problems.

547
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:05,845
Philosophers just ask stupid metaphysical
questions and so on,

548
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:07,438
play with absolute truths,

549
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,915
which we all know
is inaccessible.

550
00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:11,578
No, I think philosophy's
a very modest discipline.

551
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,746
Philosophy asks
a different question,

552
00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:15,153
the true philosophy.

553
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:18,055
How does a philosopher approach
the problem of freedom?

554
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,390
It's not "Are we free or not?"

555
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:22,054
"Is there God or not?"

556
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:23,927
It asks a simple question,

557
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:27,002
which will be called
a hermeneutic question:

558
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,968
What does it mean to be free?

559
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:32,040
So this is what philosophy
basically does.

560
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:37,545
It just asks, when we
use certain notions,

561
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:40,376
when we do certain acts,
and so on,

562
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:43,975
what is the implicit
horizon of understanding?

563
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:46,987
It doesn't ask these
stupid ideal questions:

564
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:48,454
"Is there truth?"

565
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:49,785
No. The question is,

566
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:53,055
"What do you mean
when you say this is true?"

567
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:56,063
So you can see, it's a very
modest thing, philosophy.

568
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:57,894
Philosophers are not the madmen

569
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,400
who search for some eternal truth.

570
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:34,094
What we encounter here, I think,

571
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:37,900
is precisely Lacan's reversal

572
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:40,168
of the famous Dostoyevsky model,

573
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:43,109
"If God doesn't exist,
everything is permitted.

574
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:46,943
If God doesn't exist,
everything is prohibited."

575
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:49,483
How? On the one hand,

576
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:51,951
again, you are allowed

577
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:54,522
to have a full life
of happiness and pleasure,

578
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:57,183
but in order, precisely,
to be happy,

579
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,284
you should avoid
dangerous excesses.

580
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,920
So at the end,
everything is prohibited.

581
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:03,794
You cannot eat fat,
you cannot have coffee,

582
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,367
you cannot have nothing
precisely in order to enjoy.

583
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:10,495
So today's hedonism combines
pleasure with constraint.

584
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,665
It is no longer the old notion

585
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:15,903
of the right measure
between pleasure and constraint.

586
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,912
Like sex, yes,
but not too much.

587
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,038
Proper measure.

588
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:22,674
No, it's something
much more paradoxical.

589
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:24,685
It's a kind of immediate
coincidence

590
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:26,220
of the two extremes,

591
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:31,692
like... as if action
and reaction coincide.

592
00:34:31,794 --> 00:34:34,319
The very thing
which causes damage

593
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,866
should already be
the counter-agent,

594
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,025
the medicine.

595
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:40,362
The ultimate example

596
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,232
I encountered recently
in California...

597
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:45,136
I don't know if you can buy it
also here in New York...

598
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:47,072
is chocolate laxative.

599
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:49,804
And there it says
as a propaganda,

600
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:51,777
"Do you have still constipation?

601
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,873
Eat more of this chocolate."

602
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:58,044
The thing is already
its own counter-agent.

603
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:00,018
And the negative proof

604
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:02,147
of the calamity
of this stance, I think,

605
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:04,385
is the fact that today,

606
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,552
the true unconstrained
consumption

607
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:08,323
in all its main forms...

608
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,694
drugs, free sex, smoking...

609
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:13,495
is emerging as the main danger.

610
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,945
The traditional notion
of psychoanalysis

611
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:05,418
is that, because of some
inner obstacles...

612
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:08,718
you internalized,
identified excessively

613
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:11,384
with paternal or other
social prohibitions...

614
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:15,327
you cannot set yourself
free to enjoy, to...

615
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:17,558
Pleasure is not accessible for you.

616
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,396
It is accessible to you
only in pathological forms,

617
00:36:20,502 --> 00:36:22,527
of feeling guilty and so on.

618
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,935
So, then, the idea is,

619
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,472
psychoanalysis allows you

620
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:28,941
to suspend, overcome
this internalized prohibitions

621
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:32,172
so that it enables you
to enjoy.

622
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,441
The problem today

623
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:38,111
is that the commandment
of the ruling ideologies

624
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,778
enjoy in different ways.

625
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:42,220
It can be sex and enjoyment,

626
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,656
consumption, commodity enjoyment,

627
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,524
up to spiritual enjoyment,
realize yourself, whatever.

628
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:50,097
And I think
that the problem today

629
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:53,168
is not how to get rid
of your inhibitions

630
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:56,237
and to be able
to spontaneously enjoy.

631
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:00,172
The problem is how to get rid
of this injunction to enjoy.

632
00:37:00,275 --> 00:37:01,606
<i>Organizations,</i>

633

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:18,492
<i>and disturbed adult behavior</i>

640
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,824
<i>has been clearly traced
by such authorities</i>

641
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,794
<i>as Dr. Rene Spitz of New York.</i>

642
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:25,992
<i>Distressing experiences
in childhood</i>

643
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,966
<i>may set up patterns</i>

644
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,530
<i>which in later life
will produce mental conflicts.</i>

645
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:38,136
<i>Such conflicts lead to the same
feelings of insecurity</i>

646
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,112
<i>which was felt as a child.</i>

647
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:43,844
<i>When such conflicts
paralyze the individual,</i>

648
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:47,388
<i>preventing him
from acting freely,</i>

649
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,390
<i>he is said to have a neurosis.</i>

650
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:55,293
<i>Let us see
how a neurosis develops.</i>

651
00:37:57,966 --> 00:37:59,661
<i>My eternal fear</i>

652
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:01,258
<i>is that if,
for a brief moment,</i>

653
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,632
<i>I stopped talking,</i>

654
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:06,105
<i>you know, the whole
spectacular appearance</i>

655
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,334
<i>would disintegrate.</i>

656
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,138
<i>People would think
there is nobody</i>

657
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,506
<i>and nothing there.</i>

658
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,170
<i>This is my fear,</i>

659
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:15,808
<i>as if I am nothing
who pretends all the time</i>

660
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,249
<i>to be somebody,</i>

661
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,651
<i>and has to be hyperactive
all the time,</i>

662
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:24,385
<i>just to fascinate people enough</i>

663
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:27,758
<i>so that they don't notice
that there is nothing.</i>

664
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,970
Well?

665
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:39,268
- Okay. You also, you also.
- Go ahead.

666
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:41,808
One of the big reproaches
to psychoanalysis

667
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,437
is that it's only a theory

668
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:48,448
of individual pathological
disturbances,

669
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,383
and that applying psychoanalysis

670
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:54,513
to other cultural
or social phenomena

671
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,057
is theoretically illegitimate.

672
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:03,631
It asks in what way
you as an individual

673
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:06,394
have to relate
to social field,

674
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:08,265
not just in the sense
of other people,

675
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,363
but in the sense
of the anonymous social as such

676
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,567
to exist as a person.

677
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:17,406
You are, under quotation marks,

678
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:19,606
normal individual person

679
00:39:19,715 --> 00:39:25,153
only being able to relate
to some anonymous social field.

680
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:30,155
What is to be interpreted
and whatnot

681
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:32,352
is that everything
is to be interpreted.

682
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,758
That is to say

683
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:36,695
<i>when Freud says,
"Unbehagen in der Kultur"...</i>

684
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:38,698
civilization and its discontent,

685
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,258
or more literally,
the uneasiness in culture...

686
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:45,966
he means that it's not just
that most of us, as normal,

687
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:47,507
we socialize ourself normally.

688
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:50,043
Some idiots didn't make it.
They fall out.

689
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,772
Oh, they have to be normalized.

690
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,279
Culture as such,

691
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:56,943
in order to establish
itself as normal,

692
00:39:57,052 --> 00:40:01,148
what appears as normal

693
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:03,281
involves a whole series

694
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:06,293
of pathological cuts,
distortions, and so on and so on.

695
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:10,354
There is, again,
a kind of a "Unbehagen,"

696
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:11,591
uneasiness:

697
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,759
We are out of joint,
not at home

698
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,427
in culture as such,

699
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:16,936
which means, again,

700
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,440
that there is no normal culture.

701
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:23,841
Culture as such
has to be interpreted.

702
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:14,692
When people ask me

703
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:16,593
why do I combine
Lacan with Marx,

704
00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:19,428
my first answer is,
"Lacan already did it."

705
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:20,796
I think, for example,

706
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:22,460
that it's only through

707
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:25,972
the strict psychoanalytic
Lacanian notion of fantasy

708
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:29,475
that we can really grasp
what Marx was aiming at

709
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:32,069
with his notion
of commodity fetishism.

710
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,775
It's, I think, precisely
the use of Lacanian notions

711
00:41:35,884 --> 00:41:38,079
like, again, fantasy...

712
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:41,383
fantasy in the strict
Lacanian sense,

713
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,653
or excess "plus de joie,"
excess enjoyment,

714
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,886
and so on and so on.

715
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:47,894
The real...
not to mention the real...

716
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:51,523
that we can understand
today's phenomena,

717
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,694
like new fundamentalist
forms of racism,

718
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,262
like the way our so-called
permissive societies

719
00:41:59,374 --> 00:42:00,432
are functioning.

720
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:03,375
Again, here,
the psychoanalytic notion,

721
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,036
especially the way

722
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,672
it was conceptualized
by Lacan.

723
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:09,580
The psychoanalytic notion
of superego

724
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:13,621
as injunction to enjoy
as an obscene category,

725
00:42:13,722 --> 00:42:15,622
not as a properly
ethical category,

726
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:17,589
is of great help.

727
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:20,560
So again, I think
that if Freud,

728
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:23,597
in his Freudian theory

729
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:26,691
in its traditional configuration,

730
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:31,432
was appropriate to explain
the standard capitalism

731
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:37,001
which relied to some kind
of a more traditional ethic

732
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:39,637
of sexual control,
repression, and so on,

733
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:42,945
then Lacan is perfect to explain

734
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:47,215
the paradoxes of permissive
late capitalism.

735
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:56,882
When did you have the last meal...

736
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:58,425
breakfast... or down there?

737
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:00,654
Down there.
We should probably...

738
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:02,662
No, no, I mean, one,
two hours later,

739
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,231
we should maybe go down there.

740
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,526
Or do you know any...

741
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,102
At the place
where you had your coffee,

742
00:44:08,203 --> 00:44:10,228
they do have good menus,
you know,

743
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:13,330
like very nice ones,
like simple steak or whatever.

744
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,535
- They are not bad.
- They are all vegetarian.

745
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:16,804
Sorry?

746
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:18,470
Degenerate.

747
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,138
You'll turn into monkeys.

748
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:22,113
There is a table free here

749
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:24,742
if you want to be
absolutely opportunist.

750
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:26,252
Aqua Congas.

751
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:28,151
- Aqua Congas?
- Yeah.

752
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:29,223
Why shouldn't I order?

753
00:44:29,324 --> 00:44:30,814
Could you put it there?
Thank you.

754
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:32,257
No, I mean, where to put it.

755
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,918
- You want to show it?
- Yeah.

756
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:35,326
Why do you want to...

757
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,024
Why did you say it was
a fundamental misunderstanding

758
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,794
that so many people came?

759
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:41,334
No, in the simple sense

760
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:43,961
that I have this terrible feeling

761
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,700
that they expect something
which they will not get,

762
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:48,275
and I wonder what.

763
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:51,345
Many leftists expect
the formula, you know:

764
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:53,437
I will teach them what to do.

765
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:55,072
Shit, what do I know?

766
00:44:55,183 --> 00:44:56,445
Some people expect...

767
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,315
You feel like that's what
that audience was looking for.

768
00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:00,513
- Specifically?
- No.

769
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:02,681
It's a simple
common sense insight:

770
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,157
Wait a minute. 2,000 people...

771
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,557
although I think
they exaggerated...

772
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,425
whatever, thousand people
cannot all have

773
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:12,261
the same interest in Lacan
as I do, no?

774
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:16,731
- Can I ask you a simple question?
- What?

775
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:18,328
If you were to have a daughter,

776
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,841
would you allow this guy
to take your daughter to cinema?

777
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:24,377
Be honest.
The answer is, no.

778
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,105
I hate the way I appear.

779
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:30,241
In some documents,
it's even worse.

780
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,979
It's really as a kind
of a criminal

781
00:45:32,087 --> 00:45:33,349
that I appear, you know.

782
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:35,946
You think they were expecting

783
00:45:36,057 --> 00:45:38,321
just a sort of political advisor?

784
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:41,224
No, the problem is,
whenever I talk about politics,

785
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:43,889
- I feel it as if it's a fake.
- What?

786
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:45,967
Not in the sense
that I'm faking,

787
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,329
that I don't mean it,

788
00:45:47,435 --> 00:45:49,733
but my heart is not in it.

789
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:52,033
The book that I really
enjoyed writing

790
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,574
was the one on Hegel...
sorry, on Schelling.

791
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:56,439
- "Ticklish Subjects."
- Right.

792
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,070
And that part of the message
doesn't get through.

793
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,013
You can immediately see also
in the way it...

794
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:04,278
For example, of my last books,

795
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,219
the one that I really loved,
"The Opera's Second Death."

796
00:46:07,322 --> 00:46:10,189
That one is doing
very modestly, nothing.

797
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:12,556
But that's what I love.

798
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,754
No, we didn't yet, no?

799
00:46:14,863 --> 00:46:16,296
I'll tell you...
Wait a minute.

800
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,797
Is this just drinks?

801
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,226
First you should look here,
the Venice.

802
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:24,271
You have calarinas,
filet Milanese,

803
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:26,704
ensalada csar.

804
00:46:35,283 --> 00:46:37,251
This is just for people
who come to be shocked

805
00:46:37,352 --> 00:46:38,819
and hopefully to get out.

806
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,148
So that is why you have it?

807
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,847
So when people open the door,
they go...

808
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:45,484
Yeah, there is a small hope
that I will get rid of them.

809
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,822
That's the only fun.

810
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:48,190
Has it ever worked?

811
00:46:48,296 --> 00:46:49,285
- Yeah.
- Really?

812
00:46:49,397 --> 00:46:50,830
As a matter of fact, yeah.

813
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:52,524
Some people
were actually offended.

814
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:56,195
My big worry is not to be ignored,

815
00:46:56,304 --> 00:46:58,033
but to be accepted.

816
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:00,664
When I appear to be sarcastic,

817
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:03,073
the point is not
to take seriously.

818
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:04,702
What is not to be
taken seriously

819
00:47:04,813 --> 00:47:06,337
is the very form of sarcasm.

820
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,507
It's the form of the joke

821
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,380
which masks the effect
that I'm serious.

822
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:12,248
But people still have this idea

823
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:15,084
that this guy did some big crimes.

824
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,122
No.

825
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:18,385
Of course it's not
as simple as that

826
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:20,358
that I'm simply a Stalinist.

827
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,487
It would be crazy,
tasteless, and so on.

828
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:24,758
But...

829
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:29,769
obviously, there is
something in it

830
00:47:29,871 --> 00:47:31,896
that it's not simply a joke.

831
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:33,531
When I say the only chance

832
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,509
that the left appropriate fascism,

833
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,703
it's not a cheap joke.

834
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:41,407
The point is to avoid the trap

835
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:43,484
of the standard
liberal oppositions:

836
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:45,348
Freedom versus
totalitarian order,

837
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:46,852
discipline, and so on,

838
00:47:46,955 --> 00:47:49,549
to rehabilitate
notions of discipline,

839
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,718
collective order, subordination,
sacrifice, all that.

840
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:55,455
I don't think
this is inherently fascist.

841
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:08,138
Often, friends tell me,

842
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:11,076
"But why do you provoke
people unnecessarily?

843
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,079
Why don't you simply
say what you mean,

844
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,445
that, of course,
you are against fascism?"

845
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:18,676
I tell them,
"Yes, this is good

846
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:21,517
as an abstract theoretical"...

847
00:48:21,623 --> 00:48:22,647
not even theoretical...

848
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:24,281
intellectual, whatever, statement.

849
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:26,189
But it doesn't work like that.

850
00:48:26,294 --> 00:48:28,524
For example,
concerning Stalinism,

851
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,396
my God, I've probably
written more about Stalinism,

852
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,900
about its most horrible
aspects,

853
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:37,995
than most of the people
who reproach me with Stalinism.

854
00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:39,733
And that's my wager here,

855
00:48:39,841 --> 00:48:42,776
that sorry, the only way
to get the message

856
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:45,846
If you say, "Of course
I'm against fascism.

857
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:48,575
There are just some attitudes

858
00:48:48,683 --> 00:48:50,480
which were traditional
even more to the left,

859
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:53,179
but fascism appropriated them,"

860
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:55,017
I think it doesn't have

861
00:48:55,123 --> 00:48:57,614
the desired precise
political effect.

862
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:02,595
It enables the liberal consensus
to reappropriate it.

863
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:05,666
You must say it
with this excess.

864
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:51,076
One hour be enough,
or you need more?

865
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:21,574
These are, of course, again,
the Lufthansa socks.

866
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:23,667
I stole two of them today.

867
00:50:23,778 --> 00:50:25,541
I went to wash my hair,

868
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,706
and then I was
in an intense situation,

869
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,046
and then the woman hairdresser
notice it,

870
00:50:30,151 --> 00:50:33,484
and told me, "Why don't I
give you a massage with some oil?"

871
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:35,886
I enjoyed it,
but I felt so obscene,

872
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,254
as if I paid for masturbation.

873
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:42,489
- Masturbating is so obscene.
- It is a little bit.

874
00:50:42,597 --> 00:50:44,030
But it was relaxing. It is nice.

875
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:45,599
- Really?
- But it's too much.

876
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,299
My God, where are you?

877
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:52,202
This reminds me of socialism,

878
00:50:52,307 --> 00:50:55,834
carrying water
in plastic bottle.

879
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:29,968
Really?

880
00:51:30,078 --> 00:51:31,375
Yeah, because they were
waiting for us.

881
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:32,707
You see? We were not late.

882
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:34,281
I realize it,
because you're not here.

883
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,373
But they wait for us,
you see?

884
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:39,009
Yeah, they didn't
start without you.

885
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,145
They were waiting for us.

886
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,753
Let's start as soon as possible.

887
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:46,326
Let's go in.

888
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,431
The majority of academics

889
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:54,762
who are obsessed
with this idea

890
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:56,803
"The left needs a new answer":

891
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,463
Isn't it basically

892
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,768
"We want a radical revolution,

893
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,137
but at the same time,

894
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:05,474
we want our relatively
prosperous lives

895
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,979
to go on undisturbed"?

896
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:10,141
Like precisely as already
Robespierre said,

897
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,685
"We want revolution
without revolution."

898
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:15,550
There is, I notice,

899
00:52:15,657 --> 00:52:16,885
a fundamental difference between

900
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:19,926
the standard plurality
of struggles

901
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:20,995
which progressive liberals...

902
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:22,153
What does it mean?

903
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:23,958
Isn't it in a way false

904
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:28,092
even to expect such a clear
political formula

905
00:52:28,202 --> 00:52:30,693
in the sense of "All we need
is a bright intellectual

906
00:52:30,805 --> 00:52:32,466
to tell us what to do,

907
00:52:32,573 --> 00:52:34,541
and then capitalism
will be over,

908
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:36,109
we'll have socialism," and so on?

909
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,007
I'm too stupid.
I don't understand.

910
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:40,672
- I'm sorry.
- I really wanted you to read this.

911
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,306
Thank you very much.

912
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,908
Again, I have to accept this,

913
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:48,580
again, almost Lacanian
decenterment of subjectivity,

914
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,954
which is that
"I stand for something,

915
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:54,460
but I don't really master...
dominate what I stand for."

916
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:56,359
People see things in me.

917
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,954
They have some expectations.

918
00:52:58,066 --> 00:53:00,500
There may be political
expectations

919
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:02,228
that I will provide the formula,

920
00:53:02,337 --> 00:53:05,033
the big question that everybody's
expecting today

921
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:06,265
from a leftist intellectual...

922
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:07,363
"What should we do?"...

923
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,636
or some kind
of spiritual guidance

924
00:53:09,744 --> 00:53:11,769
to help them psychologically,

925
00:53:11,879 --> 00:53:13,437
or theoretical amusement

926
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:17,352
in the sense of many dirty jokes
or examples from movies.

927
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:19,411
And I honestly accept that.

928
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,011
I think that my reaction
to this

929
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:25,388
should be not so much
"It's all a big misunderstanding,

930
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,892
they're missing my big point,"

931
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,520
but my duty's basically

932
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,691
to try and occupy the position
of the analyst,

933
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:36,395
which is basically to play,

934
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,802
in a way of transference,
with these expectations,

935
00:53:38,906 --> 00:53:41,272
and to undermine,
frustrate them,

936
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:42,741
to make it clear to them

937
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,109
that the question is not
what I can give them,

938
00:53:46,214 --> 00:53:49,206
but are these expectations
legitimate?

939
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:53,413
What this expectation should
tell them about themselves.

940
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,457
It was usually
that big progressive act

941
00:53:57,558 --> 00:53:59,617
was like it was Nixon,
not Democrats,

942
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:01,024
who had to do it with China.

943
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:03,791
This paradox...
It was in France.

944
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:06,230
It was de Gaulle,
not socialists, who...

945
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:07,926
- Got out of Algeria.
- Sorry?

946
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:12,939
Algeria, yes.
But I'm a little bit skeptical...

947
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,236
You really are an intellectual
superstar to me,

948
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:16,537
so I had to touch you.

949
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:17,702
Sorry, sorry. Interrupting.

950
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:19,609
I'm the editor of #Progress.#

951
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,045
- Of?
- "Progress,"

952
00:54:21,149 --> 00:54:23,709
journal of socialist ideas.
Harvard will know it.

953
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:25,979
- I brought you a copy.
- Perfect.

954
00:54:26,087 --> 00:54:29,420
- I was really impressed.
- Be serious. I was bluffing.

955
00:54:29,524 --> 00:54:31,458
He needs a shower.

956
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,158
It was over there.

957
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:45,497
Who knows here?
The guy knows.

958
00:54:45,606 --> 00:54:47,301
I'm sorry.
You know things here.

959
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,506
Okay, sir, you know the guy
who did "The Hero,"

960
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,512
the Chinese guy?

961
00:54:53,614 --> 00:54:59,211
"Double Indemnity" is not
on the market now, no?

962
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,414
"Being There" also, I think,
it looks bad, no?

963
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:04,855
"Being There," you know,
Peter Sellers.

964
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,017
It should be...

965
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:07,651
Hal Ashby.

966
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,322
No, this is
too intelligent for me.

967
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:12,661
You know the ape
will not get the banana.

968
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,531
Fuck it, I don't get it here.

969
00:55:15,636 --> 00:55:18,605
Ah. U.S. '70s. "Being There."

970
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,069
It's a wonderful movie,

971
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:24,439
and look, my anal character.

972
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:26,945
The price is okay,
so definitely.

973
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,049
What more do I need?

974
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:33,450
"Fountainhead" is the best
American movie of all times.

975
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:37,115
Then the best German movie

976
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:39,921
would be "Opfergang."

977
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:43,861
This is the sacrificial path,
of course,

978
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,627
from '44, by Veit Harlan,
the Nazi director.

979
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:48,725
So we have Ayn Rand, a Nazi,

980
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:52,135
and then... unfortunately,
this is a more standard one...

981
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,107
it is "lvan the Terrible,"
Eisenstein.

982
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:56,335
I would say these three

983
00:55:56,444 --> 00:55:58,309
are the best movies
of all times for me.

984
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:01,973
Ah, this one I want,
definitely.

985
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,779
So we have these two.

986
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:07,354
That will be it, I think.

987
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:09,116
How about if I buy them
for you?

988
00:56:09,223 --> 00:56:10,520
No, wait a minute.

989
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,286
Poor American girl,
working class.

990
00:56:12,393 --> 00:56:14,190
Who pays for that?
Are you serious?

991
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:15,922
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I will reimburse.

992
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,861
- Okay, with pleasure.
- I'll let you buy...

993
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:20,456
No, let it be the eternal
secret of my desire.

994
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:23,662
Did I suspect this
in advance or not?

995
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:27,207
If you were not
to make this offer,

996
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:29,970
I would in the last minute
say, "Maybe not now.

997
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:31,374
I have too many things to carry."

998
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:34,380
This one is a little
expensive, actually: $32.

999
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:36,848
Shut up, or you will
get three more.

1000
00:56:36,951 --> 00:56:39,385
I'm so sad that l...
Wait a minute.

1001
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:40,784
What is this?

1002
00:56:40,888 --> 00:56:43,618
My God, I would love to have
so that you will not...

1003
00:56:43,724 --> 00:56:46,454
- Let me buy this...
- It's got a special booklet.

1004
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:48,119
Where? Which one?

1005
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:50,891
Sorry, can I buy this one also?

1006
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:09,646
Oh, sorry. Fuck off.

1007
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:12,613
What are you working on
now, Slavoj?

1008
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,278
What's the new book?

1009
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:17,789
The mega... basically,
"Ticklish Subject, Part 2."

1010
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,655
Big, big mega thing.

1011
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,489
How far along are you?

1012
00:57:21,596 --> 00:57:23,689
Pretty close to the end.

1013
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:25,265
It will be mega.

1014
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:28,164
One part philosophy, theology,

1015
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,727
one part cognitivism...
I'm now deep in brain sciences...

1016
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,536
and one part obscenity,
politics, and so on.

1017
00:57:35,643 --> 00:57:37,668
- What's it gonna be called?
- I don't yet know.

1018
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:39,439
Maybe "The Parallax View,"

1019
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:40,775
but I must check it
on amazon. Com,

1020
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:43,281
see if there are already
20 books

1021
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:45,716
named "The Parallax View," no?

1022
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,651
I must look into that aspect.

1023
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,120
What does parallax view mean?

1024
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:50,986
It's very simple.

1025
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,289
It comes as close as possible
to what my position is.

1026
00:57:54,395 --> 00:57:57,091
You know that...
It's very simple.

1027
00:57:57,198 --> 00:58:01,760
When you mistake
an apparent move...

1028
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:03,131
You look at an object.

1029
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:05,865
It appears that the object itself
moves or changes,

1030
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:09,602
but in reality, it's just
that your perspective shifts, no?

1031
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:14,477
Like lunar, stellar,
whatever, solar, parallax.

1032
00:58:14,582 --> 00:58:18,916
The idea is, your shift in your
subjective position is refined.

1033
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,011
You perceive it
as move in the object.

1034
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,215
But, of course,
then I add another twist

1035
00:58:23,324 --> 00:58:26,020
that it is in the object
in a way,

1036
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,992
because object-subject
can be mediated.

1037
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:31,929
So what interests me
is precisely this radical cut,

1038
00:58:32,033 --> 00:58:34,831
like you move from one
to another perspective.

1039
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:39,497
There is no way
to overcome this antinomy.

1040
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:43,099
And then I develop this
systematically

1041
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:44,268
in philosophy,
cognitive science.

1042
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:46,778
In cognitive sciences,
the parallax would have been

1043
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:49,315
either you look
at your inner experience,

1044
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,180
or you open the scar,

1045
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:53,344
you see the stupid
there, brains, no?

1046
00:58:53,454 --> 00:58:55,854
But you really cannot
make the jump,

1047
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:57,446
and you really cannot...

1048
00:58:57,558 --> 00:58:59,617
Even if scientifically
you can explain it,

1049
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:03,288
you really cannot accept
that stupid piece of meat

1050
00:59:03,397 --> 00:59:04,762
that you see.
That's thought.

1051
00:59:04,865 --> 00:59:07,857
So if we distilled
your canon into three books,

1052
00:59:07,968 --> 00:59:09,833
what would they be?

1053
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:11,837
Three of my best books

1054
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,169
are unfortunately four,
I would say.

1055
00:59:14,275 --> 00:59:16,470
"Sublime Object,"
"Tearing with the Negative,"

1056
00:59:16,577 --> 00:59:18,670
"Ticklish Subject,"
and now the new one.

1057
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:20,770
This is the serious
work I've done,

1058
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:22,746
with little pieces
here and there.

1059
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,114
But this is what I would...

1060
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:27,813
although I'm more and more
self-critical of the first one.

1061
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:29,219
It's still too liberal.

1062
00:59:29,323 --> 00:59:32,417
I'm for democracy there.
I'm ashamed, I'm very sorry to say.

1063
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:35,051
I think there was a thing
called totalitarianism,

1064
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:36,356
which was bad,

1065
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:38,932
and I think there should
be pluralism in society.

1066
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,297
My God, what am I talking there?

1067
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:42,562
You know that Marx Brothers joke

1068
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:44,661
"I would never be a member
of a club..."?

1069
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:47,900
You know, if I were not myself,
I would arrest myself.

1070
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:29,044
I have a very complicated ritual
about writing.

1071
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,951
It's psychologically
impossible for me to sit down,

1072
01:00:34,054 --> 01:00:36,181
so I have to trick myself.

1073
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,417
I operate a very simple strategy

1074
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:40,050
which, at least with me,
it works.

1075
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:42,322
I put down ideas,

1076
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,763
but I put them down usually
in a relatively elaborate way,

1077
01:00:45,866 --> 01:00:48,733
like the line of thought already
written in full sentences.

1078
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:50,895
So up to a certain point,

1079
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:53,633
I'm telling myself, "No,
I'm not yet writing.

1080
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:55,470
I'm just putting down ideas."

1081
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:57,168
Then, at a certain point,

1082
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,042
I tell myself, "Everything
is already there.

1083
01:01:00,147 --> 01:01:01,910
Now I just have to edit it."

1084
01:01:02,016 --> 01:01:04,450
So that's the idea,
to split it into two.

1085
01:01:04,552 --> 01:01:06,486
I put down notes, I edit it.

1086
01:01:06,587 --> 01:01:08,578
Writing disappears.

1087
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,154
I'm sorry. Please.

1088
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,386
Just be loud enough.

1089
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,329
Good question,
but not in the sense

1090
01:01:25,439 --> 01:01:28,067
that now I will say,
"I'm modest, so nice."

1091
01:01:28,175 --> 01:01:30,166
No, it's much more serious
phenomenon.

1092
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:31,437
Let's be quite frank.

1093
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,673
At a certain superficial level,
I am relatively popular,

1094
01:01:34,782 --> 01:01:36,374
but me and my friends,

1095
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,044
I don't think you can...
maybe you can...

1096
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:44,090
even imagine how noninfluential
are we within the academia,

1097
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:46,159
which is why
it pisses me off

1098
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,627
how many, whoever they are...

1099
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:51,391
the enemies...

1100
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,729
portray us Lacanians

1101
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:56,598
as some kind of a phalogocentric
power discourse.

1102
01:01:56,704 --> 01:01:59,002
It's very fashionable
to paint us

1103
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:02,701
as kind of a dogmatic
power discourse.

1104
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,005
For example, yesterday,
when I delivered

1105
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:07,205
a differently improvised version
of the same talk

1106
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:08,474
at Columbia in New York,

1107
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:11,949
a lady kindly towards the end
asked me "But why"...

1108
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:15,283
Her problem was, why am I
so dogmatically Lacanian.

1109
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,531
Which belief?

1110
01:02:39,613 --> 01:02:40,705
Perfect.

1111
01:02:42,016 --> 01:02:43,347
Perfect question.

1112
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,145
Okay, I defy you

1113
01:02:45,252 --> 01:02:47,652
with a very simple empirical,

1114
01:02:47,755 --> 01:02:50,280
in the best Anglo-Saxon
tradition, question.

1115
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,552
Apart from this brief conflict

1116
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,026
between Gayatri Spivak
and Derrida,

1117
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:57,188
could you name me one Derridian

1118
01:02:57,298 --> 01:03:01,029
who made a small critical
remark on Derrida?

1119
01:03:01,135 --> 01:03:02,830
Rudolph Gasche? Avital Ronell?

1120
01:03:02,937 --> 01:03:04,928
Name somewhere,
but name me one.

1121
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,736
Why are we dogmatic?
Why are they not?

1122
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:11,538
Name me one point

1123
01:03:11,645 --> 01:03:16,173
where Sam Weber makes an ironic critical
remark on Derrida.

1124
01:03:16,283 --> 01:03:18,683
Name me one point
where Avital Ronell does it.

1125
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:21,346
Name me one point
where Rudolph Gasche does it.

1126
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:24,151
So why are we...
Why is my...

1127
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:28,490
Why am I dogmatically attached
to Lacan, and it's not...

1128
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,689
Why did you think
this is disavowed belief?

1129
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:32,857
I am a Lacanian.

1130
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:34,764
You are knocking
on the open door.

1131
01:03:34,868 --> 01:03:39,134
You don't have to prove
to some deconstructive analysis,

1132
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,706
"But he's a Lacanian."

1133
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:43,402
I am a card-carrying Lacanian.

1134
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,978
Something is going on here,

1135
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,378
and I just wanted to draw
the attention to this,

1136
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:49,710
how all this popular,

1137
01:03:49,817 --> 01:03:52,911
and I think so to give you now
the true answer.

1138
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,920
I think that I admit it.

1139
01:03:55,022 --> 01:03:57,388
There is a clownish
aspect to me,

1140
01:03:57,491 --> 01:03:59,186
like they put it
in "New York Times,"

1141
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,692
Marx Brother, or whatever.

1142
01:04:00,794 --> 01:04:03,957
All that, I maybe
flirt with it.

1143
01:04:04,064 --> 01:04:06,396
But nonetheless,
I'm getting tired of it,

1144
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,435
because I notice
that there is, as it were,

1145
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:12,471
when there are some stupid
reports on me, reactions to me,

1146
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,974
a kind of a terrible urge,
comparison,

1147
01:04:16,076 --> 01:04:19,978
to make me appear
as a kind of a funny man.

1148
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,548
And the true question would be,

1149
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,244
where does this urge come from?

1150
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:27,877
Why is there this necessity
to portray me

1151
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:30,616
as somebody who can
only thrive through jokes?

1152
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:34,289
And even my publishers buy it.

1153
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:37,489
You know that my Lenin book...
introduction of Lenin's...

1154
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:39,759
was almost turned down by Verso?

1155
01:04:39,867 --> 01:04:41,027
Why?

1156
01:04:41,135 --> 01:04:44,263
First, they always, at Verso,
gave kinks at me...

1157
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,134
"Oh, you are just making jokes,"

1158
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,640
then I told them, "Okay, now you
have a book, Lenin's text,"

1159
01:04:48,742 --> 01:04:51,006
Their reproach was,
"Where are the jokes?

1160
01:04:51,111 --> 01:04:52,840
Nobody will buy the book."

1161
01:04:52,946 --> 01:04:56,382
So, you know, much more
than it may appear

1162
01:04:56,483 --> 01:04:57,950
is going on here.

1163
01:04:58,052 --> 01:04:59,986
It's quite a complex phenomenon.

1164
01:05:02,022 --> 01:05:05,116
I'm almost tempted to say
that making me popular

1165
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:08,683
is a resistance against
taking me serious.

1166
01:05:08,796 --> 01:05:12,095
And I think it's my duty,
for this reason,

1167
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,463
to do a kind
of a public suicide

1168
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:18,902
of myself as a popular comedian
or whatever.

1169
01:05:26,747 --> 01:05:29,181
Let's hope we can enter here.

1170
01:05:29,283 --> 01:05:30,648
I don't know how this
functions now.

1171
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:32,309
This is it.

1172
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:37,056
Here you should do
your Hitchcockian shot

1173
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:38,317
like from "Vertigo."

1174
01:05:38,425 --> 01:05:41,326
I saw two, three times
that I came here,

1175
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:43,692
because when it was still open,

1176
01:05:43,797 --> 01:05:45,765
you took there
the elevator to the top.

1177
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:48,664
And often I saw here

1178
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:50,703
some policemen
are cordoned off,

1179
01:05:50,804 --> 01:05:52,999
and an object here, covered.

1180
01:05:53,107 --> 01:05:55,302
Because you will immediately
see what l...

1181
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,742
if you take the shot up.

1182
01:05:58,846 --> 01:05:59,904
That's it.

1183
01:06:00,013 --> 01:06:02,811
From up there, it was practical
to jump down, no?

1184
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:04,679
Go up, you jump down,

1185
01:06:04,785 --> 01:06:08,516
and it's kind of a nice,
modest, ethical suicide.

1186
01:06:08,622 --> 01:06:09,748
It's not this spectacle

1187
01:06:09,857 --> 01:06:12,587
that on the street,
you embarrass other people.

1188
01:06:12,693 --> 01:06:14,854
You go here, and you jump down.

1189
01:06:14,962 --> 01:06:17,055
Of course, my idea
was to organize this.

1190
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:19,394
You want to kill yourself.
We organize it.

1191
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,991
We prevent so that
we guarantee that no small...

1192
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:24,593
$5.00, no small children
will be here.

1193
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:26,570
I even have the idea that,
the way they do it

1194
01:06:26,673 --> 01:06:31,133
in this society of biopolitics,
as Foucault would have put it,

1195
01:06:31,245 --> 01:06:33,213
where they ask you...

1196
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:34,837
In order to get married:

1197
01:06:34,948 --> 01:06:37,746
You don't have AIDS,
you're mentally stable.

1198
01:06:37,851 --> 01:06:38,977
Obviously, doesn't work,

1199
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:40,348
because if it were to work,

1200
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,115
I would never be allowed
to get married.

1201
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:44,713
But they should do it the same

1202
01:06:44,825 --> 01:06:46,725
like if you want
to kill yourself, no?

1203
01:06:46,827 --> 01:06:48,124
I was thinking about it.

1204
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:49,490
I think that only people...

1205
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:51,325
some medical...

1206
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:55,765
or psychiatric
advisory committee, team,

1207
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:59,965
should decide is it a case
of a true metaphysical suicide,

1208
01:07:00,073 --> 01:07:01,404
or just a short crisis,

1209
01:07:01,508 --> 01:07:04,909
like you were just dropped
by your girlfriend or boyfriend,

1210
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:07,071
and there is a reasonable hope

1211
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:09,308
that it's a momentary depression,

1212
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,043
then, in two or three weeks,
it will be over.

1213
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:13,016
So it can be medical crisis.

1214
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,951
It can be this kind
of psychological crisis,

1215
01:07:15,055 --> 01:07:18,513
or pure metaphysical suicide.

1216
01:09:06,667 --> 01:09:08,100
As a Marxist,

1217
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:10,328
if somebody tells me
that Lacan is difficult,

1218
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:13,463
this is class propaganda
by the enemy.

1219
01:09:18,078 --> 01:09:20,638
I never thought I'd have
this much fun talking about this.

1220
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:22,442
- Thank you.
- Have a great weekend. Take care.
