1
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,667
I got the strangler!

2
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,669
Wabash and Van Buren!

3
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,189
Oh, shit.

4
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:17,835
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:20,371
Jack, get the van.

6
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:21,773
Eddie, help me!

7
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:26,280
Eddie, don't leave me!
God, no!

8
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:45,166
Give it up, Ray!
It's over!

9
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,749
Oh, God, I'm dying.

10
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:15,052
You hear this,
you son of a bitch?

11
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,527
I'm gonna get you for it!

12
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,321
I'm gonna get you...

13
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,423
and I'm gonna get Eddie...

14
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:28,231
no matter what!

15
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:44,816
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:55,290
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

17
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,843
Give me the power,
I beg of you!

18
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:28,509
I have no friends.
No one will play with me.

19
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:31,643
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

20
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,415
Hey, cheer up.

21
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:37,117
- Who are you?
- I'm a Good Guy.

22
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,557
I've just come
from the Good Guy clubhouse...

23
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:41,562
and I'll be your friend
to the end.

24
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,123
You will?
You mean you'll be my friend now?

25
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,135
Sure, I will.

26
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,137
Hidey-ho.

27
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,674
I saw this one.

28
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,155
All right, Good Guys,
that's our ''Good Guy Show'' for today...

29
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:18,527
but don't go away...

30
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:21,693
because we've got a very important
Good Guy message...

31
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:24,203
just for you.

32
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,737
Hi, Good Guys.
Boy, have I got news for you.

33
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:33,212
Now you can have your very own
Good Guy doll.

34
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,681
That's right.
You can have all the adventures...

35
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:38,776
we have on TV
in your very own home.

36
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:42,182
Good Guys say
three different sentences.

37
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,021
We even turn our heads
and blink our eyes when you talk to us.

38
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:47,356
Right, Oscar?

39
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:51,058
Hi, I'm Oscar,
and I'm your friend to the end.

40
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,758
Hidey-ho!

41
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,166
Wow!

42
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,206
Every Good Guy has a name
all his own...

43
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:02,367
so he can be
your very own best friend.

44
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:06,345
So remember to tell Mom and Dad
you want a Good Guy.

45
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,407
Perfect for birthdays
or just any old time.

46
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,749
And remember, you can buy...

47
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:16,149
all our Good Guy accessories too.

48
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,624
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

49
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,796
Brought to you exclusively
by Play Pals...

50
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,793
makers of Good Guys
and other fine toys.

51
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:28,695
Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.

52
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:35,208
Mommy, wake up!

53
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:00,301
- What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.

54
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:02,529
It's only 6:30 in the morning.

55
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:10,669
But it's a beautiful day outside.
See?

56
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:15,714
It certainly is.
How long you been up, birthday boy?

57
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,217
Since forever.

58
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,346
I made you breakfast in bed.

59
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:24,050
You did? Oh, God.

60
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,389
Well, thanks.

61
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:29,396
Well, this looks just excellent.

62
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,065
I'll tell you what.

63
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,729
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

64
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:42,599
But first I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

65
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,179
Come here. Come here.

66
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:51,216
That's one. How many years
old are you today? Two.

67
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:53,480
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

68
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:57,456
Thanks. Can we open
my presents now, Mommy?

69
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,551
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

70
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:04,793
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour...

71
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:07,528
Charles Lee Ray,
the notorious Lake Shore Strangler...

72
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:11,834
was shot and killed shortly before 3:00
a.m. this morning on Wabash Avenue.

73
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:15,235
Can I open this first, Mommy?

74
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:18,244
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

75
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,048
Okay, go ahead.

76
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,616
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

77
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,560
I think they're gonna be okay.
We'll just take them up a couple inches.

78
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,631
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

79
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,629
I know.
You want some toys, don't you?

80
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,639
Not boring old clothes.

81
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,870
Try the other one.

82
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,307
What do you think?

83
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:58,682
I want a Good Guy to go with it.

84
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:01,847
I know you do, Andy,
but I didn't know about it...

85
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:04,182
in time this month
to save up for it.

86
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,498
- Karen.
- Hi.

87
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:18,231
You know that doll you wanted
for Andy? It cost 100 bucks.

88
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,571
There was a peddler in the alley behind
the store and I think he's got one.

89
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:25,544
- Why would a peddler have a doll?
- Grab your purse. We can get a deal.

90
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,172
- I can't leave.
- Do you want it or not?

91
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:31,411
- Of course.
- Then come on.

92
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,556
There he is.

93
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,395
Okay, show her.

94
00:11:44,432 --> 00:11:46,764
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

95
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:49,563
It is.

96
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,299
- Well, I told you.
- How much do you want?

97
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,637
- Fifty bucks.
- Ten and not a penny more.

98
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:57,075
- Thirty.
- That thing is not worth thirty.

99
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,578
Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

100
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,706
- Take it.
- It's too much money.

101
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:04,307
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

102
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,047
- But we don't know if it works.
- Here you go, lady.

103
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:09,680
- May it bring you and your kid joy.
- Thank you.

104
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,554
Hold on, you!

105
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:14,389
How do we know the damn thing
isn't stolen?

106
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:17,522
- Steal this!
- Steal this yourself.

107
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:20,430
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

108
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:23,528
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

109
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:29,509
Andy's going to love it!

110
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,375
Nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

111
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,278
- Sorry. I was only gone for a minute.
- Have a heart, Criswell.

112
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,817
We were downstairs buying her little boy
a birthday present.

113
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:41,146
We have specified break times
for activities like that.

114
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:45,192
Mrs. Howe is sick and we're shorthanded
tonight. You have to fill in.

115
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:47,853
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care.

116
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:50,654
- This is an emergency.
- I'll take over for her.

117
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:54,667
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

118
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:59,400
You'll have to do it. You can take off
at 5:00 but be back at 7:00.

119
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,304
It's my son's birthday.

120
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,775
Are you happy with your job?

121
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,277
Yes, I am.

122
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,245
Then I suggest--

123
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:10,181
Chill out, would you, Walter?

124
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:13,118
- I'll take care of Andy.
- You can't do it again.

125
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,190
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

126
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,350
I can't imagine why.

127
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:31,061
- Where are you going?
- ''Good Guys'' are on TV.

128
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,333
I may have something
better for you.

129
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:34,807
What?

130
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:38,645
This isn't groceries.

131
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:55,357
A Good Guy! I knew it!

132
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:57,431
I knew you'd get me one!

133
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,124
Show me how he works.

134
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:03,463
Hi, I'm Andy.
What's your name?

135
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:08,139
Hi, I'm Chucky,
and I'm your friend to the end.

136
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,177
Hidey-ho.

137
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,448
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

138
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,540
Oh, Mom, thanks.

139
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:21,347
You're welcome, honey.

140
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:43,836
- See, that's how you build things.
- WDOL with a late-breaking report.

141
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,104
Eddie Caputo,
accomplice of Charles Lee Ray...

142
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,183
has just escaped
the Michigan Avenue Precinct.

143
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:52,617
More details to follow
on the news at 9:00 next.

144
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:59,627
Hey, Chucky,
you're not watching me.

145
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:04,165
Hey, want to play?

146
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:06,097
Time for bed, Andy.

147
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,164
Come on, Chucky. We have to
get ready to go to bed.

148
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,449
Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch...

149
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:28,716
the 9:00 news.

150
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:30,450
Sure he does.

151
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,285
Okay, kid, off we go.

152
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:37,591
Come on. There we go.

153
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,631
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

154
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:46,399
You too. Off we go.

155
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:53,543
Now it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

156
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,443
Okay? Agreed?

157
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,417
Good.

158
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,751
You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

159
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,388
Hey, Chucky,
want to see my room?

160
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:26,169
Andy, are you
brushing your teeth?

161
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:28,715
Yes, Aunt Maggie!

162
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:31,080
Good.

163
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,183
And now, Action News at 9:00.

164
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,627
In Washington today,
the mayor replied...

165
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:48,168
that he would study
the congressional findings carefully...

166
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,296
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.

167
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,398
Back to you, Steve.

168
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,409
Thank you, Terry.

169
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,207
Police have now clarified
the information...

170
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,214
regarding the escape
of Eddie Caputo.

171
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:03,375
Caputo eluded his captors...

172
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:06,715
while being transferred onto
a prison bus on his way to court.

173
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:18,265
Okay, mister, what do you
have to say about this?

174
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:21,267
- About what?
- Come on.

175
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:27,207
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

176
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,709
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

177
00:17:30,812 --> 00:17:33,337
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it...

178
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,814
when I told you
it was time to go to bed.

179
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:38,484
- I didn't do that.
- No? What did Chucky do?

180
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,384
Walk into the living room
and turn it on by himself?

181
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,548
Did you do that, Chucky?

182
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:46,286
Andy, stop it!
Under the covers! Hurry.

183
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:51,798
- But Aunt--
- Under the covers and not another word.

184
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:55,399
But I didn't put Chucky
in front of the TV.

185
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:58,666
Shh. Enough. Okay?

186
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,331
Give me a kiss.

187
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:03,467
Good night, baby,
and happy birthday.

188
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,512
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

189
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:26,700
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

190
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,648
Andy, is that you?

191
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:00,275
How did that happen?

192
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,440
Hello?

193
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,542
Hi. How's it going?
How's Andy?

194
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:09,111
- Karen?
- Who else? Is something wrong?

195
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,592
No.

196
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:16,659
Everything's fine.

197
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:19,358
You don't sound
like everything's fine.

198
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:24,131
I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies.

199
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:26,799
Now, would you
stop worrying and...

200
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,707
give Criswell
a kick in the pants for me.

201
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:32,670
You got it.

202
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:35,545
Listen. Thank you for everything.
You're a real pal.

203
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:37,811
Oh, yeah?

204
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:42,715
Yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me.
See you soon. Bye.

205
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:23,286
What is wrong with me?

206
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,797
I'm scaring myself
half to death.

207
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,727
Get away from this barricade.

208
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,801
Move it back.
There's nothing to see.

209
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:05,304
Let's move this police line back.
Go on home, folks, please.

210
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,018
She was on the sixth floor.

211
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,330
Whoa, miss!
What are you doing?

212
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:33,161
I live here.

213
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:51,080
Mommy!

214
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,812
Oh, thank God.

215
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:55,680
Are you all right?

216
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm so glad.
I got so scared when--

217
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:01,053
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

218
00:25:01,162 --> 00:25:05,098
- She had an accident.
- What kind of an accident?

219
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,225
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, homicide.

220
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,428
Could I talk to you
out in the hall?

221
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:13,302
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please.

222
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,610
I'll be right back.

223
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,349
Look, Mrs. Barclay--

224
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:36,357
What?

225
00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:39,432
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

226
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:46,169
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

227
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:48,332
- No!
- Whoa.

228
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,302
You all right?

229
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:53,676
Yes.

230
00:25:53,747 --> 00:25:55,374
Come on.

231
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,763
Do you got any idea
what these are?

232
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,808
No.

233
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:25,045
They look like footprints,
don't they? Very small footprints.

234
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,241
- What are you implying?
- I don't know.

235
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,819
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

236
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:37,183
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

237
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,690
Mommy?

238
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:43,229
Chucky wanted to know
what was going on.

239
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,764
I want you to go to bed.
We are very busy.

240
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:49,098
- But Mom--
- Right now, please.

241
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:54,035
What's on your feet?

242
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:57,474
Good Guy pj sneakers.

243
00:26:57,578 --> 00:27:00,513
Wow. Come here.

244
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:06,041
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

245
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:09,680
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

246
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,191
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in to tuck you in.

247
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,694
- But Mom--
- Right now!

248
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,429
Why are you treating Andy
like this?

249
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:26,165
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

250
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:29,265
Look, somebody made those footprints.
If not Andy, then who?

251
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,344
I don't know
and I don't care.

252
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:34,210
I've just lost my best friend
to a horrible accident...

253
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:38,342
and I would like some time alone with
my son who I'm sure is just as upset.

254
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,614
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:43,815
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away.

256
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:46,753
Hey, guys, you done?
Let's go.

257
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,351
Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

258
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:01,297
What do you think
was so important...

259
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:04,037
about my sneakers, Chucky?

260
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:07,477
You don't know either, do you?

261
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:29,231
Let me know if you find anything out
about those footprints.

262
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:35,337
I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

263
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:38,673
- Who, Andy?
- Chucky!

264
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,269
Your doll?

265
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:45,748
That's enough stories for tonight.
Back to bed. I mean it!

266
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,592
Good night, detective.

267
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,664
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

268
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:02,634
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just-- I hate loose ends.

269
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:05,171
And I hate people
who don't know when stop.

270
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:10,136
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

271
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:13,338
I want that autopsy report
first thing tomorrow...

272
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:16,177
and anything you can find out
about the Barclays.

273
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,979
You got it! Anything else?

274
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:22,580
Yeah. Here.
Get this to the lab.

275
00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:24,589
I found it in the corner
of the kitchen.

276
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:27,319
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

277
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:32,526
Come on. You're kidding me.

278
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:35,363
Hey, you are kidding me,
aren't you?

279
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:05,429
Who are you talking to?

280
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,592
Chucky.

281
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:20,043
Chucky, huh?

282
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,513
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

283
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:25,176
He's sitting right over there.

284
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:31,323
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

285
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,451
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

286
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:38,520
His real name
is Charles Lee Ray...

287
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:42,432
and he's been sent down
from heaven by Daddy...

288
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,697
to play with me.

289
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,773
He has, has he?
Anything else?

290
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:55,508
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie
was a real bitch...

291
00:30:55,616 --> 00:30:58,312
and got what she deserved.

292
00:30:58,418 --> 00:31:02,320
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

293
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:04,413
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

294
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:09,360
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

295
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:13,194
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

296
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,734
Chucky-- Chucky's a doll.

297
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,236
He's made of plastic
and stuffing.

298
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:21,501
Look at him.
Does he look like anything else?

299
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:23,576
Don't, you'll hurt him.

300
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:25,668
Andy, look!

301
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:28,839
You don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

302
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:30,413
But he is.

303
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:33,645
Andy, stop it! Please!

304
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:39,319
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

305
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:45,661
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

306
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,757
I'm sorry.

307
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:51,099
I'll stop making up stories.

308
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,776
Thanks, champ.

309
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:01,306
Do you want to sleep
in with me tonight?

310
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:03,178
No, it's all right.

311
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:06,411
I've got Chucky.

312
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:11,456
Come on, into bed.

313
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:18,463
Good night, sweetheart.

314
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,094
I love you.

315
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,469
Bye-bye.

316
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:42,821
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

317
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,827
Hi. I like to be hugged.

318
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:56,801
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

319
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:13,686
You sure you're all right
about last night?

320
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,415
No bad dreams
about Aunt Maggie?

321
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:20,754
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

322
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,290
Off to school then.
I love you tons.

323
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:43,638
43rd street.
Next stop, 47th.

324
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:37,596
Is that Eddie's?

325
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:46,029
Look, you stay here.
I have to go tinkle.

326
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,744
I'll be right there, Chucky!

327
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:12,372
- Mrs. Barclay?
- I came as soon as I got your message.

328
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:15,073
You haven't picked up your son
from school?

329
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:19,379
- I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

330
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:22,478
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

331
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:33,393
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Tell me what?

332
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:37,266
Do you have any idea why your
Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

333
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,806
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

334
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:45,738
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

335
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,107
She did, huh?

336
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:51,013
So why did Chucky
go to see Eddie Caputo?

337
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,642
Mommy!

338
00:39:58,058 --> 00:40:00,253
All right, sweetheart.
Come on.

339
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:04,463
Now listen to me, okay?

340
00:40:05,732 --> 00:40:09,259
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

341
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:13,465
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

342
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,100
they're going to
take you away from me.

343
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,472
You hear that, Chucky?

344
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,607
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

345
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:29,818
Please, say something.

346
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,581
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

347
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:36,458
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

348
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:39,692
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

349
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:41,460
Tell me!

350
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:45,868
Hi! I'm Chucky and
I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

351
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:51,439
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

352
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:56,208
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

353
00:40:56,316 --> 00:41:00,082
Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.

354
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,246
I've seen more than enough.

355
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:05,483
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

356
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:47,094
Well, say something,
you little bastard.

357
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:51,066
Say something, damn it!

358
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:54,665
Hi. I like to be hugged.

359
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:39,143
"He wants you
for a best friend."

360
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,810
Yeah, sure.

361
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:42,210
Hi. I'm Chucky!
Want to play?

362
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:47,173
Talk to me.

363
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,281
Come on, talk!

364
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:55,280
I said talk to me, damn it!
All right!

365
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:57,754
Then I'm going to make you talk!

366
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:12,635
Talk to me,
or I'll throw you in the fire!

367
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:16,038
You stupid bitch!
You filthy slut!

368
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:18,337
I'll teach you
to fuck with me!

369
00:45:58,251 --> 00:45:59,718
Stop!

370
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:54,506
Detective Norris!

371
00:46:54,574 --> 00:46:57,202
- What are you doing back here?
- Andy was telling the truth.

372
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,371
- Chucky is alive and killed Caputo.
- What?

373
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:05,781
I was about to throw away the box
he came in when the batteries fell out.

374
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:09,681
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking without any batteries.

375
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:13,589
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll is alive.

376
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:16,127
I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace...

377
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:18,697
when all of a sudden,
he came alive.

378
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,164
I dropped him, and he ran out
of the apartment.

379
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:24,602
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

380
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,434
Wait a minute!
I am telling you the truth!

381
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:33,002
- He killed Maggie and Caputo.
- Look, I sympathize with you.

382
00:47:33,112 --> 00:47:36,172
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is--

383
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:39,809
Lying? Does this look
like I'm lying?

384
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,486
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

385
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:45,580
Oh, for God's sake!

386
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:47,591
All right, don't believe me!

387
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:51,061
- Where you goin'?
- To find Chucky!

388
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:53,132
How you gonna do that?

389
00:47:53,232 --> 00:47:55,598
I'll start with the peddler
I bought him from.

390
00:47:55,668 --> 00:48:00,128
That isn't a good part of town!
You hear me?

391
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:03,175
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.

392
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:09,672
Goddamn it!

393
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,390
What's she doin' here?

394
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,329
Hey, excuse me.

395
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,763
Mister!

396
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:41,469
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

397
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,306
I bought a doll from you in back of
Carson's department store yesterday.

398
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:47,504
- Doll?
- A Good Guy doll.

399
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:51,049
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- What about it?

400
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,210
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

401
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,689
I don't have much.
You're welcome to whatever I have.

402
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:05,589
It's not enough.
What else you got?

403
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:08,531
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

404
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:11,398
- What are you-- Yes.
- That's not all you got.

405
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:14,234
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

406
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:19,269
- Wait! No!
- Pig!

407
00:50:20,413 --> 00:50:23,678
- He's a cop!
- What about the rest of you?

408
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:26,251
You wanna party too?

409
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:36,523
You want to answer the lady now?
Where did you get that doll?

410
00:50:36,629 --> 00:50:38,529
I don't know nothin'
about no doll.

411
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,395
You won't know nothin'
about nothin'! Now talk!

412
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,401
A burned-out toy store on Wabash!
That's where I got it.

413
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:49,373
Get outta here!

414
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,743
What's wrong?

415
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,143
Nothing.

416
00:50:57,149 --> 00:50:59,640
Wait. Something the peddler said
upset you. What was it?

417
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:01,845
I just told you-- nothing.

418
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:05,386
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! What was it?

419
00:51:07,193 --> 00:51:10,788
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

420
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:12,530
Who?

421
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:16,499
The Lake Shore Strangler.
He's partners with Eddie Caputo.

422
00:51:16,602 --> 00:51:20,197
- Where are you going?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

423
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:23,537
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.
Why don't you believe me?

424
00:51:23,642 --> 00:51:27,078
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee Ray died.

425
00:51:29,115 --> 00:51:33,415
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there! I killed him!

426
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:42,750
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:46,298
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

428
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:49,732
Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

429
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:52,395
- Did he say anything?
- Who?

430
00:51:52,505 --> 00:51:56,601
- Charles Lee Ray.
- He threatened to kill me and Caputo.

431
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:12,580
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

432
00:52:12,691 --> 00:52:14,318
I really am.

433
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:18,329
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

434
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:22,629
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

435
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:25,602
- Good night.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

436
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:29,333
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

437
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:31,103
Just tell me.

438
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,610
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

439
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:37,211
730 Stoney Island,
the south side.

440
00:52:37,283 --> 00:52:41,151
I've already checked.
There's nothing there. Good night.

441
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:42,584
Where are you going?

442
00:52:44,256 --> 00:52:46,224
- Home. Get some sleep.
- You can't do that!

443
00:52:46,325 --> 00:52:48,759
Don't you see?
You just said it.

444
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,193
Chucky killed Caputo.
That leaves you.

445
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:53,788
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

446
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:00,668
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

447
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:04,800
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane and rational.

448
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:09,014
All right!

449
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:11,275
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me?

450
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:13,283
- What?
- You didn't like loose ends.

451
00:53:13,385 --> 00:53:17,185
I'm a loose end. You can't let go what I
said tonight without checking it out.

452
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:19,190
For the last time,
good night.

453
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:19,647
Good night, asshole.

454
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,093
Oh, God!

455
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,769
Look out!

456
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:22,270
Won't do ya any good!
You can't hurt me!

457
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:52,348
What are you doing here?

458
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:55,325
After I talked to you last night...

459
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:58,760
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

460
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:02,528
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

461
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:06,136
He spent a lot of time
with this man.

462
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:16,579
All we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

463
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,719
Over here!

464
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,530
It's me. Chucky.

465
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:38,228
What d'ya think?
The grigri work?

466
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:44,366
You know, when I came here
learning about how to beat death...

467
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:47,104
I thought maybe you were
pullin' my chain.

468
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:49,112
But not now.

469
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:53,116
- Only one problem.
- What?

470
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:57,383
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

471
00:59:57,456 --> 00:59:59,219
But last night I got shot.

472
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,383
Know somethin'?
It hurt.

473
01:00:02,461 --> 01:00:05,760
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

474
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:07,059
Why's that?

475
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:10,428
- You're turning human?
- What?

476
01:00:11,637 --> 01:00:15,437
The more time you spend
in that body...

477
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,440
the more human you become.

478
01:00:19,378 --> 01:00:21,710
You mean I have to live
the rest of my life in this body?

479
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:26,412
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

480
01:00:28,353 --> 01:00:30,719
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

481
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:35,181
Because you're an abomination!

482
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:38,058
An outrage against nature!

483
01:00:38,163 --> 01:00:40,631
You've perverted everything
I've taught you...

484
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:42,495
and used it for evil!

485
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:44,501
You have to be stopped!

486
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:51,240
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

487
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:54,335
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

488
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,841
Your own personal mojo.

489
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:00,541
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

490
01:01:00,652 --> 01:01:02,449
Broken leg?

491
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:09,456
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this.

492
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:11,552
Gets you in trouble every time.

493
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:14,530
How do I get out of this body?

494
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:17,397
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

495
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:23,808
Tell me or die.
Your choice.

496
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,643
I'll tell you.

497
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,780
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

498
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:36,149
into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

499
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:39,746
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

500
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,161
I just don't believe it.

501
01:01:46,264 --> 01:01:50,325
The first person I told my secret
was a six-year-old kid.

502
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:52,460
I'm gonna be six years old again.

503
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:57,167
Well, it's been fun,
but I gotta go.

504
01:01:57,242 --> 01:02:00,234
I have a date
with a six-year-old boy.

505
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:04,315
And you have a date
with death.

506
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:09,477
So long.

507
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:36,546
Hold it! Wait!

508
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:46,123
Oh, my God.

509
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:51,652
- Too late.
- What?

510
01:02:51,763 --> 01:02:54,129
Must save the boy. Must--

511
01:02:57,302 --> 01:02:59,293
Must get his souI...

512
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:03,101
into him like he got into doll.

513
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,641
What?

514
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:08,474
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

515
01:03:08,547 --> 01:03:11,812
Kill him before he can say it.

516
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,813
But how?

517
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:19,146
The heart.
His heart is almost human.

518
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:24,755
It's the only way.
Through the heart.

519
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:46,381
Help me!
Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

520
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:59,185
Help me! He's coming to kill me!

521
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:01,060
He's here! Chucky's here!

522
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:04,202
I don't see anybody.

523
01:04:04,202 --> 01:04:06,363
But Chucky's here.

524
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,632
And he's going to kill me.

525
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:16,779
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

526
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:22,309
He's going to kill me.

527
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,548
Please don't leave me. Please.

528
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,181
Stop!

529
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:26,349
Stop him!

530
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:41,563
Check the north corridor!

531
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:29,711
Easy, Andy, easy.
It's all right.

532
01:06:29,814 --> 01:06:33,147
You're not gonna need this anymore.

533
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:37,312
But I do! Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me!

534
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:39,390
No. It's gonna be all right.

535
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:41,288
I'm gonna protect you.

536
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:44,627
Easy, boy, easy.

537
01:06:44,729 --> 01:06:46,424
Nobody's here.

538
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,829
No, please! He'll kill you too.

539
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,558
No. Please listen to me. Please!

540
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:55,401
This is just gonna sting you
for one second.

541
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:12,683
Stop! Stop!

542
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:39,307
What happened?

543
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:42,011
Miss, could you just excuse us
for a minute?

544
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,587
What?

545
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,155
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
01:07:47,258 --> 01:07:50,421
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine, and then he escaped.

547
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:52,189
Escaped? Where?

548
01:07:52,297 --> 01:07:55,425
We don't know,
but I bet she does.

549
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:02,672
You seen Chucky anywhere?

550
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:05,699
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

551
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:08,973
The same one that was at the station.
Have you seen him?

552
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,640
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you goin'?

553
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:16,517
They think Andy did it.

554
01:08:16,621 --> 01:08:20,057
The girl said Chucky was here
looking for Andy.

555
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:22,058
- Where would Andy go?
- Home.

556
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,560
- I said go there if he was in trouble.
- Does he have a key?

557
01:08:24,662 --> 01:08:27,062
- It's under the mat.
- Come on. We don't have much time.

558
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:54,250
Look, George.

559
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:56,827
- Some child left their doll.
- Leave it alone.

560
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,757
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

561
01:09:05,503 --> 01:09:07,437
Ugly doll.

562
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:10,400
Fuck you.

563
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:55,607
Surprise!

564
01:11:27,312 --> 01:11:28,506
Batter up!

565
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:16,256
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

566
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:43,845
Can you hear me?

567
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:05,768
Karen, are you all right?

568
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:13,350
Just take care of Andy.

569
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,354
Take this. Take it.

570
01:13:23,628 --> 01:13:25,220
Mommy.

571
01:14:25,323 --> 01:14:27,291
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

572
01:15:06,597 --> 01:15:09,395
Andy, help me!
The matches!

573
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:12,700
Please! Now!

574
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:27,512
Andy, no, please.

575
01:15:27,618 --> 01:15:30,451
We're friends to the end.
Remember?

576
01:15:30,555 --> 01:15:34,252
This is the end, friend.

577
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:20,470
Oh, my baby.

578
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:24,173
You all right?

579
01:16:31,115 --> 01:16:34,744
Go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast.

580
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:38,583
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

581
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:54,094
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

582
01:16:54,872 --> 01:16:56,840
Andy, hurry up.

583
01:17:13,257 --> 01:17:15,191
Hello, Andy.

584
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:19,226
Mommy.

585
01:17:27,738 --> 01:17:30,206
Give me the boy
and I'll let you live!

586
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:33,106
Do you hear me?
Give me the boy!

587
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:32,997
Give me the boy!

588
01:19:41,338 --> 01:19:43,272
What the hell's goin' on here?

589
01:19:49,513 --> 01:19:51,140
God!

590
01:19:54,218 --> 01:19:55,685
Oh, Jesus.

591
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:01,518
I got a cop down--
multiple stab wounds.

592
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:05,026
Brewster Apartments
on north Grand Street. Make it fast.

593
01:20:05,129 --> 01:20:07,427
They're gonna be here in ten minutes.
What happened?

594
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:10,626
The kid was right.
The doll's alive.

595
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:13,362
- He almost got the three of us.
- What?

596
01:20:15,172 --> 01:20:19,074
You don't believe me? Go on.
Check it out in the hall.

597
01:20:19,176 --> 01:20:22,839
He's scattered all over the hall.
But don't touch it. Understand?

598
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,174
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right. Take it easy.

599
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:28,046
Just relax, all right?

600
01:21:07,858 --> 01:21:12,192
I'd like you to take a look, because
there's no way this thing's alive.

601
01:21:13,597 --> 01:21:17,033
- I told you not to touch it.
- Be sensible.

602
01:21:17,134 --> 01:21:19,364
Look. It's as dead as they come.

603
01:21:21,172 --> 01:21:23,436
Choke him! Kill him!

604
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:40,487
Kill him now! Strangle him!
Don't let go!

605
01:21:45,863 --> 01:21:47,387
God.

606
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:59,070
Kill them! Kill them all!

607
01:21:59,176 --> 01:22:01,235
The heart!
Shoot him in the heart!

608
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:29,137
Hi. I'm Chucky.

609
01:22:29,206 --> 01:22:31,538
Wanna play--

610
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,280
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

611
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:51,127
But who's gonna believe me?

612
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:56,325
Come on.

613
01:22:59,203 --> 01:23:01,398
All right. Ready?
Here we go.

614
01:23:22,826 --> 01:23:26,262
Come on. We're gonna
go to the hospital with Mike.

615
01:23:26,363 --> 01:23:27,830
Let's go.
