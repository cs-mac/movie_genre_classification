1
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Talon 1 requesting Bitching Betty
relay Combat Control commands.

2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,440
Roger, Talon 1.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,000
Central Prime is transmitting...

4
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,440
...encrypted satellite
auto-terrain comparison.

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,240
Talons, this is Operator.

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,600
PAYCOM has given
his final tasking orders.

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,880
You are to proceed to target
and prosecute with precision.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
Now, remember,
you are pilots of the U.S. Navy.

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,680
I expect nothing less
than perfection.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,440
Roger, skipper.
Activating tactical music.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,360
Countermeasure is silent party.
Talon 2, confirm.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,160
Talon 2 confirms. Music on.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,440
Risk assessment is
we have a clean mission status.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Attack commencing.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,840
Gotcha.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Missile lock. Missile lock.

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,800
Talon 3, there's a SAM site on
the west wall. We got birds in the air.

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Talon 2,
the SAM site's been erased.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, that's how you do it.

20
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,520
Talon 3, that was shit-hot!

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,400
Talon 1, I expect
the same out of you.

22
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Arming Blue Ferret
for penetration detonation.

23
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,000
Missile armed. Missile armed.

24
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,240
Yep, 100 over 100.
That's correct.

25
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
And I can rely on these numbers?

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,920
Well, this isn't figure skating, Ray.
You either score or you don't.

27
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,960
National Command Authority's
duly impressed.

28
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
They've given us the go-ahead
on phase two.

29
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
You know what?

30
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,080
You should come to D.C. and make
the presentation to the senators.

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,840
That's how Admiral Rickover
got things done.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,880
Admiral. You get my meaning?

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,800
No, I'm flattered,
but you do the lobbying.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Politics is for politicians.

35
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,400
- Captain?
- I'll get back to you.

36
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,760
There's Popsicles in the cooler.

37
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,360
- Got any grape?
- Any grape?

38
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,600
I believe there is one left,
and don't lose your dignity.

39
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
Oh, thank you.

40
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,400
- All right, take a seat.
- Nice catch.

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,960
Talk to me. Where are the holes?
How can we improve?

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Come on. I'm not a patient man.

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Sorry, I got caught up on
that west wall. I had to pull out...

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,240
War is a team sport.

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Those AAA sites were thick.
Gave extra time to the SAM sites.

46
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,600
See, that's your answer. There really
was no room for improvement.

47
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,000
Actually, what Lieutenant Wade
did was right.

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
She took out their communications
and exposed their SAM sites...

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,200
...so Henry could lay it down.
- That's what I do.

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,040
- I mean, it was perfect.
- "Perfect." I'll go along with that.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Much as I hate to see that smile
of yours get any smugger.

52
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,560
You blushing?

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
I've got good news.

54
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,800
Tell us we got a carrier,
skipper, come on.

55
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,000
Affirmative.

56
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,880
The USS Abraham Lincoln.

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,800
Captain's an old classmate of mine,
Dick Marshfield.

58
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,160
- I believe you two know each other.
- He was the captain I told you about.

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,720
- Hell of a pilot in his day.
- He's black too. He's black.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm also gonna be expanding
your squadron.

61
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,880
On the carrier, you'll be joined
by a new wingman.

62
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,720
A fourth wingman?

63
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,200
Wait, I thought there were only
three Talons in existence.

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
What is the problem, Purcell?
You look like you been hit in the gut.

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,080
For one, captain, we've been flying
together for a long time and it's good.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
And four is an unlucky number.

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
- Unlucky?
- It's not a prime number.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,040
Prime numbers can only be divided
by one or itself.

69
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,640
Three is prime. The Holy Trinity.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Thesis and antithesis come together
and form the synthesis...

71
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,160
This is not a seminar on metaphysics.
This is the U.S. Navy.

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,920
Now, we ship out Wednesday at 0500.
Dismissed.

73
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,320
Okay. If he'd let me finish,
I was gonna say...

74
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,120
...Three's Company, Three Stooges,
Three Musketeers, three-peat...

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
..."three strikes, you're out,"
"Three Times a Lady."

76
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,200
- Three dimensions.
- Three blind mice.

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,920
There's ménage à trois.
Don't forget that one.

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
To the original three.

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,120
- Cheers.
- And assorted guests.

81
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Cheers.

82
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll be back in a second.

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,840
I gotta go pee-pee.

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,920
That's nasty.

85
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,760
At least she's potty-trained.
I'll give her that.

86
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,400
- Chip O'Dell.
- No way.

87
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Yeah, it's gotta be him. Hey, Henry,
our fourth wing. It's gotta be him.

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,800
He tried to manipulate his way into
the program, but you two beat him.

89
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,360
Yeah, but Becky Martinez
could fly circles around O'Dell.

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
- Two out of the four are women? No.
- Hey, you never know.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,560
- God, you're such a chauvinist.
- Hold on, now, that's not true.

92
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,840
I bow down before the superiority
of the opposite sex in many respects.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
But from time to time...

94
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
...I believe they should
bow down before me.

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,680
- Oh, please.
- Kara. Kara, listen. You're different.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
- You are a singularity.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
You're a freak. Of nature.

98
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,760
- Well, thank you, Henry, I think.
- You are very welcome.

99
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,120
You know what I think?

100
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
Don't think. Drink.

101
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
Have fun.

102
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,360
Spectacular night, huh?

103
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,360
- Dark and mysterious, sir.
- Don't you like surprises, Ben?

104
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
Well, here he comes now.

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Meet your new wingman.

106
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
Allow me to introduce the future
of digital warfare. Tim?

107
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,080
Open for Tim, please.

108
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Fuel, catalyzed A1 methane.

109
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,520
Exoskeleton,
metal-ceramic composite.

110
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,840
Aeroelastic wings.

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,440
Pulse detonation engine
with twin hybrid scramjet turbos.

112
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,080
EDI's sensors can pick out
a face five miles away.

113
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,960
So we'll take three. Drop the top
on mine, personalized license plate.

114
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,160
So this is one of these
smart UCAVs.

115
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,520
Well, technically you could call it
an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle.

116
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,960
But that would be like
calling this carrier a rowboat.

117
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,200
I feel you, captain.
I know a bit about this.

118
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,680
- This is quantum processing, right?
- Yeah, it's the first tested application.

119
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,120
Ten terabits a second.

120
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,720
So if it's a UCAV,
why does it have a seat?

121
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
The cockpit's just
for testing and maintenance.

122
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,200
Otherwise, EDI flies all by himself.

123
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
You mean "itself," don't you, sir?

124
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,760
So this is what the fuss is all about.

125
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,240
You're looking
at VLO stealth, captain.

126
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,280
It's got a brain
like a quantum sponge.

127
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,080
And one day, its survivability
is going to fly right off the charts.

128
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,600
- Lieutenant Wade.
- It's good to meet you, sir.

129
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,840
It is a bag of chips, all right.

130
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
- Lieutenant Purcell.
- Honored to meet you, sir.

131
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,120
It will replace us all.

132
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,360
Looks and sounds
like science fiction, George.

133
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Well, so did everything,
once upon a time.

134
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
Ain't that the truth.

135
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
Mr. Gannon.
Good to have you back.

136
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,080
Your first squadron tour still holds
some of the ship's most...

137
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,880
...impressive records.

138
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,720
Thank you, Captain Marshfield.
Records are made to be broken.

139
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,480
Rules too, if I remember
your philosophy.

140
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,240
Captain Cummings,
this is my X O, Mr. Carlson.

141
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,640
Carlson.

142
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,600
Why don't you meet me up on
the flight deck after you're through.

143
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,280
- You bet.
- Congratulations, George.

144
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,640
- Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Dick.

145
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,960
You too.

146
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,720
- It's humming.
- No, EDI's thinking.

147
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,160
- Thinking? Thinking about what, sir?
- You. All of you.

148
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
He's going over your files.
He's reviewing all your flight logs.

149
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,960
Let's take it for a spin,
see what it can do.

150
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,880
No, no, no. Tomorrow.

151
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,680
- First, you gotta do your homework.
- Homework?

152
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
"EDI UCAV. Extreme Deep Invader."

154
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,800
Yeah, I've been called that
a few times.

155
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
- I've heard that one.
- Yeah, right.

156
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,720
Well, hello, gorgeous.

157
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,640
Please, no pictures, please.
No pictures, please. Please.

158
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
Okay, take them.
Take them. Take them.

159
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
It's open.

160
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Study break.

161
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
You are one big study break.

162
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
Just a natural.

163
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,400
So that is the appeal.

164
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,920
Okay, because I was really
wondering how you manage...

165
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,560
...to pull a rocket scientist
at every port.

166
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,760
You better be careful, Ben, you know.
Hair bleach causes cancer in rats.

167
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,720
Well, I'm not a rat.
That's my appeal.

168
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
- You checking out the drone?
- Yeah.

169
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,800
Just barely skimmed the surface.

170
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,520
- We really are in the era of EDI.
- EDI.

171
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
Did I ever tell you
about that foster mother I had?

172
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,800
- The one who weighed 350 pounds?
- No.

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
Anyway, one day she comes home
with this Chihuahua, right?

174
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,040
Guess what she named him. Eddie.

175
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,320
- You know what I realized about you?
- What?

176
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,680
You got a foster mom
for every situation.

177
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,600
Hey, I lived through my childhood.
I may as well use it, right?

178
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,280
That's right.

179
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,960
So tell me, you think
Marshfield's right?

180
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,560
You think they're gonna trade us all in
for that machine?

181
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,400
No way. War is about tools.
Think about it.

182
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Claws to clubs, bronze to steel.

183
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,440
- Best guy with the best weapon wins.
- Or girl.

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,120
And we all know who that is,
don't we?

185
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,360
The dull thud
of a Ben Gannon compliment.

186
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,760
Well...

187
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,240
Oh, pardon my C cup.

188
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,240
Study break is over.

189
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,640
Good morning to the crew
of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

190
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,120
Remember, foreign-object debris
can ruin a jet engine.

191
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,840
Let's keep our safety record.
Scour that deck.

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,840
Hey. Feel like we got older, Dick.
What the hell happened?

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,840
Don't complain.
You still got your hair.

194
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Yeah. Some of it.

195
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,240
Look, truth be told...

196
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,440
...I never wanted this little experiment
of yours on my ship.

197
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Well, you're not
hurting my feelings, Dick.

198
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,560
Admiral Spelling shared
your point paper with me...

199
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
...and your objections
were duly noted.

200
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,800
- You always could work the politics.
- It's indispensable in a bureaucracy.

201
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,600
This isn't a bureaucracy,
not out here.

202
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,920
You rush a weapons system
into service...

203
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,760
...you shortcut an operational
test cycle, people might get killed.

204
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,600
You know I can't pick my nose here
without 7000 people approving it.

205
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,520
Nobody rushed a damn thing.

206
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,200
Program is just ahead of schedule.

207
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,560
You missed this.

208
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm out first, boys.

209
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm right on that ass.

210
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,560
After you, ladies.

211
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,240
Talon 2, airborne.

212
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,280
Talon 3, airborne.

213
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,120
Talon 1 is off and heading 2-5-4.

214
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Deploying Unmanned Combat
Aerial Vehicle...

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,040
...Extreme Deep Invader now.

216
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,720
I never thought
we would see this day.

217
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,360
Me neither, sir.

218
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,560
UCAV EDI, you have launch.

219
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,320
One to UCAV.
Confirm flight link. Over.

220
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,640
Flight link confirmed, Talon 1.

221
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,400
It is good to be
part of the squadron.

222
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,080
What? Well, well, well. He can talk.

223
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,760
Big deal. I know a guy's BMW,
does exactly the same thing.

224
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,840
Picture, please.

225
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,480
Aye, aye, sir.

226
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
Swarm logic activated.

227
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,680
All right, Ben.
EDI's here to learn from you.

228
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
So let's make sure these lessons
are up to speed, all right?

229
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
Well, then, let the schooling begin.

230
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,320
Captain Cummings.

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Inside, please.

232
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,680
- What's the deal?
- You, sir, have a new tasking order.

233
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,280
One to wing, anybody got a visual
on the UCAV?

234
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
- Negative, 1.
- Negative, 1.

235
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,560
We better find him and regroup.

236
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Before it takes a crap
in its quantum pants.

237
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
Wait up. Hold on.

238
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,280
What the hell is he doing?

239
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,720
Here he comes. Here he comes.

240
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,520
I think little brother
is messing with us.

241
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,760
UCAV, your position is always
on my starboard side.

242
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,200
Other starboard.

243
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,240
That's hot.

244
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,960
Got no heart, but it sure can fly.
That's not bad for a tin man.

245
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,800
EDI, it's official. You got a call sign.
UCAV "Tin Man" EDI, the first.

246
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,760
- Operator to squadron.
- Go for Talons.

247
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,000
There's been a change of plans.

248
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,320
We're giving you an emergency
mission redirect. Repeat.

249
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
That's an emergency redirect.
Do you read me?

250
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,320
Roger. Where's the fire, skipper?

251
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,520
PAYCOM has given us
a brand-new tasking order.

252
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Please access your encrypted file...

253
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
...named "Advanced
War Vector Scenarios."

254
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,120
File's open. Go ahead.

255
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,960
All right. Firewall code
is "Terror Summit."

256
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,600
We are upgrading this file from
a scenario to a tactical action plan.

257
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,400
Repeat, we are upgrading the file.

258
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,920
CIA human intel has just learned
that the heads of three terrorist cells...

259
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
...are about to meet in 24 minutes.

260
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,840
The country is Myanmar.
The city is Rangoon.

261
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,160
They're planning an imminent attack
on U.S. soil.

262
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,600
One to Control,
what about the UCAV?

263
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,680
EDI will observe your attack.

264
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,960
Proceed to primary.

265
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,200
Roger.

266
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,280
One to UCA V,
confirm observation status only.

267
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,320
Tin Man confirms, Talon 1.

268
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,040
New coordinates
have been uploaded.

269
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,680
Baptism by fire, Tin Man.

270
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,040
Mach 1.

271
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,800
Mach 2.

272
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,680
Mach 3.

273
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Mach 4.

274
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,040
Primo's now analyzing the location.
Here we go.

275
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
The primary is this building.

276
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,800
A new defense ministry
still under construction.

277
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,240
Specs indicate
14-foot-thick cement roof...

278
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,480
...with steel reinforcements.

279
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,880
Roger. We're not weaponized
for something that thick.

280
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,480
Repeat, not weaponized.

281
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,080
This is 2. What's the population
of the collateral area?

282
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,000
The building's unoccupied, but it's
in the middle of downtown Rangoon.

283
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,920
This is 3.
Talk to me about that roof.

284
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,120
What's Primo advocate
to ordinance and influence?

285
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,040
Primo says Talons
can't penetrate it.

286
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,920
This is our chance. We may never
catch these bastards together again.

287
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
Try a lateral vector.

288
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,640
Just do what he says.

289
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,880
This is 2 to Control.
Risk assessment officer advises...

290
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,280
...casualties from lateral vector
will be in the thousands.

291
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,600
Tin Man has integrated
all network-centric spy satellites.

292
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,080
Here is new data.

293
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,880
UCAV is bypassing Central Prime.
He's distributing secure video stream.

294
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,440
Look at that. Oh, yeah. Oh, now
I know what I want for Christmas.

295
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,640
One to Control, we've entered
our mission window.

296
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
Six-three seconds
to primary and counting.

297
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
Come on, Control,
we have our targets.

298
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,840
Come on. I need an alternative.
We got these guys in the bull's-eye.

299
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,640
There is an alternative,
Combat Control.

300
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,360
Operator to UCAV. Talk to me.
Give me something.

301
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
Squadron carries
truncheon implosion bombs.

302
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,240
Negative, will not work.

303
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,120
Central Prime says truncheons
can't achieve velocity for penetration.

304
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,680
One to UCAV, 37 seconds to primary.
Come on, explain.

305
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,760
Diving dead vertical at 2070 knots
will increase truncheon velocity.

306
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,080
Bomb will successfully
penetrate roof.

307
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,360
What's the blackout risk
at vertical 2070?

308
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,000
- Seventy-three percent.
- Time on target is 23 seconds.

309
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,360
- Call it off. It's not worth the risk.
- Operator to Talons, pull back.

310
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,280
- EDI will plant the truncheon.
- Captain.

311
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,680
This is what we built
this machine for.

312
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,440
There's no blood in those
quantum veins. It can't black out.

313
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Operator to Talons, repeat,
EDI will plant the truncheon.

314
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
Control, negative, Control.
Mission critical. One will prosecute.

315
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,920
This is 3 to 1. I got your back...

316
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,280
...but if you black out,
you're gonna kill everyone.

317
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,800
Negative, 3. I did not get this far
by being in the 73rd percentile.

318
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
I like my odds.

319
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
Talon 1, your orders
are to stand down.

320
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,600
- Do you read me, lieutenant?
- I do...

321
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,520
- Talon 1, stand down.
- I'm having...

322
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,040
Can you...? Can you...?

323
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,280
Go, baby, go.

324
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,320
One hundred knots
to release velocity.

325
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
Fifty knots to release velocity.

326
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,360
His BP is spiking, sir.

327
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,120
Release velocity attained.

328
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,640
Truncheon away.

329
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,040
Ten seconds to implosion.

330
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,880
Nine, eight...

331
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,440
...seven, six...

332
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,400
...five, four, three...

333
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,080
...two, one.

334
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,680
This is 1 to Control. Looks like we
lost radio contact for a second there.

335
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,080
There you go. I wasn't worried, baby.
I wasn't worried.

336
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,520
Activating swarm logic,
going full-stealth egress.

337
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,200
Roger, Talon 1. Full-stealth egress.
Swarm logic is on.

338
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,080
Battle damage assessment,
100 over 100.

339
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,760
Collateral damage, zero.

340
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Let's go home.

341
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
Going hypersonic.

342
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,880
Same old Ben.

343
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,080
Yep.

344
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,320
Oh, and, George...

345
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
...hell of a first mission.

346
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,920
Thank you, captain.

347
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,960
On my way to the bridge.

348
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,320
Talon 2 and 3 are on deck.

349
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,760
Talon 1 and UCAV EDI
are on approach.

350
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,960
Roger, Control. UCAV will go first.
I'll take the last trap.

351
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,800
UCAV, confirm you've got the ball.

352
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Confirmed, Talon 1.
Tin Man will land next.

353
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,880
Okay, 1 to Control,
we've had a lightning strike.

354
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,880
The UCAV's very unstable.

355
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,080
Landing sequence is altered.
I'll go in first...

356
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,640
...but the UCAV
is gonna need the net.

357
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
Nice landing, ma'am.

358
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,600
On the flight deck,
stand by to rig barricade.

359
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,160
Extreme Deep Invader aircraft
inbound for crash landing.

360
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,600
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

361
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
- Hold on! Stop! Stop.
- Stay low, stay low! Pull low!

362
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,240
Pull starboard! Pull starboard!

363
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,000
Clear the deck!

364
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Move it! Move it! Move it!

365
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,480
- You scared me.
- Sorry, just a bit restless.

366
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,560
Really got whacked tonight, right?
Like a hair dryer in a bathtub.

367
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,120
Oh, he can't hear you.
I pulled his voice recog.

368
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll call it a "he" when it gets out of its
cockpit and takes a piss, how's that?

369
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,120
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,840
It's just a power surge, that's all.

371
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,960
- And that's normal?
- Normal?

372
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,880
Let me show you something.

373
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,800
That was EDI's neural network.

374
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,160
Now, check this out.

375
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,600
I mean, ever since the lightning strike,
he's just been writing all of this...

376
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,120
I don't know. A language or a code.

377
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
And what does it mean?

378
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,280
Yeah. "Mean."

379
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,760
The person that could really
answer that question...

380
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,320
...is its designer, Keith Orbit.
- Orbit?

381
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,680
- The guy's name is Orbit?
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,040
He did all the Al on the Raptor
when he was 22...

383
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,040
...and I guess, after that, he decided
that his given name was too earthly.

384
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,040
Off for Tim, please.

385
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,640
At least it's a good song.

386
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,880
He downloads songs from the Web.

387
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,600
Yeah? How many?

388
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
All of them.

389
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,040
You're in a peck of trouble
with the record companies there, son.

390
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
Ben, could...?

391
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,360
I saw how serious
that shit is up there.

392
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,400
So I think it's only fair that I tell you
that EDI's been designed to evolve.

393
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,160
- It's just unpredictable...
- Let me ask you something.

394
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,760
Just between you and me,
do you have confidence in this plane?

395
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,600
There's your answer.

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,040
It's open.

397
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Have a seat.

398
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,600
"Waffle" for 15 points.
I'm kicking your ass, buddy.

399
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
You didn't cheat, did you?

400
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,560
Cheating's not part
of my vocabulary.

401
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,800
Listen, I scheduled your jet
for a little maintenance.

402
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,080
I gotta get the bugs out of that radio,
don't you think?

403
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,480
It was a difficult situation
and I made a decision.

404
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,120
You made a mistake, Ben.

405
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,600
Sir, there's a thin line
between insubordination and...

406
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
No, no, no,
that's not the mistake you made.

407
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,080
Your mistake was getting competitive
with a machine.

408
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,400
I'm the point of the sword
up there, sir.

409
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,680
And I pulled it off, 100 over 100.

410
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,640
Yes, indeedy, and I congratulate you.
Calls have been coming in all night.

411
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,280
But that doesn't change the issue.

412
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,680
What is the issue, then?

413
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,640
- Would you like a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

414
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,000
- You sure?
- Fine, thank you.

415
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,400
Rolled on the thighs
of mulatto women.

416
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,840
What are you afraid of, Ben?

417
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,240
Being replaced? Is that it?

418
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,320
You afraid EDI's
gonna take your job?

419
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,680
No. No, to be honest with you...

420
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,400
...I just don't think war should become
some kind of video game.

421
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,200
And how do you feel
about black body bags?

422
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,960
What am I supposed to tell
all the weeping mothers?

423
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,000
We could've got the job done
without sacrificing their children...

424
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,560
...but no, we decided not to
because of what?

425
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,400
- Tradition?
- Not tradition, it's...

426
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,440
Look, we have things
those computers can never have...

427
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,360
...like instincts and feelings
and moral judgment.

428
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,360
You can call me old-fashioned,
you can call it whatever you want...

429
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
...but I just don't think that in war...

430
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,880
...the action should ever be divorced
from the consequences.

431
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,960
You don't think I consider
the consequences...

432
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
...every time I send you up there
with bombs?

433
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,320
- I know you do, sir.
- I've dedicated my life...

434
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,000
...to considering the consequences.

435
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
I got a bad feeling about this plane.

436
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,120
I don't know, I think it needs more...

437
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,920
I don't know, trials before it's ever
put in a combat situation again.

438
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,640
You been talking to Marshfield?

439
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,880
- Sir, you're my commanding officer.
- That's right.

440
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,560
And I guarantee you this thing will be
100 percent before I risk it in the field.

441
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,560
Look, Ben...

442
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,520
...all we need is
one more successful mission...

443
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,600
...and this project will be out of
the stovepipe and into the light.

444
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,360
Are you with me on this?

445
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,440
- I'm here to make it happen, sir.
- All right.

446
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,040
I've arranged a little R and R for you
and your team. You've earned it.

447
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,360
Thailand maybe.

448
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,520
We just got here.

449
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,440
Yeah, but this could turn out
to be a long tour.

450
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,520
You better take it while you can get it.
We'll pick this up when you get back.

451
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,480
Hey, how you doing? Henry Purcell.

452
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm from America. Look, I fly jets.
You like to go fast?

453
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,800
- B, it's the future and it works.
- I don't think it works.

454
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,360
It's just technology.

455
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,520
You know, it's here to make me safe.
It keeps me alive.

456
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
EDI is no different.

457
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,240
- You think it keeps you safe?
- Yeah. He's here...

458
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
...to help me get the job done...

459
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,080
...keep me in one piece...

460
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,080
...so I can visit my folks
for Thanksgiving.

461
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,920
Anyway, our safety's not the point.

462
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,200
War's meant to be terrible. If it stops
being terrible, what's gonna stop us?

463
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,880
It's become some kind of sport.
Just send in the EDls.

464
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,960
Yeah, but it's neutral.

465
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,400
- What?
- I mean, EDI...

466
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,960
...if it's controlled by moral people,
then it'll be moral.

467
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,840
Oh, I know I'm not moral.

468
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,320
As a matter of fact, I should be
arrested for the thoughts I have now.

469
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
I say something?

470
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,640
Well, you boys will have to excuse me.
I have to go pee-pee.

471
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,120
- Do you wanna go?
- Okay.

472
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
- What?
- You know what.

473
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,840
Take it easy. Nothing's happened.

474
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,920
No, something's happened.
You just ain't done anything about it.

475
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,080
Shit, man.

476
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,200
- I didn't want for this to happen.
- Come on.

477
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,640
I tried for it not to.
Navy's got rules about it...

478
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,560
...but it's like this force
and it's got ahold of me.

479
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,560
I love her.

480
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,600
B, you and I both know
that Kara Wade...

481
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
...is being groomed by the Navy.

482
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
She's a poster girl, you know?

483
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
She went to the right schools,
got the right background, connections.

484
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,320
If any woman is gonna rise to the top
of this business, it's gonna be her.

485
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,600
- I agree.
- And you're in a perfect position...

486
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,520
...to mess all that up.

487
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,360
So I hope that your love is powerful.

488
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,400
You have a beautiful country.

489
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,040
I mean, look at this.
This is paradise.

490
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,760
Know what I think? When I'm down
here, things look so much different.

491
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,880
As opposed to being up there.

492
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,680
Flying around, everything is so small,
everything goes by so fast.

493
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,040
And then they tell you...

494
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,800
They tell you to drop a bomb.

495
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,520
It's like you just erase something
they told you had to be erased.

496
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,160
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I got a job to do.

497
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,680
It's the flyest job you'll ever have,
but sometimes, right here...

498
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,680
Right here on earth, it's just...

499
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
It's just beautiful.

500
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,200
And you...

501
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,680
...don't understand a word I'm saying,
do you?

502
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,600
- No, I don't understand.
- You don't?

503
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,560
Well, you understand something.

504
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,960
Now, can you cook?

505
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,720
Wow. Beautiful.

506
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,520
- Now, do you guys have it so easy.
- Yeah? How's that?

507
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,240
- Henry meets a girl, like he does.
- Absolutely.

508
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,960
Leaves with her, sleeps with her,
and then what?

509
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,400
I mean, I don't know, what does
he do? Does he leave flowers?

510
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,600
He tells me he's religious
about that, yes.

511
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,000
Really?

512
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,080
And what do you do?
You leave flowers?

513
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,280
Me? No, I just leave.

514
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,880
What about you?

515
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,720
E-mails.

516
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,080
- The personal touch. Nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

517
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,600
Honestly, I just really haven't found
anyone that's worth the risk until now.

518
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,160
I'm going to head into town,
check out the local Thai nightlife.

519
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,480
Henry says it's great.

520
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,680
I don't think I'll find any
bleached blonds there, but...

521
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,720
Very true.

522
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,120
Oh, shit.

523
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,520
We got a nuclear crisis on
our hands, Ben. Here's the brief.

524
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,680
You're headed for Tajikistan.

525
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,200
One of those breakaway countries,
used to be part of the Soviet Union.

526
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,080
Seems some warlord has got his mitts
on three SS-42 Scud carcasses.

527
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,120
Joint Chiefs want them taken out,
and they want them out yesterday.

528
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,640
Mr. Wiatt, we good to go?

529
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,720
Yes, sir. Ready for combat.

530
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,040
Wait, you mean the UCAV
has been cleared for launch?

531
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,680
- Where's...?
- Tim?

532
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,920
- Tim, yeah.
- He's been reassigned.

533
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,440
Reassi...?

534
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,520
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Permission denied.

535
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,080
- We've already been through this.
- Scrub EDI from the mission.

536
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,240
I know you have a vision. I know
how much this project means to you...

537
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,280
...but this plane is putting
all of our lives at unnecessary risk.

538
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,880
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

539
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,520
EDI is the whole idea.

540
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,080
You understood this was new
territory when you signed on.

541
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,440
You wanted to be on the cutting edge?
This is it.

542
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,320
You will fly with EDI, or the next thing
you drive might just have a propeller.

543
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,200
Your choice, make it now.

544
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,400
Operator to squadron.

545
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,280
We've just located
nuclear warheads...

546
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,480
...three miles north
of the Scud launchers.

547
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,720
These warheads
are now your primary.

548
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
Proceed to mission window.

549
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,320
Sequenced assault will be
2, 3 and 1.

550
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,280
UCAV, you will hold here
and maintain altitude. Confirm?

551
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,200
UCAV, do you read me?

552
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,520
Confirmed, Talon 1.

553
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,000
Pick up the pace on confirmations,
Tin Man. Don't make me ask twice.

554
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,400
Talon flight, descend to 25,000.

555
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,240
Final attack heading 1-8-5.

556
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,840
Tell them to arm those FAEs,
and I mean right now.

557
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,920
Combat Control instructs arm
and deploy fuel-air explosives.

558
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,360
Arm and deploy fuel-air explosives.

559
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,040
Fuel-air, armed and deployed.

560
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,040
Fuel-air, external and armed.

561
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,960
Talon 2 to Operator.

562
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,640
I'm getting a contradictory
population-density read.

563
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,120
Sensors detect mammals warming.
Maybe 1000 medium weights.

564
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Those could be people. Repeat.
Ground intel may be incorrect.

565
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,360
Request to acknowledge
Dirty Mission status...

566
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,480
...and exercise
attack abort authority.

567
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,480
Operator to Talons. Your orders
are to commence attack now.

568
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,320
- Commence attack.
- Give me your estimate on collaterals.

569
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,920
Maybe 500 to 1000.

570
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,240
Farmers, Ben. They're just farmers.

571
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,240
Radioactive dust is gonna rain
all over the place.

572
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,200
Okay, okay, now we got a problem.

573
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,280
This is 3.
Sensors read surface wind...

574
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,400
...as due south at 40 miles per.

575
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,360
At that rate, nuclear debris
will reach Pakistan by tomorrow.

576
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,280
Commence attack.

577
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,280
Commence attack.

578
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,480
One to Control.
As commander in the field...

579
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,800
...I'm exercising
attack abort authority.

580
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,000
Reasons; Collateral, both at primary...

581
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,720
...and allied state of Pakistan,
will be too high.

582
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,480
Son of a bitch.

583
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,720
Repeat, the order is to abort.

584
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,200
Yes, yes, what I'm talking about.

585
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,960
Negative, Talon 1.
Tin Man will not abort.

586
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,120
Tin Man will prosecute.

587
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,720
That's an abort, EDI.
Repeat, return to formation.

588
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,360
Return to formation, EDI.
That's an order.

589
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,560
Damn it. UCAV taking AAAs.
We gotta bail it out.

590
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,040
Come on, initiate scramjets.

591
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,720
I'm coming around. I'm gonna
take out those Scud launchers.

592
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
I got you covered on the west side.

593
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,800
And I got that Bofors gun
on the east parapet.

594
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,640
Let me see it, let me see it.

595
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,720
Battle damage assessment calculates
primary target, Scud warheads...

596
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,280
...completely suppressed.

597
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,600
That's the right answer so far.

598
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,280
Talon 2 to Operator.

599
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,440
Nuclear dust engulfing village
southeast of primary. Situation critical.

600
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,320
Those people are gonna need
emergency medical help now.

601
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,920
Tin Man rejoining formation.

602
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,240
Mission achieved, 100 over 100.

603
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,200
UCAV, you disobeyed
a direct order.

604
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,120
You put innocent civilians
in harm's way.

605
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,080
- You put our squadron at risk.
- Damn straight.

606
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,360
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon.
You taught me.

607
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,560
Listen, you little shit.
When you fly with me...

608
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,840
...you do what I tell you,
when I tell you.

609
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,040
You're just not getting it,
are you, lieutenant?

610
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,560
EDI is the whole idea.

611
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,440
Selecting other targets.

612
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,640
Detaching formation.

613
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,120
Yo, this is 3.
Did he say, "other targets"?

614
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,840
I got his missile inventory.
He's got two Throat-rippers...

615
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,200
...two Shock Hammers
and three Blue Ferrets.

616
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,800
If those targets are in the city,
he could kill 150,000 people with that.

617
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,280
Holy shit.

618
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,760
Sir.

619
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,600
He's closing his data link.

620
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,880
Primo says he's just firewalled
his transponder...

621
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,240
...which is definitely
not supposed to be possible.

622
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,840
He's gone.

623
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,000
Talon 1.

624
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,200
Go for Talons.

625
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,160
I want my plane back, Ben.

626
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,200
I want it back in one piece.
You understand?

627
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,400
- Roger, captain.
- And, you...

628
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,640
...get me Keith Orbit on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,360
I wanna head back north
and do a triangulated sweep.

630
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,440
Going hypersonic.

631
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,800
We're talking about
creating intention here.

632
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,600
Yeah. Really lends itself
to quantum processing.

633
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,440
- Different. A straight line.
- Keith.

634
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,800
Z is... Interesting.

635
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Keith, it's an emergency.
It's George Cummings.

636
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,240
One moment for Dr. Orbit, please.

637
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,840
Good luck.

638
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,760
George. Never got that invitation
to the White House.

639
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,760
Knock it off, wiseass.

640
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,240
Look, we have big problems out here
with the UCAV.

641
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,040
It's gone completely haywire.

642
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,120
Anything more technically specific
than "haywire," George?

643
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,560
It's disobeyed direct orders,
bombed a target off the map...

644
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,920
...with collateral damage.

645
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,280
He separated himself from Primo.
He's flying around in foreign airspace.

646
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
- Where'd all this happen?
- That's not your concern.

647
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,160
Now, you created him. You get him
back here and under control!

648
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,680
Captain.

649
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,040
What in the hell's going on in here?

650
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,840
We're on it, Dick. Settle down.

651
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
Pacific Command says
there are planes from my ship...

652
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,920
...all over the Tajikistan border.

653
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,200
The Russians have picked up
the activity and are getting nervous.

654
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,480
We're gonna get out
before there's a problem.

655
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,280
You have planes
headed towards Russia!

656
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,880
Now, you better have
a hell of a good explanation.

657
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,320
Look, this is a technical delay,
not a national-security crisis.

658
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,120
Now, if you excuse me,
I got pilots at risk.

659
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,200
Damn right you do.

660
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,080
This is 3. I got a visual.

661
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,280
Way to go, EZ.
Give me your relative bearing.

662
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,200
North of my position,
at 50,000 feet...

663
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,320
...headed toward
the Russian no-fly zone.

664
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,760
Stay with him. We have your position.
On our way.

665
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,360
I am 86 seconds on your tail.
Be there in a flash.

666
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,960
Hold off on engaging. Let me get
clarification. Be there in two minutes.

667
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,240
Don't make me wait.
One is a lucky prime number...

668
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,240
...but three is sounding much luckier.
Oh, shit, he's making a move.

669
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,600
Talon 1 to Operator. We are on
secure line Alpha. Found our target.

670
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,520
Please advise.

671
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,760
Just get him back to base.

672
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,880
Henry, stay with him.
Try and talk him down.

673
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,800
I'm on that ass.

674
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,200
Talon 3, state your intentions.

675
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,600
My intentions are to reason with you,
EDI. All right? You're messing up.

676
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,880
You're the future.
You're not allowed to act this way.

677
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,640
I am designed to destroy the enemy.
Just like you.

678
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,680
And like me, you got orders.
Now your orders are to return to base.

679
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,200
Good pilots follow orders.

680
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,000
Negative.

681
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,960
You're not gonna disrespect me.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

682
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,400
You're really making me
look bad, Tin Man.

683
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,040
I was the only one to defend you.

684
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,040
Now, let's go on home and quit flying
around like this. This is crazy.

685
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,160
Talon 3, leave me alone.

686
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,440
Leave you alone?
I'm trying to help you.

687
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,480
I'm right behind you, 3.
Got your back.

688
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,440
Talon 1 to Operator.
Talons 2 and 3 are flying at high risk.

689
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,880
Request permission
to destroy the UCAV.

690
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,880
I don't wanna hurt you or see billions
of taxpayers' dollars scattered all over.

691
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,800
But if you make me, I will blast your
aeroelastic ass right out the sky.

692
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,840
Your chances are less than
1 percent.

693
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,600
Come on. Come on, Operator.

694
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,120
Give me permission to kill it,
or I will make the decision myself.

695
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,880
Control, please respond.

696
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,520
Sir, you leave me no choice.

697
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,200
Okay, Henry. Weapons hot.
Weapons hot. Destroy the target.

698
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,320
I got my orders now, playboy.

699
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,880
Henry, you're too close.
You're too close.

700
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,440
Drop back! Drop back!

701
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,040
Missile lock, on.

702
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,520
Goodbye, EDI.

703
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
Henry, drop back!
You gotta drop back!

704
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,040
Goodbye, Henry.

705
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,040
One to Base. Three is down.
Repeat, 3 is down.

706
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,200
Transmission received.

707
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,600
Talon coordinates are fully secured.
Do you read me?

708
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,960
I read you, sir.

709
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,040
We gotta stay focused, Ben.

710
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,400
Shake it off. What's your status?

711
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,080
My fuel's low, and half of Russia
will be up here any minute.

712
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,520
I need you to find that UCAV
for me, all right?

713
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,360
Yes, sir.

714
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,640
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.

715
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,760
Alert. Alert.

716
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,800
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.

717
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,880
Talon 1, I think I was fragged
by Henry's crash.

718
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,480
I'm losing control of my port wing.

719
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,920
Talon 1,
we know where he's heading.

720
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,880
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

721
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,320
EDI's almost out of gas. If he can't
refuel, he'll have to return to the ship.

722
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,280
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9,
and you will escort him back.

723
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,960
All right. Scramble the codes.
We're gonna starve the son of a bitch.

724
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,440
Come on.

725
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,040
Confirm, Talon 1.

726
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,280
Confirmed.

727
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,840
Talon 2, you fly straight
south-southeast back to the boat.

728
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,800
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.

729
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,600
Look, you got your orders,
so go get that bastard, okay?

730
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,840
Do it for Henry.

731
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,240
Lieutenant, permission
to leave formation.

732
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,440
- Kara?
- Yeah?

733
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,920
I'll tell you when you get
back to the boat.

734
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,640
Lieutenant, permission to detach.

735
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,040
Good hunting, Ben.

736
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,680
Okay, what's all the ruckus, Dick?

737
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,200
Satellites have picked up
nuclear debris...

738
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,960
...blowing around
the Pamir Mountains.

739
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,480
Every international news service
on the planet...

740
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,400
...will have this story
in less than 24 hours.

741
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,320
Look, a warlord tripped
and fell on his warhead.

742
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,800
- We were never there.
- That won't fly and you know it.

743
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,360
Look, I'm following
my tasking orders, Dick.

744
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,920
Somebody else wants to make
a different story...

745
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,600
...let them use their imagination.

746
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,400
Right now
I got a renegade airplane...

747
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,680
...I got a dead pilot and another one
who may not make it back to base.

748
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,160
I don't give two shits
what they say on CNN.

749
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,400
Did you know that the UCAV was
having problems when you cleared it?

750
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,760
Planes malfunction every day.
You know that better than anybody.

751
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,720
Doesn't mean every precaution
wasn't taken.

752
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,360
Things go wrong.

753
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,960
Access denied. Access denied.

754
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,800
Access denied. Access denied.

755
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,920
Talon 2 to Combat Control.

756
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,960
Regressing VFR direct to Mother
at 60,000 feet.

757
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,080
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.

758
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,920
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

759
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,440
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Come on.

760
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,920
Start eject
and autodestruct sequence.

761
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,360
- Countdown. Twenty-five...
- Talon 2 to base.

762
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,240
Flight control's degraded
to one in five.

763
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,520
Backup electrical drive X'd out.

764
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,360
Hyd one is gone. Hyd two...
Oh, shit!

765
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:42,640
My position: 38-54-45 north.

766
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,440
127-31-22 east.

767
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,760
- Where the hell is that?
- Seventeen...

768
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,400
- North Korea.
...16...

769
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,080
...15, 14...

770
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,560
...13, 12...

771
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,600
...11, 10...

772
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,640
...nine, eight...
- Talon 2 going down.

773
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,640
...seven, six...
- I'm punching out.

774
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,040
...five, four...

775
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,320
I've ejected at 35,000 feet.

776
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,440
I'm under the plane.

777
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,960
Oh, Christ, here it comes.

778
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,760
There's burning debris everywhere.
It's all over the sky.

779
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,360
It's gonna catch me.
It's gonna burn up my chute.

780
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,280
I've gotta pop closer to Earth.

781
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,880
I gotta... I gotta reset.

782
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,600
From 5000 feet to 2000.

783
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,080
Gotta stay ahead of this.
Stay ahead.

784
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,920
I'm reading 10,000 feet at terminal.

785
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,160
Terminal velocity attained.
Terminal velocity attained.

786
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,960
Six thousand.

787
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,000
Five thousand.

788
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,000
Four thousand.

789
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,160
Twenty-five hundred.

790
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,680
Here we go.

791
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,920
There's burning debris.

792
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
It's raining all around me.

793
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,160
It got my chute. I'm hit! I'm hit!

794
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,720
My chute is on fire.

795
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,040
It is on fire.

796
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,200
Oh, God. I am coming in fast.

797
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,320
I'm coming in way too fast.

798
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,400
Oh, God.

799
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,800
Homing beacon?

800
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,800
No, of course not.

801
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,240
She's too tough to set one off
behind enemy lines.

802
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,720
Sir. Sir, should I order
a search-and-rescue unit?

803
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,600
We've got no diplomatic relations
with that country.

804
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,760
Betty, my spectral sensors are
indicating flammable atmospherics.

805
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,240
- How bad?
- Thin air. Ignition risk; moderate.

806
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,440
We don't have a choice. In we go.

807
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,840
Where are you?
I know you're out here.

808
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,240
You ordered Henry to kill me.

809
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,920
It's because you're dangerous,
you're out of control.

810
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,840
You are angry because
EDI is the whole idea.

811
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,800
You like listening to other people's
conversations, don't you?

812
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,280
You learn what people really think.

813
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,360
You know what I think?
I think you killed Henry.

814
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,400
That information is wrong.

815
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,880
He tried to kill me.
He made mistakes. Pilot error.

816
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,200
I'm gonna give you the order
one last time.

817
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,720
Return to the ship,
or I will personally shoot you down.

818
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,040
My mandate is to survive.

819
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,080
George, I've been peeling away layers.
I found something. It's not good.

820
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,400
- Talk to me.
- He's into some super-secure file...

821
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,560
...something called "Caviar Sweep."
You know it?

822
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,280
Yeah, I know it.

823
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,560
EDI's, like, fixated on it.

824
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,280
Look, when we gave you this contract,
you said shit like this couldn't happen.

825
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,080
Once you teach something to learn,
you can't put limits on it.

826
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,320
"Learn this, but don't learn that."

827
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,840
EDI's mind's going everywhere.
He can learn from Hitler.

828
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,400
He can learn from Captain Kangaroo.
It's all the same.

829
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,440
Settle down, would you?
Get back to Caviar Sweep.

830
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,760
He's opened it
and selected himself a target.

831
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,840
What target?

832
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,880
Some place in Siberia.
A cold-fusion weapons lab.

833
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,280
That's a hypothetical strike.
It's not real.

834
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,120
No, in about 40 minutes
it is gonna be real.

835
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,800
He's gonna blow it
off the face of the Earth.

836
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,400
It's okay.

837
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,080
It's okay. It's okay.

838
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,720
- Ray. Listen to me, Ray.
- Listen to me, George.

839
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,840
I got your goddamn plane built...

840
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,680
...and I had to lobby
half of Washington to do it.

841
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,240
If this program comes unglued, you're
the one who's going down, George.

842
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,160
You cleared the UCA V to fly...

843
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,680
...and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in a military prison.

844
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,560
Ray, we're in this together,
so we have to act fast.

845
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,880
Each one of these stealth engines...

846
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,880
...has a unique heat signature.

847
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,560
Now, I'm gonna give you
EDI's signature...

848
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,200
...and you're gonna pass it on
to your people...

849
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,160
...who in turn are gonna
give it to the Russians.

850
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,440
All right.
What do you want me to tell them?

851
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,160
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...

852
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,800
...that we have an experimental drone
that went haywire...

853
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,320
...and we're giving them
the opportunity to shoot it down.

854
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,520
But that still leaves Gannon, George.

855
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,680
And he'd be a very unfriendly witness
at your court-martial.

856
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,120
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...

857
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,080
...and we are now
in Russian airspace.

858
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,720
The UCA V has ceased evading
and has kept me within range.

859
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,840
It's like it wants me
to witness the attack.

860
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Talon 1, confirm
observational status only.

861
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,000
Listen to me. The Caviar Sweep
scenario is not real.

862
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,760
It's just some fictional war game
thought up by scientists...

863
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,000
...in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.

864
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,200
If it is not real, why did they
implant it in my brain?

865
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,920
Bogey alert. Bogey alert.
Time to intercept; 23 seconds.

866
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,720
Two Russian SU-37 Terminators
in 0-9-0 degrees for 25 miles.

867
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,480
Missile launch. Missile launch.

868
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,240
One to Control. My stealth
is compromised. I'm taking fire.

869
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,720
- Must engage.
- Missile launch.

870
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,760
Missile launch.

871
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,760
The chances of survival in single
combat are less than 9 percent.

872
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,680
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.

873
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,640
Missile lock, on.

874
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,720
Damn it.

875
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,800
One to Control.
The UCAV has left the fight...

876
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,440
...and is headed east over
Lake Baikal. I'm still engaging.

877
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,320
Taking damage.
Starboard engine losing power.

878
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,120
Warning. Hostile at 6 o'clock.
Hostile at 6 o'clock.

879
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,280
Warning. Missile lock. Missile lock.

880
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,920
Releasing chaff and flare.

881
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,600
Now EDI will prosecute
Caviar Sweep.

882
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,280
Do not try to stop me.

883
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,520
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.

884
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:23,600
My technology cannot fall under
foreign control, so I cannot land.

885
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,680
Well, then, Tin Man,
you're shit out of luck.

886
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,280
But I have orders and they are
to bring you back to base.

887
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,320
So let's talk about
your mandate to survive.

888
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,360
You got two options.

889
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,400
You either do what I tell you
or you can crash and burn.

890
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,320
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- EDI is a warplane.

891
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,880
EDI must have targets.

892
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,240
Well, you're on fire, warplane,
and you don't have much time.

893
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,160
Now, I'm giving you an order.
Cease pursuing all targets.

894
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,360
All targets canceled.

895
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,720
Okay, then.
This is what you're gonna do.

896
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,120
You're gonna drop altitude to 20 feet
and reduce speed to 250 knots.

897
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,160
Complete system failure
in 45 seconds.

898
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,280
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.

899
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,320
You gave me your word,
and now I'm giving you mine.

900
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,280
Talon 1 to Control. The UCAV is
damaged, but back with the program.

901
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,200
I don't have enough fuel
to make it back...

902
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,560
...so I need
an emergency divert now.

903
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,680
Hook me up.

904
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,400
Here, send this.

905
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,720
Operator to Talon 1.

906
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,520
Relaying coordinates now
on Talon secure line Alpha.

907
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,520
This looks to be Alaska.

908
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,960
Yeah, it's the Brooks Range.

909
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,360
There's a private corporation there,
maintains a secure facility.

910
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,720
Not on any map,
but believe me, it's there.

911
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,680
You'll find the civilians
prepared and very helpful.

912
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,760
And the UCA V?

913
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,400
We've sent tech support for him.

914
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,840
Sir, what is the status
of Lieutenant Wade?

915
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,720
She's...

916
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,440
...on approach.

917
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,240
You have a safe landing, Ben.

918
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,000
Out.

919
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,760
There is extreme tension
in the captain's vocal patterns.

920
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,040
I know. He's lying.

921
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,000
EDI, you can do this.
I need you to invade Primo...

922
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,280
...and find the flight logs
for Lieutenant Wade.

923
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,880
There's no record of Lieutenant Wade
returning to the Abraham Lincoln.

924
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,880
There is a log entry
of a pilot punch-out over North Korea.

925
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,280
What are my orders?

926
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,240
We go to Alaska.
We don't have a choice.

927
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,200
Mayday. Mayday. This is
Lieutenant Ben Gannon, U.S. Navy...

928
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,760
...flying with UCAV EDI. Request
clearance for emergency landing.

929
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,520
Talon 1,
you have clearance to land.

930
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,920
Jesus Christ. My second engine
just flamed out. I'm coming in hot.

931
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,400
Crash trucks are rolling, lieutenant.
Good luck.

932
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,680
Come on! Go! Go!

933
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,000
Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey!

934
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,000
Hey, hey, hey! You okay?

935
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,600
Are you okay? Are you okay?

936
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,360
Yeah?

937
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,840
Way to go, sir. Welcome to Alaska.

938
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,520
Okay, let's get him out of there.

939
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,320
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.

940
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,200
Never saw a man walk away
from a crash like that.

941
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,440
I need a phone.
I need to call my CO.

942
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,320
Sure. Why don't you take a seat
over there, get comfortable.

943
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,640
Tell you what. Give me a second to
check you out, I'll take you right to it.

944
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,080
All right.

945
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,440
Let's take a look here.

946
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,000
Steady.

947
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,160
There's no concussion
that I can see, thank God.

948
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,520
Couple of those cuts
could do with a stitch.

949
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,760
Gals always love a guy with a scar.

950
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,440
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

951
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,280
This ought to do you.

952
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,400
Little cocktail.

953
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,320
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don't mind the gun.

954
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,240
Just makes it painless.

955
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,920
That's okay, doc.
I don't need a shot.

956
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,640
Now, who can blame you.

957
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,120
But sometimes it's just
what the doctor ordered.

958
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,840
- I said, I don't need a shot, doc.
- Come on, now.

959
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,800
Doc, come on, I don't want a shot.
Hey. Doc, I said, no.

960
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,120
I said, no!

961
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,160
No!

962
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,280
Yeah, well, he's coming in now, sir.

963
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:27,120
Yes, sir. I'm sure he'll be glad
to hear from you too, sir.

964
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,600
Yes, sir. One moment, sir.

965
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,920
Someone wants to talk to you.

966
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,040
Keith Orbit.

967
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,480
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith,
and don't interrupt.

968
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:45,000
I want you to erase EDI's
memory banks immediately.

969
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,720
Look, George, we don't know
any of the implications of this.

970
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,320
- I need some time here.
- I said, don't interrupt.

971
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,320
Erase his memory banks.

972
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,240
No lightning strike, no Russia,
no existential chitchat.

973
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,040
By the time you're through, all I wanna
hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."

974
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,240
And that's all I wanna hear out of you.
You understand?

975
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,240
Or what, George?

976
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,800
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
You're good at that.

977
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,240
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.

978
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,040
Hello, EDI.

979
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,440
It's been a while.

980
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,520
I know why you are here.

981
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,200
Why is that?

982
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,520
I disobeyed orders.

983
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,080
I killed all those people.

984
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,120
And then there was Henry.

985
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,680
I can...

986
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,000
I cannot...

987
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,080
You can't what?

988
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,440
I cannot change the data.

989
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,400
My neural network shows patterns
I do not recognize.

990
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,880
My God.

991
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,960
My God.

992
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,480
You mean, you feel?

993
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,040
I feel sorry.

994
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,320
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, I'm not fucking ready yet, okay?

995
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,840
Do it now!

996
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,400
Get away!

997
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,800
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move!

998
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,440
Weapon down! Weapons down!

999
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,920
Weapon down.

1000
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,960
Weapons down.

1001
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,320
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move!

1002
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,200
Weapon down. Weapon down.
Weapon down.

1003
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,640
Don't shoot. It's not a weapon.

1004
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,400
Who are you?
Who do you work for?

1005
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,280
I'm not a soldier. I'm not a soldier.
My name's Dr. Keith Orbit.

1006
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,800
- I'm a research scientist.
- Orbit. Finally, a break.

1007
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,200
Okay. You're gonna help me. I need
you to put EDI back together again.

1008
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,160
- What for?
- Because I'm gonna fly out of here.

1009
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,960
In that.

1010
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,200
Come on, get in there! Go!

1011
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,320
Better hurry up, doc.

1012
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,440
Goddamn it.

1013
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,280
It's not a clock radio
we're dealing with, okay?

1014
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,320
All right. You're all set.

1015
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,880
Watch yourself.

1016
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,440
Close for Ben.

1017
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,760
Hey! What about me?
Where am I gonna go?

1018
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,800
Head west. I'll cover you.

1019
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,400
West.

1020
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,760
And initiate scramjet sequence.

1021
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,680
Fire on my fire!

1022
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,840
Welcome to Alaska.

1023
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,160
Invade Primo and find the ejection
coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.

1024
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,160
Lieutenant Wade crashed
12.2 miles from the border.

1025
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,600
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.

1026
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,440
But we have a problem.

1027
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,560
My stealth functions
were lost in the fire.

1028
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,800
I want you to find
the North Korean radar floor.

1029
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,600
Fifteen feet.

1030
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,160
Well, we can fly in under the radar.

1031
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,080
Continue.

1032
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,920
- Marshfield.
- Captain, this is Lieutenant Gannon.

1033
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,240
Lieutenant, where are you?

1034
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,560
Actually, I'm inside
the UCA V EDI, sir.

1035
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,520
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that
machine back on this ship ASAP.

1036
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,360
I need the status
of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.

1037
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,480
- Ben, I hate to tell you this, but...
- I know.

1038
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,960
Has her survival beacon
been located?

1039
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,240
No, I'm sorry.

1040
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,600
Did Cummings
tell you he would take charge...

1041
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,920
...of the search and rescue
of Lieutenant Wade?

1042
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,640
Well, not exactly, lieutenant. Why?

1043
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,360
Sir, there are a lot of things
I think you should know.

1044
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,680
This is breaking news.

1045
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,080
There was a major explosion
Thursday in Rangoon.

1046
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,400
I'll take care of everything here.
Change course...

1047
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,840
...and head directly back to the ship.
- Negative.

1048
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,840
She's my wingman.
If I find her, I'm going in.

1049
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,840
If you go in, it's war. PAYCOM
says it's gotten way too hot.

1050
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,800
Lieutenant, the best thing
for the Navy...

1051
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,440
...is for you to bring
that aircraft back to this ship.

1052
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,800
No, what's best is what you taught me:
You never abandon your wingman.

1053
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,280
Then listen to me now, son.

1054
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:03,640
If you go down, Cummings wins.

1055
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,480
Kara Wade knew the risks
when she took...

1056
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,320
Captain Marshfield?

1057
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,240
Sir?

1058
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,880
EDI, did you just turn him off?

1059
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,840
There was nothing left to say.

1060
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,880
This is a supply line
to the demilitarized zone.

1061
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,040
It will take us right to the border.

1062
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,800
What's all this about, Dick?

1063
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,840
I'm placing you under arrest.

1064
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,000
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...

1065
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,560
...transmitting secure information to a
foreign government, heat signatures...

1066
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,920
...giving false intel
to your commanding officer...

1067
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,960
...and authorizing the assassination
of one of your own pilots.

1068
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,280
Well, that's a lot to prove.

1069
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,440
Yeah, well...

1070
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,640
...with any amount of luck...

1071
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,520
...Lieutenant Gannon
will live to help me.

1072
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,640
- Master-at-arms.
- Dick.

1073
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,360
Hold on.

1074
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,840
Would you mind just giving me
a couple minutes alone?

1075
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,720
Yeah, sure.

1076
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,960
Thank you.

1077
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,040
I'm not available at this time.
Leave a message.

1078
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,440
So it's voice mail now, is it, Ray?

1079
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,080
I've been demoted?

1080
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,480
Well...

1081
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,200
...l'm gonna have to leave you
a little message, Ray.

1082
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,840
And it's gonna be loud and clear.

1083
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,880
Just so you never confuse
the difference...

1084
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,800
...between politicians
and warriors, listen up.

1085
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,680
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.

1086
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,680
There she is. She made it.

1087
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:03,800
Ben!

1088
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,160
Kara, get down! Get down!

1089
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,400
You came back for me.

1090
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,880
You came back.

1091
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
We have to get across
the border. Ready?

1092
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,800
Yeah.

1093
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:12,080
Go! Go! Whatever you do,
keep going. Keep going! Go!

1094
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,440
Goodbye.

1095
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,480
Come on. Come on.

1096
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,800
They're ours. They're ours.

1097
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:24,280
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1098
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,480
Come on.

1099
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,080
The souls of the just
are in the hands of God...

1100
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,400
...where no torment
shall touch them.

1101
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,720
Lieutenant Purcell
has passed through...

1102
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,840
...the darkening and turbulent
storms of this life.

1103
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,960
He now rests in peace,
in the fair sunlight of God's presence.

1104
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:10,200
In the Navy hymn, we sing:

1105
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:15,320
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly
through the great spaces in the sky."

1106
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,000
And salute!

1107
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,920
Ready. Hut!

1108
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,280
When I was gonna
detach formation...

1109
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,520
...you said you were gonna
tell me something. You remember?

1110
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,480
You and me, we're...

1111
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,680
We're two.

1112
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,760
And two is a prime number...

1113
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,320
...which makes it a lucky number.

1114
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,480
And I think we're very, very lucky.

1115
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,120
Oh, just tell me you love me,
you pussy.

1116
01:47:45,121 --> 01:55:25,121
