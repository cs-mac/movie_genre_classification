1
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:43,556
…so if you're watching this
documentary right now

2
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:46,386
the truth of the situation is
it's been pirated

3
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:49,866
you're not meant to be watching,
but it's so important that everybody

4
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:51,366
gets to watch this thing
we're giving it out

5
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,386
Ssh! Don't tell anybody.

6
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,416
One!

7
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:13,516
To everybody that's about to watch,
make sure you pass it on

8
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,366
make sure the man next to you
watches, make sure he watches

9
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,566
make sure everybody watches
make sure the message gets out

10
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:21,446
-Free the knowledge
-you understand: the message

11
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:24,396
-Free the knowledge
-it's like my brother says,

12
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:28,516
be free-minded, think for yourself,
don't get caught up in rubbish

13
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,586
Peace

14
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,446
When I first started this movement,
I told Adie about it

15
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:39,476
he was skeptical but he says to me
"if you can set the one order, set it"

16
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,566
so I'm still pushin',
and, like, now you ain't here bruv,

17
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,366
it makes it even more real.
We ain't promised tomorrow...

18
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,566
so, let's make the most of today.
Rest in peace Adie Williams

19
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:56,446
-Rest in peace - Adam Williams
-Rest in peace - Adam Williams

20
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:59,446
 -brother from another mother,
it's my family, that is
-One.

21
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:26,606
Everyone's walking around casual,
like, like zombies, but...

22
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:31,286
There's some fucked-up shit
going on, man.

23
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:34,326
You look around at everyone
and everyone's just normal, like.

24
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,446
Go home, read the papers,
watch the news,

25
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:37,566
kick back, have a cup of tea

26
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,566
and get back up
to do the same shit again.

27
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,496
No one ain't got a passion
for this thing, like me.

28
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:44,496
On the streets of Birmingham...

29
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,586
Tonight, another shooting,
another victim.

30
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,616
Probably going on
about 15 years now,

31
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:57,416
this beef in Birmingham's
been going on,

32
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,676
between Burgers and Johnsons.

33
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,526
Three fatal shootings
in as many weeks.

34
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,526
Birmingham now has the highest
concentration of gun crime

35
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:07,316
in the country,

36
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:11,376
with three serious gun crime
incidents here every single day.

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,486
The Burgers,
they're the Handsworth guys, innit?

38
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:19,496
And Johnnies are Aston.

39
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,556
These are the two notorious gangs
in Birmingham.

40
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,456
This man had an argument
with that man.

41
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,496
Next thing, a punch turns to a stab,
a stab turns to a gun

42
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:30,376
and somebody's shot.

43
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,386
If I see you, I think,
"Ain't that my man from that area?"

44
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,426
It's on sight?

45
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,556
What do you mean "on sight"?

46
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:39,406
- You see anyone, just fuck 'em up.
- In what way?

47
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:42,646
Fuck 'em up, man. Kill 'em.
Beat 'em up. Stab 'em up. Shoot 'em.

48
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,466
That's what it's come to,
a postcode thing.

49
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:47,726
You're from this area,
you're involved. It's simple.

50
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:51,486
What's the war about?

51
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:53,496
I don't even know, you know.

52
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,646
Hear them guns blow in the ghetto

53
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,636
For that big or that small dough

54
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:02,606
Beef burns slow like the bloods
at the hydro for my dough...

55
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:04,456
Show us. What happened?

56
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,686
Yeah, I got stabbed there.

57
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:08,536
Once there on my arm.

58
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:10,486
It's gang stuff, really.

59
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:13,386
How many of your friends
have been stabbed or shot?

60
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,456
Loads of my friends
have been stabbed.

61
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,516
Loads of my friends
have been shot, like.

62
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:20,496
Gotta be very aware
of your surroundings.

63
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,286
What do you mean?

64
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,506
Just, like, a lot of people...

65
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:27,486
This is like a kind of main road
in Handsworth, as well.

66
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,286
A lot of people
sometimes drive past here

67
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,396
and see if they can see someone
from this area

68
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:33,506
to try and pick them off.

69
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,546
And it's always constantly
just looking over your back.

70
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:42,416
I watch every car that goes past,
so I know who's in there.

71
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,546
A man no take backchat

72
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:45,416
Man will back a weapon

73
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,576
Probably a 4/5 or a MAC-11

74
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,366
And there ain't nothin'
you can tell 'em

75
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,646
Man, I pop your melon and a shot
straight to your cerebellum

76
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,446
And it's real struggle
that I'm reppin'

77
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:57,726
And I can't see the rats around me
but I can smell 'em...

78
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,446
It's a shame that...

79
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,666
..I'm so used to people
getting stabbed and getting shot.

80
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:08,456
It's a shame.

81
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:11,596
Every day I wake up,
"Such and such got shot. Swear down."

82
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,586
Cos are we really winnin'?
Are the kids grinnin'?

83
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,566
When shots go off
in a man's christening

84
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,496
They say niggers don't listen
All this black on black

85
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,386
Will there be peace
now that Silk's missing?

86
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,606
13's missing?

87
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:27,596
- Look. See that there?
- A wall.

88
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,536
- And that there?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,486
Slugs. Right there and right there.

90
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,696
- Unfortunately, I was the target.
- You were the target?

91
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:38,666
- Yeah, right here.
- Bloody hell.

92
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,476
How fast you can get
into the alley there.

93
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:43,656
Look at the gate.
It's got a padlock on there now.

94
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:45,596
I would have been dead.

95
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,526
Aston, home of gun crime, G.

96
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,406
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

97
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,686
Zoom on a motorbike. Jump off.
That's some next shit, blood.

98
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,666
I'll be duckin' and divin'
Bustin' at hood niggers mainly

99
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,516
I got shot once
That's enough shit for me, baby

100
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:03,336
Shine a gun, rude boy
I'm staying daily...

101
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,426
You see a man walking, catching,
you run upon him, so he don't see.

102
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,586
Now, if you're doing that,
you're living like that,

103
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,396
then you're gonna wanna be aware
of some people doing that to you.

104
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,486
You have to be on point.

105
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:19,316
Especially, if you're at the height
of shit that's going down,

106
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,576
you have to be very on point.

107
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:49,576
You moan about the people
that are gone and you just think,

108
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:54,436
"How many more people have to go
because these people have gone?"

109
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,656
And, like, ain't there no way,
like, you know..?

110
00:06:57,446 --> 00:07:00,616
If we could ask these people
what they really want, like,

111
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:02,646
you're never gonna
come back and live,

112
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,506
but what would you want?

113
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,526
I guarantee you,
half of them will say,

114
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,326
"To stop killing each other.
You don't wanna be here like this."

115
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:12,606
This cannot be living.

116
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,516
I don't believe this is
what we were put here to do,

117
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:17,386
just do what we're doing.

118
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,606
I think there's more to it than this.

119
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,536
So what did you do?

120
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:26,376
Phoned Penny up, yourself,
cos you'd finished doing the film,

121
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,416
so I know you had connections
with some of them Burgers and that.

122
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:33,546
So I contacted you to contact Dylan,

123
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:36,456
who's affiliated with Burgers.

124
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,726
Yeah, it's Flash. Waagwaan?

125
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:39,726
What you sayin', G? What's happenin'?

126
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,546
So Shabba called me,

127
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,396
because I got to know young men
on both sides of the conflict,

128
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:48,536
while researching
my film One Day, in 2007.

129
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:53,606
I stayed good friends with Dylan
who played Flash in the film.

130
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,396
I got a phone call from Penny

131
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,626
saying that a guy named Shabba
from the B6 side of town

132
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,596
was thinking about any way
where there could be a truce.

133
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:08,436
My first initial thought was,
"OK, this is against the grain."

134
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:11,506
If my friends hear I'm talking to somebody
from the other side of town,

135
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:15,376
or people I wanna associate with,
they're thinking, "Yo, I'm dodgy."

136
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,506
So my first thought was
"Do I really wanna do it?"

137
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,516
Then I thought to myself
I've got kids coming up,

138
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,536
I've heard 'em talk about
this gang stuff, so I'm obliged to.

139
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,486
Wanna be a gunman, do ya?

140
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,356
Just making the film One Day,

141
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,606
I've got these kids running up to me
saying, "Yo, Flash, Flash, Flash."

142
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:34,446
I feel obliged to push this message -
you don't wanna be like Flash,

143
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:37,576
you don't want that lifestyle,
you don't wanna be involved in that.

144
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,386
Shabba, you made it.

145
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,696
And how did you feel
before the meeting?

146
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,646
Before the meeting, I was nervous.
I'm not gonna lie.

147
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:53,626
I don't really get nervous like that.

148
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,606
This is some different kind of stuff,
cos it's against all rules.

149
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,426
It goes against
what I grew up to believe in,

150
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,646
even though it's rubbish.

151
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:05,486
For me to go into the room, I was
nervous, thinking, "What is this?"

152
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,406
I could have went in there
and he's gonna think,

153
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,656
"There's my man from that side of town.
Let's get rid or fuck him up."

154
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,696
You wake up every day saying,
"Something is not right."

155
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:15,486
Yeah.

156
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:18,436
I don't know
if we're gonna get a next chance

157
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,596
to come back in a next world
and do it again.

158
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,516
Well, we're only gonna get
this one chance, innit, brother?

159
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:27,496
Like I says, you're only gonna be
10 once, 20 once, 30 once.

160
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:31,356
There's no part two of this, next year
or in the next lifetime.

161
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,526
Bruv, right now, it's real.

162
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:35,516
I've lost a load of friends.
I've lost a load of people.

163
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,326
A load of people around me...
Misery, and a load of angry people.

164
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,466
You wake up and think, "I can't be
living like this. It's not a joke."

165
00:09:42,506 --> 00:09:43,656
Yeah, it's not. Do you get me?

166
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:46,596
You're burying your friend.
You've done your crying.

167
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,516
You can't be living like this, man.
This is crazy. You understand it?

168
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:54,396
Who else can I think of
that's gonna come up and say,

169
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,446
"You know what?
We have to stop this ting,"

170
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:59,646
and can actually get to the next side
and get back and vice versa?

171
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:03,506
So it's a good thing for me
to be sitting here with Dylan.

172
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,516
Being able to pass messages
and get messages back and forward

173
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,516
to let people know
it's not that time.

174
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:11,476
So you can't call five man
out of college to do this job.

175
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,526
This job has to be taken care of
by people that are affiliated,

176
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,526
whether they're out there banging...

177
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,496
You need to be around these members.
Man, active...

178
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,376
In half an hours time,

179
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,466
I could be with a man
who's licking off heads and that.

180
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,596
That's how real it is and
it's a small world.

181
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:30,416
Yeah.

182
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:32,646
How are we gonna really do this?
Kind of, like, you get me?

183
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:34,606
Like I says, it could, like...

184
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,416
it could put men in problems.

185
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,556
I'm not gonna lie.
Some people might not like it.

186
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,416
It's gonna be hard
to get through, though.

187
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,456
I don't get paid. There's no reward.

188
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:47,706
The only thing that could come
of this is someone could say,

189
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:49,526
"Fuck him, we're lighting him up."

190
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,446
So that's why I know
my heart's in it.

191
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,706
I believe, if we don't do it,
no one's gonna do it.

192
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,546
We've gotta try and do it.

193
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,406
Even if nothing comes of it,

194
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,486
when they mention
Burgers, Johnnies or war,

195
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:03,326
they'll know that at least
there's a man out there thinking,

196
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,486
"I'll try and do something."

197
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,446
Man can’t ever tell me
how much I've put my life on the line

198
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:08,486
for my community.

199
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,456
That thing what we did yesterday

200
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,546
is bigger than what anybody
could imagine,

201
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:18,356
Just for us to have spoken.

202
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,616
Then I've sent a message that way.
And he's sent a message his way.

203
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:23,636
Are we meeting someone I know, Dylan?

204
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:25,626
I don't know if you've met...

205
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,306
How old is he?

206
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:33,346
26 now, but as far as I can remember,
he's always been around it so...

207
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:38,396
The kids need to understand
that they're arguing over nothin'.

208
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:39,546
All of this is over nothin'.

209
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,486
That's the scary thing about it.

210
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:59,366
If there's gonna be some peace
or whatever you wanna call it...

211
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:00,406
Order, you know it’s order

212
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:03,476
..yeah, order, I'm willing to try.

213
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:07,386
I just can't see it being like...
I dunno, man.

214
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,636
I'm not saying this is gonna be
straight peace like that,

215
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:11,426
but I'm saying...

216
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,656
Them lot hollered at Penny, you know.

217
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,486
This is what I keep saying to ya.
You see when you say, "Them lot?"

218
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:18,486
All right, I'll say an individual.

219
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:21,356
Shabba, That individual there,
he's not valid.

220
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:22,426
Yeah, I hear that.

221
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,506
I need to hear it from someone
who I know deep down inside my heart

222
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,366
that is up to no good.

223
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:30,516
But he's saying there's active men
that are involved in the thing

224
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,306
and these are men
doing stuff on the road.

225
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,496
They've said it from their heart.

226
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,286
If you can stop this thing,
stop it, innit?

227
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,556
These motherfuckers are not stupid.

228
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,566
They can be saying all that because
they wanna get involved in stuff.

229
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:46,386
They wanna get their fingers
dipped in certain little situations

230
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,606
that otherwise they couldn't have.

231
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,296
Would you talk to your enemy
to set us free?

232
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,496
Or just wait for the 5-0
to give you the key?

233
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,376
Cos ten men getting 30
That was injustice

234
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,486
When it was war
they taught us to bust this

235
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:02,436
How can we come together?
Cos they don't trust us

236
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,526
Where's the loyalty?
Is there no love left?

237
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,436
Ride and die for niggers
till there's no thugs left

238
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,576
Then bust the guns
till there's no slugs left

239
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:13,476
Cos the government's having a party
and they're calling it Illuminati

240
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,466
It's Boxing Day

241
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:17,726
There's been a shooting in town.

242
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,696
Gonna phone Shabba
and see what we can do.

243
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:23,596
Try to sort the situation out, innit?

244
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,506
I'm good to go right now, bruv.

245
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:29,336
We're here, innit,
so if you're free, you could link up.

246
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:35,566
Retaliation is
what I'm worried about.

247
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,416
Even though a meeting in town
could be dodgy,

248
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:40,596
before this escalates
and turns into some big drama,

249
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,526
Shabba and I have agreed
to hook up for the second time

250
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:45,516
to see if we can sort this out.

251
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:48,446
You shouldn't be making the youths
wind you up, though.

252
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:49,556
You've been around, yeah.

253
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,416
You've been around long enough
to know, blood.

254
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,596
It's like a lickle brother
winding you up and you say,

255
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,606
"You carry on,
I'm gonna beat you up."

256
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:58,636
You know what, say,
"Fuck him” man.

257
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,536
You can't be making men
bring you down to their level

258
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:03,406
to have youth activity, blood.

259
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,676
Since, man, I met up and that,
nothing ain't really happened.

260
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:09,636
Minor tings, but nothing on the
scale of how fucking last year was,

261
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,616
with this heat wave
of shooting and that.

262
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,476
Cos the next man dies now
or next shot goes off,

263
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:16,606
it's gonna get messy again.

264
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:19,446
I could get five men
and you could get five men

265
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,636
and they could sit there and say,

266
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,456
"You done this and you done that
and, yeah, my bredren this..."

267
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,666
What I'm sayin',
if we just stop it, blood...

268
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,486
Fuck it off. You get me blood?

269
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:31,346
Fuck it off, innit?
See how it goes for a bit, man.

270
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,706
This conversation's never been had.

271
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:39,576
15, 20 years
this gang thing's been running,

272
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:41,606
this conversation's never been had.

273
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,566
So what are people suspicious of?
What would they say?

274
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:48,386
People are suspicious we're doing it
with an ulterior motive.

275
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,496
It's either to get money

276
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:54,506
or there's the police involved
somewhere along the lines.

277
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,376
There's loads of things
people are wary about.

278
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,486
I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life.

279
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,496
I'm advising ya,
so don't be mad at me

280
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:04,326
or don't think
I'm trying to pull no stunts,

281
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,546
or it's not no money scam.

282
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,416
This is for all of us
in the long run, blood.

283
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:09,626
They don't seem to understand.
“Why would you wanna do it?”

284
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,546
But we're gonna show them
the bigger picture, bruv.

285
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,426
We're gonna keep it moving,
we’re gonna keep pushing.

286
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,386
This is the black holocaust

287
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:20,626
Where we're judged
by the way we walk

288
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,496
And close friends get killed
for the way we talk

289
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,396
You bring up so much anger
You're supposed to know

290
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:27,676
That this world
don't owe you anything

291
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,556
Cos we was born to lose
but built to win

292
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:35,556
You're not supposed to talk to the
enemy, as people would say, but...

293
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:38,526
I don't look at them as my enemy.

294
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:42,316
The life I live, government, police,
the way the system works,

295
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,416
I don't look at them as my enemy.

296
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:46,686
If people have got a problem
with them, fair enough,

297
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:49,516
but I wouldn't say my enemy.

298
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:52,346
I'd rather get up
and go and kill a policeman,

299
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,616
to tell the God's honest truth.

300
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:58,366
I'm more angry at them,
you know, than them.

301
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:59,476
I'm really mad at...

302
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:04,566
I think if you put
all these mans together

303
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:08,496
and make them have to fight a cause
like the Lozells riots...

304
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:11,336
Make them have
to fight a cause together.

305
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,486
I reckon, that's what will bring
everyone together again

306
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:18,496
and make people
appreciate each other.

307
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,526
That's what I'm sayin'.
Birmingham love all the way around.

308
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:30,526
He knows what it is already.
I don't have to say no more.

309
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:33,326
I'm from the older generation, man.

310
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,476
I used to follow my grandmother
with shopping

311
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,586
and you have to say hello
to every black woman

312
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,476
and every woman.

313
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:41,696
See, here's a big man right here.

314
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,556
You know, this is the man

315
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:48,376
that owns the dumpling shop
up the road, Sovereign's Café.

316
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,566
This is a documentary.

317
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,436
We're talking about resolving
the gang situation in Birmingham.

318
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:56,676
Tell them what you think about what's
going on with this gang situation

319
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,676
and how it was
back in your day, as well.

320
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,586
My days were proper.

321
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:02,506
Life was ever so simple.

322
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:04,396
We didn't fight each other.

323
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,466
Stop lying, man.
You fought the Teddy Boys.

324
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,606
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

325
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,566
But we didn't fight each other.

326
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:12,586
You know, we think about love.

327
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,616
We think about love and girls.

328
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:18,496
So in the riots, the ones in '85,
do you remember those?

329
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:20,456
I remember both of them.

330
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:22,426
I remember both of them.

331
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:25,476
Then people were fighting
the police and the National Front.

332
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:26,676
They weren't fighting each other.

333
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:29,706
No, they weren't fighting each other.
It was the police.

334
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:33,696
People were just fed up with society,
you know?

335
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,556
Nothing was happening,

336
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,466
so people just burst out one night,
the police.

337
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,566
When police lost control

338
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,416
of a half-mile stretch of road
in Handsworth,

339
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,456
the neighbourhood was reduced
to a blazing inferno.

340
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,606
The police were powerless to stop it.

341
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:49,586
The orgy of destruction that followed

342
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:52,416
made it look like something
out of the Blitz.

343
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,566
But, the tragedy is
that it's come after so many years

344
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:57,546
of very good community relations here

345
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,436
with nothing to indicate
that this would happen.

346
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:03,526
It is pure naked hooliganism

347
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,336
running on
into upright violence and theft.

348
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,436
Two days after having
one of the best carnivals

349
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:12,626
that we've ever had in the city,

350
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,486
and it would appear,
through insensitive policing again,

351
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,306
we're now struck
with this silly problem.

352
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,686
The bigger generation
were fighting for a real cause

353
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,626
which was to get rid of racism
out of Birmingham.

354
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,446
You know what I mean?

355
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,426
But it was never
no kill black-on-black crime.

356
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,666
We're arguing over postcodes
that don't belong to us.

357
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,476
Street corners
that don't belong to us.

358
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,746
We have to pay council tax
to live there.

359
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,476
We don't want these roads.
You're fighting for a postcode.

360
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,556
Do you own a postcode? No.

361
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:54,586
Like you were saying,
trust is a luxury.

362
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:56,426
Yeah, it is, man.

363
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,496
Trust is a luxury,
cos you can't trust anybody.

364
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,386
A lot of people let you down.

365
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,536
You trust anybody
and that makes you vulnerable.

366
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:07,496
You have to stay paranoid
to be on point and it's horrible.

367
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,506
It's been sad for a long time, Penny.
That's what I'm saying.

368
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,506
Man, a lot of heartache and things.
Right now, it's not that bad.

369
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,536
There's times
where you don't even wanna

370
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,496
be driving up on the road like this.

371
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,376
Do you understand it?

372
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,476
You know, when it's peak
and it's fully on, Shabs.

373
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,636
There's times when
you don't wanna be on the road.

374
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,476
You'll get the call saying, "Yo."
You get me?

375
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,546
There'll be gang bangers
driving around

376
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:35,506
looking for someone to lick down,

377
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:38,346
so you don't come on the road,
become a victim.

378
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,466
It gets like that.

379
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,576
To tell the truth,
it's been kind of hell.

380
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,606
People are falling out
with each other,

381
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:49,406
saying I'm trying to get to Hollywood
by making a documentary.

382
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:50,566
There's been bare arguments.

383
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,516
People are been saying,
"You're working with police."

384
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,546
We haven't been able
to film any of this madness,

385
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,566
because the mandem
don't allow cameras in the hood.

386
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,506
It's all good me having my opinion,

387
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:03,446
but without any backing,
it don't really make no sense.

388
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,656
Like I say,
for me to reach out to the elders,

389
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,486
they're not gonna listen to me,
cos they'll say,

390
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,286
"D boy, your opinion
don't really count like that."

391
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,546
So I need somebody with some weight
in this thing to back me on it.

392
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,366
Be the boss, paid the cost

393
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:16,486
It nearly ruined my life

394
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,366
Wasted years in the penny

395
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,426
So I'm newing my life

396
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:21,676
For all the dirt and the shit
I've been through in my life

397
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,526
I should be stuck in jail
doing the life

398
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,636
Touch down in H town
No more confined to a cell

399
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,646
A lot of niggers actin' hard
Spitting grimey as well

400
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,556
Never seen a prison yard
They no done no time in a cell

401
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,346
This for my gangsters
doing time with an L

402
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,546
Look, hot up out of prison

403
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:40,366
I feel I got religion...

404
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,646
Bredren Zilla's
just come out the penner.

405
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:43,516
He's original Burger Bar.

406
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,356
He's been doing this ting from
the get-go. Done eight years in jail.

407
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:50,406
This blood is influential.
Bad people listen when he speaks.

408
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:53,476
This is the prison right here.
You know what I'm sayin'?

409
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:56,556
You don't wanna be ending up
behind that wall.

410
00:20:57,346 --> 00:21:00,376
So they accused you
of trying to kill a policeman?

411
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,446
Yeah, times two.
Trying to kill two of them.

412
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:04,606
I was on two attempted murders
of the police.

413
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:06,496
That was my original charge.

414
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:09,396
Attempted murder times two
on two officers.

415
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,356
But they had to drop it
to a lesser charge,

416
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,546
cos they couldn't prove
that I tried to kill nobody.

417
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,496
Tryin' to say,
I tried to shoot one of them, yeah?

418
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:20,426
And the gun jammed.

419
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,686
Then I tried to shoot the next one
and the gun jammed.

420
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:24,706
But if the gun's jammed
on one person,

421
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,506
how can I attempt
to kill someone again?

422
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:29,356
It was just a load of shit.

423
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,406
I got eight-and-a-half years,

424
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,596
which I done eight years out of it,
more or less.

425
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:35,476
I've been jail enough times.

426
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,636
This time,
I tried to really learn something,

427
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:41,536
so when I get out, obviously,
I'm gonna do something right, innit?

428
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:45,396
You know, the place is a mess,
so my priority was,

429
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:48,436
if I can make one difference
in the hood where I come from,

430
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:50,686
then that's an achievement to me,
you get what I'm sayin'?

431
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,516
If I can deter one person from
ending up in there where I ended up,

432
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,346
that's an achievement for me, innit?

433
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,546
So that's what I want, innit?

434
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:03,586
I've got a lot of friends
left in jail still. You get me?

435
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:06,556
I feel their pain.

436
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:09,576
But mans here and some of them
ain't gonna get to experience this.

437
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,516
You understand what I'm sayin'?

438
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:18,376
Zilla has agreed
to support the movement 100%,

439
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,426
but he has asked us to highlight
the case of four of his friends,

440
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,556
who are doing life
after a high-profile trial.

441
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:28,496
The thing people remember most
about Burger Bar and Johnsons

442
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:32,426
is the tragic killing of Letisha
Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis

443
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,516
on New Year's Day, 2003.

444
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,486
This has got to end.

445
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,456
My daughter's life was cut short...

446
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,516
..by this killing.

447
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:04,436
A part of me died when Letisha died.

448
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,366
This is as bad as it gets.

449
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:10,606
Please help.

450
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,576
Please help.

451
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:17,416
OK.

452
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,716
But two wrongs don't make a right.

453
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,686
My friends were identified
by an anonymous witness

454
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:27,576
and Marcus Ellis got 35 years
based solely on his evidence.

455
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:34,616
I don't think
we've really taken on board,

456
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:38,526
what a serious step it is
to allow witnesses

457
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:41,426
to give evidence anonymously
in our courts,

458
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:45,466
speaking in Dalek voices
through voice-distortion equipment,

459
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,576
shielded from the view
of everyone in court,

460
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,456
sometimes even defending counsel.

461
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,626
You're not allowed
to ask another witness

462
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,456
if the anonymous witness
was even present at the scene.

463
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:57,656
You can't check.

464
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,466
What I've got is the prison records

465
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,546
that were made available to the court

466
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:07,406
of Mark Brown,
who is the anonymous witness.

467
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,546
He's at Brinsford
at the detention centre.

468
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:12,516
You're saying in June
that the Johnson boys are after you.

469
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:14,326
They've attacked you.

470
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,406
You were seen
wandering out of some toilets,

471
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:18,476
dazed and bleeding
with your clothes torn.

472
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:20,576
"Does that ring a bell?"
And he says, "Yes."

473
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,536
So then Nigel Rumfitt says,

474
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:26,486
"Cooperating with the police
started to become attractive to you."

475
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:28,276
Yeah, of course.

476
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,366
As soon as he started cooperating,

477
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:33,496
he was moved from Brinsford
to a different prison.

478
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:35,526
Vulnerable people,
in them situations,

479
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:38,446
do anything they can do
to get out of that situation.

480
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:40,656
Jail is not a nice place.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

481
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,666
You give your life away to the place.
You know, it's not nice.

482
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:46,506
When you visit the scene,

483
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:50,316
you begin to appreciate
how unbelievable the evidence

484
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,436
that that witness gave is.

485
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:56,476
The party was here at these premises.

486
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:59,726
Mark Brown, the anonymous witness,

487
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,556
claimed that he came out
for fresh air

488
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:08,506
and the vehicle
drove along the service road,

489
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:10,416
with tinted windows,

490
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:13,666
discharged a firearm,

491
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:18,476
sadly killing the two young girls.

492
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,606
This was round about 4:00am...

493
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,516
..at the very beginning of January,

494
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:29,506
so it would still
have been intensely dark.

495
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,536
So Mark Brown claimed
that he could clearly identify

496
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,556
four men wearing masks
in a moving car

497
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:38,536
with heavily tinted windows
in the middle of the night.

498
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:42,426
It's a matter of a split second

499
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:45,526
for the vehicle to go
past the relevant positions.

500
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:50,456
It would have been quite impossible
to identify anyone in that vehicle.

501
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:55,406
He then refuses
to attend an identity parade.

502
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:56,486
It's the same guy saying

503
00:25:57,276 --> 00:25:59,396
that he can't point these people out
in an ID parade,

504
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:02,586
that's saying that he could see
these people in a tinted-out car,

505
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:05,456
with masks on,
in the middle of the night.

506
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,516
But he can't go into a room,
bright as fuck! You understand it?

507
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:12,396
You can see their whole face,
and he can't pick them out there?

508
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:14,616
I don't know how people
feel about it. It's wrong, innit?

509
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:17,476
Okay, it's wrong, innit?
it's just blatantly wrong.

510
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:20,576
Because my friend
had the gang marker,

511
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:24,406
he was stitched up in a way
that wouldn't happen to anybody else

512
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:25,626
who didn't have this gang marker.

513
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,376
So, your car is gang affiliated.

514
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,436
Your house,
gang members go to this house.

515
00:26:30,476 --> 00:26:31,686
Everything becomes gang affiliated.

516
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:35,506
When you go to the court of law now
and that word "gang" comes up,

517
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:38,426
it gives them powers
to use acts that they've created

518
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:39,556
to go against gang members.

519
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,506
It started because there is
a great deal of witness intimidation.

520
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:46,366
And there's no doubt about that.
It does go on.

521
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:48,566
There are gangs
in our inner cities now,

522
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:50,536
gangs with access to firearms,

523
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,556
which is not something that used
to be as widespread as it is,

524
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,476
and there is a genuine problem.

525
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,726
But, in my view, it's a problem
primarily for the police,

526
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,586
whose relationship with certain
minorities of the inner cities

527
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:03,536
has broken down in recent years.

528
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:05,486
And it's a problem for politicians

529
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,416
to sort out questions
of social cohesion,

530
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:11,546
which make it so difficult for people
to give evidence.

531
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:15,346
What you can't do is address
a social problem like that

532
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:18,486
by throwing away
the thousand years of legal history

533
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:21,366
and the protection
of the rights of the accused

534
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:24,486
and by having unfair trials
to combat social problems.

535
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,436
It's not a remedy.

536
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:29,546
Marcus gave me that first phone call

537
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,516
and said, "Mum..."

538
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:42,566
He said,
"Mum... they've found me guilty."

539
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:46,476
And we both cried together.

540
00:27:48,296 --> 00:27:52,426
He says, "Mum, sometimes
when you're in the cell,

541
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:56,446
"the realisation
just hits you right in your face...

542
00:27:57,486 --> 00:27:58,586
"..that you're here."

543
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,446
And he even said to me

544
00:28:01,486 --> 00:28:05,496
that he visualised himself

545
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,426
in nursery and then school...

546
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:13,406
..primary school
and then secondary school,

547
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:15,616
and then he said to this.

548
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:18,616
And it just kind of
just knocked him for six.

549
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:26,456
On the... on...
on the streets of Birmingham.

550
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,656
Zilla was cool that we agreed
to highlight the case

551
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:31,546
and used his influence

552
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,446
to bring cameras
into the hood for the first time.

553
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,666
Cameras are a no-go in my community,

554
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:38,666
especially when we are
talking about gangs and whatnot,

555
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,676
so today's
kind of monumental, really.

556
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,616
What about one of these guys?
You're 17.

557
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,486
He's 16.
What are you, 15 today? 16 today?

558
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:50,276
You're 17 today?
God, you're getting old, man.

559
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:52,316
Big-arse youths, as well, man.
You're 17.

560
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,466
Stand up next to me, bruv.
He's 17, bruv.

561
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:55,746
What are you eating round here, bruv?

562
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,396
The other side of town
that ain't from here,

563
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:02,476
are they seen as, like, enemies
or just like..?

564
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:03,566
What's your take on it?

565
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,546
Now it's that bad, half of the men
can't even go to town.

566
00:29:07,336 --> 00:29:08,516
You have to go to town in a group.

567
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,446
And the police don't like that.

568
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,726
And if you go to town in a group,
police are looking to draw you.

569
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,666
You're drawing
more attention to yourself.

570
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,656
You don't want that.
You're going to buy some clothes.

571
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,636
Once you reach a certain age,
you ain't going to Newtown.

572
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:25,456
They don't know you. When they see
you, they think, "Who's this?"

573
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,586
You could be on it,
but they just don't know this.

574
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,496
Yeah, like I said,
everybody's defensive.

575
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:34,306
All that postcode shit
is a bag of bullshit to me.

576
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:37,396
I don't rep nothin' that owns
to the government. Me, myself and I.

577
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,576
You understand it, rude boy,
and it's the truth, huh?

578
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:49,626
I helped start all of this shit, man.

579
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,606
Started all of this shit.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

580
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:56,606
So it's my job
to try and fix it, innit?

581
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,376
I won't feel right
in myself otherwise.

582
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,496
We're bringing the hood together.
Stopping the fucking hood.

583
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,526
Say it like this,
say 50 men say, "Yeah, forget it,"

584
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:12,396
but one man out of 50 men,
something happens from the past.

585
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:15,606
Everyone's going back to what
they was doing before, innit?

586
00:30:16,396 --> 00:30:18,446
No one's not sticking
to what they was doing.

587
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,726
Just go back
to what it was before, blood.

588
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:23,536
If a man thinks
he can push my button,

589
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:27,366
that's a reason to fuck up, cos I'm
gonna make an example out of him.

590
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:29,606
I ain't allowing for anyone
to think that I'm a chump,

591
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:31,596
cos it can't work like that, blood.

592
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:33,586
It just don't make no sense, blood.

593
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,506
A man violates you.
That's one nil to him.

594
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,346
You go and lick down. You think
it's one nil to you cos he's dead.

595
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:43,506
Well, at the end of the day,
you're on the run.

596
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:47,316
Eventually, when you get caught
with the thing, you're fucked.

597
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:48,426
Then you're sitting down.

598
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:49,566
How have you won?

599
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:51,496
Your life's fucked, you know.

600
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:54,496
There's no winners.
That's what men need to understand.

601
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,336
We're not meant
to be warring like this, bruv.

602
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:03,596
Forget Birmingham and anything.
We're young men. Black brothers.

603
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:08,446
Fair enough, but when they see you,
even so you wanna stop whatever...

604
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,546
- Yeah, bruv.
- You know what's gonna happen.

605
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,346
I’m gonna have to be a man.
That's what I'm sayin'.

606
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:15,456
So what, you're supposed
to get beat up?

607
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,586
No, this what I'm showing ya.
I'm not sayin' that.

608
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,526
Us elders, we have
to link up with their elders

609
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:23,556
and talk to our youths and
they have to talk to their youths.

610
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:27,366
Don't think it's just us on
this side. It's over there, as well.

611
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:28,576
We have to put this order in place.

612
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:32,576
Even with having Zilla out,
it's been kind of a mission.

613
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,576
Shabba, he ain't got no support.

614
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,526
Hey, yo, we're tryin'
to stack a million

615
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,336
My life in Brumigan

616
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:44,376
Code name Zimbo, birth name Simeon

617
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,546
Get money how you can
It's not opinion...

618
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:51,436
There are loads of mandem over there.
He's got loads of men against him.

619
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,476
On the phone,
I can hear the background

620
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:54,606
and it sounds like madness,

621
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:58,626
so for him to keep pushing,
I have to respect him.

622
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,526
And I ain't tryin' to be nice, fool
I'm tryin' to be real...

623
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,526
People are like,
"Fuck the truce and that."

624
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:09,386
Too much things are happening.
Too much bad things have happened.

625
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,496
Smell me
I ain't had a wash for two days

626
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:14,486
Cos I'm out on the street
trying to move these 2Ks...

627
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:17,316
I'm rhymin'...

628
00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:20,416
No one wants a truce.
They don't mind having beef.

629
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:21,506
Man don't mind.

630
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:24,356
The life that men
are living now, we don't care.

631
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:25,446
It is what it is, innit?

632
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,616
You're talking about truce
and this and that, blood.

633
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:31,436
They're thinking, "You're
chatting shit. You're a dickhead.

634
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,526
"When I see this man,
I'm gonna fuck him up."

635
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:37,376
If it's gonna save a couple of youths
growing up in the future...

636
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,426
When you're dead, they'll
remember me, for what I was about

637
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:41,586
and for what I was trying to do.

638
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:44,376
If we all got together today
and says,

639
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:47,616
"Yo, the beef between Burger Bar
and Johnsons is done, it's dead,"

640
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:50,406
nothin', nothin' ain't changed.

641
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,466
It's just that...

642
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,676
Not for us it wouldn't,
but for the youths it would.

643
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:56,496
Why do you think
it would change for the youths?

644
00:32:57,286 --> 00:33:00,306
They're still gonna be seeing
and going through the same shit.

645
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,516
It's just that Johnsons and Burgers
haven't got beef.

646
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:06,336
These little youths in Aston
will probably have beef

647
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:07,606
with them little youths
in Newtown now,

648
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:09,556
cos the mentality's still there.

649
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,536
Every lickle nigger in my ends
is on this thing, regardless.

650
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,446
They're down to reppin' this thing.

651
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:18,676
You phone them, they'd feel like
"Wow! They phoned me to come."

652
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,606
I'm rolling. You understand it?

653
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:23,626
They're passionate about it.
What, goin' to jail and dyin'?

654
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,436
That's why we have
to push this thing hard.

655
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:28,696
When I was a kid, I wanted to be
the hardest nigger on the road.

656
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,496
I wanted to be a gang banger,
sell drugs.

657
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,446
That's what I wanted to do.
That was the life, innit?

658
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:37,486
When I was growing up,
my pops weren't there,

659
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:43,296
so, obviously, where I learnt to do
my thing or whatever is on the road.

660
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:45,366
So, obviously,
I'm gonna be a road man.

661
00:33:45,406 --> 00:33:49,456
The only niggers that showed me
anything are road men.

662
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,616
I've been gang-banging
since I was about 13, bro,

663
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,516
so I don't know nothin' else.

664
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:56,466
- When you're tellin' men...
- Stop what you're doing.

665
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:57,716
You get me, man?
This is the norm now.

666
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:01,616
It's not even a bad thing to us.
It's life. It's not even bad.

667
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:14,596
Right now, this is about the
senseless killing, the idiot thing.

668
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,506
Half these youths, they don't know
what this thing's about.

669
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:22,346
What are they reppin'? What are
half of these people reppin'?

670
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,476
I asked them, "What's it about?"
They don't know.

671
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:25,756
You don't know nothin' else.

672
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:30,336
When you don't know nothin' else,
you don't know nothin' else.

673
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:33,476
How much of us have been suspended
from school or expelled?

674
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:35,656
Yeah, everyone, innit?
Everyone, innit?

675
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:38,676
You're 12, 13. We don't have a dad.

676
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,666
So now we're suspended.
We don't need to go back to school.

677
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,686
The school don't want us, so why
are we gonna go back to school?

678
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:48,636
Now we see money. We're seeing
older people making money.

679
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,616
Well, we're wanting that. You get me?

680
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,586
We're lost, innit?
We've just come up lost, innit?

681
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:56,556
That's what it boils down to, blood.

682
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,476
We need to be growing
young black men, not no niggers.

683
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,736
We need to be growing
young black men.

684
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:04,356
Hate it or love it,
you're on the internet, Zimbo.

685
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,416
You get 100,000 hits, bruv.
You're a role model, B.

686
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,506
You're responsible.
You get me? Regardless...

687
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:14,486
We're responsible for our actions
and for the kids coming up.

688
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:18,656
I've got seven boys, you know, dawg.
My biggest boy's nearly 14, bruv.

689
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,586
When I said I'm going to speak
to Shabba the first time,

690
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,446
he said "You're mad.
You're going to Aston?"

691
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,516
You know,
that kind of scared me, blood.

692
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:29,346
Imagine that.
My son said that to me.

693
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:30,626
Imagine how that scared me, like, yo.

694
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:34,616
Man, look it's giving me goose bumps
now even thinking about it, bruv.

695
00:35:35,406 --> 00:35:36,636
Like, yo,
I've seen it, you know, bruv.

696
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,666
I've seen my bredrens leave.
I've seen my man twisted up.

697
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:42,666
I've seen them fucked up.
I've seen them in jail doing life.

698
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:44,646
Imagine my youth
could fall into that.

699
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:47,526
Are you crazy?
I have to do something, bruv.

700
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:51,316
- I think we're fucking ourselves.
- We're fucking ourselves!

701
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:54,416
It's not even the system,
the government. It's ourselves, blood.

702
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,646
Bruv, you see blaming people,
that's all wasted energy.

703
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,546
Let's make it happen, innit?

704
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:01,556
If we deal with the real issues,
what's really going on,

705
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:07,396
that's what I'm passionate about,
changing the way niggers think,

706
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,656
changing the way we're living, innit?

707
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:11,446
By coming at us with the truce thing,

708
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:13,676
we ain't listening
to another word you gotta say.

709
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:21,526
All this conflict resolution stuff
is a lot harder than I thought.

710
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,656
James Purnell, who's producing
this documentary, is an ex-MP.

711
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:34,466
James says he has somebody
who could help or give us advice.

712
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:44,466
This person is Jonathan Powell.

713
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,696
He helped broker the Peace Treaty
in Northern Ireland.

714
00:36:47,486 --> 00:36:49,626
One of the things I did
was Northern Ireland peace talks

715
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,466
because when Blair came in in '97,

716
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:54,676
it had gone back to violence -
the IRA started killing.

717
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,696
the big bomb in Canary Wharf

718
00:36:57,486 --> 00:37:00,566
and a bunch of bombs
in Northern Ireland.

719
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:03,496
Tony Blair managed to get them
back into peace talks

720
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:05,426
and then in about a year,

721
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:06,696
we got them
to the Good Friday Agreement

722
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,606
where they finally signed off
on a peace agreement.

723
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,446
I guess that's
kind of what you're facing,

724
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:15,716
cos if you're going to make this stop
after all these years,

725
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:18,576
it's not something you do
in two or three weeks.

726
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,546
it's something that's going
to take a very long time.

727
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:25,496
We're not a threat to the government.
We're not shooting police.

728
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,376
That makes it harder for us.

729
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:30,566
Whereas the government could think,
"They're not bothering us."

730
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:32,546
That's the problem, everyone thinks,

731
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,416
"They're killing each other.
Why would we care?"

732
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:38,496
They're not going to invest in it,
as a way of stopping,

733
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:41,306
so you'll have to do it yourselves.

734
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:44,546
Some of these mans are hard work.
It's hard work. Ignorant.

735
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,376
Nothing to live for.
Nothing to look up to.

736
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:48,556
No role models in their lives.

737
00:37:49,346 --> 00:37:50,566
So it's hard to get through it.

738
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,496
It's been this way for so long.
It's what they know.

739
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:56,406
They're just comfortable in that.

740
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:58,646
They don't see no need for no change
or nothing like that,

741
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:03,436
so the hard part is basically getting
a vision across of the bigger picture

742
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,666
of like, you know,
what we really should be doing.

743
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,646
What I worry about is
looking like you're surrendering,

744
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:12,456
because that's always a problem -
how you persuade both sides.

745
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:14,576
The big-man thing to do
is not to shoot someone,

746
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:19,486
it's to actually draw a line now,
not have anything from now on,

747
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:23,446
and something will happen and
you need some way of diffusing it.

748
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:26,686
In North Belfast, a leader, Gerry
Kelly, who used to be in the IRA,

749
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:30,556
escaped from jail three times - once
in Ireland, twice from British jails.

750
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:33,506
Gerry Kelly,
at one stage, had to stand,

751
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,366
holding back
a whole crowd of young Catholics

752
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,486
who wanted to attack.

753
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,316
Some of the more crazy ones
started shooting at him,

754
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:42,386
rather than at the police
or at the Loyalists.

755
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,536
He had to put himself on the line
to stop that from happening.

756
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:48,466
My warning is the first steps
are easier than further on.

757
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:49,676
If you start losing faith in it,

758
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:53,526
I just urge you to keep faith
and to have patience in doing it

759
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:58,376
and absorb a certain amount of pain
in doing it, because you'll have to.

760
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,556
But it's really, really worth it.
You can change. You can make it.

761
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:03,486
You're not part of the solution,

762
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:05,356
you're part of the problem.

763
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:06,566
I know where your head's at, blood.

764
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:09,476
I know you're on this thing
and you're a down nigger,

765
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,716
but I know you'd like to get involved
in something like this, blood.

766
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:16,516
People are trying to help us.
That's what I want you to know, blood.

767
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:18,386
I ain't gonna bullshit you.

768
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:21,466
That's why I want you to come
to the meeting - to see for yourself.

769
00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:23,596
These are proper MPs,
people that rub shoulders

770
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,516
with Tony Blair and Parliament -
proper big people.

771
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:30,526
So if that's not good enough for you
to say you're from the hood...

772
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:32,386
You know like they say,

773
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:35,466
"Bring the Queen down.
I wanna talk to her direct..."?

774
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,746
How high up do you need
to be going, blood?

775
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:40,336
Who do you wanna
get your message across to?

776
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:42,376
These people are prepared to help us.

777
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,546
I know some are saying, "Fuck that."
You shouldn't look at it like that.

778
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,456
You know...

779
00:39:50,396 --> 00:39:51,486
Yeah!

780
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:56,446
The next time we see my face,
we could have, like, 40 men.

781
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:57,516
Like, who knows?

782
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:03,556
That's one thing
we're opening the door to.

783
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:12,436
Do you not wanna
get involved, blood, seriously?

784
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,396
Don't keep saying
I'm doing my thing, blood,

785
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:16,646
cos it's not my thing, blood.

786
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:20,356
You know I'm having problems
on this side.

787
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,486
No one listens.
That's why I say I need support.

788
00:40:23,276 --> 00:40:24,426
They've got their thing mapped out.

789
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,546
Over on this side,
everyone's like, "No."

790
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:28,486
I don't know what you want me to do.

791
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:30,506
I need someone like you
or Nuggz, Sharp,

792
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,386
someone to back me up, blood.

793
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:33,476
See what's going on.

794
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,636
If you think there's money, you get
the money, as well, then, innit?

795
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:38,566
If that's what you believe.

796
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,436
As long as you're here,
it's not gonna harm you.

797
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,456
I didn't say
no one ain't gonna harm you, blood.

798
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,616
Who said anything
about harming you, blood?

799
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:52,436
No, I didn't say that.

800
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:54,606
Did I say that no one
is gonna harm ya?

801
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:57,526
What am I gonna say
someone will harm you for, blood?

802
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,676
I said it's not gonna harm you
to come down. That's what I said.

803
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:05,476
Who?

804
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,616
What are you on about, blood?

805
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:11,566
Blood, I'm saying...

806
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,566
Different day same shit
when I wakin' up

807
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:22,356
Lyin' in my bed
Wishin' that I never woken up

808
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,486
I've got this father
that I never ever see

809
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,506
And the only time I see
this little prick is in my dreams

810
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,476
Every day I'm wonderin'
"Has he forgot about me?"

811
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:32,756
Every night I'm on me knees askin',
"God, why me?"

812
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:37,296
Mum don't want her son
to be taken by the streets

813
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:38,516
But this is the life I lead

814
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:41,466
So it's kind of beat
wonderin' if people will miss me

815
00:41:41,506 --> 00:41:42,556
When I'm 6ft deep

816
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:45,466
Tossin' in my grave
cos I can't rest in peace

817
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,716
I've got so much demons
surroundin' me

818
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,586
So I call on Most High
to come and rescue me...

819
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,466
Today we're going
to speak to the youngsters,

820
00:41:57,506 --> 00:41:58,646
who are my sons' friends.

821
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:04,316
They've got friends
that have been stabbed,

822
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,466
but nobody's actually died.

823
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:07,726
They haven't got the pain
and don't feel that revenge yet.

824
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:11,476
So we have to get to them
before it's too late.

825
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,466
You're aware
of what's going on, innit?

826
00:42:16,506 --> 00:42:19,666
And I know you're getting
slowly but surely close to it, innit?

827
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,536
I look over my shoulder
in this area even...

828
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:26,476
Every three to four seconds.

829
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,636
I ain't tryin'
to wish no death or nothin'.

830
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:33,386
Anything could be
round the corner, really...

831
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,576
Anything, anything
could be around the corner.

832
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:38,556
- How old are you lot?
- 15 and a half.

833
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:40,396
15.

834
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:41,666
That kind of age group...
They're all 15.

835
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:43,606
You understand what I'm sayin'?

836
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,416
What do you know about
growing up on the ends?

837
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:48,646
All the beef, the "man dem",
the "bwoy dem" and, yeah....

838
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:52,476
Started to like know about it
from, like, Year Seven onwards.

839
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:53,716
Year Seven, that's what I'm sayin'.

840
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:56,596
11 and that thing.
Same with all of that, as well.

841
00:42:58,386 --> 00:42:59,596
My bredren got stabbed the other day.

842
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:02,636
- Over the gang stuff?
- Yeah.

843
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:04,426
Yeah.

844
00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:07,626
It was in Aston. Yeah, Aston.
That's what I'm sayin'.

845
00:43:09,406 --> 00:43:12,406
You can go to that area, but
if you get caught slipping, then...

846
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:17,396
You've gotta do
something about it, innit?

847
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:19,566
Because of, like, the pride, as well.

848
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,546
We gotta keep the pride.
I'd probably die if my pride died.

849
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:24,436
That's why it escalates.

850
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,486
Say something happened
to my man here,

851
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:29,456
then, obviously, we'll all go back.

852
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,616
It'll escalate and then if we do
something to them,

853
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:34,646
then they try and do something to us.

854
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:39,326
Like, if he had a fight
or he got rushed,

855
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,456
I'd go back there straightaway,
not thinking.

856
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:44,646
If it's just us two and there was
ten of them, I'd go there.

857
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,626
Probably might die or whatever.
That's what I mean.

858
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:50,526
You just don't think, do you?

859
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:55,546
You don't hesitate to do things.
It just happens.

860
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:57,366
They can't afford guns.

861
00:43:57,406 --> 00:44:00,406
It's not that easy to get guns,
regardless of what people think.

862
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:03,556
So they've all got little knives
and they will poke you up with it.

863
00:44:04,346 --> 00:44:06,476
You poke the wrong artery,
you will bleed to death,

864
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,576
unless you make it
to the hospital in seconds.

865
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:10,436
It's impossible.

866
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:13,476
Don't you think
that's a waste of life?

867
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:14,526
Yeah...

868
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:20,306
I don't see it as a waste of life.
It's just... I don't know.

869
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:22,396
- That is life.
- Yeah.

870
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:23,586
Yeah.

871
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:27,396
It's just a way of life that we know.

872
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:43,566
After filming on that day,
I had phone calls.

873
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:47,376
There were people that wasn't
too happy with what we was filming

874
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:49,596
and some people didn't understand
what the message was,

875
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:52,516
so it made them kind of hostile
to what we was doing.

876
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:58,556
If we don't get through
certain mindsets,

877
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:01,376
it can be a serious thing,
you understand?

878
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,546
I mean, I'm not worried for myself.

879
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,506
I'm not saying, "I'm Superman.
No one can shoot me."

880
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:09,316
Anyone can get killed,
anyone can get shot,

881
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,356
but I ain't worried
for myself like that.

882
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:14,646
I don't know, but I worry for him.

883
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:18,516
You understand what I'm sayin'?
If people come to, like...

884
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:23,536
He will be the target. 100%.
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

885
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:25,446
I told him on the phone.

886
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:27,586
I said, "Listen, tell D boy
I'm gonna kill him."

887
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:31,376
Not calling no names or nothin',
but you know...

888
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,456
And like...

889
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:36,686
They've got the place in their hand.
You have the whole hood in your hand.

890
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:40,536
You say, "Jump," and they say,
"How high?" That's the reality of it.

891
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,446
So that's why it's up to man
to be responsible

892
00:45:43,486 --> 00:45:44,646
and make things right, innit?

893
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,616
So, what's up?

894
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:55,456
We've kind of hit
kind of a brick wall.

895
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,716
Like, my mum's windows
got smashed out

896
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:02,506
and, like, the night before,
like, a 17-year-old kind of died.

897
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,356
So I don't know
about all this truce stuff.

898
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,536
Right now, basically,
the truce thing, like,

899
00:46:08,326 --> 00:46:09,476
it's not gonna happen, innit?

900
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,586
It's just long.

901
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,526
You know, whoever did it
knows who they are, innit?

902
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,506
Dickhead business.

903
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:19,316
Punk business, bredren.
Punk business.

904
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,446
- You understand?
- Look at the size difference.

905
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:24,716
This is why they try and pick up
on lickle D boy. You get me?

906
00:46:25,506 --> 00:46:26,586
But just forget it, innit?

907
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:29,406
It's a girl business, innit,
like I say.

908
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:31,546
They didn't pick on me.
They went to my mum's house.

909
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,396
My mother's house.
I don't even live there.

910
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:37,446
You've gone to my mum's house.
Do you understand it? For what?

911
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:40,636
Now the big issue is a youth died
yesterday night.

912
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:43,556
I woke up in the morning
at seven o'clock.

913
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:48,526
My son said to me, "Dad, a boy's
got killed. My friend's got killed."

914
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:51,386
These are the things
we're trying to prevent.

915
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:52,646
It's just going on
right in front of us

916
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,656
and it's just raw and it's kind of...

917
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,636
Tried to do something that I thought
was gonna benefit everyone,

918
00:46:59,426 --> 00:47:01,666
but, obviously, some people
don't see the vision.

919
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:04,586
We just want a better future
for the youth coming up.

920
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,506
We don't want them jumping on a bush
that we jumped on.

921
00:47:08,296 --> 00:47:11,416
We need to uplift ourselves
and do something. Understand?

922
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,466
Look around.
Like, we don't own nothin'.

923
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:15,596
Look on the Ansell Road,
all those places,

924
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:17,436
niggers don't own shit.

925
00:47:17,476 --> 00:47:18,636
You understand what I'm sayin'?

926
00:47:19,426 --> 00:47:21,486
Man wanna inspire the youths
to be something,

927
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:24,326
so when they get to them ages,
they own shops,

928
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:27,536
they've got that mind where they
say, "Why should I go on the road?

929
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:31,416
"Why don't I go college?
Why don't I aspire to be something?"

930
00:47:35,346 --> 00:47:36,486
What are we doing, Dylan?

931
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:40,506
We're gonna walk over by that dome
and meet the kids.

932
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:42,606
Where's the rest of your gang?

933
00:47:44,286 --> 00:47:45,426
Down there on the thing.

934
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:54,756
A couple of days ago,
when I was saying talk to the kids

935
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,526
before their friends die
or something...

936
00:47:58,316 --> 00:48:00,506
These kids have got that in them -
"They killed my friend."

937
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,436
They've always got a reason now.

938
00:48:02,476 --> 00:48:04,506
Every time you tell them something,

939
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:07,446
they'll tell you,
"But he killed my friend."

940
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,356
When people in normal society
get murdered,

941
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:16,496
there's a whole campaign,
there's rewards put up.

942
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:20,316
But when people
in my community get murdered,

943
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,596
it doesn't even make the news.

944
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:23,436
You're just dead.

945
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:34,606
We saw you two days ago
and nothing had happened then.

946
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:37,566
It's really shocking.

947
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:41,476
Like, my friend, Shyheim,

948
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:44,666
he got fucking... stabbed for...

949
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,696
He owed him money for some reason.
Do you know the story?

950
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:49,606
Nah.

951
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:54,566
Like, it hit one of his main arteries
and it bled out too much,

952
00:48:55,356 --> 00:48:56,516
like five pints of blood.

953
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:01,606
How did you hear about it?

954
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:03,446
Oh, on BB.

955
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:05,676
Like, everyone just kept putting up,

956
00:49:06,466 --> 00:49:08,466
like, "RIP Shyheim" and "RIP Tricks."

957
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:10,506
But I thought
it was a joke thing at first.

958
00:49:12,306 --> 00:49:15,456
"To all the people on BB,
this should be a wake-up call to you.

959
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:16,556
"Rest in peace, Shy."

960
00:49:20,286 --> 00:49:23,456
What does that make you feel like
you wanna do or think?

961
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:24,656
This is real life, isn't it?

962
00:49:25,446 --> 00:49:26,466
This ain't a game.

963
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,746
It's real life. Life ain't a game.

964
00:49:32,426 --> 00:49:33,496
Yeah.

965
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:37,486
Scary world.

966
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:41,496
Real talk, I'm not even involved
in the gang thing, really.

967
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:43,306
It's all about money.

968
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:46,456
Just because I'm from Handsworth, I
wouldn't want one of them to bully me

969
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:47,596
because I'm from Handsworth.

970
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,526
But you told me it was about girls
and every girl likes a tough boy.

971
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:53,476
No, that's, like, part of it.

972
00:49:53,516 --> 00:49:55,706
That was... That was...
That was back in the day!

973
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:57,666
Cut! Cut!

974
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:01,506
It was about, to me,
I was trying to look cool for girls,

975
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:06,456
so I throw a gang sign
just to impress the girls, innit?

976
00:50:06,496 --> 00:50:10,536
But now you're growing up thinking,
"Girls are just shadows to me."

977
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:12,406
I walk and left them.

978
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,606
I don't chase them, I replace 'em!

979
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:16,476
Yeah, yeah! Change 'em like socks!

980
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:21,616
After Shyheim was murdered,

981
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:26,456
there were four days of violence,
stabbings and shootings,

982
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:29,646
not connected directly to Shyheim,
but the violence was terrible.

983
00:50:30,436 --> 00:50:32,676
There was a shooting and
a two-year-old girl was trampled on,

984
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:35,626
as people tried to escape
the gunshots ringing out.

985
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,526
That's what the text said,

986
00:50:38,316 --> 00:50:40,486
the two-year-old or three-year-old
that got trampled

987
00:50:41,276 --> 00:50:42,386
is in a critical condition.

988
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:43,516
That's what the text said.

989
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:46,456
They must have heard the gunshots
and everybody ran.

990
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:49,496
But the buggy must have fell over,
the kid tripped over,

991
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:53,406
and while everybody's running,
they probably never even noticed.

992
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:54,516
In the last four days or so,

993
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:57,416
how many shootings and stabbings
has there been?

994
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:59,456
There's been like...

995
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:00,696
I've heard a couple of shootings.

996
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:03,716
I've only heard the one stabbing,
that was a fatality,

997
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:06,536
but I've heard
a couple of shootings.

998
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:09,446
A couple of stabbings.
Somebody's arm got severed.

999
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:10,626
That was nothing to do with gangs,

1000
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,606
but I did hear
a young man's arm and leg

1001
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:14,536
got severed, was hanging off.

1002
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:17,476
I don't know the full ins and outs.
There's been a lot.

1003
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:20,566
How many things do you know about
that happened in the last few days?

1004
00:51:21,356 --> 00:51:23,386
That stabbing.
Someone died the other day.

1005
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:26,596
A stabbing and a shooting
in a club the other day.

1006
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:28,596
I don't know
how much people got shot.

1007
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,386
I've heard five, I've heard four,
but I know people got shot.

1008
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,576
I'm just statin' the facts

1009
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:35,476
Talkin' about reality

1010
00:51:35,516 --> 00:51:37,736
Whole leap of casualties
Bag of fatalities

1011
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:41,436
It's fucked up
But this is the life we live

1012
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,646
This ain't the type of life
that you want for your kids

1013
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:47,516
Little young tugs screamin' out,
"Dawg, fuck the pigs"

1014
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,326
14 and stressin'
cos he can't buy kicks...

1015
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:55,506
It's mad how being
in a situation,

1016
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:58,306
being in the wrong place
at the wrong time

1017
00:51:58,346 --> 00:51:59,446
does mess up your whole life.

1018
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:00,576
What do you mean?

1019
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:07,486
We're more harsh on our own people.

1020
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:10,546
You get me?
My friend got stabbed... Wednesday?

1021
00:52:12,306 --> 00:52:13,326
Died on the night.

1022
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:15,416
Was that the boy
that was stabbed to death?

1023
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:20,526
Yeah, yeah, my friend Shyheim, man,
and it's all cos of... hype.

1024
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:23,666
People ain't got no morals no more.

1025
00:52:24,456 --> 00:52:26,456
Imagine getting dragged out your car

1026
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:29,496
when your family member is there
and getting stabbed up.

1027
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:33,296
This ain't Cali. Is it Cali now?
Is it California now?

1028
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:36,546
Look at that.
Waste of two lives, innit?

1029
00:52:37,336 --> 00:52:40,406
The youth's mother and family
in jail, as well, they're feeling it,

1030
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:42,566
and I'm not condoning him
for stabbing this guy,

1031
00:52:43,356 --> 00:52:45,386
but I know
he didn't mean to kill the youth.

1032
00:52:45,426 --> 00:52:46,506
They stabbed him in his leg.

1033
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:49,526
It's not like he went AWOL
and stabbed him in his neck and face.

1034
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:51,546
He stabbed him in his leg,
just thinking,

1035
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,496
"Let me just preps him
and let him know I want my money."

1036
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:57,416
They licked a main artery
and now the youth's dead.

1037
00:52:57,456 --> 00:53:00,466
Stab people... Your whole body
is full of main arteries, innit?

1038
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:03,656
You hit somebody in the wrong place,
you get me, you miss 'em.

1039
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:08,376
Let me show you something, as well.
Let me show you something.

1040
00:53:09,406 --> 00:53:10,456
Like...

1041
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:14,536
You know, the grave looks nice
and it's all pretty and nice.

1042
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:16,326
It's all nice.

1043
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:19,376
But you have to understand,
there's a youth lying in there,

1044
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,556
that was alive like me and him,

1045
00:53:21,346 --> 00:53:24,436
breathing and speaking... living.

1046
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:26,456
He's in there dead.

1047
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:30,636
Like, in a box,
in a hole, in the ground.

1048
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:40,406
Life's just gone.

1049
00:53:40,446 --> 00:53:42,456
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's just gone.

1050
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:45,686
No, we're not gonna see Shy again.
Do you get me?

1051
00:53:52,326 --> 00:53:55,556
If Heaven was a place on Earth
then I'll go, then I'll go

1052
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:57,426
No matter how far

1053
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:58,576
I would fill the tank in my car

1054
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:01,426
And I'll roll and I'll roll

1055
00:54:01,466 --> 00:54:03,626
Cos where I'm from
there's a lot of sad faces

1056
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:06,486
A lot of us had
to live with the basics

1057
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:09,396
And this heart thinks
we've got to face the places

1058
00:54:09,436 --> 00:54:11,616
I know, I know...

1059
00:54:23,366 --> 00:54:25,536
No one wants to come to the table
and see what's going on.

1060
00:54:26,326 --> 00:54:29,466
Everyone's making up what they think
it's about or I've heard this...

1061
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:32,546
No one ain't been a big man
and said, "I'm gonna see for myself."

1062
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,396
Only them geezers on the other side.

1063
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:38,476
So do you want me to come link you?

1064
00:54:40,326 --> 00:54:41,516
Do you want me to come link you now?

1065
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:44,516
What park?

1066
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:49,386
Where they do the running?
Where they used to do the relays?

1067
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:51,556
I'll come there now.

1068
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:56,736
Go see 'em and if... yeah.
He's with couple of people, innit?

1069
00:54:58,276 --> 00:55:00,486
Yeah, but, I mean, I'm really fed up
with going to people

1070
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:03,356
and they're going,
"Turn the cameras off."

1071
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,496
It's just a waste of time.

1072
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,506
I'm not saying go with no camera.
See what they're saying.

1073
00:55:08,296 --> 00:55:10,476
- So, who is it?
- He's with a couple of people.

1074
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,536
- What, Zimbo?
- Yeah.

1075
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:15,366
Yeah.
Do you think it's worth it, though?

1076
00:55:15,406 --> 00:55:17,466
It's whether you think
it's worth it, innit?

1077
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:18,736
I'd go and see what he's saying.

1078
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,416
Yeah? OK.

1079
00:55:23,506 --> 00:55:24,696
So we'll give it a go, then.

1080
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:26,576
Well, fuck knows.

1081
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,476
- There's a carnival tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1082
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:38,716
And everyone's expecting for
the carnival to be the same thing.

1083
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,686
We're gonna go there,
a lot of black kids are gonna end up

1084
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:44,556
breaking up the carnival
and rare tear, tear.

1085
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:46,506
We don't wanna see that, man.

1086
00:55:47,296 --> 00:55:48,496
What do people think is gonna happen?

1087
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:52,286
People think there are gonna be
gang fights, stuff like that.

1088
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:55,336
It's just another day in Handsworth
or another day in Newtown.

1089
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:57,516
You know what I'm tryin' to say?
Just another day.

1090
00:55:58,306 --> 00:56:02,426
What becomes terrible to you lot
becomes everyday to us.

1091
00:56:02,466 --> 00:56:03,706
Carnival tomorrow and thing,
you get me?

1092
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:05,606
- You get me?
- Oh, gosh.

1093
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:11,396
Yo, bare, bare babies right there.
They're all barefaced with y'all.

1094
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:12,526
Tomorrow's gonna be mad!

1095
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:16,326
Hopefully, it should run smoothly,
but I guarantee tomorrow,

1096
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:18,396
there's gonna be at least one fight.

1097
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:20,626
Not even fight.. Shots gonna be
busting and all kinds of...

1098
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,556
- Gunshots, bullets.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

1099
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:27,476
Fingers crossed, it's a nice day.
Everybody has fun.

1100
00:56:32,486 --> 00:56:33,496
Cos Handsworth is B21,

1101
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:36,466
Burger Bar side of town,
there's rumours saying the guys

1102
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:38,556
from the other side of town
are gonna come in

1103
00:56:39,346 --> 00:56:41,586
and try and shoot up the place
or try and get into it.

1104
00:56:42,376 --> 00:56:43,606
It's gonna go off at the carnival.

1105
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:46,416
So that's a big worry for people.
Madness.

1106
00:56:46,456 --> 00:56:49,476
"Come to carnival with your trainers
and a bulletproof vest."

1107
00:56:49,516 --> 00:56:50,726
That's what's on BlackBerry.

1108
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:53,676
Hopefully, everything goes well,
nice and peaceful.

1109
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:55,536
Have a lovely day.

1110
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:58,526
Everywhere I go, I have these kids
asking me questions,

1111
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:03,436
"Flash, do you do this?"
"Flash, give out the guns."

1112
00:57:03,476 --> 00:57:05,486
I couldn't get involved
in no gun fights.

1113
00:57:06,276 --> 00:57:08,356
They listen.
I have a voice that they listen to.

1114
00:57:08,396 --> 00:57:10,536
So make them hear
the right things, innit?

1115
00:57:11,326 --> 00:57:13,376
Guns, make sure
you don't touch them, innit?

1116
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:14,636
Real talk. Big and serious, like.

1117
00:57:15,426 --> 00:57:17,576
That's why Flash survived,
cos he didn't have the gun.

1118
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:20,376
Never got involved in the gunfight.

1119
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,656
You did.
You gave the little boy the gun.

1120
00:57:22,446 --> 00:57:24,646
Yeah, I know and he left it,
didn't he?

1121
00:57:25,436 --> 00:57:26,546
That's why Flash survived,

1122
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:29,386
cos he didn't get involved
in no gunfight.

1123
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:30,496
You understand it?

1124
00:57:31,286 --> 00:57:33,296
I say don't touch them, yeah?

1125
00:57:36,356 --> 00:57:37,486
- Hello.
- Hi!

1126
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:39,506
Hello, there. Where can you see me?

1127
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,546
Hello.

1128
00:57:45,356 --> 00:57:46,516
Hi!

1129
00:58:04,396 --> 00:58:07,486
- It's happenin' right now, bruv.
- Yeah.

1130
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,476
One side of the park's been breached
by a gang of people, so...

1131
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,616
It's all right!

1132
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:33,616
Stop it! Stop, stop, stop!

1133
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,666
Where the fuck is your boy?

1134
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:42,486
Don't panic!

1135
00:58:43,276 --> 00:58:47,286
After the carnival I was thinking,
"This is not gonna work.

1136
00:58:47,326 --> 00:58:49,436
"This is definitely, definitely
not gonna work."

1137
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:51,626
I was kind of sceptical.

1138
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:54,646
We needed something big to happen,
but when it happened,

1139
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:56,586
I didn't expect it to be this.

1140
00:59:06,486 --> 00:59:09,536
Violence broke out
after a crowd of about 200

1141
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:12,366
gathered outside
the local police station,

1142
00:59:12,406 --> 00:59:14,426
to protest about the death
of Mark Duggan,

1143
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,526
who was shot by police on Thursday.

1144
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:21,386
These are sickening scenes,

1145
00:59:21,426 --> 00:59:23,526
scenes of people looting,

1146
00:59:24,316 --> 00:59:27,346
vandalising, thieving, robbing,

1147
00:59:27,386 --> 00:59:30,386
scenes of people
attacking police officers.

1148
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:34,486
This is criminality, pure and simple,

1149
00:59:35,276 --> 00:59:38,376
and it has to be confronted
and defeated.

1150
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,456
It's crazy, man.

1151
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:42,736
If a black person
was to shoot a police officer,

1152
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:46,486
look how quick
that's getting dealt with.

1153
00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:48,276
Now, seriously.

1154
00:59:48,316 --> 00:59:49,416
Once one of theirs is down,

1155
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:51,456
look how quick
that is gonna get dealt with.

1156
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:53,566
They know who licked the man.

1157
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:57,426
The police, they are their own gang,
the biggest gang in the world,

1158
00:59:57,466 --> 00:59:58,706
and I can't see
one of them behind bars

1159
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:00,586
for killing this youth, yeah.

1160
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:02,526
All of this shit we're keeping up

1161
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:05,406
is keeping us
from the bigger picture.

1162
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:06,566
It's keeping us where we are.

1163
01:00:07,356 --> 01:00:10,416
That's why they don't fuck with us,
that's why they leave us,

1164
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:12,526
cos it's like our minds
are occupied, innit?

1165
01:00:13,316 --> 01:00:15,456
So we're not thinking
about the bigger agenda.

1166
01:00:15,496 --> 01:00:18,516
We're thinking about
the "bwoy dem", they're this man,

1167
01:00:19,306 --> 01:00:21,456
and we're not thinking
about what's really going on.

1168
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:24,576
We're getting conned, lads.
Do you understand it?

1169
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:28,386
When black men weren't allowed
in pubs and allowed to sit on a bus

1170
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:30,436
and weren't entitled
to certain things.

1171
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:32,646
It's riots that made
them things work, you know, blood.

1172
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:35,626
People saying, "Fuck this.
I'm mashing up the place."

1173
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:40,486
There is bigger things going on
out there, like the bigger agenda.

1174
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:43,426
We should have been going
to the right people

1175
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:44,606
and making these people afraid.

1176
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:47,526
We ain't rioting properly.
We got us on TV as looters.

1177
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:50,486
That's to do
with this geezer that died,

1178
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:53,286
just to show them
that he ain't no play thing.

1179
01:00:53,326 --> 01:00:55,566
You can't do things behind closed
doors. People are not having it.

1180
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,526
So I say riot, mash up the economy,
mash up the businesses

1181
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:01,396
that are funding the police
to do these things,

1182
01:01:01,436 --> 01:01:02,676
cos without all the money
we're paying,

1183
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:05,616
they wouldn't be able
to have these big guns and that.

1184
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:07,636
To me, that's not going to work.

1185
01:01:08,426 --> 01:01:09,616
You can't just go everywhere,

1186
01:01:10,406 --> 01:01:12,616
just kick off doors,
try to get your voice heard.

1187
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:15,466
We need to come at it
more strategically.

1188
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:18,506
We've been rioting for years, man,
and we're still fucked.

1189
01:01:19,296 --> 01:01:22,306
If we had a link to a political
person that came from Tottenham,

1190
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,346
and they could say,
"This is what it is..."

1191
01:01:24,386 --> 01:01:27,516
And him and this political person
is on TV and they're having a debate,

1192
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:30,306
then it would have been
a different look.

1193
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:31,456
We ain't got no structure,

1194
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:33,556
or we're just whining now
for impulses.

1195
01:01:34,426 --> 01:01:36,616
Like, we do and then think about it
when we're fucked later.

1196
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:38,556
The policeman killed the geezer.

1197
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:41,486
You don't need a spokesman
to explain what happened.

1198
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:43,306
Someone needs to say,

1199
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:45,556
we need to hear someone say,
"We want justice, bruv."

1200
01:01:46,346 --> 01:01:47,536
The man from the hood
knows what it is.

1201
01:01:48,326 --> 01:01:50,326
Anybody else thinks,
"What's going on?"

1202
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:53,506
They're probably thinking a blackie
was thieving in the first place,

1203
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:55,466
that's why he got licked down.

1204
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:57,666
We need to put ourselves
in positions of power.

1205
01:01:58,456 --> 01:02:00,676
Like I says, we're too low
in the food chain everywhere.

1206
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:03,676
Power, blood,
is through violence, blood.

1207
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:05,526
Nah.

1208
01:02:06,316 --> 01:02:08,476
You have to use a bit of violence.

1209
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,716
Make them know you're not playing
about and then keep mad.

1210
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,476
I had no idea the effects the riots
would have on our peace movement.

1211
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:25,536
I thought it would make things worse.

1212
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,416
The police have got balaclavas on,
so it might go down today.

1213
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:31,606
- The police have balaclavas on?
- Yeah. Fully ballied up.

1214
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:34,446
There must be something out here.

1215
01:02:48,316 --> 01:02:49,366
Hello.

1216
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:50,606
Hello, hello, hello.

1217
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,616
- Do you remember me?
- Hi, Flash!

1218
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:28,436
How comes you didn't wanna make
your way home, lads?

1219
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:29,716
I'm just looking for stuff
on the floor.

1220
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:33,426
Looking for stuff on the floor?

1221
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:34,646
They're rioting, cos a black boy

1222
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,536
was killed by the police
earlier on this week.

1223
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:42,466
That's the reason for the protests.
It's not like thieving stuff.

1224
01:03:42,506 --> 01:03:44,736
- That's the cause behind anything.
- What channel's this on?

1225
01:03:46,276 --> 01:03:47,516
It's not on TV yet,
but you lot go home.

1226
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:50,376
All right, then.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

1227
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:08,346
People end up
coming together in riots.

1228
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,516
You have a common enemy.

1229
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:12,336
That's what kicks
people's minds to think,

1230
01:04:12,376 --> 01:04:14,516
"Hold on. Forget fighting each other.

1231
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:18,506
"People are holding us down,
witnessing bad situations.

1232
01:04:19,306 --> 01:04:22,386
"So let's forget the bullshit
Let's stick together and fight."

1233
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:25,636
Do you know what's causing all this,
what's fuelled all of this?

1234
01:04:26,426 --> 01:04:29,446
It was that kid, innit?
He got shot. I heard he got shot.

1235
01:04:29,486 --> 01:04:31,696
I don't know what the real story is,
but he got shot.

1236
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:34,536
You know what,
before I act off anything,

1237
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:36,526
I make sure
I've got the proper intel.

1238
01:04:37,316 --> 01:04:38,386
You know what I'm sayin'?

1239
01:04:38,426 --> 01:04:41,536
I make sure that, you know what,
I'm fighting for that real cause.

1240
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,326
There's no point
fighting off hearsay.

1241
01:04:45,356 --> 01:04:48,446
So, how do you officers feel
about what's going on out here?

1242
01:04:50,356 --> 01:04:51,506
They're acting like I'm not here.

1243
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:54,346
This is the problem
we have in our community.

1244
01:04:54,386 --> 01:04:56,596
When we speak to these people,
they act like we're not here.

1245
01:04:57,386 --> 01:05:00,386
Once again, have you got anything
to say about this situation?

1246
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:03,536
Sir, we're not obliged to make any
comment about what's happening here.

1247
01:05:04,326 --> 01:05:07,516
If you want a comment from the
police, speak to the Press Office.

1248
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:10,426
This is why the whole of the UK
is erupting right now,

1249
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:13,476
cos they're pissed, fed up of it,
not having it no more.

1250
01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:15,556
So, as long as things
remain the same,

1251
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,396
I can see things
remaining the same out here,

1252
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:21,456
and me, personally, I can see
into all of these people's eyes

1253
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:22,616
and they look scared.

1254
01:05:23,406 --> 01:05:26,436
There's thousands of youths
where I come from

1255
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:28,556
and these youths are ready
to come out here

1256
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:31,496
and cause, like, a revolution,

1257
01:05:32,286 --> 01:05:34,416
cos they'll understand,
that we do have the power.

1258
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:42,716
So why didn't you join in, then?

1259
01:05:44,456 --> 01:05:46,526
I went to town
and you couldn't get in to town.

1260
01:05:47,316 --> 01:05:48,376
It was blocked off,

1261
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:50,526
It was just mayhem
in the middle of the road.

1262
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:52,516
Loads of youths running around.

1263
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:55,526
I was in two minds,
should I park up and walk round or..?

1264
01:05:56,316 --> 01:05:58,516
I just parked up there for a bit.
After a bit I just got off.

1265
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:01,546
Just said, "I'm not coming out
to thief nothing, you know."

1266
01:06:02,336 --> 01:06:04,526
The damage is done.
Shit mashed up, as well, yeah.

1267
01:06:05,316 --> 01:06:07,446
People there,
standing protecting their shops,

1268
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:09,586
just making it known
that they don't take sides

1269
01:06:10,376 --> 01:06:11,486
with black people, you know.

1270
01:06:12,276 --> 01:06:14,366
No matter what happens,
day to day in daily life,

1271
01:06:14,406 --> 01:06:17,436
they just made it known
that they're not supporting it,

1272
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:18,646
they don't business about it.

1273
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:21,486
It's their business,
so why wouldn't they?

1274
01:06:22,276 --> 01:06:23,326
Yeah, not the shop.

1275
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:26,446
I'm on about... the whole
criminal system, you know.

1276
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:29,546
We're fighting for justice, you know.
Police brutality.

1277
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,476
Police take the piss with us
and we're fighting back,

1278
01:06:32,516 --> 01:06:35,696
because they don't go through that,
they can say, "Everything's cool."

1279
01:06:36,486 --> 01:06:39,586
If Asians were getting in trouble
by police, they'd be pissed off.

1280
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:41,526
That's why I say it's a trap, man.

1281
01:06:42,316 --> 01:06:44,406
It's designed
to keep us down and that.

1282
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:48,686
I'm hearing that shots
have gone off in Aston.

1283
01:06:51,316 --> 01:06:54,316
Three Asians are dead yesterday.

1284
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:55,476
So I don't know what happened.

1285
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:56,746
All I know is
that three people are passed

1286
01:06:58,286 --> 01:07:00,416
and there's some Asians
that are not too happy.

1287
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:02,606
Regardless of whether
that's gonna escalate or not,

1288
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:04,416
I don't know, you know.

1289
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:07,466
But once you've got Asians
and fucking Illuminati together,

1290
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:08,596
we've got no chance.

1291
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:13,396
So it's a race war now.

1292
01:07:13,436 --> 01:07:15,606
It's no longer the shops
they need to worry about.

1293
01:07:17,436 --> 01:07:20,436
If it brings us together and we die
together, I'm down for that.

1294
01:07:23,426 --> 01:07:25,646
Last night, when I was driving past,
I'd seen people outside,

1295
01:07:26,436 --> 01:07:28,486
groups of Asian people
outside their shops,

1296
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:30,396
trying to defend their shops,

1297
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:32,596
cos people have been smashing
and looting their shops.

1298
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:36,576
Somebody pulled up on the pavement
and run down three people

1299
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:38,526
and I've heard they died.

1300
01:07:48,286 --> 01:07:52,506
If it's turning into a racial war,
it's gonna be serious out here.

1301
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:55,356
Very, very, very, very serious
out here.

1302
01:07:55,396 --> 01:07:56,576
It's stirred up a whole lot of stuff.

1303
01:07:57,366 --> 01:08:00,366
So all this Burger Bar
and Johnsons thing right now,

1304
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:02,546
it looks as trivial
as it is right now.

1305
01:08:06,356 --> 01:08:09,426
With this particular incident,
yes, there is potential,

1306
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:11,636
but the tensions will be heightened
because of that,

1307
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,496
but there have been
a succession of meetings

1308
01:08:15,286 --> 01:08:17,336
amongst community leaders
and the police.

1309
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:18,566
This is messed up. It's gone too far.

1310
01:08:19,356 --> 01:08:21,566
Greed and what is there
to really thief on this road?

1311
01:08:22,356 --> 01:08:24,446
If you wanna work,
you've gotta work hard for it.

1312
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:25,706
There's nothing to thief, like.

1313
01:08:26,496 --> 01:08:27,676
Even if you are a career criminal,

1314
01:08:28,466 --> 01:08:31,486
what are you gonna thief on a shop
that's full of food shops?

1315
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:33,276
Burgers and chips?

1316
01:08:33,316 --> 01:08:34,506
- Ridiculous.
- It's pointless.

1317
01:08:35,296 --> 01:08:36,536
These families need discipline.

1318
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:39,516
And yourself, please.

1319
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,456
We need to do
an investigation here now.

1320
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:44,576
So what have I got to do
with the investigation?

1321
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:46,406
Can we have a quick word?

1322
01:08:46,446 --> 01:08:48,606
Conducting a murder enquiry here
at the moment, OK?

1323
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:50,406
Who do you represent?

1324
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:51,546
- Channel 4.
- Thank you.

1325
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,446
You need to move away.

1326
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:54,706
- Is it confidential?
- Yes, please.

1327
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:58,676
You'll have to talk to the director.

1328
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:02,556
What's the point of speaking to me?
I'm at work at the moment.

1329
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:05,456
OK, OK. All right.

1330
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:07,696
Like, I'm saying.
So this is my point.

1331
01:09:08,486 --> 01:09:10,646
Cos I'm black and I stood here,
they wanna question me.

1332
01:09:11,436 --> 01:09:14,526
I had to explain to them I'm at work.
Now they haven't got no questions.

1333
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:18,326
That's how fucked up
it is round here. Fucked up.

1334
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:20,516
They're asking me...

1335
01:09:21,306 --> 01:09:25,436
Cos I've got a baseball cap on
and a jacket and cos I'm not white...

1336
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:27,586
They didn't ask you to speak.
We all came together.

1337
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:29,396
Do you understand it?

1338
01:09:34,486 --> 01:09:36,566
I don't trust nothing out here,
me personally.

1339
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:39,526
- United we stand.
- Divided we fall. You understand it?

1340
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:42,526
It's in my hand and his hand.
That's how we need to roll.

1341
01:09:43,316 --> 01:09:44,336
Do you feel me?

1342
01:09:46,426 --> 01:09:48,446
The hood is a very, very funny place.

1343
01:09:48,486 --> 01:09:50,576
It changes like the weather.
You understand it?

1344
01:09:51,366 --> 01:09:53,516
Anything could happen.
It goes that way, goes this way.

1345
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:56,466
It's hard. That's why a lot of people
go crazy down here.

1346
01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:59,556
It's not very stable.
There's no stability around here.

1347
01:10:00,346 --> 01:10:01,536
What, right now?

1348
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:05,456
A truce is highly possible.
Highly likely. That's the truth.

1349
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,676
There was no gang activity
during the riots.

1350
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,486
No Burger Bar. No Johnsons.

1351
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:19,476
No gang activity at all.

1352
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:20,676
Everyone came together.

1353
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,526
So, yeah, you could call it
a four-day truce.

1354
01:10:25,316 --> 01:10:26,526
Yeah, everybody's on the same team.

1355
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,466
Yeah, but what can you expect?

1356
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,596
When you see advertisements
for iPhone 4

1357
01:10:37,386 --> 01:10:39,466
every 15 minutes on your TV,

1358
01:10:39,506 --> 01:10:40,646
then what do you expect?

1359
01:10:41,436 --> 01:10:42,526
When we glorify the apps

1360
01:10:43,316 --> 01:10:45,436
and the this and the that
and the FaceTime,

1361
01:10:45,476 --> 01:10:46,606
what do you expect?

1362
01:10:49,296 --> 01:10:50,396
A kid must have seen the thing

1363
01:10:50,436 --> 01:10:51,636
and thought,
"Let me thief some sweets.

1364
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:54,566
They smashed the window
and they came and thought...

1365
01:10:55,356 --> 01:10:57,496
These are not criminals.
These people are little kids.

1366
01:10:58,286 --> 01:11:00,496
Like, it's all madness
that's going on right now.

1367
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:04,486
I didn't even know what to say.
It's kind of funny, innit, really?

1368
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:07,366
When the law makers
are the law breakers, as well,

1369
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:09,466
you can't expect the everyday citizen

1370
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:11,746
to be, you know,
conducting themselves correctly

1371
01:11:13,286 --> 01:11:14,456
when you see stories of corruption

1372
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:16,516
and you don't see
any consequences to that.

1373
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:21,446
And the reason why these places
are so appealing to young people

1374
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:22,606
is because of the kind of things

1375
01:11:23,396 --> 01:11:25,496
that we value, promote
and advertise out there.

1376
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,386
Yeah, Waterstone's untouched.

1377
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:30,516
That would be most valuable
to the people.

1378
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:33,396
Exactly, yeah,
where all the knowledge is,

1379
01:11:33,436 --> 01:11:34,676
where all the valuables really are.

1380
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:37,526
Right over there.
Waterstone's untouched.

1381
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:42,496
Not a window broken in sight.

1382
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:45,506
But yet still Cybercandy was...

1383
01:11:46,296 --> 01:11:48,326
I mean, can you see
there's something wrong

1384
01:11:48,366 --> 01:11:49,576
with that picture there, people?

1385
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:53,416
If I don't come out of my house
and come here,

1386
01:11:53,456 --> 01:11:54,556
which is my family's place,

1387
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:58,416
I don't go nowhere else,
because I don't feel safe, mate.

1388
01:11:58,456 --> 01:12:01,556
The pickny no bigger
than me shoes...

1389
01:12:02,346 --> 01:12:04,396
I wanted to hear
what the elders' thoughts was

1390
01:12:04,436 --> 01:12:06,516
on the state of our community.

1391
01:12:07,306 --> 01:12:10,486
Unfortunately... unfortunately,
we've got a generation lost.

1392
01:12:12,276 --> 01:12:13,466
It's not a generation of black lads,

1393
01:12:13,506 --> 01:12:16,546
it's a generation of youth
that is lost.

1394
01:12:17,336 --> 01:12:18,576
They are completely
lost to us, mate,

1395
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:21,516
and there's nothin' we can do
to get through to them.

1396
01:12:22,306 --> 01:12:23,536
For God's sake,
catch the damn pickny.

1397
01:12:24,326 --> 01:12:26,356
Take off your belt,
swipe him two time

1398
01:12:26,396 --> 01:12:27,476
and send him home to Mama.

1399
01:12:27,516 --> 01:12:31,656
Excuse me, if people thinks
that that is bad and that is abusive,

1400
01:12:32,446 --> 01:12:33,646
sod the lot of ya.

1401
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:36,436
Sod your arses about abusive.

1402
01:12:36,476 --> 01:12:39,486
I put life into my kids,
the government, the law.

1403
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:42,356
I would have box-eyed 'em
in front of the Queen.

1404
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,436
You can't tell me me can't do it.

1405
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:45,666
I will do it in front of the Queen.

1406
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:49,506
If they wanna lock me up after,
that's fine. But you know something?

1407
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:52,306
None of my kids
got involved in the riots,

1408
01:12:52,346 --> 01:12:53,486
cos of what I've drummed into 'em.

1409
01:12:55,276 --> 01:12:57,306
Yesterday we listened
to some big men speak

1410
01:12:57,346 --> 01:12:59,506
and they think it needs
to be resolved with a beating.

1411
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:03,406
Look at the big youth. Stand next to
me, so they can see this on the roll.

1412
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:05,646
You can't beat these youths,
cos they'll probably beat you!

1413
01:13:06,436 --> 01:13:08,506
There has to be other measures
to go about it.

1414
01:13:09,296 --> 01:13:11,406
I'm not saying
that they don't need discipline,

1415
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:12,656
but there's levels to beating 'em.

1416
01:13:13,446 --> 01:13:16,506
You can get a slap or somebody
can find a piece of this in the house

1417
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:20,356
and start, "Stop! Rah, rah, rah,"
and beat you to a pulp.

1418
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,446
There's levels to it.

1419
01:13:21,486 --> 01:13:23,596
A little slap... discipline.

1420
01:13:24,386 --> 01:13:25,546
Like, picking up stuff and chairs.

1421
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,566
And I've seen people get beaten,
like serious beat-downs.

1422
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:31,476
We have to know what we're doing.
There's a lot to it.

1423
01:13:31,516 --> 01:13:33,566
We've got a lot of problems
within ourselves

1424
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:35,586
and we wanna blame
the whole world, man.

1425
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:37,476
Let's sort out own stuff out.

1426
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:40,716
I've got the feeling kids that have
been beat are slightly more violent.

1427
01:13:41,506 --> 01:13:44,516
I have that feeling. I'm not 100%,
so you can't quote me on that.

1428
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:48,366
But I've got a feeling that the kids
who are beaten are more violent.

1429
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:50,596
My community and where I come from,
beating is normal.

1430
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:53,386
What's happened to you?

1431
01:13:53,426 --> 01:13:55,586
Yeah, like, see the other day, like,
Tuesday and that,

1432
01:13:56,376 --> 01:13:59,516
I was nearby town and then,
like, some police see me, innit?

1433
01:14:00,306 --> 01:14:02,366
And they chase after me,
so I started running

1434
01:14:02,406 --> 01:14:03,616
and I'm hiding behind one car now.

1435
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:07,426
They dragged me from behind the car,
they was kicking me in my face,

1436
01:14:07,466 --> 01:14:10,466
and they got me to the ground
and they was punching me in my head,

1437
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,526
and they were kicking me
in my ribs and that

1438
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,456
and beating me up, really.

1439
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:15,506
And how old are you?

1440
01:14:16,296 --> 01:14:18,316
16 still. 16.

1441
01:14:18,356 --> 01:14:19,506
They put me in a cell for the night,

1442
01:14:20,296 --> 01:14:21,496
saying I have
to come back in a month.

1443
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:23,446
But why did they do that?

1444
01:14:23,486 --> 01:14:27,556
I don't know. Like, they said
suspicion of me rioting. Looting.

1445
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:29,416
Then that makes you feel

1446
01:14:29,456 --> 01:14:31,496
like you want to get them back
and do whatever?

1447
01:14:32,286 --> 01:14:33,346
I got hatred in my heart.

1448
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,596
I had hatred in my heart for a long
time for them, but I got more now.

1449
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:39,516
So I wanna get them back.
You know what I mean?

1450
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:45,476
Loads of police officers.

1451
01:14:45,516 --> 01:14:46,616
Imagine I'm in distress!

1452
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:50,526
Imagine I'm in distress.

1453
01:14:51,316 --> 01:14:53,426
I could have been called
into a problem.

1454
01:14:53,466 --> 01:14:55,546
It could have been anything.

1455
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:58,496
There's more right there.
There's more right there.

1456
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:02,326
They've followed me all morning.
They've followed me to the shop.

1457
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:03,536
They asked me what I am doing.

1458
01:15:04,326 --> 01:15:07,366
Who's invested in this film
to make this film?

1459
01:15:07,406 --> 01:15:09,516
They asking me
all sorts of questions.

1460
01:15:11,486 --> 01:15:13,726
This is how we're living here, man.
People take the mick.

1461
01:15:16,396 --> 01:15:19,466
- Born black, you're born a criminal.
- It's the crime of the century.

1462
01:15:19,506 --> 01:15:22,506
It's the biggest crime, bro.
The biggest crime.

1463
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:24,296
It is.

1464
01:15:24,336 --> 01:15:26,506
It's them again. It's them again.
They don't wanna stop.

1465
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:28,506
The pussyholes
have been following me,

1466
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:31,456
but now I've come with my camera,
they wanna talk to me.

1467
01:15:31,496 --> 01:15:33,516
They've followed me
around the whole hood.

1468
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:35,446
Faggots!

1469
01:15:43,386 --> 01:15:44,576
Can you stop the camera off a second?

1470
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:46,456
- Why?
- Cos I wanna speak.

1471
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:49,646
- Can you knock the camera off?
- No, because I'm making a film.

1472
01:15:53,476 --> 01:15:55,496
Well, what have we done wrong?

1473
01:15:57,356 --> 01:15:58,506
Just have to ask you a few questions.

1474
01:15:59,296 --> 01:16:00,486
But why? Why?

1475
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:03,306
- Sorry?
- Why are you asking us questions?

1476
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,576
Why are you pointing a camera
in my face?

1477
01:16:05,366 --> 01:16:07,496
- I'm making a film. You came to me.
- That's fine.

1478
01:16:12,356 --> 01:16:13,586
Listen... We'll close the door, then.

1479
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:15,546
What do we have to understand?

1480
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:19,366
We haven't done anything wrong,
so why are you stopping us?

1481
01:16:19,406 --> 01:16:21,506
This is a free country
in which I'm allowed

1482
01:16:22,296 --> 01:16:24,326
to be in a public place
making a film.

1483
01:16:24,366 --> 01:16:26,376
Right. Do you have a filming permit?

1484
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,436
- Filming permit for what?
- You say you're filming something.

1485
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:32,636
15 minutes later,

1486
01:16:33,426 --> 01:16:35,646
the police demanded
all of our footage from Channel 4.

1487
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:38,526
They also sent emails
asking community centres

1488
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:41,396
to report back
on all of our activities.

1489
01:16:41,436 --> 01:16:44,466
The police are saying they're gonna
try and shut us down, bredren.

1490
01:16:44,506 --> 01:16:46,666
They're trying to say
they're gonna try and lock us off,

1491
01:16:47,456 --> 01:16:48,666
cos we're gonna incite gang problems.

1492
01:16:49,456 --> 01:16:51,526
All of these people
that have been raping us...

1493
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,456
£190 million that they say
they put into my community

1494
01:16:54,496 --> 01:16:56,626
to help and stop gangs -
stop lying to the people.

1495
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,656
No gang member I know
or gang member I spoke to

1496
01:17:00,446 --> 01:17:01,536
knows any you people, innit?

1497
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,356
You're raping my community.
Keep raping us and see what happens.

1498
01:17:05,396 --> 01:17:07,426
We're putting
our heart and soul into this.

1499
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:09,486
This has been far from easy,
far from easy.

1500
01:17:10,276 --> 01:17:11,296
A nightmare most days.

1501
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:14,336
We don't know which way we're
gonna turn, but we've continued.

1502
01:17:14,376 --> 01:17:17,466
The reason what's driving us is that
there could be a passion in there.

1503
01:17:17,506 --> 01:17:19,716
We could have just said,
"This ain't working." Fuck it off.

1504
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,666
What was your point in stopping me
to come and ask me?

1505
01:17:27,456 --> 01:17:29,486
I'm pissed. That's the reason
I'm not happy.

1506
01:17:30,276 --> 01:17:31,386
I'm not happy, so that's that.

1507
01:17:31,426 --> 01:17:32,476
Where do you know me from?

1508
01:17:32,516 --> 01:17:33,736
You don't know me.
You've never met me.

1509
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,406
Where's all the anger come from?

1510
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:38,596
We're pissed!
You motherfuckers are killing people!

1511
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:40,576
I don't wanna calm down! I'm upset!

1512
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:43,536
I'm upset like the rest
of the country.

1513
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,436
We're pissed! We are mad!

1514
01:17:45,476 --> 01:17:47,646
Upset, innit? Right now
you're killing people, innit?

1515
01:17:48,436 --> 01:17:51,516
No, we don't have to talk.
No, it's not for the camera.

1516
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:53,376
This is real-life shit!

1517
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:55,586
You said, "Mr Duffus, Mr Dylan,"
like you know me!

1518
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:57,606
You're all part
of the same gang, innit?

1519
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:00,536
The same way everybody puts us
into the same category,

1520
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:02,326
when it comes to us.

1521
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:04,486
The same way you lot
all fit into the same category -

1522
01:18:05,276 --> 01:18:06,366
point blank, period, innit?

1523
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:08,566
We're guilty until proven innocent
where we come from.

1524
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,566
This is what we go through
as black young men.

1525
01:18:12,356 --> 01:18:14,556
You're probably thinking,
"Why is he behaving like that?"

1526
01:18:15,346 --> 01:18:17,526
If it happened to you every day,
you'd behave like that.

1527
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:21,386
You have no idea. You are a foot
soldier, so I refuse to speak to you.

1528
01:18:21,426 --> 01:18:22,666
Unless you are a boss,
don't talk to me.

1529
01:18:23,456 --> 01:18:24,526
Let's roll out, man.

1530
01:18:26,276 --> 01:18:28,346
What makes a race not come together?

1531
01:18:28,386 --> 01:18:29,416
We want order

1532
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,636
And why do gangsters go jail
before they find religion?

1533
01:18:32,426 --> 01:18:34,606
If they stayed and listened
would they be still with us?

1534
01:18:35,396 --> 01:18:37,416
No fate
Then they die behind prison gates

1535
01:18:37,456 --> 01:18:38,686
Are we supposed to wait or just hate?

1536
01:18:44,426 --> 01:18:45,466
A joke that we had -

1537
01:18:45,506 --> 01:18:47,666
what's the difference
between Aston and Handsworth?

1538
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:52,506
It's like Birchfield Road.
You know, a road, a dual carriageway.

1539
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:56,426
You know what I mean?
How lame, how shallow, how petty!

1540
01:18:56,466 --> 01:18:58,516
Let's just hope
that two weeks from now,

1541
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:00,446
that the focus changes again.

1542
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,626
That after they've mashed up
their community,

1543
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,646
after they've, you know, united,
whether willingly or not,

1544
01:19:06,436 --> 01:19:08,476
let's hope they look
at that bigger picture

1545
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:10,636
and say to themselves,
"What are we fighting each other for?

1546
01:19:11,426 --> 01:19:13,556
"Because my vulnerabilities
are the same as yours."

1547
01:19:14,346 --> 01:19:15,476
You know what I'm sayin'?

1548
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:18,646
"My institution lies, racism
experience are the same as yours.

1549
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:21,626
"My lack of opportunity
are the same as yours.

1550
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:25,416
"The only thing that's not the same
is our postcode."

1551
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:26,486
That's the only thing.

1552
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,476
Cos this one lives in B6
and this one lives in B20.

1553
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:31,636
Two opposite sides
of Birchfield Road people.

1554
01:19:32,426 --> 01:19:34,536
Come on. Come on. Do better.

1555
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,556
After almost a year on his own,

1556
01:19:50,346 --> 01:19:51,586
Shabba finally made a breakthrough.

1557
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:55,366
Obviously, I targeted,
like, official people.

1558
01:19:55,406 --> 01:19:56,576
I tried to go to official people,

1559
01:19:57,366 --> 01:19:59,376
people that had influence,
people that had respect

1560
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:01,616
and try and get them
to see the picture.

1561
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:05,616
I had a meeting with the mandem.
There were about 30 men in the yard.

1562
01:20:06,406 --> 01:20:08,516
There were people arguing
and voices were raised.

1563
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:12,326
They were in there getting mad
and there was a lot of tension.

1564
01:20:12,366 --> 01:20:14,506
I can remember Sykes
was in there quiet, innit?

1565
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:17,366
He was quiet the whole time,
taking it all in.

1566
01:20:18,456 --> 01:20:21,636
I was expecting Sykes
to probably take their side,

1567
01:20:22,426 --> 01:20:24,506
but he actually was
on my side, you know.

1568
01:20:25,296 --> 01:20:27,306
The gang thing don't make sense.

1569
01:20:27,346 --> 01:20:29,436
I can tell you now,
the gang thing don't make sense.

1570
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,666
From them people that we lose, yeah,

1571
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,626
we need to make a positive from it,
you know.

1572
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:36,556
There's too much memorials and that
in the name of...

1573
01:20:37,346 --> 01:20:39,486
- Look at this.
- What's all this?

1574
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:43,366
That there, on the gravestone,
these are all my friends, you know.

1575
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:46,456
Friends that has gone.
You know what I mean?

1576
01:20:46,496 --> 01:20:49,586
For shit that started when
man weren't even fucking born.

1577
01:20:50,376 --> 01:20:51,426
Cos these are young men.

1578
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:55,556
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

1579
01:20:56,346 --> 01:20:58,536
May they rest in peace.
May those brothers rest in peace.

1580
01:20:59,456 --> 01:21:01,696
Madness. You get me?
Absolute madness.

1581
01:21:04,346 --> 01:21:07,546
I'm 26. Done nine-and-a-half years
in jail. Don't make no sense.

1582
01:21:08,336 --> 01:21:09,486
You hear me? Don't make no sense.

1583
01:21:10,276 --> 01:21:12,506
All that time as a youth
getting sent to jail for madness.

1584
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:14,486
OK, here's my hypothesis now.

1585
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:17,496
Firearms were made here
during the Industrial Revolution.

1586
01:21:18,286 --> 01:21:19,406
Guns were made right here.

1587
01:21:19,446 --> 01:21:22,576
The guns that were made in Birmingham
were used to trade for African people

1588
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:24,576
to be taken
to the Caribbean as slaves.

1589
01:21:25,366 --> 01:21:28,456
The youth involved in the gun crime
are the descendants of the Africans

1590
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:30,496
who were traded for guns made here.

1591
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:33,406
The Industrial Revolution
fuelled the slave trade

1592
01:21:33,446 --> 01:21:35,656
and the slave trade
fuelled the Industrial Revolution.

1593
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:37,516
It was a triangle of trade,

1594
01:21:38,306 --> 01:21:40,376
where goods were made right here
where we stand

1595
01:21:40,416 --> 01:21:43,416
to trade for our ancestors.

1596
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:46,526
Hence why today Caribbean people
have European surnames,

1597
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,466
including myself,
including these two gentlemen.

1598
01:21:49,506 --> 01:21:53,586
And all this is testimony,
you know, to the grizzly past

1599
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,586
of the European doing
dodgy business in trading man.

1600
01:21:57,376 --> 01:21:59,516
We should become
intelligent enough

1601
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:01,516
to learn about what happened to us.

1602
01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:04,496
Now we're born in opportunity
and where there's laws here

1603
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:08,306
to protect us as black people,
we should take advantage of that.

1604
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:09,506
If the youth are gonna join a gang,

1605
01:22:10,296 --> 01:22:12,306
I would suggest
to join an academic gang.

1606
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:15,506
Join an academic gang
of bankers, solicitors, lawyers, OK?

1607
01:22:16,296 --> 01:22:18,336
Growing up, yeah,
I ain't thinking about...

1608
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:20,456
I'm gonna be in no gang
with no bankers and that.

1609
01:22:20,496 --> 01:22:22,576
I wanna be with the mandem, innit?
I wanna make P.

1610
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:25,526
I wanna do this thing
with my friends, innit? You get me?

1611
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,516
Your friends who you grow up with.
That's all it is, you know.

1612
01:22:29,306 --> 01:22:31,476
That can still happen.

1613
01:22:31,516 --> 01:22:32,566
I got my friends here.

1614
01:22:33,356 --> 01:22:35,556
My older friends,
I will listen to them

1615
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:37,406
as older brothers.

1616
01:22:37,446 --> 01:22:39,546
We are what we are.
We're a product of our society.

1617
01:22:40,336 --> 01:22:42,566
We grew like this.
This is just what we are.

1618
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:47,626
We need to break free
Get the fuck up out of these chains

1619
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:50,536
Inside the game, B
Mentally enslaving our brains

1620
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:53,516
You think you've changed
In reality you're still the same

1621
01:22:54,306 --> 01:22:55,406
Stuck in the game
Bitch made

1622
01:22:55,446 --> 01:22:57,486
Mentally enslaved
and that's life, nigger

1623
01:23:01,446 --> 01:23:02,636
That's life, nigger...

1624
01:23:03,426 --> 01:23:04,636
Nuggz did the same,
as well, you know.

1625
01:23:05,426 --> 01:23:06,636
He come over and say, "It's true.

1626
01:23:07,426 --> 01:23:10,606
"I'm definitely down for it.
Anything you need, I'll support it."

1627
01:23:12,296 --> 01:23:13,476
And that's life, nigger...

1628
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:17,676
No one tells Nuggz what to do.
He does what he wants to do.

1629
01:23:18,466 --> 01:23:21,486
So, if Nuggz wants to get on board,
it's because Nuggz wants to.

1630
01:23:23,286 --> 01:23:25,426
Motherfucking cops
on the block, yeah.

1631
01:23:26,476 --> 01:23:27,646
Undercovers.

1632
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,576
A true Muslim knows
that you can't harm your brother.

1633
01:23:31,366 --> 01:23:32,476
You can't kill your brother.

1634
01:23:32,516 --> 01:23:34,566
No bullshit.
No gang-related bullshit.

1635
01:23:35,356 --> 01:23:37,586
So if a man's a Muslim, then a man's
a Muslim. That's how it is.

1636
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:40,476
Any beef he had before
is done with. Gone.

1637
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,526
Fear Allah, innit? And that's that.

1638
01:23:44,316 --> 01:23:47,316
And is it a way in prison
in which people have come together,

1639
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:50,446
who previously out on the block
might have been shooting each other?

1640
01:23:50,486 --> 01:23:52,686
Yeah, cos they've got time
to sit and read and reflect

1641
01:23:53,476 --> 01:23:54,586
and see what's what, innit?

1642
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:56,526
Yeah, that's true.

1643
01:23:57,316 --> 01:23:58,446
They ain't got no time for no...

1644
01:23:58,486 --> 01:24:01,656
Well... they ain't got nothing to do.
They're in jail, innit. Jail's jail.

1645
01:24:02,446 --> 01:24:04,626
Lockdown. Get me?

1646
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,496
And why did Zimbo
change his mind?

1647
01:24:14,286 --> 01:24:16,306
Kind of the same thing.

1648
01:24:16,346 --> 01:24:17,566
We are getting older.
We've got kids.

1649
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:20,516
Can't be running around
gunning down men all your life.

1650
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,456
So it's time for a change

1651
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:24,586
and he could see
the business side of it, as well.

1652
01:24:25,376 --> 01:24:28,386
Like, let's stop this.
Let's come together and do something.

1653
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:29,536
You have to show love to Shabba.

1654
01:24:30,326 --> 01:24:31,566
He started this.
He's getting it going.

1655
01:24:33,316 --> 01:24:34,526
He's made it happen, innit?

1656
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:38,326
Is it too late
for the youths to go, huh?

1657
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:39,446
I don't know.

1658
01:24:39,486 --> 01:24:42,536
It's never too late. Never too late.
It ain't never too late.

1659
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:45,466
It's never too late to grow

1660
01:24:45,506 --> 01:24:46,726
Cos I don't wanna feel
the same no more

1661
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:48,636
And I don't wanna feel the same

1662
01:24:49,426 --> 01:24:51,426
Kickin' back
Getting lost in my thoughts

1663
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,616
Thinkin' about the things I see
and all the things I saw

1664
01:24:54,406 --> 01:24:56,586
Headin' down the wrong road
And I couldn't change course

1665
01:24:57,376 --> 01:24:58,546
Used to wanna be a G
But now this G wants more

1666
01:24:59,336 --> 01:25:02,366
Always in and out of court
My life in the hands of a judge

1667
01:25:02,406 --> 01:25:04,636
Looking straight at me with hatred
Cos I'm black and I'm young

1668
01:25:05,426 --> 01:25:07,476
18 and I'm going down
for packing a gun

1669
01:25:07,516 --> 01:25:09,596
Misled by my olders
I was slanging for funds

1670
01:25:10,386 --> 01:25:12,496
Still attackin' my lungs
Weed smoke got me para

1671
01:25:13,286 --> 01:25:15,336
Celebrity, number
Everybody in the manor

1672
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:17,586
In this life I've never walked
straight only ever stagger

1673
01:25:18,376 --> 01:25:20,496
Sober so I can't even blame
the loose manner

1674
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:23,316
Just like a weak bladder
I was out of control

1675
01:25:23,356 --> 01:25:25,496
My fate's in my own hands
What was I never told?

1676
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:28,396
I'm livin' with no limit, limitless
Now that I know

1677
01:25:28,436 --> 01:25:30,586
It ain't never too late to grow, grow

1678
01:25:32,476 --> 01:25:35,706
It's never too late to grow
It's never too late to grow

1679
01:25:36,496 --> 01:25:38,736
Cos I don't wanna feel
the same no more...

1680
01:25:40,276 --> 01:25:41,336
It's a question, innit?

1681
01:25:41,376 --> 01:25:43,396
Yeah, mate. Is it too late?
Do you get me?

1682
01:25:43,436 --> 01:25:45,526
Question yourself
and then you realise, innit?

1683
01:25:46,316 --> 01:25:49,366
I wanted to put the message out there
that it's not too late, innit?

1684
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:50,506
Ain't never too late, innit?

1685
01:25:51,296 --> 01:25:54,306
There's people
that do shitty things all their life

1686
01:25:54,346 --> 01:25:57,436
and then, boom, they're inspired
and their whole life changes, innit?

1687
01:25:57,476 --> 01:26:00,496
I had a dream last night
that I was back in prison, bun that

1688
01:26:01,286 --> 01:26:02,466
I'd rather die so today I'm chillin'

1689
01:26:02,506 --> 01:26:04,606
They're tryin' to watch us
like clockwork, mechanism

1690
01:26:05,396 --> 01:26:07,546
Give 'em the fingers up
to show the fools that I can see them

1691
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:09,556
I see straight
through the plain clothes

1692
01:26:10,346 --> 01:26:11,566
I ain't wanted
so I got no reason to lay low

1693
01:26:12,356 --> 01:26:14,396
I just wanna live my life good
and raise dough

1694
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:16,636
But they don't wanna see that
so they're stoppin' my stage show

1695
01:26:17,426 --> 01:26:19,636
The roads are brake, bro
So I'm tryin' to stick to my career

1696
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,636
And I did this for Danio and Keya
Daddy's here, yo

1697
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:24,656
This is one
to let the whole world know

1698
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,466
It ain't never too late to grow

1699
01:26:27,506 --> 01:26:30,536
Niggers are never shown, man,
the right shit.

1700
01:26:31,326 --> 01:26:33,566
For my generation growing up, yeah,
everybody wanted a name.

1701
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:37,376
If you didn't have a name, yeah,
that means you're idiot, innit?

1702
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:38,446
That's it, innit?

1703
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,576
You're somebody or you're nobody.
You get me?

1704
01:26:41,366 --> 01:26:44,546
Whereas now, I can stand up
and prevent things. You get me?

1705
01:26:45,336 --> 01:26:48,396
I can say, "Yo, listen, allow that.
Allow that cos that's gas."

1706
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:49,536
I talk to the youth all the time.

1707
01:26:50,326 --> 01:26:52,486
Allow the gang thing,
but it's dumb. Don't make no sense.

1708
01:26:53,276 --> 01:26:54,466
You're not gonna get nowhere from it.

1709
01:26:54,506 --> 01:26:56,596
My little cousin is dead

1710
01:26:57,386 --> 01:27:02,386
and he paid
the maximum penalty, innit?

1711
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,516
I kind of blame myself
sometimes, as well.

1712
01:27:05,306 --> 01:27:08,316
Cos he's following me, innit?
He's following me.

1713
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:11,466
I'm the oldest cousin. I'm the oldest
out of the lot of us, basically.

1714
01:27:11,506 --> 01:27:16,556
So, obviously, it's like,
when I do certain things,

1715
01:27:17,346 --> 01:27:19,366
then the rest follow, innit?

1716
01:27:20,446 --> 01:27:24,606
It's never too late to grow
It's never too late to grow

1717
01:27:25,396 --> 01:27:26,556
Cos I don't wanna feel the same...

1718
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:28,496
I sit down in, like, the studio.

1719
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,506
I'm sitting down in the studio
with the so-called "bwoy dem".

1720
01:27:32,296 --> 01:27:34,366
Was that the first time
you'd ever been in a room

1721
01:27:34,406 --> 01:27:35,646
with Burgers and Johnson?

1722
01:27:36,436 --> 01:27:38,616
Yeah, the first time in my life
and I was a bit uneasy.

1723
01:27:39,406 --> 01:27:43,476
I have to sit down and think,
"Is everything really cool here?"

1724
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:46,596
And then they will come over
and everything was kind of relaxed.

1725
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:48,426
It was an experience.

1726
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:51,606
You just realise,
"Hold on. He's just like me, innit?"

1727
01:27:55,296 --> 01:27:56,536
They talk the same.
They think the same.

1728
01:27:57,326 --> 01:27:59,386
He's not my enemy.
These guys ain't my enemy.

1729
01:27:59,426 --> 01:28:01,556
But that was another wake-up call.
Like, come on.

1730
01:28:02,346 --> 01:28:05,526
This is so trivial.
It's so foolish, so unbelievable.

1731
01:28:06,316 --> 01:28:07,476
This is how it's supposed to be

1732
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:10,686
and that's the dream now, innit,
to make it always like that.

1733
01:28:11,476 --> 01:28:13,516
That's how they're supposed
to live. Together.

1734
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:17,436
And I don't wanna feel the pain

1735
01:28:17,476 --> 01:28:19,496
It's never too late to grow

1736
01:28:20,286 --> 01:28:22,456
It's never too late to grow

1737
01:28:22,496 --> 01:28:24,526
Cos I don't wanna
feel the same no more

1738
01:28:25,316 --> 01:28:27,436
And I don't wanna feel the pain

1739
01:28:33,396 --> 01:28:35,396
- My dawg.
- That's what I was about to say.

1740
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:36,636
My brother from another mother.

1741
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:38,506
We're like that, innit?

1742
01:28:39,296 --> 01:28:40,516
So, that's just all it is.

1743
01:28:41,306 --> 01:28:43,506
So say no more, innit?
A real brother, innit?

1744
01:28:44,296 --> 01:28:45,456
Shabba. It's just Shabba, innit?

1745
01:28:45,496 --> 01:28:47,546
He's just taking me
as it comes, innit?

1746
01:28:48,336 --> 01:28:50,476
There's nothing more to it.
It's just Shabba.

1747
01:28:50,516 --> 01:28:51,596
I can't complain and that.

1748
01:28:52,386 --> 01:28:54,566
It's not exactly the truce
that we wanted, you know,

1749
01:28:55,356 --> 01:28:58,476
to kind of make history, have some
form of truce, bring people together.

1750
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:01,736
But it's still a way
of bringing people together.

1751
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:06,416
We've got mandem on the soundtrack,
we've got mandem in the same studio,

1752
01:29:06,456 --> 01:29:08,576
we've got people talking,
so it is progress.

1753
01:29:09,366 --> 01:29:10,476
We've come a long way.

1754
01:29:10,516 --> 01:29:11,746
We can look and say,
"I'm living good."

1755
01:29:13,286 --> 01:29:15,386
For once, I'm living good.

1756
01:29:16,276 --> 01:29:19,416
I've got to analyse a lot of stuff
I've been through, I've grown up in

1757
01:29:19,456 --> 01:29:20,676
and analyse the whole situation.

1758
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:22,616
I've come to realise it isn't...

1759
01:29:23,406 --> 01:29:25,416
Everybody's always
blaming each other.

1760
01:29:25,456 --> 01:29:27,616
You have to blame yourself, man.
This is your life.

1761
01:29:28,406 --> 01:29:31,486
So you have to live it
and I have to be all I can be.

1762
01:29:32,276 --> 01:29:34,366
You understand it?
And that's what I've learnt.

1763
01:29:34,406 --> 01:29:36,616
I've watched a lot of people
spend a lot of time saying,

1764
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:39,516
"It's this person.
We're blaming that person."

1765
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:43,316
When I wake up in the morning,
I do what I wanna do, innit?

1766
01:29:43,356 --> 01:29:45,536
So when I wake up in the morning,
whatever I do,

1767
01:29:46,326 --> 01:29:48,336
that's the life I'm gonna be living.

1768
01:29:48,376 --> 01:29:49,506
So it's my decision, my choice.

1769
01:29:50,296 --> 01:29:52,346
So, me, I'm gonna try
and do the right thing.
