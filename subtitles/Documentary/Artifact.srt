1
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,580
This record is about

2
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,950
overcoming challenges.

3
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,750
It's very important to

4
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,930
fight for what you feel is right.

5
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,320
We were backed into a corner.

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,700
For us, it was all or nothing...

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,300
Sometimes you have to

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,600
fight in order to be free.

9
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,650
"This Is War" is an album

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,180
about conflict.

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,610
We had a huge battle

12
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,690
with our record company.

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,090
The album kind of documented

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,890
this really turbulent time

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,670
in our lives.

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,850
There has always been a serious

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,760
distrust between an artist

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,600
and their record label.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,750
I never heard of a label

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,820
that doesn't screw an artist.

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,140
That's the business model

22
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,360
is screwing the artist.

23
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,460
None of us in a band ever dreamed

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,310
that we would be so lucky

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,940
to have the success that we've had.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,200
Now here we were faced

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,340
with the possibility

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,250
that everything was gonna be

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,430
ripped right away from us.

30
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,120
There is a kind of economic

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,780
perfect storm brewing

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,030
disastrous situation

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,840
they're losing their jobs

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,190
rising gas prices

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,070
My friends and fellow Americans,

36
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,780
I am very pleased and

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,750
very privileged to introduce to you

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,650
the next vice-president

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,700
of the United States:

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,170
Governor Sarah Palin

41
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,430
of the great state of Alaska.

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,090
You can hear the bugles blaring.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,210
The sound of the battle cry.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,910
The march of the drum

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,280
calling me from my slumber,

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,900
pushing me toward

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,060
A new day. A new fight.

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,810
Oh wow... Oh wow...

49
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,840
It's too fucking bright.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,490
It was 2008, we were on the road

51
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,560
for over 2 years and had recently

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,110
returned to Los Angeles to work

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,350
on our third album.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,070
After over a decade of struggling,

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,350
we finally had a breakthrough

56
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,450
and achieved more success

57
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,940
than we ever dreamed.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
Our second album A Beautiful Lie

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,850
sold over 3,5 Million copies

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,200
and gave us the chance to tour the world.

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,250
We were all incredibly excited

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,800
about this time in our lives

63
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,880
and we decided to make a film

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,310
about the next album but...

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,050
It quickly turned into something else.

66
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,770
Thirty Seconds to Mars is being sued for...

67
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,300
30 Million Dollars! Cute! Right?

68
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,240
This summer, the band's label Virgin/EMI

69
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,360
filed a breach-of-contract suit

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,670
against Thirty Seconds to Mars.

71
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,040
However, Jared insists

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,090
that the band was just exercising

73
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,230
their legal rights.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,340
What do they want?

75
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,690
30 Million Dollars.

76
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,820
Really?

77
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,560
You're being sued
for 30 Million Dollars

78
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,090
What are you?...
Huh...

79
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,270
How do you sleep at night?

80
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,530
I have no idea where the number came from

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,620
other than...

82
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,930
It certainly wasn't
a wink to the press or

83
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,830
were we clever
to use the same number...

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,400
Thirty Seconds to Mars
have just sold a lot of...

85
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,820
a lot of albums
and never made any money.

86
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,420
We weren't really expecting

87
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,030
a bunch of money

88
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,780
we just thought it
bizarre that...

89
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,820
that all this revenue was being generated

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,530
and that we were still
2.7 Million Dollars in debt so,

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,850
we started to look into it.

92
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,010
Thirty Seconds to Mars suffered a

93
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,410
contract that really wasn't even

94
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,570
a direct contract with EMI,

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,680
it was bad deal.

96
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,660
They basically told us to shut up

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,190
and go make another album.

98
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,930
They weren't addressing our concerns

99
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,220
that we had with the contracts,

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,800
so we decided to terminate with EMI.

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,820
We've been signed for 9 years.

102
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,930
Under California law, you can't be held

103
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,800
bound to a contract for more than 7 years

104
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,510
which the courts and myself

105
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,880
and we all feel is pretty reasonable.

106
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,880
On July 4th 2008, we sent
a termination letter

107
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,690
to EMI. We sighted the 7-year statute

108
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,970
which legally ended our contract

109
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,220
with the company.

110
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,030
With any lawsuit,

111
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,740
there is two sides of the argument.

112
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,940
Your side of the argument was:

113
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,990
"Our contract is no longer valid

114
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,230
because of the 7-year statute"

115
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,270
and their side of it is:

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,690
"No, that is not applicable.

117
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
You have a commitment based
on a number of albums,

118
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,170
based on the amount of money we've spent

119
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,350
and you're not free to terminate this."

120
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,750
It really is David
against Goliath

121
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,360
and... and in this
case the label,

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,330
the Goliath was well, here's
a 30 Million Dollars lawsuit

123
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,660
like I am just gonna keep you awake,
they don't...

124
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,860
It doesn't keep them awake

125
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,800
suing for 30 Million Dollars, it's just:

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,390
I'm just stress you out,
you know, emotionally

127
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,800
and financially until you cave.

128
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,810
30 Million Dollars.

129
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
Yeah.

130
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,470
I think, it's so crazy

131
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,650
that it doesn't even
really register with me.

132
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:13,930
Like it's so fuckin' like
just fantastically huge

133
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,850
that I don't really get it.

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,040
You would hope that, in success,

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,760
that they would even take
the initiative to be:

136
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay look, you guys,

137
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,900
you have the worst record
deal on the planet.

138
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,680
Let's make this right

139
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,650
because we know at some point

140
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,630
you're gonna educate yourselves,

141
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,860
you're gonna realize that
you've been stolen from

142
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,400
and you've been highjacked.

143
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,280
They don't do that.

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,870
No.

145
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,300
They make the artist do that

146
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,790
and they don't want to do what's fair,
what's right,

147
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,980
You have to threaten them
with legal actions,

148
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,660
you have to threaten them
with creating precedences

149
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,190
in order to get them just to make

150
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,120
a slightly fair deal that still leaves them

151
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,740
with the complete lion share of everything

152
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
and the complete domination

153
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,490
of Thirty Seconds to Mars.

154
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,160
Musical taste actually
begins to form in the womb,

155
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,580
the developing fetus
has a fully functioning

156
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,260
auditory system
at 20 weeks and is hearing

157
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,910
all of the sounds of the environment.

158
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Music is everywhere.

159
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,280
It's really woven into
the fabric of everyday life.

160
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,110
Perceptual studies
have shown that,

161
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,510
in the higher
hierarchy of needs,

162
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,690
the two things that
people care most about,

163
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,190
are music and sex.

164
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,060
So, there is no question

165
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,190
that music is a primal need

166
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,060
and it's unbelievably powerful.

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,690
No other art form
works like music.

168
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,270
Paintings are beautiful

169
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,250
but, you know,
once you see it

170
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,060
eventually you
see everything in it.

171
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,980
With music, it's forever changing.

172
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,060
For a piece of music to succeed,

173
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,190
it has to take you through

174
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,890
some kind of emotional journey.

175
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,440
The right chord sequence,

176
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,650
the right few seconds of a song

177
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,730
and you are right there.

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,990
That's exactly how I feel.

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
I love in trying to interpret what

180
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,500
the music is saying both
lyrically and musically,

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,570
that's why I like music

182
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,040
and once I've tried to figure it out,

183
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,610
I have personally crazy fantasies of what

184
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,700
the person was thinking about

185
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,480
when they wrote that

186
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,290
and why they wrote that

187
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,790
and how does it relate to me.

188
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,960
That's what music is.

189
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,370
You mix the right word at the right time

190
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,720
with something that's beautiful

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
and moving and sort of.

192
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,120
That makes you,
you know,

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
the hair on the back
of your neck stand up,

194
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,710
it's an incredible moment.

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,200
That's probably why we need it

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,530
because it's wonderful.

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,040
The song has a story in it,

198
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
there is a heart behind it,

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,450
there is a frequency within it

200
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,000
and you, as a person,
delivered it

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,380
and that why people care.

202
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,040
Music is the most powerful
vehicle in the world.

203
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,710
Period.

204
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,360
Despite the lawsuit,

205
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,770
we decided to move forward

206
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,500
and start making our new album.

207
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,770
And that meant financing it ourselves.

208
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,000
So, we built a studio in the basement

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,580
of the house in the Hollywood Hills,

210
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,310
hired Flood and began the process.

211
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,040
Flood is like this superstar producer.

212
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,460
A legend. A guy that has made albums

213
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,840
that will live forever.

214
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,710
I mean 20 years
I've been listening to his work.

215
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,440
I used to look on the
back of albums and CDs

216
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,040
and tapes and who is this guy Flood?

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,350
I didn't even know if he was a real person.

218
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,910
You always see this
mysterious little name Flood.

219
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,780
He produced Depeche Mode.

220
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,180
U2.

221
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Nine Inch Nails.

222
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,330
PJ Harvey.

223
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,500
Smashing Pumpkins

224
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
and the most important, obviously, is:

225
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,710
Thirty Seconds to Mars, so...

226
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,710
His wide range of creativity,

227
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,240
it's inspiring.

228
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
For me creativity is about
vulnerability,

229
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,160
taking risks,
showing one's true emotion

230
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,670
and to be able to make
everybody feel as though

231
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,780
they can make mistakes,

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,610
they can put themselves out there

233
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,770
and there's no recriminations.

234
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,280
Jared took on a huge responsibility

235
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,500
and a huge burden
when he chose to start making

236
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,870
"This is War" without a label on board.

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,660
He didn't know what the
future held for the band.

238
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,390
It was very scary because

239
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,180
he was letting me know like:

240
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,270
"Look, we are alone.

241
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,110
There ain't gonna be any money coming in,

242
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,740
whatever we, as a band,
or really me, Jared,

243
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,900
as like the leader,
did good business to save

244
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,220
some of the money that we made,

245
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,300
that's now going to pay for our album

246
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,140
and our producer and our studio

247
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,490
which may result in zero Dollars."

248
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,520
We had to bet on ourselves,

249
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,330
even using Vegas terminology:

250
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,380
it's like if we are the black square,

251
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,980
we put everything on black and

252
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,960
we roll the dice.

253
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,180
We are heading to see our
manager Irving Azoff

254
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,600
and our lawyer Peter Paterno.

255
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,600
How are you doing?

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,380
Good.

257
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,030
Okay, what do you want to do?

258
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,550
What I would like to happen is:

259
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,710
I would like to go to court,

260
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,890
I'd like to sit in front
of a jury of my peers.

261
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,600
I think in any lawsuit
that's a slam-dunk,

262
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,680
you still have a 20%
chance you get screwed.

263
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,530
Let me ask you a big picture question:

264
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,510
Signing a record deal with a traditional

265
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,510
record company or not.

266
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,190
What are the other options?

267
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,720
My view has always been that any deal that

268
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,150
doesn't involve a major
record label is better

269
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,780
than any deal any major
label will offer you,

270
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,040
because you have your ownership,
your masters.

271
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,190
The other issue too,
that you have to keep in mind,

272
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,320
is that even if you signed

273
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
with one of these other alternatives,

274
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,730
EMI is still suing you.

275
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,760
It seems that we're between
a rock and a hard place.

276
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,230
Either signed some antiquated dinosaur deal.

277
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,500
But what's the new model of it?

278
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,940
The new model is worse, so the antiquated

279
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,320
dinosaur deal is a good deal.

280
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,300
Why there isn't a new model that's better?

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,830
People are listening to
music more than ever.

282
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,600
Cause they're all losing money.

283
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,110
They're not buying it.

284
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,060
They may be listening but

285
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,000
they're not buying it,

286
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,200
they're not paying for it.

287
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,640
It makes it even
less valuable.

288
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,890
If it were a traditional record company

289
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,050
we wouldn't be sitting here,

290
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,430
we would have settle that a long time ago.

291
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,430
We drew a bad card.

292
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,150
We drew a guy from outside the business

293
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,150
who doesn't play by industry rules,

294
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,180
who doesn't give a shit.

295
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,240
We can't get them to settle.

296
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,330
They're not gonna settle now.
They said to me:

297
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,240
"I don't care how long it takes.

298
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,390
I don't care how angry
it makes the other label groups.

299
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,630
I would go to court to a decision."

300
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,970
The record business is in a very
very serious trouble.

301
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,620
If you look at historically
other businesses

302
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,950
that have gone away, I think there is

303
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,580
this kind of gradual decline...
Well gradual,

304
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,640
it has been pretty severe, but like this

305
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,550
and then it just reaches
a kind of tipping point

306
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,860
and just falls off the cliff.

307
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,000
The economics around
the record business

308
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,220
is based on selling albums.

309
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,060
You know growing up you
had to buy the entire album

310
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,670
to get the song you loved,
you had to!

311
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,850
You had no choice!

312
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,570
And now, what happens is:

313
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,390
A kid is sitting at home and goes:

314
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,280
"I've got to hear that Kings and Queens song,

315
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,320
I got to hear that!"

316
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,670
They don't have to get in a car
or ask their parents

317
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,470
and save up 12 bucks to go buy.

318
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,330
Now you're given a choice and

319
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,770
you can buy the song you love

320
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,580
without buying the album,
you gonna do that,

321
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,970
not only that, when you can buy...
Have it for free.

322
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,640
Record sales have dipped 20% a year

323
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,340
for the last 6 years, now.

324
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,450
That's a lot.

325
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,500
The music business has
really become decimated

326
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,350
and it has been largely
because of illegal downloads.

327
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,930
Others factors too.

328
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,900
But the predicament we're in now, is

329
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,220
that an entire generation
of music listeners,

330
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,520
virtually everybody
under the age of 21,

331
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,420
has grown up in a world

332
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,650
where, for their entire sentient lives,

333
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,680
they've never had to pay for music.

334
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,120
And they look at people my age and

335
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,720
who buy music they think we're saps.

336
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,270
Why would you pay for something that's free?

337
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,260
It would be like paying for air!

338
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,950
I've heard someone
like Trent Reznor say:

339
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,590
"You know, you work
for a fucking year on something,

340
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,870
and you put all this time
and you spend all this money

341
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,600
on creating these songs and a cup of coffee

342
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,240
like the other day,
cost more than your song."

343
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,340
Consumers wouldn't walk into a grocery store,

344
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,140
and steal a loaf of bread and have it

345
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,120
but it became okay to steal music.

346
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,860
That really isn't something
you blame the labels for,

347
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,940
you know, that's technology.

348
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,400
The labels have never been
cohesive enough to create

349
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,020
their own future
distribution systems.

350
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,770
Which is why it took
a computer company

351
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,960
to start iTunes, hum...
Have they've been smart enough

352
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,480
they would have co-owned
their own digital delivery

353
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,600
like iTunes, you know,
that was a big mess up.

354
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,060
When Apple, which is a great company,

355
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,710
don't get me wrong,
is the third largest company in America

356
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,490
and the biggest music retailer in America,

357
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,150
I think that's concerning.

358
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,870
It's a device manufacturer.

359
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,970
The labels are
petrified and terrified.

360
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,070
They don't know
what's going on,

361
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,580
they don't even understand
their own industry anymore,

362
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,620
they've been too big and
too slow to change, so

363
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
I do think they're just gonna start to crumble.

364
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,650
Let's play "Kings and Queens"...

365
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,440
There is definitely something in there,

366
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,670
let's try it again.

367
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,820
I think this is the part (I think so too)

368
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,260
I'm sitting here...
I'm singing it in my head.

369
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,990
It's infectious, I want to hear it again.

370
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,490
That guitar creeping up... I mean...

371
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,860
Great! ... Yeah! ...

372
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,780
So, I know, for making records like this,

373
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,580
the hard work,
the struggle is all part of it,

374
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,710
it's about being truthful to yourselves.

375
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,310
That's what I mean about now.

376
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,830
It's like you can take it and embrace it.

377
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,010
And go with it.

378
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,800
Be a bit off balance,
try out a few mad things

379
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,670
and there you are in a great place
to do that.

380
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,650
In the middle of all this,

381
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,710
we got some good news: we were nominated

382
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,730
for a Latin MTV award.
So, we packed our bags

383
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,460
and flew ourselves to Mexico.

384
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,420
After an exciting and unforgettable night,

385
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,720
we woke up to discover
that we had been served

386
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,930
with legal papers from EMI.

387
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,370
You have to understand this whole story

388
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,260
really began before we started the album.

389
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,870
Before we got sued, when we were

390
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,710
in friendly renegotiations with EMI.

391
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,980
And that was going well,

392
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,570
Irving was talking to them.

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,470
We had met some efforts
to address some commercial

394
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,210
terms of the
Thirty Seconds to Mars agreement

395
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,050
that I think,
we all recognized,

396
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,800
were probably inappropriate.

397
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,020
And then, something happened.

398
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,510
That effort stalled out for whatever reason.

399
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,990
Soon investors won't be able

400
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,490
to buy a piece of the Beatles.

401
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,350
EMI is going private next month.

402
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,680
The British music publisher is being acquired

403
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,150
for nearly 5 Billion Dollars.

404
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,340
Terra Firma is an UK based private equity company.

405
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,600
They tent to buy companies
that are distressed,

406
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,930
not necessarily companies
that are in distressed industries,

407
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,320
which is important point
when you come back around EMI.

408
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,550
If you are in England,
I imagine you look at EMI:

409
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,000
it's the home of the Beatles,

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,230
it's is one of the most iconic
British companies ever.

411
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,400
And you say to yourself:
"Wow! I can fix that too.

412
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,290
Those dummies, I'm sure
that they don't know
what they're doing either.

413
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,990
So, let me buy that and turn it around."

414
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,350
The real principal of Terra Firma
is Guy Hands,

415
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,960
he's essentially the guy
who runs Terra Firma.

416
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,270
Guy Hands, he is a self-made billionaire.

417
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,790
He's been incredibly successful.

418
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,710
One of the victories he had was

419
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,160
he bought all the gas stations

420
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,250
on a highway in northern Europe.

421
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,630
And he cleaned the bathrooms.

422
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,930
Once they cleaned them all of sudden

423
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,560
business went up at the gas stations,

424
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,630
at the convenience stores attached to them.

425
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,500
And he made a ton of money.

426
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,240
They spent billions of
dollars on a company

427
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,390
and I really think
that they believed

428
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,970
they could transform it.

429
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,100
When Terra Firma came in and purchased EMI

430
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,320
they became that benefactor regime

431
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,870
that sued us for 30 Million bucks.

432
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,540
Terra Firma took
the negotiation away from us.

433
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,380
I think they looked
at it and they said:

434
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,070
I think they didn't like the fact

435
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,480
that it was a friendly renegotiation.

436
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,660
They came with a perspective
of we've got to be hard nose.

437
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,320
Take one...

438
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,860
I'm in a bad beginning... And again...

439
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,100
Woo... It's getting warmed up, dude,
one more.

440
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,000
Perfect

441
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,420
Let's just do a couple of more

442
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,300
and then we'll listen

443
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:17,960
One more...

444
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,340
One last one... One Maaaas...

445
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,480
Give me one second to loosen my hand up

446
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,880
One more... Just for fun.

447
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,570
Dude, you're still under a hundred takes.

448
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,980
You're at ninety seven.

449
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,160
Ninety seven? Okay. Fuck that!

450
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,460
We're gonna do three more.

451
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,510
Yes! Come on!

452
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,090
Hold on... Let me get ready...

453
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,250
I never met anyone as driven

454
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,640
who will work this hard

455
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,650
who will go to the, you know,

456
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,290
end of the earth and back,

457
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,920
just on a one and a million chance,

458
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,870
that something is gonna help the music.

459
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,520
There is nobody, that I know personally,

460
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,440
that can say that they do for their art

461
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,710
and their work what he does.

462
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,650
You ask me what Jared's role is

463
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,870
in the making of This is War?

464
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,140
It's too small of a question

465
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,700
to encompass what he does in the world of
Thirty Seconds to Mars

466
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,460
He is the Mastermind.

467
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,930
Success on the level
that we even have right now

468
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:26,250
we never dreamed. You couldn't...
How could you dream of this?

469
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,880
My brother and I were born in Louisiana.

470
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,340
We climbed out
of the muddy banks of the Mississippi

471
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,240
with our instruments in one hand

472
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,130
and... A fist full of food stamps in the other.

473
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,550
We had a very young mother.

474
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,780
I think she was pregnant with me and

475
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,140
had my brother by the time she was 18.

476
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,680
I was a child that had children.

477
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,680
I never considered that any of it was difficult.

478
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,740
Going to school with two babies and

479
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,720
being on welfare
and having food stamps

480
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,700
and Medicaid cards.

481
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,140
When you are a kid and you're poor,

482
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,010
I don't think you realize it.

483
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,100
It wasn't until I got much older

484
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,010
I realized we didn't have money to go out

485
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,160
buy a bunch of presents

486
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,850
Every Christmas was really about making

487
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,190
presents for each other.

488
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,580
We moved around quite a bit as kids.

489
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,010
When we lived together
it was always this thing,

490
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,830
there was always
something going on,

491
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,280
we were making art,
making music.

492
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,760
There was always things around,

493
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,180
anybody could pick up
and draw a paint with,

494
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,210
and dress up and dance around and sing.

495
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
I mean there was always that energy,

496
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,850
that creative energy.

497
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,120
They were indoctrinated into music quite

498
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,610
really early.
It was like music, music, music, music.

499
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,520
My mother used to sing in the car.

500
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,400
I remember she would harmonize with songs.

501
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,780
I remember thinking
that she always had a great voice.

502
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,660
She was always listening to music

503
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,170
and exposed us to a lot of great music.

504
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,510
And I never really thought

505
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,440
that you could be a musician in a band.

506
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,170
I never thought about fame,

507
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,740
I never thought about any of that stuff.

508
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,780
That early childhood,
that creative exposure

509
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,870
really helped shape my brother and I

510
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,240
in an important way.

511
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,260
Yeah, I like that, it sounds great.

512
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,860
It's definitely a tough place

513
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,380
to play something different I think.

514
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,490
What do the vocals say?

515
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,690
Right away, when they go off?

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,780
Wait, I don't even know the chorus.

517
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,450
It's also no rush.

518
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,140
We should just take the time it needs

519
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,070
to get it right.

520
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,800
And if we have to do it over 3 days,

521
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,860
we'll do over 3 days.

522
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,050
I'm just in it. I just... You know...

523
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,260
And then, it's gone... Oh my god, okay.

524
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,140
No, I got that.

525
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,170
That's the way it is, that's all.

526
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,920
Let's encourage each other to enjoy it as well.

527
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,850
This discovery.

528
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,280
Because it's awesome stuff,

529
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,980
the feel that you came out with the snare,

530
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,040
totally cool and you never done it before.

531
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,560
Let have a bit of joy while we do it.

532
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,060
That's all good... Different processes man.

533
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,480
I am enjoying it.

534
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,360
I got him all fooled.

535
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,090
We getting there,
but there's still lots to do.

536
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,170
I never heard of a label

537
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,090
that doesn't screw an artist.

538
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,150
You talk to anybody
who audits their label

539
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,010
they're always own money.

540
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,160
And if nothing else,

541
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,990
usually the label holds back enough money

542
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,530
that your cost of auditing is such

543
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,030
that you won't do it, so...

544
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,140
That's the business model
is screwing the artist.

545
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,630
The financial practices have been shady

546
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,900
since the beginning of time.

547
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,290
It's been grandfathered in since the 50's

548
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,090
and 60's when rock and roll really started.

549
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,560
In the 50's,
they were screwing the artist then,

550
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,820
but there was much
much less money involved.

551
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,340
Then as you start to go into the 60's

552
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,930
and the 70's, the hit to shit ratio is

553
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,110
so bad that they're saying:

554
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,460
"Hey! You know, we can't pay the hit artist

555
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,800
cause he is paying for all the bad artists."

556
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,450
It goes back to how the
music industry was set up

557
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,180
in the very early stages
of the recording industry,

558
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,460
taking advantage of
uneducated, easily swayed

559
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,540
artists who don't really
care about the money.

560
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,000
Unfortunately
there's a lot of fall out with,

561
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,200
still with bands getting
paid, you know.

562
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,680
We had to sue our label to get paid.

563
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,640
They've created
this strange convoluted system

564
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,190
that you have to be a lawyer

565
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,650
to really understand... Or mathematician.

566
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,310
A typical record deal is structured

567
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,390
something like this:

568
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,280
The record label gives an advance say:

569
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,520
250.000$ to the artist to record an album.

570
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,180
The artist then records the album.

571
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,420
Suppose that the album
sales 500.000 copies

572
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,360
at 10$ each yielding 5 Million Dollars.

573
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,120
The record label then takes their cut out

574
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,740
of the 5 Million,
typically 85% of the total sales.

575
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,500
Leaving the artist with 750.000 dollars.

576
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,980
But before the artist receives
any payments,

577
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,300
the label first deducts the advance.

578
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,310
In addition the record label
recoups other costs

579
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,330
such as: recording costs,

580
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,900
half the promotion costs,

581
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,800
half the video costs, and tour support.

582
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,710
This leaves the artist 425.000 Dollars

583
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,320
in debt to the record label.

584
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,450
And then this debt gets carried on

585
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,660
to the next album,

586
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,650
the next album,

587
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,280
and the next album.

588
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,570
I don't know if most people have seen

589
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,460
long form contracts, they're insane.

590
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,430
And there's all these little,
these little things throwin' in.

591
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,160
It's kind of like legislating,

592
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,740
you know, legislature for a government.

593
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,320
They put up this big issue
but underneath that issue

594
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,690
there's like seventeen other little laws

595
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,790
that they threw in,
that they are not talking about.

596
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,170
So, when you say yes to this one thing

597
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,550
you are actually saying yes

598
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,890
to like forty five other things.

599
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,630
There's a worse one,

600
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,430
they use to have damage fees
with digital downloads.

601
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,560
Digital downloads?

602
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,950
Like, at first they were doing that like

603
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,190
they just trying to get away with murder,
you know.

604
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,420
It just like let's leave in there,

605
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,350
let's see if the lawyer sees it
kind of thing.

606
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,250
Some other hidden items

607
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,350
that the contract includes are:
packaging costs,

608
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,110
they deduct up to 25% of the artist cut

609
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,640
known as the royalty to cover the expense

610
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,650
of plastic cases and artwork.

611
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,900
This cost is even administered
to digital downloads

612
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,400
where packaging is non-existent.
10% is deducted

613
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,820
to cover breakage costs during shipping.

614
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,400
They started in the vinyl era,

615
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,560
continued when CDs replaced vinyl

616
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,290
and still applies today
with digital downloads.

617
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,470
The 10% free goods deduction
is an antiquated

618
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,460
system where retailers purchased 100 albums

619
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,990
but are given an additional
10 albums at no charge.

620
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,880
Since the artist is only paid on album sold.

621
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,080
they are not compensated
for those free albums.

622
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,680
This deduction still continues

623
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,370
even in a digitally dominated market.

624
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,850
Artists generate so much money
for so many people

625
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,730
that have nothing to do with

626
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,690
the creative process at all.

627
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,790
There is no road you can go down

628
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,900
that the artist isn't fucked.

629
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,960
Most people out there who have jobs,

630
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,620
they can go to their boss ask for a raise,

631
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,000
they can leave and go get another job

632
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,940
if they are not happy.

633
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,070
Musicians don't really have
that ability to do that.

634
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,140
And by the way, if we don't like,

635
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,790
if we don't feel like pushing
your records anymore

636
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,210
we don't fell you gonna sell,

637
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,970
we're not gonna let you go,

638
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,740
we're just gonna put you
on the shelf over here,

639
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,430
we won't really let you work

640
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,100
but we're not gonna let you leave either.

641
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,600
It's like being in a bad marriage.

642
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,410
At what point does your husband beat you up

643
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,670
or your wife beat you up and you say:

644
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,640
I had enough I'm leaving.

645
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,850
That's the point we are at right now.

646
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,720
I'll be back in a second,
Irving is calling.

647
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,260
Can they stop us putting a record out?

648
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,540
It's really cool.

649
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,050
This is Taiko drumming

650
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,450
and I'm learning about Taiko drumming.

651
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,780
Shannon is a beast of a player.

652
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,190
He doesn't play in a song,

653
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,380
he takes the song over.

654
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,240
He inhabits it, he lives it,

655
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,010
he breathes it.

656
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,270
There's an energy
that he has when he drums

657
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,090
that's fantastic.
He's very animalistic.

658
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,470
He's completely emotionally reacting.

659
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,940
It's absolutely fascinating

660
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,150
to watch somebody like that.

661
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,130
My brother always had a love of music.

662
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,980
He had a real passion for it.

663
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,820
I would certainly not be doing this
if it wasn't for him.

664
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,900
The only thing I took seriously in my life
was music.

665
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
Before Thirty Seconds to Mars

666
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

667
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,540
I was doing construction, I was...

668
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,090
Breaking the law.

669
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,380
Jared often jokes about kids
from the wrong side of the tracks,

670
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,180
I was definitely one of those kids.

671
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,590
He would disappear,
you know,

672
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,620
he would just disappear.

673
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,370
I never knew
what he was doing.

674
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,310
I reached a point in my life where

675
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,090
I needed some sort of change and

676
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,930
music was the only thing that made sense.

677
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,040
He and Jared started
playing together a lot.

678
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,650
That's when it got serious.

679
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,390
That's when I was like: "Oh! Okay!

680
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,780
I need to follow this path."

681
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,380
He was the one
that was motivated to make music.

682
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,610
He was the one that was do or die with it.

683
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,740
Just the energy of us playing together.

684
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,890
That was exciting.

685
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,500
I just wanted to play, play, play, play.

686
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay. Secret spot. Pinky swear?!

687
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,890
I'll never be able to find it anyway.
So, don't worry about it.

688
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,380
So, what's the deal?

689
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,910
You had a long meeting the other day.

690
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,480
Yeah, EMI wants to make a deal.

691
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,960
Interesting.

692
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,790
It's a shitty deal but, it's a deal.

693
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,380
So, we have a couple of options.

694
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,470
There's the option
that's exciting to go on our own.

695
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,130
It feels like there's a lot of opportunities

696
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,620
with that independent spirit
and taking the mindset at...

697
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,440
Rather than signing an antiquated deal

698
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,940
with a company that has no interest

699
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,010
in really doing anything

700
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,600
except making the numbers work.

701
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,710
But that's the reality,

702
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,640
if you want to sign a record deal.

703
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,750
That's what you're doing.

704
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,560
High nose. Both options.

705
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,770
Jared?

706
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,610
Both options are a big gamble.

707
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
Yeah,
I don't know enough to have a real opinion.

708
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,840
But it's seems like going on our own

709
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,850
is the only way to go.

710
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,150
I don't know, it's hard.

711
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,490
Give me a name of one band

712
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,280
that's had continued worldwide success

713
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,530
without a label.

714
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,040
I can't give you one.

715
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,650
Some people say to take the deal.

716
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,980
Settle.

717
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,180
Yeah...
Just take whatever deal you can get

718
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,000
cause this is so fucked right now.

719
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,560
Basically,
you're looking for a record company

720
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,510
to handle very specific things

721
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,630
like promotion, marketing, and things

722
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,480
that I don't really want
to have to deal with.

723
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,870
Right.

724
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,530
If we go completely independent,
I'll end up...

725
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,240
That will be my life
- morning, noon and night -

726
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,230
is going to be having
to have a record company.

727
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,770
You feel you want to push army.

728
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,680
Yeah, I want to push army.

729
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,980
You take the rock of your choice,

730
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,950
or a bolder depending
how big your issue is.

731
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,300
And you throw it over the precipice

732
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,670
and when you throw it, you scream,

733
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,940
and you let go of this particular aspect of

734
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,460
who you are or something in your life

735
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,700
that's plaguing you.
And you leave it behind and...

736
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,500
And, well, we gonna do it right now.

737
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm gonna start or you wanna?

738
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,500
I go first.

739
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,420
Yeah, you go first.

740
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,990
Let's see what you got.

741
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,010
I just heard somebody say "ouch!"

742
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,430
That's pretty good.

743
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,460
It never landed... what's that been...

744
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,000
This is so fucking nuts.

745
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
Yeah.

746
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,620
By the way, I think I came up

747
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,800
with a name for the album.

748
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,220
What is it?

749
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,960
"This is War."

750
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,810
It's easier than ever
to make music and record it.

751
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,670
It's easier than ever to make videos

752
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,690
and record them properly.

753
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,970
It's easier than ever
to put them out there

754
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,620
but it's harder than ever
to make them heard

755
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,760
or have them heard
because there's so much noise

756
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,980
on the internet
so a record company

757
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,910
still has to do the job of helping
to filter that

758
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,990
and to promote things properly

759
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,370
so that they can get noticed.

760
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,590
And there's certainly exceptions of artists

761
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,540
that have done well
without a record company

762
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,240
but by in large
the overwhelming majority of artists

763
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,120
that have achieved, you know,

764
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,960
major success, have been signed
to major labels.

765
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,650
Major labels are
giant Cyclopes,

766
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,290
and they have one very
monstrously powerful eye

767
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,580
right in the middle of their forehead

768
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,460
and when it's staring at you, you know,

769
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,730
the world is a very bright and shiny place.

770
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,150
And when it's not,
there is no getting attention of that thing.

771
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,380
If I knew a band was going
to sign a major label deal,

772
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,500
I would probably try to dissuade them

773
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,260
or I would at least try to figure out

774
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,150
what they thought
they were gonna get out of it.

775
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,390
Increasingly, artist development is a term

776
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,190
that's not even use at record companies,
you know.

777
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,300
They use the word artist development

778
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,480
but it's offensive to a certain point

779
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,700
cause they don't really do that.

780
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,040
They look at the profiles,

781
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,830
in the old days, it was MySpace,

782
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,280
the profile numbers now it's Facebook,

783
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,240
YouTube, Twitter.

784
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,310
Can you sell 10 / 20 000 on your own
without a label

785
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,320
and if so,
then they start paying attention,

786
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,180
you know, kind of thing, but yeah,

787
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,140
but it's not artist development.

788
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,390
That's already signing an artist
that's developed itself.

789
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,740
I think the main reason people
really want labels now

790
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,640
it's legitimacy,
especially when you are a new band that,

791
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,280
that what you're doing really kind of matters

792
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,790
and is part of something,
and to get the press,

793
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,270
to get people believing in you.

794
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,070
So obviously, bands
when they get big on their own

795
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,660
then they sign with a label for that:
Legitimacy.

796
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,990
One thing we've definitely learn

797
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,040
is that artists need help.

798
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,670
Metric is a great example.

799
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,680
They were the first artists to break top 5

800
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,650
in pop radio with no label.

801
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,230
But if you talked to Matt Drouin

802
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,260
who manages Metric, he will tell you:

803
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,710
"We had more people working on that record

804
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,430
than if we were at a label.

805
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,420
We just hired them ourselves so, no,

806
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,600
we didn't have a label but

807
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,400
we kind of built our own staff around it."

808
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,560
When I got off the label,
I pretty much knew

809
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,210
I didn't want to sign with another one.

810
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,400
And I knew nothing could
beat doing direct business

811
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,070
with my fans, it wasn't...

812
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,880
There was no deal in the world
that was that good.

813
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,010
I cannot tell you how many eMails

814
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,960
I've got from fans saying:

815
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,660
"We want to directly support you.

816
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,290
How can we do it so
your label doesn't get the money?"

817
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,770
Give people awesome music

818
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,880
and then make it very easy for them
to help you.

819
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,520
And they will.

820
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,480
There are lots of artists,
like I said

821
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,490
who were finding themselves
with this choice

822
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,880
and it is not to say

823
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,260
that the labels can't win the argument

824
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,040
as to why an artist should use them

825
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,820
and partner with them. Em...
But it is to say

826
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,910
that there is a great number
of tools available

827
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,290
to independent artists
to do it on their own

828
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,970
and they are not necessarily considerably

829
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,840
inferior to the label choice.

830
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,460
What's the BPM?

831
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,690
GO!

832
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,220
Next chorus...

833
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,060
Thank you very much
have a nice fucking day!

834
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,330
I was 21 years old and I would do anything

835
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,260
in order to be able
to play music for a living.

836
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,360
But I had made the choice to give up.

837
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,790
I realized I had missed my boat.

838
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,660
I had made plans to sell all of my gear,

839
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,610
I didn't want to have any like,
memory of the music life.

840
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,820
The next day,
after like, making this choice,

841
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,000
is when I got the call to see if

842
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,670
I was interested in auditioning

843
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,950
for Thirty Seconds to Mars.

844
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,980
I'm like completely broke. I have no money,

845
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,170
I have nothing at all. I have a guitar

846
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,680
and some crappy gear.
And I begged my parents,

847
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,230
I was like, this is the one, I can feel it.

848
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,990
I know, I'm gonna get this.

849
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,760
No matter what,
nothing gonna stop me from getting this,

850
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,290
I will die if I don't get this.

851
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,520
We're auditioning like hundreds of people.

852
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:41,830
He walks in and he says:

853
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,300
"I just want to let you guys know

854
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,750
you don't have to look any further..."

855
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,790
I was so cocky and so stupid.

856
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,800
It could have gone so badly,
the way I was acting.

857
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,290
I was like,
alright, well, see what you got.

858
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,470
They took a chance on me.

859
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,430
I wasn't the coolest looking kid.

860
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,400
I certainly wasn't
the best guitarist out there

861
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,210
but there was obviously something
that they saw in me.

862
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,280
Re-signing with EMI, gets rid of
2 Million Dollars of all debt

863
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,060
and gets rid of
the Thirty Million Dollars lawsuit

864
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,340
but that fucking pissing me
this won (I know)

865
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,220
and it's not even the fight

866
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,210
to fight to beat somebody.

867
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,640
It's the fight to... to...
for what's right, what's fair!

868
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,260
You sign a deal in a way to compromise

869
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,770
but you're doing it so that

870
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,340
you could get in on the inside,

871
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,750
work with somebody

872
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,730
and change the fundamentals

873
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:18,710
that way rather than a confrontation.

874
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,370
Yeah, changing from the inside out.

875
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,230
Exactly.

876
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,190
Or do you confront it from the outside?

877
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,800
We would never have this opportunity again

878
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,690
to fight over the 7-year clause

879
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,880
and to go and like, change a part of...

880
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,440
Absolutely.

881
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,960
Not just the music business

882
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,690
but you know, the way that our

883
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,120
contracts are handled.

884
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,150
So there is this kind of... You know...

885
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,500
... Moral crusade.

886
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,050
Yeah, there's a bit of a moral crusade.

887
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,430
If they give us every single fucking thing

888
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,430
that we wanted

889
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,710
they would still be winning

890
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,980
and they know it!

891
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,130
That's the thing they're fuckin' know it!

892
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,150
And by the way, what the Fuck!
What if they give a shit,

893
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,590
they gonna go home and get their salary

894
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,560
at the end of the night.

895
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,610
They're getting everything that they want.

896
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,480
Complete domination over the artist.

897
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,200
Just be careful you know, addict...

898
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,650
Addicted is a strong word, to be the person

899
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,510
that is always gonna be in battle.

900
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,010
Maybe this is not the right time
to fight this

901
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,270
through this mechanism.
Just bide your time.

902
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,680
It might well be a different way
to fight it.

903
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,790
But you don't have to sacrifice as much.

904
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,500
The Company can always outlast the act.

905
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,240
We learn this lesson primarily
with Georges Michael.

906
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,630
He killed his career suing Sony, okay.

907
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,090
So, the act has an incentive to settle

908
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,510
because acts are not like engineers at IBM

909
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,650
who might work for 40 years.

910
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,330
Prince was pissed off at Warner Brothers

911
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,690
and stopped recording that's when

912
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,130
he changed his name to that symbol.

913
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,760
It was a protest against Warner Brothers.

914
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,320
So, was that the right thing?

915
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:13,850
You know, at the kind of his height,
to go sit on the sidelines

916
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,100
and then go make music
how many every years later

917
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,710
when people don't want to fight
about it anymore?

918
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,190
I don't know. Who won? Who lost?

919
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,910
I just remember the whole time thinking:

920
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,700
It's not a good idea
to go into a pissing contest

921
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,270
with the record company,

922
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,380
who has, who holds all the cards.

923
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,980
It's like a war of attrition.

924
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,570
It's like,
whoever wears the other person down first

925
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,710
is going to win.

926
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,330
Usually the company
they want to teach the act a lesson,

927
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,060
but they also need the revenue.

928
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,600
So, assuming the act is willing to sit

929
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,240
on the sidelines for a year or two,

930
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,950
they can ultimately make a better deal.

931
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,210
Hopefully they've not lost momentum
in the process.

932
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,510
Do you think as a corporation EMI

933
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,400
ever lied to you?

934
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,520
Erm... Do I think
EMI ever lied to us?

935
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,270
I am...

936
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,680
I'm seeking not to get sued
by 30 Million bucks,

937
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,600
So, I can't tell you or not
how they are inside.

938
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,900
I mean that's the only condition of

939
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,940
our release that I got to be a good boy.

940
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,270
So, give me some council here, my friend.

941
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,150
What am I doing?

942
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,060
Jesus Christ!

943
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,320
... It's getting worse.

944
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,560
I think I just caught your cold!

945
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,980
Okay, what's your advice here

946
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,110
as an expert in the music industry?

947
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,510
To me... To me... I think that...

948
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,130
I'm taking into account

949
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:19,210
what you guys are saying,

950
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,530
I think EMI is the safe bet.

951
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,390
Because, like I told you before,

952
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,930
I think you're doing one album for them

953
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:25,840
and you'll be done with them.

954
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,920
So, that's what I would do it's safer,

955
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,080
the other thing is riskier.

956
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,660
If you want to take a risk.

957
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,930
Got it.

958
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,640
No, it's how you feel, how you

959
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,060
and Shannon and Tomo feel about it.

960
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:39,790
Okay bye.

961
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,080
Okay bye.

962
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,620
Thanks. Hey?!...

963
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,630
I wanted to ask how much
that phone call costs me.

964
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,540
(Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow)
Dean Martin

965
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,210
It seems funny getting a Christmas tree

966
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,760
when it's totally sunny outside

967
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,540
and the guy is in a tee-shirt.

968
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,930
Hey! These are all the thrifty, she says,

969
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,400
these are the Charlie Browns.

970
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,350
The ones that have like, you know,
broken branches.

971
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,920
Yeah!

972
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,160
Yeah.

973
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,840
I think this one is pretty fucking funny.

974
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,820
This is all fucked up man,
there is no way they even...

975
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,840
It says 99 bucks,
I ain't paying 20 bucks for that.

976
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,910
20 bucks. He's got, look,

977
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,240
arthritis on the knuckle right here.

978
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,330
His hair are falling out.

979
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,790
OMG. Rheumatoid.

980
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,480
He's got short man's complex.

981
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,550
How much you gonna pay us
to drag this out of here.

982
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,370
I mean look at this thing.

983
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,660
I know, it's so sad.

984
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,250
I mean this is the ugliest tree

985
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,900
I have ever seen in my entire life.

986
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:41,980
How much you take?

987
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,650
19.99

988
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,680
19!

989
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,810
All right, we'll take it...

990
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,200
Where do you want to put this bad boy?

991
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,020
In the corner?

992
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,870
That was a bargain.

993
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,750
She was tall, dark, handsome.

994
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,310
Listen...

995
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,870
She was tall...

996
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,290
Okay... She was tall, dark, handsome...

997
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,230
The cigarette gets me in character.
I can't help it.

998
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,150
She was tall, dark, handsome,

999
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,230
hung like a wildebeest...

1000
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,940
Ohhh...
We've been sued for 30 Million bucks.

1001
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,890
Ahhh... We really are...

1002
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,720
We really are.

1003
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,030
What if they just said:
"Fuck you! This is done,

1004
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,890
We're taking you to court."

1005
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,570
She was tall, dark, handsome,

1006
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,030
hung like a wildebeest but I loved her.

1007
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,130
How you're gonna restructure Guy,
 just tell us?

1008
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,010
Why are the job cuts necessary Guy?

1009
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,710
What's your message to staff Guy?

1010
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,290
EMI news's owner Guy Hands was tight lipped

1011
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,650
as he arrived at the cinema

1012
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,800
to outline the music group's new direction.

1013
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,840
Inside staff learned that EMI is set

1014
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,880
to axe up to 2000 jobs.

1015
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,040
They stripped mine the place.

1016
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,400
They fired tons and tons of people.

1017
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,690
They put people in charge

1018
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,110
that never had any experience
in the record business

1019
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,670
or the music business.

1020
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,600
They started to decentralize it.

1021
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,120
They had all this strange pods

1022
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,000
instead of a more traditional structure.

1023
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,060
They also put some people
in positions of power

1024
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,420
who didn't make any sense to me whatsoever.

1025
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,550
I see it all the time.

1026
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,940
It is just the heavy hand of guys,

1027
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,460
who don't understand the business,

1028
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,250
who try to tell people,

1029
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,280
who do understand the business,

1030
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,270
how to do their jobs.

1031
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,380
I met with him once and he said to me:

1032
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,420
"All you people from the music business.

1033
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,660
You know you really don't know
how to run a business."

1034
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,630
They installed a lot of people

1035
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,890
across the global leadership of the company.

1036
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,690
And most people see at management levels.

1037
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,460
And these groups serious record company executives

1038
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,420
were gone instead in a matter of month.

1039
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,620
Obviously,
I have a certain bias

1040
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,870
and I was there
and I was very vocal

1041
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,260
about any of my disagreements.

1042
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,480
They wanted to restructure the company

1043
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,780
and in the terms of my contract,

1044
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,180
they couldn't
without asking me

1045
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,850
and so, they
did it anyway.

1046
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,610
In the old days,
you say what is EMI thinking,

1047
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,470
you would name 10 people
that have worked there

1048
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,730
for 20 years or 30 years.

1049
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,850
You'd worry about what they thought

1050
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,050
but there's nobody that's worked there
for 20 years or 30 years.

1051
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,630
It's not the company
or the people it ever was.

1052
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,810
We have been through so many regimes at EMI

1053
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,530
since we signed a contract
with Virgin Records.

1054
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,340
I can't even tell you how many it has been.

1055
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,420
It is safe to say it is
over eight less than twelve.

1056
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,610
I don't think there is a single employee

1057
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,760
that was there
when we signed our record deal.

1058
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,570
We would take care of the lawsuit.

1059
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,120
That's already cost me more money
than I have,

1060
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,610
than we have as a band.

1061
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,350
We've spent more money
that we have in the bank.

1062
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,070
Right!

1063
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,350
No, I understand

1064
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,510
I'm gonna have to tell them:

1065
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,860
they can suck my fucking proverbial dick!

1066
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,020
So, in a sense,
EMI has already bankrupted us.

1067
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,480
Kempler really is controlling this?

1068
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,940
No, the money guys are controlling it.

1069
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,230
You know Terra Firma...

1070
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,940
Well fuck them! That's such bullshit!

1071
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,700
How could that motherfucking *bip* *bip*

1072
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,910
can sit there and tell us

1073
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,260
that he was gonna do something

1074
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,620
and then not do it?

1075
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,630
Across the pond, it's Guy Hands,

1076
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,340
and here in America,
it's Jeff Kempler and I think

1077
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,980
that he is either trying to show off
for Guy Hands

1078
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,360
and he thinks
that he's gonna strangle all this.

1079
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,060
We have other options.

1080
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,150
I, myself I'm ready to go all the way.

1081
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,060
They're acting like they're so
ready and happy

1082
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,200
and willing to just go into litigation

1083
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,250
that I'm having to prepare the battle plan.

1084
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:06,450
I think everyone is getting lost in the deal

1085
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,690
and not seeing what a benefit

1086
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,290
it probably could be to me and to them,

1087
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,450
for us to work out something
fair and reasonable.

1088
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,360
But I can't do, I just can't do it

1089
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,600
if it's not fair. I can't do it and

1090
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,430
feel I've been taking advantage of?

1091
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,290
Okay, so what's the next move here?

1092
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:32,680
What's up?

1093
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,590
We need you again... (Okay)

1094
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,410
I thought that was gonna be an easy song.

1095
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,150
(yeah) I actually didn't think

1096
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,090
it was gonna be an easy song,

1097
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,940
I knew it's gonna be
a pain in the fucking ass!

1098
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,920
Em. Can we try... Em. Just... You know?

1099
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,010
Sure... It's huh... Pretty fast.

1100
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,730
Is it better one foot or two?

1101
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,930
One, I think.

1102
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,350
It's so weird, it's so fast.

1103
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:10,970
It's very awkward.

1104
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
Jesus Christ!

1105
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,790
You know what you want, man!

1106
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,180
I need power... Need power...

1107
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,430
It's not enough at one.

1108
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:24,780
I got it brother, my brother. Right?

1109
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,670
We will work with this.

1110
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,920
We'll call you in a minute.

1111
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,410
I don't know.

1112
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,200
I have no idea.

1113
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,290
What about a little bit of like:

1114
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,440
Some days you feel so strong

1115
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,660
and then, other days, you're like:

1116
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,060
what the fuck am I doing?

1117
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,560
I'm wondering if I'm ruining it?

1118
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,250
Am I fucking it all up
for Shannon and Tomo?

1119
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,740
Some days, I feel so confident, so strong,

1120
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,450
I'm like: it doesn't matter

1121
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,890
this album is gonna be so good,

1122
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,360
the songs are gonna be so great.

1123
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,090
It doesn't matter what label we are,

1124
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,200
we're gonna reach people
but you need the help.

1125
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,270
You need... You can't do it on your own.

1126
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,370
And the other days, you just feel like:

1127
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,610
what the fuck are we doing?

1128
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:20,790
And I don't know,

1129
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,580
maybe I'm fucked up to keep fighting.

1130
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,080
I've had one successful record.

1131
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:28,280
And I'm fighting like,

1132
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,680
I am the Rolling fucking Stones.

1133
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,760
But who the fuck am I?

1134
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,600
It's a fucking nightmare, man,

1135
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,390
this whole thing is a fucking nightmare.

1136
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,290
I mean, all of this could be a year from now,

1137
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:45,280
I mean, looking back and say:
"Wow, I fucked up!

1138
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,920
I didn't sign with the label,

1139
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,820
the record sold 12 fucking copies."

1140
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,070
I put everything that I have into this.

1141
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:57,010
My entire life, everything. We all have.

1142
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,430
You don't want to get through

1143
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,710
all this fucking legal thing.

1144
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,680
And you don't win anything.

1145
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,750
If it was like a pot of gold

1146
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,990
at the end of that rainbow, I'll do it...

1147
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:23,350
The win is: you don't lose anything.

1148
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,570
Hey, that's your win!

1149
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,570
The win is that
you get to pay the legal fees.

1150
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,340
That's what your win is.

1151
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,780
That's the win...

1152
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,110
You look to have some fun.

1153
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,710
I haven't talked to Kempler in 6 months.

1154
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,440
Let's call him. Your lawsuit...

1155
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,440
Hey! Brenna, call Jeff Kempler.

1156
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,850
I'm gonna have trouble being nice,
seriously...

1157
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,460
Hey guys,
I'm in the bathroom at the airport,

1158
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,400
so it's a little loud.

1159
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,620
It's probably a little cold, too.

1160
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,220
Any place where it's cold for you
makes me happy

1161
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,300
It's Irving.

1162
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,040
You sound like a corporate fucking dick,

1163
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,380
let's just talk about the deal.

1164
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,380
The reality of fact is that: it's,
you know,

1165
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,360
it's really hard to advise these guys

1166
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,050
to do anything
with that piece of shit of a company

1167
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:26,130
that you work for, and say yes, say no,
go away man,

1168
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,310
just go away, if you don't want to do this.

1169
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:30,220
And before they fucking sell the company out

1170
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,820
from under you guys, put out the record.

1171
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:32,440
Okay.

1172
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,390
But fly safe anyway. Bye.

1173
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,860
Right. By the way just side issue. (Yes.)

1174
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,410
How is the record company?

1175
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,950
What?

1176
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:47,970
I just want to feel good.

1177
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,330
This all negotiations,
it doesn't feel good.

1178
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,170
It's not supposed to feel good.

1179
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:51,650
No.

1180
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,420
This whole thing.
You've got the unstable time.

1181
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,620
You've got the unstable EMI.

1182
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,670
You've got the unstable maverick way.

1183
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:59,340
The thing... It's all unstable.

1184
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,040
So, there's no feeling
that's gonna be attached,

1185
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,370
to like: "Oh! Yeah..."

1186
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,590
Then you've got the album we're doing

1187
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:05,760
and you've got everything, dude.

1188
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,340
It's a little unstable, you know.

1189
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,590
Managers who are standing up

1190
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,990
and say they are very very worried

1191
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,960
about the instability at EMI.

1192
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:15,640
Major acts like Radiohead and

1193
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,080
Paul McCartney parted ways
with the company.

1194
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,110
And I just said to my producers,

1195
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,650
I said I want to feel excited

1196
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,180
by releasing this record.

1197
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,320
It's just a mess.

1198
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,130
They're trying to manipulate us

1199
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,180
with a little bit of fear.

1200
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,070
They're pulling deals out
from under our feet,

1201
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,190
they're fucking with us, they're toying,

1202
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,310
they're sending eMails, letters

1203
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,870
just outright hostile.

1204
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,670
The shakeup at EMI reportedly has Coldplay

1205
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,610
rethinking a future deal with the label.

1206
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,010
Robbie Williams's manager has been quoted as saying:

1207
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,670
"The star is in no rush to put out a new album

1208
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,560
due to a lack of faith in the new management."

1209
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,080
Today marks the deadline for Hands

1210
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,560
to meet a payment to Citigroup,

1211
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,310
one of its creditors, or

1212
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,600
he'll lose control of the firm.

1213
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,910
These people that they say one thing

1214
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:00,980
and that they do another thing.

1215
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,100
It's disgusting that they do business like this.

1216
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,630
They wonder why they have a bad fucking name.

1217
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,660
It's because they treat people like fucking shit.

1218
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,320
They deserve the fucking disaster

1219
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,600
that they are in the middle of.

1220
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,210
Walking out before I break shit.

1221
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,010
You know you've got to guide me here,

1222
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,890
I'm heel over my head,
I don't know what to do.

1223
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,550
Huh, I don't know either.

1224
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,440
It's amazing how this fucked-up-lawsuit

1225
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,940
is taking over our lives.

1226
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,160
I feel like fuck we should just take

1227
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,200
the god damn deal, whatever it is

1228
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,070
just fucking take it,

1229
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:35,510
what if everything got worse?

1230
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,250
This part of the record is always really

1231
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,360
really really important for me.

1232
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,300
It's like the backing tracks are there,

1233
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,010
they've got a lot of strong personality.

1234
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,740
It doesn't matter whether it's good or bad.

1235
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,330
It could be fast, it could be slow,

1236
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:04,000
but they've all got some sort
of essence to them

1237
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,670
that makes the songs stand out.

1238
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,920
And now, it's like filling in,

1239
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,840
it's coloring the picture.

1240
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,370
And I think that's the part

1241
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,990
that has been missing from you.

1242
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,320
I have to say: holy fuck!

1243
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,310
That's how I feel today.

1244
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,390
You don't have like undeniable.

1245
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,430
No, we don't right now as we speak, No!

1246
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,540
I'll sit here for another year,

1247
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,390
I'll Chinese democracy this motherfucker

1248
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,280
if I have to. It doesn't matter.

1249
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,400
I know exactly what you're talking about

1250
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,210
and this is quite usual at this stage
of making a record.

1251
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:43,000
You're now in the place where
you're doubting everything.

1252
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,600
Everything is sort of plateauing
and fundamentally,

1253
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,680
there is nothing that's getting
your juices going.

1254
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,330
And what I suggest is

1255
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,320
that we need to look at the whole thing,

1256
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,520
because...

1257
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,860
We're definitely missing a song

1258
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,420
I can tell you that right now.

1259
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,400
No, I agree with you.

1260
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:03,450
So, it might be that

1261
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,790
that has to be a period of just like:

1262
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,880
okay, we are missing this,

1263
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,650
we do need to do another song

1264
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,960
but maybe it hasn't been written.

1265
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,400
But without at least getting

1266
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,880
some of these other songs into point

1267
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,720
you're not going to know
what you're missing.

1268
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,920
I hope that this is mid... You know,

1269
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,700
the midlife crisis of the record,

1270
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,250
but I don't know, I mean,
we have to question everything.

1271
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,250
It's the morning, early early morning,

1272
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,180
it's still dark out and

1273
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,370
we have decided to get out of Los Angeles.

1274
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,710
And go to Florida.

1275
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,160
I just couldn't face not doing something

1276
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,490
for fucking New Year's Eve.

1277
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,210
We've been going at it all fucking year.

1278
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,720
I want to dance this week.

1279
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,540
You're gonna see a dancing fool.

1280
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,350
Ditto.

1281
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,980
I need breakfast before I face this shit.

1282
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:56,600
Everybody took a break.

1283
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,460
Shannon went to Hawaii,

1284
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,450
Tomo went to Michigan.

1285
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,450
I feel like, there's a lot up in the air

1286
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:10,870
and it was serendipitous

1287
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,330
that the holiday break came at the time

1288
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,460
when there was this make-or-break
kind of place

1289
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,550
we happen to be in,

1290
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,650
for the record,

1291
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,310
for the creative parts of the album,

1292
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,710
for the lawsuit.

1293
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,650
Ready? She thinks you are Jared Leto.

1294
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:28,730
She told me to come here

1295
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,990
and ask you if you're Jared Leto?

1296
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,070
Mmmm. Yep.

1297
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,400
You are? Serious?

1298
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:32,680
Yep.

1299
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,980
Are you just fucking with us?

1300
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,040
No... How you doing?

1301
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,880
I knew it.

1302
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,450
What's up?

1303
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,280
You don't think: oh, it's Miami,

1304
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,320
there's gonna be all these people

1305
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,490
taking pictures on the beach.

1306
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:48,260
Michael Jackson!

1307
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,060
So, we escaped

1308
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,950
and went to some alligator farm
or something...

1309
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,510
There's nothing like starting
your new year in a swamp.

1310
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,010
600 000 jobs lost in January.

1311
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,870
The DOW is already down 2000 points.

1312
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,510
This is the Frank Lloyd Wright house.

1313
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,270
I thought that would be a great place for us

1314
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,760
to record and would be really inspiring.

1315
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:30,030
You know what's exciting,

1316
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:32,580
we're gonna have the spirit
of this house inside the record.

1317
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,750
This is a living, breathing piece of art.

1318
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,830
Art, it's something we all
aspire our work to be.

1319
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,990
Some people can do
whatever they think of.

1320
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,890
And what they think of
 is special

1321
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,970
and moves other people.
Those people are artists.

1322
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:03,620
It's their bare honest truth

1323
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,450
about something that they love.

1324
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,260
I think it's one of the avenues

1325
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,670
to get to oneself
to find out who we are.

1326
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:25,400
Timeless art is 
the most difficult form of art.

1327
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,770
I see it in the Chrysler building,

1328
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:30,400
I see it in the Concorde.

1329
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,180
I hear it in the Beatles...

1330
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,570
The business is, I hate all those people,

1331
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:49,750
those people are leeches.

1332
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,690
All they ever do is care about
not losing their job.

1333
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:59,240
They never once care about
enhancing the value of art.

1334
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,270
One of the problems
we have in business at large right now

1335
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,620
is corporations own these businesses.

1336
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,160
So, it's very difficult to change it ever

1337
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,260
because it has to be this machine
that keeps going.

1338
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,610
The other part of the problem is that

1339
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:16,180
the business itself has
homogenized the process.

1340
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,580
The record company tells a band
what to write,

1341
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,350
how to write it, who to write with.

1342
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,840
You know. What is gonna be a single,

1343
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,060
what's not gonna be a single.

1344
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,670
And I think has far too much control
on a creative level.

1345
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:31,140
So, that everything starts sounding
very much the same.

1346
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,180
That's a pendulum.
I think.

1347
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,720
What inevitably happens is

1348
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,890
that companies
that are wrestling with that

1349
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:37,430
creative, intuitive,
blended with science,

1350
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,750
they swing way
too far to the

1351
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,450
lets-be-scientific-and-mathematical.

1352
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,580
Sort of
throw the baby out with the bath water

1353
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,400
and lose that comfort with intuition,

1354
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,800
creative sensitivities

1355
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,990
and mistakes get made that way.

1356
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,780
The record companies keep consolidating

1357
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,700
and so, there's less of them

1358
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,120
and that's dictated by the fact

1359
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,890
that it is a business and as business shrinks

1360
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,420
and there is less people buying music.

1361
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,870
What do the record companies do?

1362
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:05,880
They cut cost. So, as a result of that

1363
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,580
you have less places for artists to go,

1364
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,980
less people getting signed.

1365
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,400
I don't think it ever ends...

1366
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,350
I don't think it ever ends.

1367
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,010
I've been in this
business 19 years

1368
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,870
and it was going on,
the day I started

1369
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:18,260
and it's going on now, you know.

1370
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,010
I don't know that art and commerce

1371
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,820
ever get married like that.

1372
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:36,570
Hello!

1373
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,380
Jared they're grabbing Irving

1374
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,070
Nobody told us what they were gonna do.

1375
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,400
They wouldn't meet with us.

1376
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,060
They don't like us!

1377
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:56,180
Yeah, I'm beginning not to like them
very much either.

1378
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,170
Documentary changes your own music?

1379
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,030
Yeah, I don't understand how

1380
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,980
that even happened.

1381
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:05,510
I don't even know why we brought this up.

1382
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,230
We shouldn't have never even brought it up.

1383
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
No, I mean he would have say "no" later,

1384
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,360
you had to bring it up.

1385
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,040
You couldn't have just put the music in...

1386
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,710
You had to say... You know what I mean?

1387
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,400
So, if there is a shot of me sitting

1388
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,030
and playing one of my songs

1389
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,840
on the piano, at the house,

1390
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,980
I'll have to get permission from EMI

1391
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,530
in order to release this documentary?

1392
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:29,210
Correct. They're  basically gonna say that

1393
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,210
we have a contract ready for 2 more albums,

1394
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:35,510
so this is a settlement of that contract

1395
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,010
and under that old contract

1396
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,610
you couldn't put any music in the DVD
without them,

1397
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,450
they own the mere music, not you.

1398
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:43,940
And the way they've worded it,

1399
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,950
did they have like final cut over this thing?

1400
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,330
They're like: we need to see a copy of it

1401
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,310
and then we'll talk about it

1402
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,900
if we're gonna license you the music for it,

1403
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,110
is that basically how it is?

1404
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,650
Yeah, they're trying to
make you abandon the project.

1405
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,950
Trying to get me abandon the film.

1406
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,420
Yep. So, let's have a call.

1407
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:04,590
Okay.

1408
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:05,540
Bye.

1409
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,120
Bye.

1410
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:11,930
It all comes down.

1411
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,730
So basically, you sell the film

1412
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,090
for the record deal.

1413
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,190
Or you just take EMI out of the film.

1414
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:28,620
Cause then they'll say:

1415
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,060
"Sure, we'll let you put it out."

1416
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,860
What's up girls? Hello?

1417
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,750
To me, there is quite two factions
in this company.

1418
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,950
There's one that just doesn't want
to make a deal with you

1419
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,160
and there's one that does want
to make a deal with you.

1420
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,490
It's a further slap in the face to say

1421
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,640
you can't do the documentary.

1422
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,690
It makes no rational financial sense.

1423
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,740
I think I go back to them and say,

1424
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,080
we own the documentary

1425
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,570
and we can do what we want with it.

1426
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,000
Could you reiterate that
there's more to life out there

1427
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,460
than a bloated failing corporation?

1428
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:13,630
Aaahh Fuck... What a day. What-a-day!

1429
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,790
Could have been worse:

1430
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,020
the record company could have told us

1431
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,520
to go fuck ourselves.
Oh wait! They just did.

1432
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,530
EMI should be ashamed of themselves.

1433
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:37,440
They came back with their offer today.

1434
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,950
As soon we're getting somewhere,

1435
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,810
some giant fucking moron
at the company, thinks

1436
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,610
they're gonna control and own this.

1437
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,950
But guess what?
They can kiss my fucking ass!

1438
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,670
It's over. We are not doing that.

1439
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:52,060
Just talked to Irving. Fucking idiots, man.

1440
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:53,230
Good.

1441
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:56,700
Greedy fucking corporate hubris.

1442
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,800
We suggested a meeting, right?

1443
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,060
So, we can all sit face to face

1444
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,250
and not get lost in the deal

1445
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,650
and to be human about things.

1446
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,340
They said no. Just so you know.

1447
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,880
They said no, they think

1448
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,760
they're gonna own
that piece of music with me

1449
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,870
just diddling on the piano.

1450
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,070
I'll do it right now just for fun.

1451
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:34,300
That's not yours, not mine.

1452
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,540
No, it's just ludicrous.

1453
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,500
Selling recorded music that's the record.

1454
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,290
And that's historically the only thing

1455
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,940
that a record label records cared about.

1456
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,050
Until that's stopped making money.

1457
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,000
If Thirty Seconds to Mars started today,

1458
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,540
they'd have an even worse deal

1459
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,500
than they originally signed

1460
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,590
cause they'd have
what they called the 360 deal,

1461
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,690
they'd have to give away a piece
of their merchandising

1462
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,920
and their touring, to get their record deal.

1463
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,670
Thank god,
we didn't get stuck in one of those deals.

1464
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,450
360 deal is when a record label participates

1465
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,360
in all revenue streams of an artist.

1466
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:12,080
Typically touring, merchandise,

1467
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,430
could be publishing,
licensing opportunities,

1468
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:15,870
endorsement opportunities.

1469
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,990
It's a direct
response to the fact

1470
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:20,540
that no one is selling
10 Million records anymore.

1471
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,040
Even when you have a big hit,

1472
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,980
they're not as big as they used to be.

1473
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,490
So, if you are going to invest big money

1474
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,590
in making an artist famous

1475
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:31,110
then, you've got to find
more ways to collect.

1476
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,720
The argument I had on one
of these deals is they said:

1477
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:39,720
"- Okay, if my client has a baby
and sells baby pictures,

1478
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,010
do you participate in that? - Well yes."

1479
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,740
Over the last 18 months,

1480
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,020
90% of the deals
that have been,

1481
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,100
you know, signed by EMI,

1482
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,300
have an extended amount of rights,

1483
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,880
if they are not 360, they're,
you know, 280...

1484
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,840
or something... Whatever... You know.

1485
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,510
So yes, definitely, definitely more.

1486
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:01,560
Everyone wants 360
now as far as labels.

1487
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,250
Majors at least.

1488
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,630
Indies are still not necessarily all 360,
you know.

1489
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:07,800
Some do some don't.

1490
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,040
So, how does it help an artist?

1491
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,200
Well, it doesn't.

1492
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,180
You've got no leverage,

1493
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:13,490
you're a band
just starting out

1494
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:16,990
and neither a label
will take this off the table,

1495
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,290
so, so what do you do?

1496
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,380
For a band to do a 360 deal, well,

1497
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:24,420
now, they're turning over
their real cash prize.

1498
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,320
Which is their ability to make money touring

1499
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,910
and make money in selling merchandise.

1500
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:32,350
What do labels typically take from a 360?

1501
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:33,890
You know, they vary depending on...

1502
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:38,110
I've seen as much as
10 to 25% of the artist's piece.

1503
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:41,660
You know, I've seen some of the television

1504
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:47,840
star deals go as high as 50%. Pretty crazy.

1505
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,040
They've just got
this entire plantation mentality,

1506
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,560
they should own everything
that an artist does

1507
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,290
and I've never been comfortable with that.

1508
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,780
I just really hate that.

1509
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,760
I don't need your permission
as a record company owner

1510
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,610
to go do, you know,
things like movies or TV shows.

1511
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:05,880
Screw you guys !

1512
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,160
After we rejected their last offer,

1513
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,010
EMI finally agreed to sit down face to face

1514
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:28,290
so, that we could try to work something out.

1515
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,760
So, I got on a plane and headed to New York.

1516
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:39,670
We've been fighting for a long time already

1517
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:41,880
and there wasn't a lot of communication going on

1518
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,550
with us and the label directly.

1519
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,130
Let's say virtually none.

1520
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:50,860
It's freezing out!

1521
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,060
I always loved this city
ever since I was a kid,

1522
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:02,580
it's been a magical place for me.

1523
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:04,670
Every time I come to New York, I'm excited.

1524
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,200
I feel like this is my city in a weird way.

1525
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:13,670
More than LA is.
There's something about it.

1526
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:16,240
Always an adventure.

1527
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,290
Wait, wait, you're in a movie. I know you.

1528
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,370
You're famous, aren't you?

1529
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,780
Erm... Yeah... Kind of...

1530
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,560
You were in that very cool movie
(Sometimes…)

1531
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,230
with the crazy lady.

1532
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,330
Yeah, yeah, Requiem for a Dream.

1533
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:29,420
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god... Etc.
(Hi)

1534
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,980
You're in my favorite mov…
(How is it going?)

1535
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,250
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry.

1536
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,800
You are in my favorite movie in the whole...

1537
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,570
I love that movie.

1538
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,220
Thank you.

1539
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,240
Oh my god, oh my god...

1540
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,930
What's in that drink?

1541
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:38,980
Extra caffeine?

1542
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:41,710
It's the big meeting Sunday.

1543
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,360
It's was nice to be in New York.

1544
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,150
I had a chance to get away from the studio

1545
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,550
and see some friends.

1546
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,470
But the main focus of the trip
was this meeting.

1547
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,940
I was excited that there was a chance
to work things out.

1548
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,200
Unfortunately...

1549
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,690
EMI canceled...

1550
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,500
It was a long way to go

1551
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,950
to get stood up,
but while I was in New York

1552
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:13,630
I heard that
there were major changes happening

1553
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,250
at the label once again and

1554
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:18,720
that any possibility of a deal with EMI

1555
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,800
was very unlikely.

1556
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,340
Oh! I like that... What he is playing.

1557
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,290
Gonna tell them I like that.

1558
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:40,340
Did you record that?

1559
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,380
No, no, the regular one.

1560
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,170
Huh? No, no, I like the beginning

1561
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,570
how you just played that.

1562
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:46,380
Yeah.

1563
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:54,660
It's fucking fucking because it's off.

1564
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,920
It gets off.

1565
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,010
You just got to listen to the click
you're good.

1566
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,050
Hold on a second.

1567
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,210
It's fine.
You just got to keep on that beat.

1568
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:03,990
That's the thing.

1569
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,710
I'm playing to the click but it's going slower.
(Yeah, I know)

1570
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,830
 but you're right with the click

1571
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,910
so it's really hard.

1572
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,250
You know you got to be like a machine.

1573
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:10,870
Ahhhh! Humans!

1574
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,600
You hear that the slicer is not with the click?

1575
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,680
Right?

1576
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,760
You want me to play that?

1577
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,830
Yeah, go ahead, yeah, please do.

1578
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:22,980
Prove me that the slicer is not slowing down!

1579
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,520
I'll prove it right now.
Where is my goddam pick?

1580
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,590
That's it... Use his pull-off...
Use my other thing...

1581
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,560
It's like the performances between the two

1582
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,430
are good enough so...

1583
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:43,940
Oh yeah... The elbow, baby!

1584
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,580
The fucking elbow! Woo...

1585
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,130
Here we come motherfucker! Yeah!

1586
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:49,130
What else we...

1587
01:26:55,330 --> 01:27:00,120
Don't you just want to make
something that lives forever?

1588
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,490
Something that's phenomenal?
Something that's great?

1589
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,510
Something that's undeniable?

1590
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,010
That touches the core
of every person that hears it?

1591
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:09,570
Yeah! (You know)

1592
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,060
Yeah. You want to make something beautiful,

1593
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,250
something moving, something provocative,

1594
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:17,200
something that's pure and true.

1595
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,180
We're doing that.

1596
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:20,410
I hope so.

1597
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:53,180
All along EMI had been interested
in resigning us.

1598
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,380
The problem was they kept offering us

1599
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,240
different variations of the same terrible deal.

1600
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:02,410
We decided we would consider resigning with EMI

1601
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:04,480
if they were willing to make things right.

1602
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:06,910
Especially as it would put an end

1603
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,430
to this brutal lawsuit and ensure

1604
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:10,080
that our album would see the light a day.

1605
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,740
So, we went back to them one last time

1606
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,330
and basically told them:

1607
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:17,380
"Look,
these are our final terms and conditions,

1608
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,460
either meet them

1609
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,830
or there really isn't anything left
to talk about."

1610
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:25,580
EMI responded saying
they'd get back to us in 24 hours

1611
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,150
with their official final response.

1612
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:33,070
It's a little weird
we haven't heard from EMI.

1613
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:34,690
No word from EMI.

1614
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:36,560
We're waiting for one finale response.

1615
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:37,810
Aaahh...

1616
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,150
...And... Nothing!

1617
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,590
Still no word from EMI.

1618
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:45,400
We're gonna hear from them tomorrow.

1619
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,530
Tomorrow is the day.

1620
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:51,790
It's not bad.

1621
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,790
Tomorrow,
which is what we've been told again,

1622
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:02,020
and again, and again, and again, etc.

1623
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,460
That it was tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...

1624
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,340
Jesus Christ!

1625
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,680
Please someone just shut that fucking dog up.

1626
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,070
Maybe he's pissed too?

1627
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,440
EMI told him he's gonna get
his dog food tomorrow.

1628
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:22,620
We should have something
tomorrow, tomorrow, etc.

1629
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:36,320
It's like the guy in the movie, you know.

1630
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,960
Tooooomorrrrrrow. It's ridiculous.

1631
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:56,910
EMI.

1632
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:05,630
Holly shit.

1633
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,360
EMI caved.

1634
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:18,230
"I think we are done, capital D.O.N.E.

1635
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,310
Press release to be mutually approved

1636
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,220
but that can happened quickly after signing,

1637
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,580
meanwhile could you get
an approved quote from Jared

1638
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:25,830
and we will send you a draft.

1639
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:30,580
Thanks to all, now the real work starts."

1640
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,370
Now we have to decide.

1641
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,540
So Shannon, Tomo and I
got together and debated,

1642
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:27,610
discussed and made a decision.

1643
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:30,610
EMI came to us and offered us

1644
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:32,190
the deal we were fighting for.

1645
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:33,740
So, we accepted.

1646
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,970
Is it really Friday the thirteen?

1647
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:49,160
It is pretty brave, bold and stupid of them

1648
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:54,750
to actually make a deal with a band,

1649
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,750
even if it's us,
without having heard the record.

1650
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,660
But at the same time, they knew

1651
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:01,210
there's not a chance in a fucking hell

1652
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:03,150
I was gonna play them
a single second of this record.

1653
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:07,980
You have to do what's best
for the music at this point.

1654
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:12,490
I think what's best
for the music is resigning with EMI

1655
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:13,680
and putting a record out.

1656
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,650
Your goal on this album

1657
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:26,520
is to have many people as possible buy that.

1658
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,070
You have to consider your career.

1659
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,180
It's all about your career.

1660
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,500
So, what do you think we should do?

1661
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,630
I think you should sign this thing,

1662
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:34,680
get your record out there

1663
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,540
and get back to your career away from courts.

1664
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:38,220
What do you think we should do?

1665
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,220
You should absolutely sign this deal right now

1666
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:43,160
and then go back to the studio
and keep working.

1667
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:43,750
Yeah.

1668
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:46,200
It's amazing that at the same time

1669
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,350
we're trying making a deal,
the world is falling apart.

1670
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:50,130
Look, you've got seven or eight years

1671
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:52,360
of the record business
just going straight to the dumper

1672
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,450
and then, six great months ago,

1673
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:56,240
the rest of the world went
with the record business.

1674
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,190
Everything is in the dumper now.

1675
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,250
So, why don' I feel like
we should be celebrating?

1676
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,220
Because it's the record business,

1677
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,690
there's really nothing to celebrate

1678
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:05,810
about the record business,

1679
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,550
because it's a dying business.

1680
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,620
And especially on an international level

1681
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:12,340
where you guys,
you're gonna sell 70% of your records

1682
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,110
cause more records still sell overseas.

1683
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,580
You know,
you gotta have one of these, guys.

1684
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,800
And this is the one you get
without a lawsuit.

1685
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,020
Jared, you were very idealistic and

1686
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:23,080
you wanted to write
the wrongs of the record business

1687
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,370
and you're not gonna have
your chance to see it before

1688
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,580
it shines a light on the corruption
of the music business

1689
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,710
or take it down,
but it's going down anyway.

1690
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:31,700
That's the problem.

1691
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,670
It's hard to stop fighting sometimes.
(Much tougher)

1692
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:34,850
How do you stop fighting?

1693
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:35,890
How can you do that?

1694
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,580
Because they're all fired.

1695
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,860
This, by the way, is one contract.

1696
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,500
Take a deep breath, man.

1697
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,540
The deal that we made was a very favorable one

1698
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,800
and a much better deal
that Thirty Second to Mars had.

1699
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,400
The goal of the litigation is to accomplish

1700
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,530
whatever goal you got the litigation for.

1701
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,270
I don't think that the court room

1702
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:01,130
is a really good place for artists to be.

1703
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,110
I think they're better off in the studios.

1704
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,360
The real battle is the clock starts.

1705
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,950
You got to finish the record.

1706
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:11,550
Mmmm... Yeah.

1707
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:14,800
Try to get this show on the road.

1708
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,650
And no excuses.

1709
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,250
Have you finished with this song yet?

1710
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,240
So, the new contract with EMI says

1711
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:28,320
that we have three weeks left to finish.

1712
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:29,780
The clock is ticking.

1713
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,610
Is there any kind of methodology

1714
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:49,050
that you know about
to increase the productivity

1715
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,430
of the remaining days we have here?

1716
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:55,410
So, Guy Hands stepped down today.

1717
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:56,230
Oh, did he?!

1718
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,550
That definitely means there's some shit shifting

1719
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:59,530
and changing around.

1720
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:02,500
Breaking news, Citigroup taking ownership

1721
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,750
of one of the world's leading music companies.

1722
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,600
Guys Hands is from Terra Firma, acquired EMI

1723
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,030
with a lot of debt and the numbers

1724
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,750
never made a lot of sense and so?

1725
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,700
here we are with Citigroup taking control of EMI.

1726
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,610
The decline and demolishment of EMI

1727
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:25,300
is a sad 21st century story of failure.

1728
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:29,180
He was running a whole company

1729
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:31,630
that categorically
he was incapable of running.

1730
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,900
Obviously it turned out to be
a tremendous mistake

1731
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:35,220
bought at the wrong time.

1732
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,360
He really believed
he was gonna transform it

1733
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,680
and then sell it. I don't think he thought,

1734
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,660
that he would own it and then, lose it.

1735
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:45,750
What EMI now is,
it's a bump sitting on Citibank

1736
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:49,190
balance sheet, waiting to be removed
from their balance sheet

1737
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:50,760
and sold to the next sucker.

1738
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,040
There is no killer App. to turn around
a record company.

1739
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:57,660
It has to be done slowly and patiently
and it takes time.

1740
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,060
It takes time to break artist,

1741
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,070
it takes time to sign artist,

1742
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:01,720
and it takes time to get
the right executives in.

1743
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:05,140
I think that guy,
and I wouldn't say this to his face...

1744
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,380
Hum... He is a very bright guy

1745
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:13,130
who unfortunately had the popular misimpression

1746
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,830
that the music business is populated
by idiots and thieves.

1747
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:18,830
We've got our fair share of them,

1748
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:21,220
but there's a lot smart,
good people in the business.

1749
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,210
Just because the guy is a billionaire

1750
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,720
and he's made a bunch of money
in other businesses,

1751
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,710
you know... We have a long list of people

1752
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:32,130
from outside the music business
that have come

1753
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:34,820
and entered the business and left it
in ruins.

1754
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,520
And he is the biggest fool of all of them.

1755
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:58,160
You know what I think?

1756
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:58,830
What?

1757
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:00,810
I think we're gonna finish this song tonight.

1758
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:13,970
Pretty good one.

1759
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,740
Let's call it finished.

1760
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:19,310
Woo! High five! Yeah!

1761
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:25,640
Woo! Come on! Don't leave me hanging, boys!

1762
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,680
The future of the music business is
unknown.

1763
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,650
That's what makes it exciting to some

1764
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:07,350
and really scary to others.

1765
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:09,690
Because people can record in their houses

1766
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,290
and distribute overnight.

1767
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:13,870
I believe that music can reclaim

1768
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:16,070
its space as the driving medium.

1769
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,740
There is change, there's evolution.

1770
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:20,270
If you don't ride the change, you die.

1771
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,390
Jared always jokes that some kid
is gonna write a song

1772
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:24,740
and he's gonna figure it out

1773
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,240
and is gonna sell hundreds millions copies
of a single

1774
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,870
by himself and he's gonna make
a Billion Dollars

1775
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:31,220
and he's gonna say: "fuck you,

1776
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,580
I don't need you." And then,

1777
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,070
that's gonna be the new beginning.

1778
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:35,800
People listen to
more music now

1779
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,440
than ever before,
from a bigger

1780
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,570
diversity of artists.

1781
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:41,180
So, I think culturally,
we are in a much better place.

1782
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:42,680
I look at it and I actually think

1783
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:45,160
that we are at sort of entering
the golden age for music.

1784
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:48,760
I love the idea that we may,
in this next generation,

1785
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,490
not be living in a world of
the possibility of,

1786
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,320
you know, being successful is,

1787
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:58,070
that you have to be
Michael Jackson, Madonna,

1788
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,210
Prince, Lady Gaga but, that actually like:

1789
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:02,750
the dream of being musician means,

1790
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:06,410
you can just make a living
and connect with people

1791
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:08,750
and make your music
and not have to have a job you hate.

1792
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:09,970
Music will never die.

1793
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:12,460
It will always drive industry,

1794
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,420
it will always drive innovation,

1795
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:17,000
it will be always be available to everyone

1796
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,690
and everyone always is going to want it.

1797
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:22,740
It doesn't really matter
what the critic says

1798
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:24,270
or the gatekeeper says,

1799
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:27,220
really, in this day and age
of the music industry,

1800
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:29,630
the new gatekeepers are the fans.

1801
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:34,130
If you have 5 Million people
downloading your album for free,

1802
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:37,450
that's still 5 Million people
you've touched.

1803
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:42,350
and has a value to me
that's far greater than money.

1804
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:43,930
How many people have a copy

1805
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:45,890
of our new record "This is War?"

1806
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:52,180
And how many people stole
that copy off the internet?
