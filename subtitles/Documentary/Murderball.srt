1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,440
This programme contains
very strong language.

2
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
MOTOR STARTS

3
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
I've been out in clubs, I've been
out all over the place and people
will come up to me, shake my hand

4
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
and say "It's good to see you out."

5
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,720
And I look at them like,
"Good to see me out?"

6
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,840
"Am I supposed to be in a closet?"

7
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,720
What I can do that probably
people don't think I can do is,
I can cook and I can drive.

8
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,320
I may not be a great cook,
might not be a great driver,
but I can do both.

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,800
People say the dumbest things. I'll
be loading groceries into my car,
"Do you need help in your car?"

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,520
It's like,
I wouldn't come to the store
if I couldn't get back in my car.

11
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,960
I've gone up to people, talking shit
and they go, "Oh..."

12
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,480
I go "What, you're not going
to hit a kid in a chair?
Fucking hit me, I'll hit you back."

13
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,480
Quadriplegic rugby was developed
in Canada and the original name
was murderball.

14
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,560
What we do is take these
wheelchairs and make 'em into
a gladiator, a battling machine,

15
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,200
a Mad Max chair that can knock the
living daylights out of each other.

16
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Most people that play wheelchair
rugby have broken their necks.

17
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,200
So we have rods, plates, screws
inside.

18
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,000
The biggest misconception is that
quadriplegics can't move their arms.

19
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm like "No, I have
impairment in all four limbs."

20
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,040
The higher you break your neck,
the less mobility you have.

21
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
So we're given point values
ranging from half a point

22
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,240
to three and a half points,
based on what you can move.

23
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,800
You can't exceed eight points
on the court at one time.

24
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm a two, because I have some
hand function and full arm function.

25
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,720
My hands don't close, they only
open, so, like spatulas for
pancakes, for flipping' people off.

26
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,680
When I was 16, I was in
a car accident, car hit a tree

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,240
and made the car flip
and the roof came down on my head.

28
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,560
And I became
an incomplete C6 quadriplegic.

29
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I was out on the back porch
and he picked a fight with me

30
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,000
and he picked me up and threw me
off the deck and he punched me
and it snapped my spinal cord.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,600
I've got a few muscles left,
but for the most part, my trunk's
paralysed to about right here.

32
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,640
I've got a bicep,
my triceps are paralysed,
I've got little finger function.

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,760
Hold on, let me move 'em.
Did you see? I moved 'em.

34
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,280
One thing we do to help grip
the ball is we add some kind of glue

35
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,560
so it's sticky and you can pick
the ball up and throw it.

36
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm a three and my grip is affected.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,680
I can't close that.

38
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,640
Plus I'm missing a muscle
in my left shoulder.

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,160
My accident happened
in Florida when I was 18.

40
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,720
My buddy spun out, threw me into
a canal. I spent 13Â½ hours
in the canal

41
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
holding on to a branch
until somebody found me.

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
He has always been
what I call a tough kid.

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I know very few people
that would ever fuck with Mark.

44
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Just to see him out on the court
with the tattoos up his arm
and the goatee, he's intimidating.

45
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,160
He's one of these players
people try to stay away from.

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
Jason...

47
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,560
Where you want to go, down or up?

48
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,800
I have backup. Where?

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Where? Where? Where?

50
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Where do you want to go? Shut up.

51
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
You want us to call security?

52
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,920
My hypothesis on Mark was, he was
very much an asshole before he was
in the wheelchair, so any attempt

53
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,800
to try and point to the wheelchair
or the accident as the cause of his
grumpiness would be an utter hoax.

54
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,120
We just arrived today from Stockholm
and we just saw a lot of people

55
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,080
in wheelchairs and of course
wondered what they're doing.

56
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,920
THEY PERFORM THE HAKA

57
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
One, two, three!

58
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,840
USA!

59
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,080
Rugby! Yeah!

60
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,120
The United States has dominated
the sport of wheelchair rugby
for the last ten years.

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll be the first one to say, look,
I just want to beat the bloody
Americans, more than any team.

62
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,200
We find the United States pretty
arrogant,

63
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,560
they've been winning
this game for a long time.
That's what we came to fucking do.

64
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,120
There's been, I believe,
11 international competitions.

65
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,160
The US has won all of 'em.

66
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
Round 'em up!

67
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Um... yeah, I can, but Kevin came
over here during one of our games

68
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,760
and we weren't, so you want
to kick us out the same way.

69
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,640
Fuck you, bitch.

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,280
"Joe Soares may be the best
quad rugby player in the world."

71
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,120
"Childhood polio
took Joe's ability to walk,
but not his drive to excel."

72
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,000
My Uncle Joe, you go to his house
and he has this wall of fame,

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,440
it's not just a small shelf,
it's huge.

74
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,280
Joe's one of the most competitive
men I've ever been around. It shows
in his sports accomplishment.

75
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Being around him
is like being around Elway -
just a great competitor.

76
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,160
In '96, Joe was the man.

77
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,560
That gold medal,
he was a huge part of that.

78
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
Unfortunately, his speed went
down, he became older,

79
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,040
so he got cut.

80
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Joe got a little upset, a little
angry he didn't make the team,
tried to take us to court.

81
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,200
He pissed and moaned and cried over
it and he lost all of his protest.

82
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,760
Just because things didn't
work out for him, he jumped
ship and left to go up north.

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,800
And now he's coach of Team Canada.

84
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
Canada!

85
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,080
Yeah!

86
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
He took the plays with him,
took some of our calls with him

87
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,560
so he'd know when to attack
and how to attack.

88
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,880
USA, learn a new way!

89
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
If Joe was on fire,
I wouldn't piss on him.

90
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,120
Yeah, yeah!

91
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,760
Yeah!

92
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Yeah, baby, yeah!

93
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,840
Yeah? Any time, big boy.

94
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,680
He thought I should respect
him for just who he was.

95
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,640
Fuck you, I ain't gonna respect you
for who you are.

96
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,760
You've got to gain respect.

97
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,680
I'll remove you from my
face if you yell in it again.

98
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,480
If you think you're man enough, OK?

99
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,360
Go fuck eggs, boy.

100
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,120
This is ours for the taking, boys!

101
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,920
This is ours! So tonight,
no drinking, go to bed early
and get ready for USA in the finals.

102
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,680
You got that? All right, boys,
great job, great job, great job!

103
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,520
Tomorrow,
I don't want to see anyone
talking to anyone except your team.

104
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,440
They're gonna be talking all kinds
of trash, Joe's gonna say whatever
the hell Joe says, I don't care.

105
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,360
The only reason Joe went to
Canada is to beat the United States

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,360
and we're gonna kick the
shit out of them. It's our time!

107
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,000
We wanted them, we got 'em!

108
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,560
This is it!

109
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,840
On the count of three,
loud and proud!

110
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,760
Loud and proud, 1, 2, 3... Yeah!

111
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
USA! USA!

112
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,200
USA! The objective, basically,
is to inbound the ball, we play
on a regulation basketball court,

113
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
you go from one end to the other.

114
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,960
Stop the ball, stop the ball,

115
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,160
stop the ball!
Two wheels have to cross over
the line with possession of the ball

116
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,720
then you get one point.

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,200
The other guys stop you
by slamming their chair in to you.

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
Help him! Dave, Dave, help him!

119
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,920
You have to dribble the ball or pass
to a team-mate every ten seconds.

120
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,040
Other than that, it's basically
kill the man with the ball.

121
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,840
Everybody get back. Everybody
get back! Get the hell back!

122
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
Get over here! Get over here!

123
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,600
Everybody over here.
Everybody stay here.

124
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Cheap crap!

125
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
Motherfuckers.

126
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
Blow the whistle, please.

127
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,200
You've got Declan right there,
he's behind you.

128
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Pick it up! Pressure! Pressure!

129
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,320
Hit 'em! Hit 'em!

130
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,440
USA down!

131
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,040
Pick this man, that's your job.
When you're back here,
last man standing, stay with him.

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
Go, Dave, go, Dave, push, push!

133
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,560
USA, USA!

134
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,920
Yeah!

135
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
Fuck! We're gonna do this, guys!

136
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,960
It's gonna happen right now.

137
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,680
1, 2, 3... USA!

138
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,280
Ten seconds.

139
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
It was really an exciting thing.
Congratulations. Thank you.

140
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,560
My pleasure. Great job.

141

# We stand on guard for thee

143

DISCO MUSIC BLARES

146
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Kiss them medals.

147
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,280
Hey, buddy, skol!

148
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,000
We love you! You're the best coach!

149

Fuck.

150
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,880
Andy. Andy, do I need to
buy you a beer or something?

151
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,520
Do I need to buy you a beer?

152
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,240
If we had lost,
I would have been happy for your ass.

153
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,720
If you had paid your dues in the US,
you would have been fucking
head coach...

154
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,360
Paid my dues?
I paid my dues for 12 years, buddy.

155
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,480
You know what, you've got many years
to play afterwards. Guess what, bud?

156
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,920
That was my last shot, baby. How does
it feel to betray your country, man?

157
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
58, 59...

158
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,560
There's a perception
that everyone can play this game,
but you start with 500 players

159
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,080
that play in the
United States, we whittle down that
group and get our best 12 players.

160
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:56,440
And the level of play that's gonna
be in Athens is far higher than
world championships was in 2002.

161
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,960
You gotta pull in the 12 guys
that are gonna have your back
in order to win a gold.

162
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,760
Five minutes. All players!

163
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,040
Let's do a game called sweat.

164
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,880
It's five cards up each time.

165
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,760
Your call, buddy.

166
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,680
Out. Out.

167
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,160
All right, I'm in. Bobby!

168
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
Flip 'em. What you got? Full house.

169
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,000
Explain why you think
he's interesting.

170
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,160
We respect Joe, hopefully
he respects us, that's it. I don't.

171
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,600
He tried to help us with some
fundamentals, tried to help us with
some clutch situations. Who cares?

172
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,480
Does that make him a shining star?

173
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,840
Does that mean you go
and coach Canada?

174
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,520
Professionally,
there's nothing wrong with it.

175
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
That's the second
stupidest thing I've heard.

176
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,480
At this camp, I heard Sam say
he doesn't like big tits
and he'd dump a girl with big tits.

177
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't lie. It's over. Don't lie.

178
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,760
They get in the way.
I like athletic girls, that's
what I said all along that night.

179
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,920
You'll never live that one down.

180
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm OK with my sexuality,
I can say I don't like big tits. You
like shoes though. I do like shoes.

181
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,160
Everybody that gets hurt
thinks they're gonna walk again.

182
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,840
Your mind becomes a bigger
disability than physical stuff.

183
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,000
I had the idea
that I would walk again

184
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,600
so I was just gonna hide and deny
the whole thing until it went away.

185
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,680
I didn't go outside, I even got
to the point where I got scared

186
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,320
to get the newspaper in the morning
cos I thought people would look
at me in the driveway.

187
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,920
And that kind of fed itself.

188
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
What's really hard is
the first two years.

189
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,040
Quadriplegics, after
they have broken their neck

190
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,560
and they've got very little
function, they can't do anything
for themselves.

191
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,240
They've got someone helping them,
someone wiping their ass

192
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,720
and they work for three to four
years trying to get independent.

193
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,240
It's a mind fuck in the beginning
and then either you make it
or you don't.

194
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,800
All his life, as soon as he was
able to get on a tricycle,
he's been on wheels.

195
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Bicycles, dirt bikes, quads -

196
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
he loved wheels.

197
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,640
Now, one of the favourite things
in the world to Keith hurt him.

198
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
You got it.

199
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,800
All right!

200
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,360
Now come back down.

201
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,800
When you go down to that gym,

202
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,240
you realise
how much you're broken down,

203
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,320
you're really almost at
an infant's level.

204
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,160
You get frustrated
because you can't even lift
your arm up to itch your nose.

205
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,280
Just shaking hands with somebody,
I can't even make a firm grip
with my hand to present myself.

206
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
And that type of reality check,

207
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
you just, you can't explain
to anybody.

208
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
Yeah, the Velcro's put on too tight.

209
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,600
Hello, my name's Joe Soares
and I have to tell you, brother,

210
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,480
this is the wall that's about me.

211
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
These are the trophies I've won.

212
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
So we go through all this
and we have Texas, Texas, Texas.

213
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,560
Those are my MVPs.
Those are my MVPs.

214
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm doing you, Joe.

215
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
Come on over here, Joe,
we're having fun.

216
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,560
This here is the gold medal
from Sweden that we won, Joe.

217
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,640
We're glad
that you can keep it in this room.

218
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
He's got the Canadian flag
put proudly there. Raider!

219
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
Raider!

220
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,640
Hey, did someone invite this guy?

221
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,080
Did someone invite
this guy over here?

222
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,480
To go from winning gold medals
for the US,

223
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
just because he's snubbed
at one try-out camp,

224
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,040
he's gonna turn around
and snub his entire country?
Because he is Benedict Arnold!

225
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,720
OK, Benedict Arnold was in a war

226
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,520
and when he betrayed his country,
many people died because of that.

227
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,320
OK? This isn't a war. It's war
to me, baby. Look out, Athens!

228
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,920
Robert, open this up and let me
know if you want it cooked longer.

229
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,000
OK, open it up now.
Get a fork and use that knife.

230
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
Just cut a piece at the corner.

231
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,800
What would you say?
I don't know, cut a little piece off.

232
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,240
It's your taste, not mine.

233
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,360
I've no idea what you like.

234
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
I know you like it warm, but...

235
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,280
I know, but I like it one way,
you like it another.

236
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,840
Cut this for me.

237
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
You cut it. Guess what, I'm busy.

238
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,000
Put it in here.

239
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,120
And one, and two, and three.

240
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,960
# We're Canada rugby
We're far from our home

241
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,320
# When people don't like us
They leave us alone

242
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,000
# We drink to get drunk
We're far from our home

243
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
# We're Canada rugby
So piss off and die #

244
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I'll just say one thing, OK?

245
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Curfew, ten o'clock.

246
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,720
In a year and a half, we have become

247
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,040
the strongest family I've ever had,
as far as a second family, OK?

248
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,680
You guys have really made me feel
right at home and I absolutely
consider you guys my boys.

249
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,120
You guys are my boys and you'll
be my boys for a long time.

250
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
# TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR

251
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,880
This is the poster my dad got when
he went to the Paralympics in 1996.

252
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
He's right here getting chased
by a guy with his ball.

253
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,920
This is a shirt that
my dad ended up giving to me.

254
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,480
He didn't actually want it any more
though, but I don't know why.

255
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,520
It has the quad rugby team
from 1996 on it.

256
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,880
There's Joe. Right there.

257
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,640
There's Dad. Dad. There's the dad.

258
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,360
My dad is one of the best
rugby players in the world,

259
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,040
but it's annoying to dust my dad's
trophy wall because you have
to get up on a ladder

260
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,760
and go all the way up to the top
and dust up there and dust in and
out and around every single trophy.

261
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,040
Robert's known for two things,
getting nothing but As and Bs

262
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,520
and that his dad's in a wheelchair
and plays wheelchair rugby.

263
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,400
My son's report card, he received an
award of merit for his outstanding
performance as school safety patrol.

264
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,000
You get trophies for good work,

265
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,880
I got this for the Amethyst team
high honour roll
for conduct, grades and behaviour.

266
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Hey, hey - you take first.

267
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,040
Joe never sat and bitched to me

268
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,000
that "My kid doesn't do this,
or doesn't do that",

269
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
but you could hear it
in some of the things he'd say.

270
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,080
"He doesn't play sports
and I wish he would"

271
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,320
and he'd try to get him to try
something and it wouldn't stick.

272
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,280
6th grade year was really hard
cos before I got moved
into advanced class,

273
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,160
kids thought I was just
a smarty-pants and a know-it-all
and all the other stuff.

274
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Kids get very jealous
and want to pick on me and Robert,
or just Robert.

275
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,720
One day I ripped a page out
of his book to teach him a lesson.

276
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,760
And I'll do it again
if he acts up again.

277
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,600
I always told him,
if some bully's pickin' on you,
if you have no other recourse

278
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,520
and they're coming after you,
go right for the nose.

279
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:14,280
I remember I was seven or eight and
there was this one kid, he would call
me cripple and gimp and everything

280
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,600
he made me really mad and I made sure
I waited for the right opportunity
and I was close enough to him

281
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,960
and I was sitting on the ground,
cos of course I couldn't walk,
and I tripped him and he went down.

282
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,040
And when he did I jumped on him and
just beat the living hell out of him

283
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,680
because my upper body
was a lot stronger than his.

284
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,400
Sink like a rock.

285
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,080
Mark is definitely
what I would classify as a jock.

286
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,720
That's freezing!

287
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,800
And I would never have given any
thought to hang out with jocks,
to be honest.

288
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,880
When I met her, she was doing
an internship at the morgue.

289
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,960
How many girls do you meet
that work at the morgue?

290
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,960
And that are cool
and enjoy it and are cute?

291
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,360
I actually really miss
working at the morgue,
I miss the work, I miss the people.

292
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
# Here is the church
And here is the steeple

293
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,640
# We sure are cute
For two ugly people...

294
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,560
First time I saw Mark Zupan
was at a friend of ours' funeral.

295
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,720
He rolled in, introduced himself
and I don't think we've had
a moment apart, from that night.

296
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,200
I really think it's curiosity
that attracts a lot of girls
to quadriplegics

297
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,040
and I think also, to some extent,
it's the mothering instinct.

298
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,720
# ..doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see
In anyone else

299
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,400
# But you are always trying
To keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel... #

300
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,880
I had a girlfriend
prior to the injury

301
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,200
and as I get discharged from here
and I get back to my private life,

302
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,880
how would that affect,
will I be able to be sexually active?

303
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,600
The short answer is yes.

304
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,960
We have a video to show
how to do it,

305
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
as time goes on we're gonna
go through a whole programme
of what techniques you may need.

306
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,560
Often, adjustment after spinal cord
injury involves a re-evaluation,

307
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,320
or reordering of priorities
in one's life.

308
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,720
One must work through the issue of,
why did this happen to me,

309
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,960
and make a conscious decision
to move forward in life.

310
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,120
Women are not threatened
by the guy that's in a chair.

311
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,360
They come up, strike up
a great casual conversation

312
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,560
and you're like "Is she seein'
the chair or is she seein' me?"

313
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,280
Everyone says,
"What's your approach,
how do you work these women?"

314
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,800
Fuck it, man, The more pitiful I am,
the more the women like me.

315
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,520
The girls who like you,
there is one question

316
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,440
that pops in their head pretty quick.

317
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,360
But they don't wanna say it, so they
say, "Oh, how did you get hurt?"

318
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,920
Yeah, I can move 'em. It takes 10
or 20 minutes of working that chick

319
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,040
and then she finally drops the bomb -
can you do it?

320
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,960
No, it's all still very, very good.

321
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,560
I think everyone here,
ding, ding, ding. Why, is there some
can get it up but not...?

322
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:54,680
It's not a given with every quad.
When I first got injured,
I was in intensive care

323
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,840
everyone was curious to how
much function I was gonna have
when I came out of my coma.

324
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,080
I was about ready to wake up and the
nurses decided to give me a bed bath

325
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,640
and one nurse got so excited
that I got a woody,

326
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,680
she ran outside and got my mom
and showed her my erection.

327
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
Really?

328
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,400
Physical changes occur immediately
after spinal cord injury.

329
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,760
Before you engage in any
sexual activity with a partner,

330
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,720
it would be helpful to know
how your new body works.

331
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,280
This can most effectively
be accomplished by masturbating.

332
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,480
In rehab, the first thing I learned
how to do was jerk off!

333
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,320
That was the very first thing -
I'd rather be able to grab my meat
than grab a toothbrush.

334
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,120
You break your neck and
these things may be impaired,

335
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,120
but, you know, that still works

336
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,760
and when you're in a chair,
you usually like to eat pussy.

337
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,920
It's humorous at times
to watch the process of trying that.

338
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,680
You might fall over or have to do
some modifications to it.

339
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,080
So does the girl have to be on top?

340
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,200
A lot of girls like being on top.

341
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
I've got a kind of modified doggy
style that I've perfected.

342
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,520
Since I have less hand grip,
I use a towel.

343
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,640
I wrap a towel or belt around her
waist, then I hold it right there,

344
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,080
and then do my thing, you know.

345
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,000
'My first full-on sex,
after being in a wheelchair,'

346
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,640
was a very great moment in my life,
just knowing that I could still,
not just the physical act,

347
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,360
but you could still go out one
night, meet a girl and get lucky.

348
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,320
Things you don't think
are possible any more.

349
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,000
I try to be constructive, OK?

350
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,400
You've got to be able to accept it.
You can't be sensitive.

351
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,360
If you do your job,
will I yell at you?

352
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,160
How do you think you guys
got to this level?

353
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,200
That's because when you mess up,
you lead someone in.

354
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,680
Let me ask you something.
When you were growing up,

355
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,520
and your dad told you not to
do something, and you did it,

356
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,400
what did he have to do? He had
to ground you. Whichever way.

357
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,160
Well, guess what. I'm the same way.
I've got to do that, OK?

358
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,080
'My theory on discipline, if you
start early and let them know'

359
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,840
you will back up what you say,
then usually, by age five,
discipline is already established.

360
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,160
Please don't do that.
Don't do that again.

361
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Did you hear me? Stop acting up.

362
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm not acting up.

363
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
Robert, go with Mom.

364
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,760
No, I want... Go with Mom now.

365
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
I want to stay here.

366
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
INAUDIBLE

367
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,720
If I have to say it again!

368
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,720
'If you give 'em tough love, they
learn the difference from wrong and
right. My dad was a police officer.'

369
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,920
If you bad-mouthed him or did
anything at all, there were
consequences. He was very hard-nosed

370
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,760
and he had really huge hands
and hit really hard.

371
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,360
I let him know
that it isn't even close,

372
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,800
what I do to him,
what my father did to me.

373
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,760
Thank you.

374
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,120
Robbie won't... Robbie's not gonna
want that, is he? No, he won't.

375
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,800
'Rugby at one point
took over a lot.'

376
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,280
Rugby, rugby, rugby...

377
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,360
They used to be like...

378
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,320
addicted, it's like an addiction.

379
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,920
It's like some drug for him.

380
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,080
When he comes closer to the time
when the game is going to go on,

381
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,000
he gets more edgy, more irritable.

382
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,920
I was up this morning at 6.30, I went
to bed at... I guess we're doing it
tomorrow. We're doing it tomorrow.

383
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,000
I thought we could do three threes
and a deuce out there...

384
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,560
'The doctor wants him to take it
easy and not get over-stressed.

385
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,000
'And Joe is continuing to coach'

386
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,880
and he wants to continue to play.

387
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,640
No! No! No, he doesn't have the ball!

388
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,240
Get outta there! Oh!

389
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,520
On the count of three!

390
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,400
One, two, three...

391
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,360
Do you want 50 or 25? 50. 50?

392
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,000
I was playing college soccer,
we went out after a game we won,
I had a few too much to drink,

393
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,800
so I went and passed out
in my buddy's pickup truck.

394
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,000
He crashed and I went flying.

395
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,560
He was drunk and that was that.

396
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,480
Knowing Zupan and Igoe as well as
I do, this day, ten years later,

397
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
sometimes I feel worse for Igoe
than I do for Zupan.

398
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,640
Why isn't Igoe at our 10-year
reunion? There was apprehension on
both their parts. This is difficult.

399
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,880
I believe he feels, if he came here,
some part of Igoe's mind would say,

400
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,440
"Everyone in this reunion will be
saying, 'There's Mark and the guy
that put him in the wheelchair.'"

401
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,960
They were two best friends,
and after the accident,

402
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,440
Chris Igoe thought
I was gonna beat the shit out of him.

403
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,880
And I hugged him.

404
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,840
What else could I do?

405
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,280
I said, "This was an accident, I know
you didn't do this intentionally,

406
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,040
"so don't worry about it.

407
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,880
"But you are responsible.

408
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,120
"And don't forget that either."

409
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I didn't have a lot of anger,
I had a lot of concern.

410
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,320
I had concern that my son was gonna
die and that Chris wasn't going
to survive the mental challenge.

411
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,160
It's gotta be horrendous
to live with that every day.

412
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Your best friend.
It has to be horrendous.

413
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,160
The night of the accident started
pretty innocently enough.

414
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,000
We were doing shots with the girls
and just slamming beers senseless.

415
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,160
Next thing I know,
I'm getting woken up by the bouncer.

416
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,240
Um...you know,
I'd driven drunk prior to that.

417
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,520
You know, everybody pretty much had.
It wasn't a big deal at that point.

418
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm just thinking,
"I'm gonna get home."

419
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,600
He had to have got launched
all the way over this

420
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,760
and landed in the canal.

421
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,680
And I had absolutely no idea
that he was in the truck.

422
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,760
I...

423
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,840
And I had a long, hard time,
you know, accepting that fact

424
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,920
because it was...it's just so...

425
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,880
..foreign.

426
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,440
For me to come back and see this,

427
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,240
it's...

428
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I don't know.

429
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,760
You know, I'm not getting a real
emotional reaction, it's just...

430
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,120
a place that something bad happened.

431
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,360
There was an accident, you know,
it was simply an accident.

432
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,840
People talk about
hitting rock bottom.

433
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,440
I mean, I...

434
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,040
Not to sound overly dramatic or
anything, but I was definitely...

435
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,800
acting suicidal,
whether I knew that or not.

436
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,760
They're possibly the two worst
personalities for this accident
to happen to together.

437
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,520
You've got Zupan,
who's not an emotional person,

438
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,280
that's gonna say,
"Let's get all this out.

439
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,160
"You feel guilty, I understand
your guilt, I can help you."

440
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,240
You've got Igoe who very much is,
"I don't need anyone's help"

441
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,520
They seem to have the perfect storm
of personality quirks

442
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,880
that may prevent the two of them
from ever saying exactly
what the other needs to hear

443
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,640
to make both of them whole
to move forward with it.

444
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,680
I was pretty hard on him.

445
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
I'd have him come get me.

446
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,040
He had a pager
and I just blew up his pager.

447
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,840
I would just continually call.

448
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,280
I would project my anger
on people that I care about.

449
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,280
I mean, when you come out of rehab,
you have traces of your old self,

450
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,840
just everywhere - where you used to
sit after you'd come home from...

451
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,360
I don't know, a soccer game,
a party, whatever.

452
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,440
Just seeing soccer shoes or...

453
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,120
stuff you'd use in able-bodied life
in your closet, you have pictures...

454
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,760
of you playing sports,
of your friends.

455
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,800
You figure out that home isn't
necessarily comforting, but it's...

456
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,640
it gets to you inside.

457
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Just keep it up, that's all we ask.

458
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,320
You must be going somewhere.
Yeah, home.

459
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,080
Good luck. Thank you.

460
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,480
Hey, you're leaving us.

461
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,040
D'you guys want to write down
your contacts?

462
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,560
We'll definitely be having parties
and stuff

463
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,360
and all you guys are to come down.

464
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,240
I'll be there, man.

465
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,040
Oh.

466
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,120
Is this a therapy joke?

467
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,280
I didn't pick the card. Melissa did.
You can blame it on her.

468
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,440
Let me help you. I got it.

469
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,840
That's a new chair.
Yeah, looks brand new.

470
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,440
That new one, I gave to him
that first week he was in.

471
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,040
It's a bit more compact.
The one we were looking at
had a case and everything...

472
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,560
It's cold and everything.
This place really sucks.

473
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,960
What? I said it's like...everything
in here is nice and all...

474
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,040
This is where you're going...
I'm in a wheelchair.

475
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,440
This sucks.

476
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,080
It's like when you came from Robert
Wood, it was a new transition,
new schedule, give it a few weeks.

477
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,520
Ssh!

478
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,280
Let me just have a moment.
Yeah, but...

479
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,040
Preach to me all you want.
It won't make any difference.

480
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,440
Yeah, I'm thankful that I'm here.

481
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,200
You know, I could have been
so much worse off.

482
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,200
But the fact is, what was once normal
will never be the same.

483
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,760
And that's just settling in
right now.

484
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,200
Are you sure you wanna see this?

485
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,680
Imagine if you didn't have this on.

486
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,000
Selection's a hard part.

487
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,640
We've got a great responsibility
going towards Athens.

488
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,600
We're going there to win gold and
I've selected a team that gives us
the best opportunity to do that.

489
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,320
From Tempe, Arizona,

490
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,720
Andy Cohn.
APPLAUSE

491
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,280
From San Diego, California,
Sam Gloor, Cliff Chunn, Lynn Nelson,

492
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,440
Brent Poppen, Bob Lujano.

493
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,200
APPLAUSE

494
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,640
From Phoenix, Arizona, Scott Hogsett.

495
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,440
From Austin, Texas, Mark Zupan.

496
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,520
APPLAUSE

497
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,640
This is the 2004
USA Paralympic rugby team.

498
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,680
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

499
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,920
One, two, three...

500
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,720
USA RUGBY!

501
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,400
Hey, Mark. Hi. We're trying
to learn all their names.

502
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,480
Hi, how are you?

503
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,600
Shake his hand.

504
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,840
What's your name? Melissa.

505
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,000
Melissa? Nice to meet you.

506
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,360
Do you like rugby, Melissa?
Do you like it?

507
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,200
Being a little bashful.

508
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,040
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

509
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,760
How do you eat pizza
with your elbows?

510
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,320
Well, I just pick it up like this.

511
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,600
I use this chair to help me,
it's my everyday chair.

512
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,400
I get up like this.

513
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,600
I'm gonna need a seatbelt, slide in.

514
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,520
How...how did you...?
How did you lose your arms?

515
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,560
I got sick when I was nine years old
and contracted a blood disease.

516
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,840
But I'm all right.
That's all that matters.

517
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,520
I'm alive and use everything I have
to get through life.

518
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,240
That's what we all have to do -
use everything we have.

519
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,600
I contracted meningococcocemia
when I was nine years old.

520
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,120
It's an early stage of meningitis, a
very rare form. It happens overnight,

521
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,040
like picking up a cold.
They couldn't do anything for me.

522
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,720
They pretty much said
I wasn't gonna make it.

523
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,200
They brought a priest in and gave
last rites, so it looked pretty grim.

524
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Then I just woke up and had no legs.

525
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,800
I remember being wheeled
into the emergency room.

526
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,760
I looked down and saw my legs and
feet and headed to the operating room
and knew this wasn't good.

527
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,640
My father was very much instrumental
in helping me deal with everything.

528
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,800
I remember times, whenever kids would
laugh or point, he'd kinda laugh
along with them and joke about it.

529
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,320
Once I saw him
lightening the situation,

530
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,400
you know, it didn't make me
feel upset or hurt.

531
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,640
'I'm a 33-year-old single male
in Birmingham.

532
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,720
I think I'm living, but every single
male's supposed to be living.

533
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,280
I live independently, take care of
myself, cook for myself, have a job.

534
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,760
These are my artificial limbs
and I use it primarily
just to button up and zip up.

535
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,880
I also have to use them to drive.

536
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,840
When I first started out, I drove
without them and had an accident.

537
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,800
The first thing they said was,
"Did you have a seatbelt on?" "No."
"Did you have your arms on?" "No."

538
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:51,360
It's very much humiliating,
but yet life still goes on.

539
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,000
There's a dream that I have
where I was flying

540
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,640
and I've had it a couple of times,
very much the same dream,

541
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,400
where I'm at my grandmother's house,
the house where I lost my limbs.

542
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,880
I was having a dream where I was
just flying up into the back yard,

543
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,920
flying over the roof of the house,
flying among the trees.

544
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,440
I do see myself as having limbs
as I was flying.

545
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,120
It was a very liberating feeling,

546
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,320
not wanting it to end and wanting
to keep it going, you know.

547
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,560
If he didn't have that exercise,
he would be probably gone.

548
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,280
My doctor says, "You've the heart
of a bull." I believe him.

549
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,080
Anybody join me in a toast? Sure.

550
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,480
This is the first time we've seen
Uncle Joe since his heart attack

551
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,720
and thank God his heart's pumping
strong and he looks great
and he's in great health.

552
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,360
To his future and good health
and God bless him.

553
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,880
ALL: To Uncle Joe.

554
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,920
'I'll be honest here,
I'm living the American Dream.'

555
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,160
My family moved here to the US at age
11, and if I had stayed in Portugal,

556
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:43,360
I probably would not have anywhere
near the opportunities in life
as I've had living here in the US.

557
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,280
If you've got a disability
in Portugal,

558
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,440
they become ashamed of having
someone, it's a sign of weakness.

559
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,720
'So it's not that
I'm not a proud American,'

560
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,200
I still believe in my country, I live
here, but I have a job to do and it's
been a great ride with Team Canada.

561
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,840
Uncle Joe!

562
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,520
Uncle Joe!

563
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,680
Do a 360. OK, a 360 coming up.

564
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,320
Whooh!

565
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,160
That's funny!

566
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,600
After his heart attack,

567
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,400
it's like he grew, he matures.

568
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,320
For some reason, he woke up,

569
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,600
God touched Joe somehow.

570
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,040
He did. I do believe that.
I believe it too.

571
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,240
And everything changes
because the way Joe talks

572
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,600
is like the new Joe.

573
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,960
He's smart. Straight A's
three years in a row.

574
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,080
He plays the viola,
he's pretty good at it.

575
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,840
I always knew
Joe would grow up to be somebody.

576
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,080
He had that fortitude about him.
He had a great personality.

577
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,600
He had a lot of drive, unbelievable
for a man confined to a wheelchair.

578
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,560
I underlined my home phone number.
Cell number's on the back.
You look good.

579
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:09,640
Actually, I'm the only person
in the world to have all three world
championships in wheelchair rugby.

580
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,520
I don't think God is into
competition, but I think God rewards
those who help people out.

581
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,400
The man up there's giving me
the strength to be a better coach
now than ever

582
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,280
because I'm hoping
he blesses my team.

583
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,480
Don't let the Americans
get in your way, just beat 'em,
beat their asses off!

584
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,480
They deserve a good beating.

585
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,000
It'll take it, baby.

586
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,080
This tournament is important for us
because it gives us an opportunity
to reclaim what we feel is ours,

587
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,840
which is being the number-one seed
going into the Paralympics.

588
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,960
Are we ready to play here, boys?

589
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,480
ALL: Yeah! Are we ready?

590
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,760
USA! Go get 'em!

591
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,840
Watch Zupan. Watch Zupan.

592
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,080
Attack, attack, attack!

593
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,920
Ohhh!

594
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,040
Canada! Canada! Canada!

595
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,120
Canada!

596
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,920
Ref, stop!

597
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,840
Off, off, off, off!
Swarm him! Swarm him!

598
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,960
Swarm him! Swarm him!
WHISTLE BLOWS

599
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,000
We'll crush! We'll crush, OK?

600
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,920
Let's go and get this.
One, two, three... USA!

601
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
Swarm him! Swarm him! Swarm him!

602
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,400
USA!

603
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,680
We got fucking 2Â½ months to go.

604
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,240
Right now,
this is what we needed to do.

605
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
the gold-medal-winning team -

606
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,240
the United States!

607
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,320
Is there any way you could take an
earlier flight to get to my concert?

608
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,760
'I'll go as quick as I can.
I miss you,

609
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,080
'and...I love you.'

610
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,400
We have six students
who did all the writing play-offs
and all the written play-offs.

611
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,600
When I call your name,
please come down.

612
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,320
Samuel Fraser...

613
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,000
Caitlin Grant... Jenny Park...
Laura Payne, and Robert Soares.

614
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,240
Good job. Good job.

615
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,120
How you doing, bud?

616
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,680
I'm proud of you.
You did a good job.

617
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,120
I'm gonna play this for you guys,
then I'll tell you a little about me

618
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,680
and a little about the sport.
That's cool.

619
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,280
'Meet the US wheelchair rugby team.

620
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,720
'Wheelchair rugby, also known
as quad rugby, is for athletes
who are quadriplegics.

621
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,080
'If people see you in a wheelchair,
they treat you
like you're made of glass.

622
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,040
'Playing wheelchair rugby...'

623
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,520
Are you on one of them teams?
I play for the United States
Paralympic rugby team.

624
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,720
Do you wear helmets? No, ma'am.

625
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,160
Why not? You don't wanna do it
wearing elbow pads, shin pads... That
might be just the macho-man thing...

626
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:09,560
Is there a technique to falling?
Just don't lead with your head!
That's pretty much it!

627
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,480
I've actually done more in a chair
than I did able-bodied.

628
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,320
Don't let this thing limit you
from doing anything you want.

629
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,600
Let's just say that, down the road,
we play...

630
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:27,640
I have the mentality that I don't
want to be in this wheelchair
for the rest of my life.

631
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,880
Yeah. But, say we do start walking,

632
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,200
do we get kicked off the team
right away?

633
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:40,720
If you get out the chair and walk
away, that might be one of the things
you have to give up

634
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,760
to go and walk away!

635
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,280
What is that made from?
Aluminium.

636
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,720
You got it put on?
Yeah.

637
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,960
It's custom-made to each person.

638
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,800
This chair's different
to my everyday chair.

639
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,280
You sure you wanna do this?!

640
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,640
How does it feel?

641
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,880
How does it feel? I feel
as if I'm on a battering ram!

642
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,880
How do you feel in it? Unreal.
It's a whole different aspect
of being in a wheelchair.

643
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,520
Feel how rugged it is!

644
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,880
Can run into anything.

645
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,440
You can't do it! You're in
a hospital - you can't do it!

646
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,000
Can I do it outside?

647
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,280
You're on hospital grounds.
God forbid, something goes wrong,
you hurt yourself...

648
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,200
You're still a little fragile.

649
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,040
Can I even tag him? No!

650
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,320
He'll be fine.
He's not gonna fall out.

651
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,880
I don't wanna ruin your chair.
You won't ruin it.

652
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,840
Do people, like,
just throw their body at it?

653
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,120
You're strapped in differently
when you're in it.

654
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,640
OK...

655
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,200
The Paralympic Games follow just
a few weeks after the Olympic Games.

656
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,760
This year, they're September 17th
to the 28th, in Athens,

657
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,880
using all the same venues,
stadiums, everything.

658
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,280
..competing, and right now,
we are too.

659
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,000
It's an amazing sport to watch,
and until you see it live,
it's hard to appreciate.

660
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,480
This is gonna be
the hardest training of my life.

661
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,760
This is just crazy.

662
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,840
I didn't expect anything like this.

663
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,840
Tell me about wheelchair rugby.
It used to be called Murderball.

664
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,840
But you can't market Murderball
to corporate sponsors!

665
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:21,440
We've been hearing about a rivalry
between US and Canadian
quad rugby teams.

666
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,600
You guys are
really going after each other.

667
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:29,400
We have a reputation
of always staying on top
and always winning gold,

668
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,440
so we don't wanna be the first team
to let our country down
and not win.

669
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,000
Great! Thanks very much! Thank you.

670
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,880
I came a day early,
and spoke at a rehab hospital,

671
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,720
and there's this young guy that just
got hurt... He was told about rugby,

672
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,440
I brought a rugby chair.
We couldn't get him out of it
when it was time to leave.

673
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,480
He was like,
"I wanna go and hit stuff!"

674
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,800
So just to see that - his
eyes light up, and being so happy -

675
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,240
it was so fulfilling.

676
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,960
NBC-13 has more, with the American
Paralympic rugby team.

677
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,400
The Paralympic team preps
for its biggest day in four years.

678
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,920
The Paralympic Games, in Athens,
Greece are a month away.

679
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,880
Pass! Tighten up on that!

680
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,680
Watching the Olympic
opening ceremony the other day -

681
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,560
that got my blood going, realising
that we're less than 30 days away.

682
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,880
Bobby, have you seen Ocean's Eleven?
Yeah.

683
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,880
Remember the little Asian guy
that gets in that box?

684
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,320
And they break in the bank,
or the casino?

685
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,440
We're gonna try that with you.
You know how funny that would be?!

686
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,320
Oh, my God, I'm pissing myself.

687
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,880
Are they coming now?
No, call the girls.

688
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,160
Put it upside-down
and put it on top of you.

689
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,000
Will it work?

690
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,560
Are you comfortable?

691
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,440
Hmm...not.

692
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,840
Where you going? To pee. Fuck
peeing! Bobby's gonna suffocate!

693
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,720
Scott needs a hand. Quick! My box
fell over, with my bag in it.

694
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,240
He just needs a hand.
I can't pick up the bag.

695
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,720
Just pick it up quick.

696
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,320
Shouldn't I put it like this...?

697
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,360
No, I'd pick it up...

698
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,920
then the bag will be...
Pick it straight up. All right.

699
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,280
That was real fucking funny(!)

700
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,840
I was at a wedding, and my chick's
mom's sister came up,
and she goes...

701
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,320
IN HIGH VOICE:
"Hi, Scotty, I'm so-and-so.

702
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,680
"I hear you're going
to the Special Olympics."

703
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,400
And I went from being the "man"
at the wedding to a fucking retard.

704
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,000
It was the worst feeling.

705
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,440
Special Olympics happens once a year

706
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,600
and it's for people
who are mentally challenged.

707
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,960
What they do in the Special Olympics
is very honourable.

708
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,520
It's amazing what they can do,
but this is totally different.

709
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,520
We're not going
for a pat-me-on-the-back,
"Thank you for participating".

710
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,000
We're not going for a hug.
We're going for a gold medal.

711
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,920
When we're prepping, we've got to put
emphasis on stopping Kirkland,

712
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,880
stopping Zupan.
Jump on him, turn him.

713
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,880
The adventure begins. We can't just
be satisfied with stopping him.

714
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,480
We've gotta forget the past.
We have to forget what happened
in Sweden

715
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,720
and in Vancouver. It's time to go
to Athens and take care of business.

716
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,640
Canada! Number one!

717
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,600
CANADA!

718
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,680
You're the best son ever. You're the
best son anybody could ever have.

719
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,760
You make me so proud.

720
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,160
INAUDIBLE

721
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,720
I never thought we'd be here.

722
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,560
# Light and day
Is more than you'll say

723
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:24,720
# Cos all my feelings

724
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,800
# Are more than I can let by

725
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,120
# Or not, more than you've got

726
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:37,680
# Just follow the day

727
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,800
# Follow the day
and reach for the sun...

728
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,280
# Reach for the sun. #

729
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,400
I got injured 11 years ago,
at a lake cabin. I got pushed
off the balcony and broke my neck.

730
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,920
My friend was driving
on the freeway when we hit a tree.

731
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,160
I got thrown out the back
of a pick-up truck.

732
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,280
I spent 14 hours in a canal,
hanging on to a branch.

733
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,480
I contracted a neurological disorder
when I was one.

734
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,040
But it's allowed me to play
quad rugby!

735
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,120
We're gonna divvy you guys up.

736
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,680
We'll show you some rugby,
then those who want to try

737
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:31,120
can have a live-speed version
of rugby. Anyone that's Air Force,
Marines or Navy,

738
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,760
you'll be with the blue team.
The Army are with the red team.

739
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,680
My job is...hopefully snag
the wheel on the way by.

740
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,120
If I can slow him down for one
or two seconds, I've done my job.

741
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,520
It's full-wheelchair contact. It's a
lot of fun. If you like football,

742
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,120
you'll love wheelchair rugby.

743
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:52,560
I guess we're gonna play some...
so you guys can actually see
the game.

744
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,840
I can't throw that far.
It doesn't matter.

745
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,040
None of us could in the beginning.
You're gonna do an awesome job.

746
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,000
WHISTLE BLOWS

747
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,960
USA!

748
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,840
Ready, set, go!

749
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,560
Congratulations. May God continue
to bless our country.

750
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,600
Zupan!

751
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,280
Come on, Joe, bring it in!

752
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,800
It's coming!

753
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,160
No, wait!
