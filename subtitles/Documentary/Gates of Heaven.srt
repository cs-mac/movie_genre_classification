1
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:41,151
<i>Inspiration
of the pet cemetery business is...</i>

2
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,772
<i>a little story that probably
leads me back many years.</i>

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,949
I was born in the state
of North Dakota...

4
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,948
county of Barnes,
city of Valley City.

5
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,290
I was there for several years...

6
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,798
being born in 1930,
and then the World War II started...

7
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,961
in 1941,
when I went to the farm.

8
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,635
On the farm,
I had my own pet collie...

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,016
which worked with me
and was beside me.

10
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,761
No matter what I did
and where I'd go...

11
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,309
my pet collie was with me.

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,149
One, 
One afternoon...

13
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,270
we came back
from hauling bundles -

14
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,648
“thrashing,”
the old words going -

15
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,652
and an old Model A
came up the road...

16
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,616
and struck my collie
and killed him.

17
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,240
I never did catch him...

18
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,959
but I grabbed my collie...

19
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,546
and I held him in my arms
until he died.

20
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,416
And I pulled
one little acre of land...

21
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,668
right behind the house...

22
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,171
I'd say a quarter mile away.

23
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,343
Overlooked the,

24
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,510
the prairie to the north...

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,725
which was really a beautiful -
had the lake site in the back -

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,689
and I picked that
as the cemetery for my own collie.

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,649
<i>Right across the street
from where I lived In Los Altos...</i>

28
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,023
<i>was the most beautiful
piece of land...</i>

29
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,113
<i>as far as I was concerned,
in the whole valley.</i>

30
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,703
<i>And boy,
I knew what to do with it:</i>

31
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,535
<i>make that into a pet cemetery.</i>

32
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,455
<i>I thought, “This is gonna be
my project of fife.</i>

33
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,873
<i>f found the land.
I found the need.</i> ”

34
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,123
<i>Something the old-timers
used to tell me years age:</i>

35
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,252
<i>“To be a success
in this world or this life...</i>

36
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,424
<i>find a need and fill it. ”</i>

37
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,891
<i>And hay, I found a need, and I wanted
to fulfill this more than anything in the</i> -

38
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,724
<i>anything I ever did in my whole life,
I wanted to fulfill this dream.</i>

39
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,239
And there is where
we started our work.

40
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,900
Planning, development...

41
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,574
and getting the people interested,
working with -

42
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,990
I worked with
Carnation Pet Food Company...

43
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,242
I worked with Safeway stores...

44
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,119
I worked with Lucky stores.

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,087
Several. Several.

46
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,547
I remember talking to Dick Yee
with Dick's Supermarkets...

47
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,342
and asking him if I could come
and work in his pet food section...

48
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,592
and just hand out my cards
and talk to the people...

49
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,593
about having a pet cemetery.

50
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,097
I went to grooming shops.
I went to the veterinarians.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,734
And the interest I got
was just phenomenal.

52
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,604
It was just great.

53
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,075
So then I had to get
some more interested people...

54
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,241
in the idea of it,
'cause we needed the financing.

55
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,739
Floyd...

56
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,958
is a very heartwarming individual...

57
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,370
and a man that likes
to do a lot for everybody.

58
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,998
He'd happened to come
into the office one day...

59
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,500
and him and I got to talking.

60
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,220
His real name, I think, is Floyd,
but we always called him Mac.

61
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,807
And Mac, very surprisingly,
said to me that...

62
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,473
something he'd always
wanted to do was...

63
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,808
put a pet cemetery together.

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,644
So I told him,
“Gee, Mac, that's amazing...

65
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,690
because we've just been thinking
about the same thing ourselves...

66
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,155
and maybe we can
put it together...

67
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,113
you know, under one group."
So he said, “Wonderful?

68
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,113
<i>So I was made aware
of this property...</i>

69
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,662
<i>that is in Los Altos
on Foothill and Highway 280...</i>

70
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:28,000
<i>and we felt that that would make
a great place for a pet cemetery...</i>

71
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,132
<i>because it had
tremendous visual ability...</i>

72
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,595
<i>and the thousands of cars
that went past 280.</i>

73
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,931
<i>And the property leaned
in other directions as well.</i>

74
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,224
<i>h' was a marvelous location
for a restaurant or a motel."...</i>

75
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,393
<i>or various and sundry things.</i>

76
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,438
<i>We found that people
by the name of Danton...</i>

77
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,607
<i>owned the property...</i>

78
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,731
<i>and we approached them
and asked them what they thought of it.</i>

79
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,281
There was a meeting held
at Mr. McClure's house...

80
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,029
which I attended.

81
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,243
I was a little late...

82
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,787
but during the meeting...

83
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,286
Mr. Dunton had expressed...

84
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,210
his wishes, desires, and needs
to Mr. McClure...

85
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,797
and emphasizing
very, very strongly...

86
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,921
“Mac, you have nothing
to worry about.

87
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,551
I'm a minister
of this particular church.

88
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,396
You can trust me.
You can trust me. You can trust me.

89
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,683
I'm a minister.
We will have a pet cemetery.

90
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,311
It'll be a success,
and you and I will put it together.

91
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,406
We'll do it, we'll have it,
just you and I."

92
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,402
It was sort of a “kismet" idea.

93
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,030
So we went to work
on the pet cemetery...

94
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,998
and...

95
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,288
the ugly crisis...

96
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,414
which we used as our basis -

97
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,916
and this was no,

98
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,386
nothing against the SPCA
of Santa Clara County.

99
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,096
It was nothing against
the animal control officer...

100
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,428
of Santa Clara County.

101
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:09,062
But the idea
that we needed the concept...

102
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,728
and,

103
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,271
for the people
that loved their pets...

104
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,607
and needed a place for 'em.

105
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,240
Not the garbage pit,
not the garbage can...

106
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,735
and a place to bulldoze 'em
into the ground...

107
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,080
'cause we have more love and desire
for Mother Nature's little pets.

108
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,451
God only gave us these pets...

109
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,961
to be our fellowship...

110
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,831
our desire and our will...

111
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,755
and what have we got
to give them in return?

112
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,345
Not to be put into a garbage pail
or a dump ground...

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,807
but our last good-bye...

114
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,052
for the things they gave us.

115
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,433
<i>Rendering is one
of the oldest industries.</i>

116
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,980
<i>It dates back
to the time of the Egyptians.</i>

117
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,487
<i>They can trace it
back this far, rendering.</i>

118
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,574
<i>In the Bible,
way back in the Old Testament...</i>

119
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,991
<i>the guy cut off the sheepskin
and put it over him.</i>

120
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,910
<i>Put the lamb fat on him
to keep him warm.</i>

121
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,829
<i>It could be
the oldest industry in the world.</i>

122
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,453
<i>It could be. ifs possible.</i>

123
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,456
When the public
got concerned about recycling...

124
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,833
that's when
the rendering industry...

125
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,962
started to blossom out,
so to speak, and say...

126
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,807
“Hey, we've been recycling
for 500 years here.

127
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,802
Take a look at us.
We are recycling.

128
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,600
We're doing
what everybody wants us to do."

129
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,849
That's when we started
to come forward.

130
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,859
Before that, nobody talked
about the rendering industry.

131
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,526
That's why it was the invisible industry.
Nobody ever mentioned it.

132
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,525
On the quiet side.
“What those guys do out there -

133
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,697
They boil all this stuff in pots.

134
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,412
It stinks."

135
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,123
What is a rendering company?

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,334
A rendering company.

137
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,921
And my mind
pretty near exploded...

138
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,759
with the thought
and the remembrance...

139
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,965
of a very bad nightmare.

140
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,760
A dream of hell.

141
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,727
And it took me back to this
rendering company in North Dakota...

142
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:15,939
where all the little pets at that time,
when they died...

143
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,310
a truck would come out,
and a big old driver would come...

144
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,779
and grab your pet and throw him
in the back of this truck...

145
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,615
and take him to what I called
“the boiler chambers.”

146
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,362
it's controversial.
In other words, I -

147
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,705
You know, we stay low-key.

148
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,574
We don't want people to know
we're bringing in animals...

149
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,452
and reprocessing
animal by-products.

150
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,081
Some people get nauseated
by the thought.

151
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,755
They get nauseated by it.
You know that?

152
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,259
It actually nausea-
I've had people ask me -

153
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,928
I've been at a dinner party...

154
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,051
and been sitting down
at a dinner table...

155
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,178
and somebody will say,
“What do you do?”

156
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,726
And I say,
“I'm in the tallow business."

157
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,442
And somebody will say,
“Jeez, don't bring that up right now.

158
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,854
Wait till after dinner,
when we all break up."

159
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,608
In other words, “We don't want
to talk about what you do, Mike.

160
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,952
It makes us sick.”
Why? I don't know, but it does.

161
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,572
People say that all the time.

162
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,575
We called it back home
a “glue factory."

163
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,667
They don't waste nothing.

164
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,787
They take the meat and strip it...

165
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,377
and they take the bones
and boil them...

166
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,798
and cook them and make
some kind of a meal out of 'em.

167
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,795
They don't waste nothing.

168
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,924
Not even the toenails
on the animal or anything.

169
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,302
And the smell that came from it.

170
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,891
I walked in there
one day as a child...

171
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,640
and I seen all these animals
laying there.

172
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,311
Being a 4-H man
and an animal lover and -

173
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,986
I just thought,
“Boy, being in hell. Here I am.

174
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,281
I'm sitting in the floors
of hell right now.”

175
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,747
I furnished the car -
or the station wagon -

176
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,038
and Mac furnished
some furniture and his time...

177
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,332
and his promotion skills.

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,371
And Joe...

179
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,545
also furniture and some labor.

180
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,920
We both dug the first few graves.

181
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,093
And I made some
of the caskets...

182
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,058
and Joe would also go around
and pick them up.

183
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,851
He'd go around and pick up
the pets to be prepared.

184
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,852
Burying the pets
was a very, very difficult task.

185
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,272
Mr. McClure...

186
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,740
was physically handicapped.

187
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,110
He couldn't. no way...

188
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,534
do any physical labor whatsoever.

189
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,624
And my having
full-time employment...

190
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,789
it was mostly done
in the evening.

191
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,005
A gentleman came to my door...

192
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,965
and the gentleman
was a huge man.

193
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,256
I'd say about 6'2”...

194
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,130
a large -

195
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,225
He's the type -
more like you'd say...

196
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,806
he's more the Hercules type.

197
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,556
And he asked me,
“Are you Floyd McClure?"

198
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,315
And I said, “Yes, sir."

199
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,982
He says, “Do you have
the pet cemetery across the street?"

200
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,982
My house is right across the street
from the cemetery.

201
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,736
I said, “Yes, sir.”
And he started crying.

202
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,577
I thought -
I asked him, “What's wrong?"

203
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,743
He says,
“Last night my dog died."

204
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,253
And he says...

205
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,210
“I wanted to bury him
this morning."

206
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,302
His family was home,
and they were gonna go to church.

207
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,844
But he had him
completely wrapped in -

208
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,388
like a mummy, pretty near.

209
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,477
I would then...

210
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,643
get the pet out of his car...

211
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,641
lay him out in the driveway...

212
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,110
and proceed to clean him up...

213
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,947
brush him out,
make him as presentable...

214
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,192
as possible
under the circumstances.

215
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,616
We had all kinds of animals.
Every type of animal.

216
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,621
We had snakes, we had rats...

217
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,249
we had monkeys,
we had chickens...

218
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,789
we had hamsters, we had mice.

219
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,956
Seen a few.
Rodents of all types.

220
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,216
And we had -

221
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,336
Of course, dogs, cats...

222
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,963
were our main pets.

223
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,636
But it doesn't make any difference
what type of animal.

224
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,850
If that animal, you love it...

225
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,475
and you want to give it a proper burial,
that's your business.

226
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,643
You bury that pet
'cause you love it.

227
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,988
You could have...

228
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,491
an idea that all animals
should be buried...

229
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,202
but if you live over here,
or five or 10 miles away...

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,574
and you have a horse,
and that horse dies on a Saturday...

231
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,702
and it's 102 degrees,
and you can't get anybody to bury it...

232
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,251
you're going to get a hold
of the rendering company real fast.

233
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,999
'Cause you want that horse
out of there, like, now.

234
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,543
See?

235
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,343
I remember
one young lad there that -

236
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,351
He had a pet lamb,
and his lamb died...

237
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,433
and right away
his dad picked up the phone.

238
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,682
This is a 4-H animal...

239
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,901
that he'd taken from birth
and just loved this animal.

240
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,066
And right away, his father...

241
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,986
had grabbed the phone -

242
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,859
and back in North Dakota,
very few people had phones...

243
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,487
but at this particular farm,
they had a phone.

244
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,411
He called the rendering service
outside of Valley City...

245
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,080
and asked them to come
and pick up the animal.

246
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,421
I've had people call
that have an animal...

247
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,167
and they'll want us to bury it,
and we don't bury animals.

248
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,044
And they're crying.
People are very emotional about-

249
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,217
That's why
it's a controversial thing.

250
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,218
That's why I don't like to break away
and get into the individual things.

251
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,141
But you take a guy
who loses his pet horse.

252
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,060
I mean, to some people,
you know...

253
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,934
it's like losing
their son or their daughter.

254
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,357
I mean it.
That's no kidding.

255
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,698
They're really chilled up bad.
Heavy. it's heavy.

256
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,036
You get some real moaners
on the phone. They're crying, and -

257
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,951
This young lad,
boy, he was so upset...

258
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,200
he went out
and jumped on his pony...

259
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,418
and rode
clear over to our place...

260
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,665
and told me
that his pet had died...

261
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,712
and wanted to know
if he could...

262
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,757
bury his pet
with my collie out there.

263
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,637
I said, “Well, sure."

264
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,802
So we hooked up
a team of horses...

265
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,767
and headed to his place
to beat the rendering truck.

266
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,684
And we did. We got there
and got the pet on the wagon...

267
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,274
and got him back over
to the farm...

268
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,936
and...

269
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,360
I guess we beat the rendering truck
by two hours or something.

270
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,529
We had a little altar
set up in the office...

271
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,903
with some artificial flowers...

272
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,496
and Mr. McClure
would light the candles...

273
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,412
and be ready to receive...

274
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,958
the mourning owners of the pet.

275
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,672
The mother
was uptown shopping...

276
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,633
and the kids were home.

277
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,920
I'm not talking
about just small children.

278
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,548
I'm talking about kids
that are teenage children.

279
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,018
And the mother had given 'em
specific chores to do.

280
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,730
One was, the girl was
to wash and dry the clothes.

281
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,896
One was to wash, and the other
was to take the clothes...

282
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,520
out of the washer
and put it in the dryer.

283
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,521
So anyway, the job was done.

284
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,867
The girl threw the clothes in the dryer
and slammed the dryer door shut...

285
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,487
and walked back to the kitchen.

286
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,536
And as I understand this now...

287
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,829
she heard some meowing...

288
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,962
and frightening screams
of the cat.

289
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,252
They were looking for the cat
and couldn't find the cat.

290
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,423
All of a sudden,
they seen in the dryer-

291
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,969
They heard it in the dryer,
and they opened the dryer door...

292
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,342
and the cat was in the dryer.

293
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,137
The little cat suffered
a broken neck.

294
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,515
I guess they'd called out
the fire department...

295
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,683
and they tried to revive the cat.

296
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,978
The cat did pass on.

297
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,027
The love that people have
for their pets...

298
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,443
is really tremendous.

299
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,413
It's something that is
very, very difficult to explain.

300
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,706
On several occasions,
I've seen it myself...

301
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,827
where we were burying a pet...

302
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,207
where the whole cemetery
would be at the gravesite...

303
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,050
and the children...

304
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,588
and the mother and the father
would really break down...

305
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,465
and actually cry.

306
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,218
The little services...

307
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,643
that we give
out there at the cemetery...

308
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,734
we bring out pretty much that...

309
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,444
“Here before us lies little Toby.

310
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,406
Little Toby was put on this earth
for two reasons:

311
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,988
to love and be loved.

312
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:52,535
And today we're standing here
saying good-bye to little Toby...

313
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:57,081
who was
the Smiths' beloved little friend.

314
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,213
And now we are going
to give you back...

315
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,457
little Toby, to Mother Nature.”

316
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,755
We had a gal here -

317
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,048
I had a gal hired here -

318
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,718
This'll show you
what you're up against.

319
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,843
She never went in the plant.
She never left this office.

320
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,722
You don't see anything from this plant.
Yeah, these trucks come in...

321
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,848
but you don't see
too much, right?

322
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,102
And she didn't see anything.
But she left.

323
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,106
She quit working here
because it bothered her mind.

324
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,025
The mere fact of what we did
bothered her mind.

325
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,744
And she never saw a damn thing
or smelled anything.

326
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,284
This is one thing...

327
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,624
that really bothered me a lot...

328
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,335
that really got into my heart...

329
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,173
was knowing not only
that animals are being treated...

330
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,884
in such a violent way
after death...

331
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,629
in this rendering company...

332
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,803
by being tore apart,
and every scrap of their body...

333
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,309
being used
in one way or another...

334
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,312
but the smell and stuff
was so terrific.

335
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,977
We'd even sit down
in the evening time to our meal...

336
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,070
and the only thing
that hit your nostrils...

337
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,407
wasn't that good piece of meat
you were about to eat...

338
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,862
or the vegetable...

339
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,580
or the nice dessert
that's put on your table...

340
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,325
but you first had to grab...

341
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,671
the wine glass off the table and take
a whiff of that to get the smell...

342
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,213
of the rendering company
out of your nostrils before you could eat.

343
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,427
You know John Ascuaga's Nugget
up there?

344
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,671
They lost one
of those elephants one time.

345
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,675
Jeez, they didn't know
what the hell to do with it.

346
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,518
We got it, and somebody
made the statement...

347
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,679
“Hey, that thing went
to the rendering company."

348
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
We had so many phone calls...

349
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,525
and we actually had to deny
we had that animal.

350
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,938
We told 'em we took it
to a pet cemetery and buried it.

351
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,190
Because people
just didn't want to get-

352
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,700
People got chilled up.
“What happened to that animal?

353
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,077
What happened to that elephant?
Where's the elephant?"

354
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,698
Every once in a while,
they'll lose a giraffe at the zoo...

355
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,793
or they'll lose Big Bertha,
or they'll lose...

356
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,583
Joe Bear
or whatever his name is...

357
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,548
and people say,
“Hey, what's going on here?

358
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:12,178
We'd better bury this
and get a plot and everything," see?

359
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,717
So we got a standing deal
with the zoo.

360
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,558
They don't tell 'em
where the animal went.

361
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,178
'Cause they don't want to be
in the burying business.

362
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,304
When I came here...

363
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,603
and seen this ugly crisis...

364
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,445
these gas chambers
that they got built down here...

365
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,656
and these pets half dead
going into the dump grounds...

366
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,275
and the bulldozer
going over the top of 'em...

367
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,324
and leaving 'em half alive
in the garbage dumps...

368
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:41,245
brought me back to that, and I thought,
“Boy, we're going to beat this.”

369
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,001
And this is the pan
of the inspiration...

370
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,496
of getting our little pets...

371
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,500
out of these places
and into a cemetery...

372
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,718
something that...

373
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,338
we can be proud of, of saying...

374
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,933
“My little pet
has did his chore here...

375
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,019
that God has sent him to us
to do a chore:

376
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,764
love and be loved
and serve his master."

377
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,274
And boy, these little pets
have did that.

378
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,813
And not let 'em go
into the basis of the living hell.

379
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,781
Like I said before,
“Death is for the living...

380
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,942
and not for the dead."

381
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,660
Sing. Sing, Babe.

382
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,460
Come on. 
Come on.

383
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,454
“I want my mama."

384
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,004
So sleepy.
N'

385
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,304
“I want my mom."

386
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,594
“I want my mom."
Come on.

387
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,969
“I want my mom."
“I want my mama."

388
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,970
Come on.
“I want my mama."

389
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,811
Attaboy.

390
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,647
“I want my mama."

391
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,313
“I want my mama."

392
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,823
Are you sleepy?
We'll sing loud.

393
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,455
How can I say
how you miss them...

394
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,499
and how you wake at night...

395
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,588
and feel around for her...

396
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,754
hoping she's all right,
and then shes not even there.

397
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,879
It's, 
It's-it's heartbreaking.

398
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,472
And then you remember
that she is gone...

399
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,763
but you get to thinking
where she is...

400
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,888
and you know where she is,
and you're happy where she is...

401
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,686
and the next day
you go out and take flowers...

402
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,276
and maybe meditate
a little bit and think of...

403
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,737
how often, maybe,
you cried into her fur.

404
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,859
People like people
because they like one another.

405
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,698
And people don't trust
one another thoroughly...

406
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,365
like an animal
and a human being.

407
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,956
I can know you very well...

408
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,252
but when I turn my back,
I don't know you. Not truly.

409
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,249
But my little dog -

410
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,345
I can turn my back on my little dog,
and I know he's back there.

411
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,556
He's my little friend.
He's not gonna jump on...

412
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,843
or bite me or anything like that.

413
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,686
But human beings
cannot be this way.

414
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,182
We didn't get an agreement -
which is our fault -

415
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,025
in writing.

416
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,737
And it just kept getting involved
and more involved and...

417
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,736
since there was no final agreement,
why, then we started...

418
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,373
to differ on ideas
and get in a few arguments.

419
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,586
A pet cemetery business
is not a fast-buck scheme.

420
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,793
It's not a suede-shoe game.

421
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:39,761
It's a good, solid
business enterprise.

422
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:43,256
And in order
to have this concept...

423
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,930
it has to be in your heart,
not in your billfold.

424
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,598
And these are the type of people
I wanted in business with me...

425
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,566
in the pet cemetery concept.

426
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,445
The reason, unfortunately...

427
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:02,112
that we didn't continue on
with the entire development...

428
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,781
of the pet cemetery was...

429
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:09,578
we couldn't actually
work it out with our investors...

430
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,794
that we could project exactly
what the income would be for it...

431
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,957
because we had no way
of projecting the amount of people...

432
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,875
that would want to put their pets
into a cemetery...

433
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,345
even though we felt
that there was a great need for it.

434
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,807
So after several weeks
and several months, we,

435
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,723
we decided that...

436
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,313
it would be better to turn it back
to the original owners...

437
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,979
which was Mr. Dunton
and his family.

438
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,649
I was told that the Duntons...

439
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,941
were trying to get themselves involved
in some sort of gold venture...

440
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,820
or exporting of dead animals...

441
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,539
from the United States to Mexico
for some university in Mexico...

442
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,536
to do some exploration type
of work on the animals.

443
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,841
Mr. Robert Dunton had convinced
Mrs. Ken Dunton...

444
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,676
to have her child born in Mexico...

445
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,388
so he would be a Mexican citizen,
and under those pretenses...

446
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,931
he could have a business
in Mexico and control it.

447
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,850
Mr. Dunton came back into town...

448
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:17,734
and then he decided
at that time that...

449
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,069
“Well, maybe
this is just a great thing.”

450
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,529
I can't speak
for this man's mind...

451
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,446
but the only thing I thought at the time
was the way they decided...

452
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,490
I should open one gravesite...

453
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,205
and put several pets
in the one grave and then close it.

454
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,834
To me,
that only spelled one thing:

455
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,875
“Let's get all the bucks
we can out of this."

456
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,219
Mac called me and says...

457
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,600
“We can't come
to a final agreement...

458
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,970
and I got put out today."

459
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,769
He says,
“The attorney's advice would be...

460
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,110
to get all those pets over
on the legal side...

461
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,228
and vamoose."

462
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,397
So that's what we did.

463
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,685
Mrs. Billingsley
came out to the cemetery...

464
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,781
and said that they had moved
the stone on her animal.

465
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,035
I said, “How are they gonna get
the animal out of the grave -

466
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,950
the casket out -
if they don't move the stone?"

467
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,574
And she said
she didn't want her animal moved.

468
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,702
She said, “You talk as though
I didn't care about my animals...

469
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,420
like you did about yours."

470
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,790
I says, “That's the way
it appears to me."

471
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,155
I asked her
if she had signed a release...

472
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,029
and she said
she had signed a release.

473
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,998
Then she said she hadn't,
so I don't know.

474
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,000
I can't swear to that.

475
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,121
But I made up my mind
I wasn't gonna fool with her.

476
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:47,591
She went down and talked
to Mr. Robert Dunton...

477
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,678
and then I sat in the car
waiting for his son.

478
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,840
I was supposed to sign
the release to let my dog go.

479
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,055
Then I saw both of them
look in my direction...

480
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,055
and start laughing,
like it was just a big joke.

481
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,977
She isn't gonna
cause me any trouble...

482
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,350
'cause I ain't gonna pay
any attention to her.

483
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,816
She just wanted to be noticed.
She just wanted to be Miss Big.

484
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,156
Here we've got all these other
poor people that really needed help...

485
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,651
and she was just trying
to be Miss Big...

486
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,029
and she didn't pay half as much
as the rest of us did.

487
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,177
I don't know whether she really
liked her animals or loved 'em...

488
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,047
or whether she was
just trying to show off...

489
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,216
and make a big impression.

490
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:40,390
This was my idea,
because anybody that would come...

491
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,398
whizzing up in a Cadillac
with all of her furs on to a cemetery -

492
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,901
and you know when they're digging
animals, ifs gonna be an odor there -

493
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,895
didn't have much upstairs.

494
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,024
'Cause I'll tell you,
that was not the place to wear fur.

495
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,992
I think that
something should be done...

496
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,953
so that it shall
never happen again.

497
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:03,577
I think it was a horrible thing for us
in this generation to have it happen.

498
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,291
And in a state like California...

499
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,381
to have something like that,
I think it's inhumane.

500
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,099
I think Mac really wanted
a pet cemetery...

501
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,440
and I think he had probably
a great love for animals.

502
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,441
But unfortunately,
ifs not that easy.

503
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,321
You just can't go out and start
something like that, and build a chapel...

504
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,112
and pay
$50,000 an acre for land...

505
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,949
and pay taxes...

506
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,035
and interest on the balance...

507
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,624
for 25 cents.

508
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,002
Impossible.

509
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,292
And the Duntons
were not interested...

510
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,673
in that beautiful Garden of Eden...

511
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,088
that Mac had in his mind.

512
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,758
'Cause I really think
he had it in his mind.

513
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,097
So as a total...

514
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,639
before it finally wound up
and went to the final lawsuit...

515
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,805
why, I myself lost
around $30,000..

516
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,479
And I'm not sure
how much Joe has lost, but...

517
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,107
ifs in that neighborhood.

518
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,988
I suppose after you lose
this kind of money...

519
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,325
you just keep working at it
until you're a success at something.

520
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,330
I don't know.

521
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,667
So-

522
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,623
The only thing I'm guilty of...

523
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,750
is compassion.

524
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,798
And that's all.

525
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,091
If you want to put...

526
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:43,183
to what I was charged with...

527
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,270
in the courts...

528
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,141
the only thing they can
charge me with is compassion...

529
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,269
<i>because f put my heart...</i>

530
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,522
<i>over the dollar sign.</i>

531
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,487
<i>Ii wasn't the dollar I was after.</i>

532
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,736
<i>It was to take care
of m y customers...</i>

533
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,828
<i>and my dedication...</i>

534
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,164
<i>to what! believed in.</i>

535
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,331
Then, because of the way
I proved my point...

536
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,797
by using my heart...

537
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,170
into fulfilling my obligation...

538
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
then I was condemned.

539
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,056
Then they write letters...

540
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,897
tell everybody
lam no longer part of it...

541
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,567
which broke me...

542
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,904
not only financially...

543
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,774
a burden upon myself
and everyone else -

544
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,447
<i>t was not only broke...</i>

545
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,699
<i>but brokenhearted.</i>

546
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,459
<i>Fm raised on a farm.</i>

547
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,346
<i>We had chickens
and pigs and cows...</i>

548
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,465
<i>and sheep and everything.</i>

549
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,685
<i>Bu! down here, I've been lost.</i>

550
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,056
Now they've taken 'em all away
from here up to the -

551
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,105
What is the name of that place
up above here a little ways?

552
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,194
That town?

553
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,564
Commences with “B."

554
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,613
Blue Hill -
It's Blue Hill Cemetery...

555
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,861
I think the name of it is.

556
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:33,377
Not too far. I guess about
maybe 20 miles from here.

557
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,712
Little town there. Little place.

558
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,753
You know where it's at,
that place.

559
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,924
But I was really surprised
when I...

560
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,173
heard they were getting rid
of the cemetery over here.

561
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,926
Gonna put in buildings
or something over there.

562
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,307
Well. I know people have been
very good to me, you know, 'round -

563
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,146
Well, they seen my condition.
I guess they felt sorry for me.

564
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,692
But it's real, my condition is.
It's not put on, that's for sure.

565
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,990
Boy, if I could only walk.
If I could only get out...

566
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,534
drive my car.

567
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,125
I'd get another car. Yeah.

568
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,086
And my son,
if he'd had only better to me.

569
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:21,175
After I bought him that car -
He's got a nice car.

570
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,711
I bought it myself
just a short time ago.

571
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,672
I don't know.

572
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,471
These kids. Sometimes
the more you do for 'em -

573
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:34,392
He's my grandson,
but I raised him from two years old.

574
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,232
And my husband
always told me, he says...

575
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,478
“Mama, someday
you're gonna be sorry.”

576
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,947
That was a car?

577
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,192
Was that that? Boy.

578
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,360
He says,
“Someday you're gonna be sorry.”

579
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,656
You see how it happens, things?

580
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,411
I don't see him very often.

581
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,754
And he just got that car.

582
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,550
I didn't pay for all of it.
I gave him $400.

583
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,011
Pretty good.
His boss knows it.

584
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,301
Well, he's not working
for that outfit now. He's changed.

585
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,266
He's gone back on his old job...

586
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,682
hauling sand.

587
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,524
No, not hauling sand. He's working
in the office. That's right.

588
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,984
He took over the office job.

589
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,320
His boss told me that
on the phone.

590
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,235
But you know,
he should help me more.

591
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:30,236
He's all I got. He's the one
that brought me up here...

592
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,955
and then put me here
by myself among strangers.

593
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,916
It's terrible,
if you stop and think of it.

594
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,754
I've been without so much
when I first came up here.

595
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,928
It's just - You know, it's -

596
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,430
It's what half my trouble is -

597
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,391
from him not being home with me.

598
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,263
Didn't cost him nothing
to stay here.

599
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,932
Every time he needed money,
he'd always come...

600
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,401
“Mom, can I have this?
Can I have that?”

601
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,021
But he never pays back.

602
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,275
I'm too good, too easy.
That's what everybody tells me.

603
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,570
I quit now. I quit.

604
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,291
Now he's got the office job,
I'm going after him.

605
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,830
I'm going after him good too.

606
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,874
If I have to...

607
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,092
go in a different way,
he's gonna pay that money.

608
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,554
He's got the office job now,
and he makes good money anyway.

609
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:36,636
And he has no kids. He is not married.
“Never get married,” he says.

610
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,645
He was married once.
They're divorced.

611
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,731
And,

612
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:45,193
Well, she tried to take him
for the kid, but she didn't.

613
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,984
They went to court.
It was somebody else's kid.

614
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,984
She's nothing but a tramp.
I told him that.

615
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,031
He wouldn't listen to me.

616
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,157
I says, “I know what she is.
Richard, please, listen to me."

617
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,660
No, he wouldn't listen.
He knew all. He knew everything.

618
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,332
Big shot.

619
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,839
But he soon found out.

620
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,625
Now that's all over with.

621
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,175
I've been through so much,
I don't know how I'm staying alive.

622
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,305
Really, for my age -

623
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,011
If you're young, it's different,
but I've always said...

624
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,137
“I'm never gonna grow old."

625
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,139
I've always had that.

626
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,394
And people that I tell how old I am,
they don't believe me.

627
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,069
Because people my age, as a rule,
don't get around like I do.

628
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,202
<i>Skippy had been dead quite a while,
two or three years.</i>

629
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,203
<i>You know.</i>

630
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,298
<i>Yeah.
I don'! want to think about it.</i>

631
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,465
Everybody liked that dog
around here.

632
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,514
You know, you miss your pets
just like you do any of the family.

633
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:05,107
I don't know what happened
to this last little kitty who was here.

634
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,396
All the cats have gone.

635
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,564
There's no cats around.
There are no animals, no nothing.

636
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,318
I miss that little black kitten
so much.

637
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,991
It was wonderful.

638
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:22,491
And all of a sudden, boom.
No animals around.

639
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,368
Somebody in the neighborhood
or something...

640
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,996
is doing away with them.

641
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,804
<i>The thought
of trying to bury 400 pets...</i>

642
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,928
<i>was pretty hard
to accept at the outset.</i>

643
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,898
<i>However, we felt we had
an obligation to pet owners...</i>

644
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,939
<i>because if we were not
to take on this endeavor...</i>

645
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,903
<i>it would leave many pet owners
with a sour taste...</i>

646
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:57,071
<i>and could set our industry back
for a long time.</i>

647
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,116
<i>We are often asked,
“Why is your business...</i>

648
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,202
<i>apparently successful
where others have failed?"</i>

649
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,792
<i>And the only answer
that I can give...</i>

650
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,794
<i>Is a very obvious one,
and that is that...</i>

651
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,792
<i>we have tried to follow
sound business practices...</i>

652
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,211
<i>where ifs quite obvious
that other pet cemeteries...</i>

653
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,010
<i>that have now failed did not.</i>

654
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,475
This cemetery will be in business...

655
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,641
50, 60, 70,
or a hundred years from now.

656
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,149
Surely beyond the lifetime
of anybody...

657
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,643
who ever buried a pet here.

658
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,647
And I think this is all
that concerns the people...

659
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,941
that have buried their pets here.

660
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,114
When we decided to...

661
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,988
turn the property
into a pet cemetery...

662
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,657
and we discussed a name...

663
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:50,045
and we just all agreed that we couldn't
come up with a better one...

664
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,755
than Bubbling Well
Pet Memorial Park...

665
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,170
which has a lovely sound.

666
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:59,216
The connotation
is something living, bubbling...

667
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,055
a well...

668
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,971
with lovely, refreshing springwater.

669
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,517
And it has a meaning of life...

670
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,307
and, um...

671
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,900
purity and all
of the good things...

672
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,021
that we all like to think about.

673
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:20,150
Most people don't know it, but we're
in the middle of a pet explosion...

674
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,238
<i>throughout not only the United States
but throughout the world.</i>

675
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,364
<i>And this is brought about.</i> ..

676
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,786
<i>From the new pattern that has
emerged in the last 10, 15 years...</i>

677
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,459
<i>in the family fife.</i>

678
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,799
I would say that the Pill...

679
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,384
is probably largely
more responsible...

680
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,264
for the pet explosion
than any other single factor.

681
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,008
This is quite a surprise...

682
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,852
to a lot of people
that don't understand the business...

683
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:51,223
and haven't done
any background work...

684
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,892
but ifs very simple.

685
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,402
The old style was for the husband...

686
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,773
to earn the living,
and the mother stayed at home.

687
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,697
<i>Today we have
a different pattern.</i>

688
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,070
<i>Today the husband and wife
both work...</i>

689
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,534
<i>and they want to prepare
themselves with a home."...</i>

690
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:12,035
<i>and some of the things they'd like
to have before they start a family.</i>

691
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,335
Well, this is just fine
from a planning standpoint...

692
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,630
but nature can't be put aside.

693
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,550
So when the young mother
comes home...

694
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,764
she has to have
something to fondle...

695
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,051
something to mother,
something to love.

696
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,849
<i>She'll have a pet.</i>

697
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,722
<i>The rest of it,
in the normal pattern.</i> ..

698
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,817
Would be that
the grandparents...

699
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,608
would have children -

700
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,523
grandchildren -

701
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:45,323
to take care of and to fondle
and to help to rear...

702
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,037
and this would satisfy
their need for love...

703
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,202
and giving of love
and receiving.

704
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,827
But when this has been set aside
for five, six, seven, or eight years...

705
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,454
what do they do?

706
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,128
They get a pet. Now we're talking
about both sides of the family.

707
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,258
We're not talking about just one.

708
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,470
Now we have
a three-way explosion.

709
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,556
Well, we're here to...

710
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,971
put Caesar in the ground today...

711
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,386
and I know that you've -

712
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,185
This is something
that you've not looked forward to...

713
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,478
but I would just be
interested to know...

714
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,852
how you picked Bubbling Well...

715
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,856
and just tell us
a little about Caesar...

716
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,859
so that we can...

717
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,283
have as much personal feeling
about this as you do...

718
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,532
because we're going to be
Caesar's caretakers...

719
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,000
and take care of his plot
from now on.

720
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,037
And although we can't know...

721
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,664
personal details about all the pets...

722
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,463
of all the people
that come to Bubbling Well...

723
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,553
we have a great feeling for pets...

724
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,800
and we surely want to include
Caesar in our pet family.

725
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,143
Cal, here's...

726
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,683
a little picture of Caesar here,
and I think...

727
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,182
- Yes.
- If you see that, you can understand...

728
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,477
why we wanted him buried
in a good place like Bubbling Wells.

729
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,696
- You know, I feel like I know him.
- Is that right'?

730
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,363
- That face and that smile.
- He was quite some dog.

731
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,111
What was his pedigree again?

732
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,661
He was a mixture
of Australian sheep and terrier.

733
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,533
- And terrier?
- Yeah.

734
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,537
- Australian sheep.
- As you can see with all that hair.

735
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,128
- Did he have a coat! Look at that face.
- Isn't he beautiful?

736
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,967
I've never seen that kind of a mix.

737
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,304
And we get many, many
different combinations.

738
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,049
One thing that we get
and we see...

739
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,468
is it's the combinations -

740
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:37,393
it's the crossbreeding
that produces seemingly the best pet.

741
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,392
- Right.
- The purebreds are fine...

742
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,563
and a lot of people
enjoy their relationship...

743
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,985
as much as others,
but it seems that...

744
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,108
when we get a mix...

745
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:54,323
somehow it seems to bring out
the best in all the breeds...

746
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,575
- and they make a better pet.
- Right.

747
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,669
I don't know.
This is most unusual.

748
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,538
Most unusual.

749
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,666
I just can say
I've never seen anything like that.

750
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,340
He always had hair down over his eyes.

751
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,340
- That's from the sheep?
- From the sheep in him.

752
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:15,264
- He never had trouble looking out'?
- No, he found his way around good.

753
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,933
He got around.
I'm glad you showed that to me.

754
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,933
- He always got around me pretty nice.
- I'll bet he did.

755
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,067
I'll bet he did.

756
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,067
<i>Our oldest son,
who was in the insurance business...</i>

757
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,156
<i>back in Salt Lake City...</i>

758
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,402
decided that the pressures
in the insurance business...

759
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,404
were getting to him...

760
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,623
and he made a trip back home...

761
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,333
to just sort of look around
the Bay Area...

762
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,999
to see what might be available.

763
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,249
And his mother...

764
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,752
as devious as she is,
sort of got him on the hill...

765
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,629
and really sold him
a bill of goods.

766
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,631
And the next thing we knew...

767
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,930
he had decided to bring
his little family back to Napa.

768
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,069
<i>Every young guy
has an aspiration...</i>

769
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:14,660
<i>to pursue
a very aggressive sales field.</i>

770
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,824
<i>So about the only thing
I could think about was insurance.</i>

771
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,326
<i>So I started off as a salesman...</i>

772
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,499
<i>and worked my way up
to a sales manager.</i>

773
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,711
<i>But all throughout that whole thing,
I wasn't cognizant of it...</i>

774
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,177
<i>but I was actually using my strength
and my youth to the height.</i>

775
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,962
<i>I was burning out.</i>

776
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,011
<i>I could not exceed 150 pounds...</i>

777
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,723
<i>no matter how much late.</i>

778
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,596
<i>There was so much...</i>

779
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,519
<i>mental work there, you know?</i>

780
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,313
<i>And I had, ultimately,
no free time.</i>

781
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,903
<i>So I resigned my position...</i>

782
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,399
<i>and of course gave them
plenty of warning and stuff“.</i>

783
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,821
<i>and decided
to come back to California.</i>

784
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:01,457
I have to say to myself,
“What does it mean to me?

785
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,997
What does this mean to me?

786
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,621
And what is it going
to mean to me?”

787
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:10,125
So I recognize this, and,

788
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,596
A couple of things
when I was instructing in motivation...

789
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,091
back in Salt Lake City...

790
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,811
is that, you know,
if we don't stop...

791
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,649
and ask ourselves
a question once in a while...

792
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,395
to probe our subconscious
or to probe our conscious -

793
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,738
I used to teach it.
It's a plain, simple formula.

794
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,195
We reduced everything
to a formula, memorized it...

795
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,694
and therefore we were able
to repeat it constantly.

796
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,866
<i>I used to call x?
the R2/A2 formula</i> -

797
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,582
<i>recognize, relate, assimilate,
and put into action.</i>

798
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,168
Like, I could be driving
down the freeway...

799
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,629
and see a 450SL,
and I could say...

800
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,465
“Hey, I like that.
What does that mean to me?

801
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,132
What will I have to do to get it?
How can I do it?”

802
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:58,803
Then work for it and strive for it.
It kind of makes life easy.

803
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,426
<i>I think that's why
a lot of people don't -</i>

804
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,266
<i>they get frustrated,
they have emotional problems...</i>

805
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,687
<i>is that they don'! know
how to cope with their mind.</i>

806
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,153
<i>There are three things
that I've got to do...</i>

807
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,571
<i>and that if anybody wants to do
to be successful is“.</i>

808
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,161
to have the desire,
the “want-to," you know?

809
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,747
Why do you go to work
in the morning?

810
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,911
“Gee, why am I here?"

811
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,457
Because you want to.
You know?

812
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,796
But that's obvious.

813
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,583
And then the next
very important ingredient...

814
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,961
is something that a lot of people...

815
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,338
and a lot of businesses
fail to delve into -

816
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,590
ifs the activity-knowledge.

817
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,343
It would be the equation...

818
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,469
to a mathematical problem.

819
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,980
It would be equal to...

820
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,063
the chemist's ability to...

821
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,936
emulsify chemicals properly.

822
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,484
The valences.

823
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,322
But the knowledge of it,
the whole scope, everything in detail.

824
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,364
And then the third element would be
the know-how or the experience.

825
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,536
<i>I have the inspiration to action.</i>

826
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,785
<i>I don't have
the activity-knowledge...</i>

827
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,458
<i>but I'm getting the know-how
before the activity-knowledge.</i>

828
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,174
<i>As a matter of fact, I'm getting more
know-how than activity-knowledge.</i>

829
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,381
<i>But they can be
correlated together.</i>

830
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,595
<i>They can be overlapped.</i>

831
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:23,967
Dan, our youngest son,
graduated from Chico...

832
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,812
with a degree
in business administration...

833
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,976
and he thought this entitled him...

834
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,351
to an executive position
out in the world somewhere.

835
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:37,526
After many interviews,
he found that it wasn't that easy.

836
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:43,036
So he agreed to come home and, with a
lot of reluctance, to try this out...

837
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,873
to see how he and his lovely father
would get along.

838
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,583
<i>College is an interesting experience...</i>

839
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,829
<i>and I was kind of taken with it
my first few years.</i>

840
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,797
I would study
eight, nine hours a night...

841
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,545
and really caught up in the idea
of doing all this studying.

842
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,213
But towards the end
of my college days...

843
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,010
I ended up partying
more than I did actually studying.

844
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,885
But,

845
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,514
You know, I learned a lot.
Not that I - I learned -

846
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,609
I took many classes, say,
in mathematics...

847
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,571
business administration,
marketing, and things like that.

848
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,987
And it's not like you -
You're given things to learn.

849
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,112
However, you don't retain
the knowledge that you learn.

850
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,911
It's the idea that you're applying
your brain. You're exercising it.

851
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,875
That's the part where
the education comes in, I think.

852
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,858
<i>Something also that happened -
it happens to everybody, I suppose</i> -

853
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,104
<i>I fell in love up in Chico...</i>

854
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,196
<i>and...</i>

855
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,283
<i>I think an important thing
in falling in love:</i>

856
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,820
<i>Before you fall in love,
you should have</i> -

857
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:11,165
<i>True love, I think, is experiencing
many different types of loves...</i>

858
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:15,583
<i>and learning exactly what you want
out of a relationship.</i>

859
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,257
I spent about <i>2</i> 112 years
with a woman...

860
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,251
and...

861
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:26,131
I fell in and out of love
and learned a lot of things.

862
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,349
“Nothing lasts forever'...

863
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,810
was something that hit home.

864
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,232
I think a broken heart...

865
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,443
is something that everybody
should experience...

866
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,562
because it makes you appreciate...

867
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,238
any future experiences
that you have.

868
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,827
You've felt the hurt...

869
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,741
so you can enjoy
the positive aspects of love.

870
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,165
<i>So I finished
all those experiences...</i>

871
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,251
<i>and I came back here
to the park.</i> ..

872
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:03,501
<i>And my father offered
to take me on...</i>

873
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,425
<i>and teach me the business.</i>

874
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,639
<i>I knew we had
many houses up here...</i>

875
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,509
<i>and I would have no prob/em
having a place to live.</i>

876
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,929
<i>I lived in the chicken coop
in the little house for a while.</i>

877
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,647
<i>Then I got this place...</i>

878
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,859
<i>which is a pretty nice place
for just one person.</i>

879
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,693
<i>“The house on the hill"
is what we call it.</i>

880
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:28,405
<i>And so I moved up here.
I still haven 't completely moved up here.</i>

881
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:32,372
<i>I still have a lor of my stuff
down in the chicken coop.</i>

882
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,005
<i>My dad initiated this whole program...</i>

883
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,927
<i>I would say
approximately six years ago.</i>

884
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,848
<i>So therefore, he has
the greater amount of knowledge.</i>

885
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,097
<i>He has the public relations...</i>

886
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,440
<i>with the veterinary doctors.</i>

887
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,730
<i>He knows them not only by name...</i>

888
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,898
<i>but also by their secretaries'...</i>

889
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,021
<i>and also their wives' names.</i>

890
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,194
<i>He has a vast amount of knowledge.</i>

891
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:12,286
<i>My brother Danny has been working
in the park for about, three years.</i>

892
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,247
<i>Therefore, he has
quite a bit of knowledge...</i>

893
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:18,163
<i>of procedures and public relations.</i>

894
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,712
<i>So therefore, my father is</i> -

895
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,548
<i>he's the focal point.</i>

896
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,544
<i>He trained my brother.
He gave him the knowledge.</i>

897
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,715
<i>He taught him this route
that Fm responsible for now.</i>

898
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:37,015
<i>I find it quite hard right now to -</i>

899
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,766
<i>you know, to go out on my daily task
here at the park...</i>

900
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,108
<i>without consulting my brother...</i>

901
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,273
<i>or consulting my father.</i>

902
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,614
One of the things in the insurance
business that I always did...

903
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:52,577
that got me ahead, I suppose,
is I was able to memorize quite well...

904
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,912
with hardly any effort.

905
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,533
And I have to literally
memorize the streets...

906
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,080
and the localities
of these veterinary clinics.

907
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,454
<i>These clinics are literally speckled...</i>

908
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,673
<i>all over that
southern peninsula area...</i>

909
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,089
<i>and I have to get on the freeway
and go to this one...</i>

910
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,759
<i>and come back on to this one
and pick up from where I left.</i>

911
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,474
<i>I have to memorize routes,
know exactly where they are...</i>

912
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:20,230
<i>what road to take to get to it,
to get back, to get to the next one.</i>

913
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,566
<i>Naturally, there's an element
of fear that I have.</i>

914
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,739
With our permalloy markers...

915
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,985
we have several different formats
that the people can choose from...

916
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,329
and you can see some
of the different formats right here.

917
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,832
Now, in some situations...

918
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,542
when the people don't have
actual photographs...

919
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,539
they can sketch a picture...

920
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,007
right on to the alloy steel.

921
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,510
Now, probably
the most popular type...

922
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,673
of marker that we have
in a permalloy...

923
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,051
is what we call
a vertical-type picture -

924
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,099
the reason being,
a vertical-type picture...

925
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,520
they can place
the photograph in a position...

926
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,235
where you're getting maximum
amount of surface coverage...

927
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,946
with maximum amount
of wordage usage.

928
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:14,488
I have to keep telling myself,
“Jeez...

929
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,828
there's gonna be
more parts to this thing.

930
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:23,326
There's going to have to be
an advance selling program.”

931
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,748
I'd like to be selling
in Los Angeles...

932
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,963
and getting
the cemeteries there...

933
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,549
and starting another one
in Los Angeles.

934
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,927
Maybe Seattle. A larger city...

935
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,387
where there are a lot
of concentration of animals.

936
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:39,509
With our private burials,
we have two systems of marking...

937
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,386
and the first is
what we call a grid system.

938
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,731
And the way it works is,
we have a rectangle...

939
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,108
with letters and then numbers.

940
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,071
In a vertical position,
we put numbers...

941
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:56,237
and the numbers go from 1 to 17,
and then we have the alphabet.

942
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,324
It's a cross situation,
where an animal -

943
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,823
say, Bonnie -

944
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,076
would be 9-W.

945
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,088
What that would mean is that
the people would go to Row 9...

946
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,840
then they'd go to

947
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,880
And where those two points crossed...

948
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,629
<i>you would have the location.</i>

949
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,303
This opportunity doesn't mean
a damn thing to you...

950
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,551
unless you're willing...

951
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,973
to work hard...

952
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,643
to study, to be a student...

953
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,812
and to apply your experience...

954
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,560
and to do better constantly.

955
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,905
So I think that's what
my father's done for many years.

956
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,070
And I know
I've seen his successes.

957
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,614
He's read
the same textbooks I have.

958
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,576
Danny is basically doing
the same thing.

959
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,293
And this is what I have to do.

960
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,710
I have to learn to put
this knowledge into reality.

961
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,519
The basic tenet of our church...

962
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,981
the Bubbling Well Church
of Universal Love...

963
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,442
incorporated
in January of 1977, is...

964
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,982
“The Church has as its tenets...

965
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,614
a belief in a supreme being...

966
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,109
who does not differentiate...

967
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:24,205
in bestowing his benevolence
on all species of life...

968
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,494
whether of this earth...

969
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,206
or any form of life hereafter."

970
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,788
<i>The thought occurred to me...</i>

971
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:36,838
<i>that any god,
any supreme being...</i>

972
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,180
<i>that was indeed compassionate
and concerned about people...</i>

973
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,472
<i>would surely be concerned
about any living creature.</i>

974
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:49,597
<i>God is supposed to know
when the sparrow falls...</i>

975
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,815
<i>when the lilies of the field bloom.</i>

976
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:55,152
<i>So surely
at the gates of heaven...</i>

977
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,022
<i>an all-compassionate goo'...</i>

978
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,867
<i>or an all-compassionate supreme being
is surely not going to say...</i>

979
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,620
<i>"Well, you're walking in on two legs.
You can go in.</i>

980
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,536
<i>You're walking in on four legs.</i>

981
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,576
<i>We can? take you."</i>

982
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,703
<i>I don? believe this will happen.</i>

983
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,133
Now, people come up,
and there is a common bond.

984
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,720
At the church,
we don't have formal services.

985
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,181
We're not trying
to save any souls...

986
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:27,017
or collect money
or anything like that.

987
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:31,355
It's just a -
It's son of a church of love.

988
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,772
We do not have to go too far afield
to make this conversion...

989
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,396
because...

990
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,860
we have our own chapel.

991
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,076
We have stained-glass windows.
We even have a bell.

992
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,448
And we're usually talking
in terms of death...

993
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,166
and talking in terms of hereafter.

994
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:55,163
Well, this is the very essence
of any other religion.

995
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:59,588
So if in the hereafter
there are no pets...

996
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,924
I don't think any of us
that love our pets...

997
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,306
would really feel, maybe -

998
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,801
I can't say
we wouldn't want to go...

999
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,930
but I really believe
they'll all be there...

1000
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,393
in the spirit with all of us.

1001
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,438
The pet owners
that we have talked to...

1002
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,980
have embraced the idea...

1003
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,984
and it has had
a very dramatic effect on a lot of them.

1004
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,578
It's brought them assurance,
it makes sense...

1005
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,289
and ifs not -

1006
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,785
It's very hard to refute it,
as a matter of fact...

1007
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,958
because it makes sense.

1008
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,457
You don't have to depend
on a lot of...

1009
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,676
mystical type of thinking.

1010
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,636
It just makes sense.

1011
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,139
And people at this time
are looking for assurance.

1012
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,475
They don't want pie in the sky.
They don't want fairy tales.

1013
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,477
They want assurance.

1014
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,316
Trooper was the type of dog...

1015
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,780
that didn't have
other dogs to relate to.

1016
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,778
He lived
with adult human beings.

1017
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:13,157
And having the inability
to communicate...

1018
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,496
like human beings do
through conversation...

1019
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,166
he did it with his mannerisms...

1020
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,209
and his eyes and reception.

1021
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,129
One of the things
that you noticed with him...

1022
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,424
is when we were sitting in a room,
he would position himself...

1023
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,970
and as each one of us spoke,
the tone of their voices...

1024
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,388
would direct his attention
to that person.

1025
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,603
And during the course
of the conversation...

1026
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,439
if the conversation was pleasant,
he would react to that...

1027
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,105
or if it was sharp,
he'd react to that.

1028
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,525
He also had a sense as to
the subject of the conversation.

1029
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,569
In particular, on Christmastime...

1030
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,536
<i>the discussion about gifts
to various members of the family...</i>

1031
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:54,449
<i>and there were certain things
that we knew he would like...</i>

1032
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:57,577
<i>as to doggy bones
and little chewy things that he had.</i>

1033
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,547
Of course, we didn't conceive that
he would be aware of our conversation...

1034
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,379
yet we were relating to him,
because as I say...

1035
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:08,254
there was no one else he could talk
and relate to except ourselves.

1036
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,848
Christmas morning -
this was just before his death -

1037
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,845
<i>we all came down
to open our presents.</i>

1038
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,223
<i>They were all laid out in various sections
around the Christmas tree...</i>

1039
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,066
<i>and we would hand
each one of us a gift</i> -

1040
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:25,063
particularly with my mother-in-law,
her being the elder of the family...

1041
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,110
we'd bring her presents.

1042
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,951
He lined himself up and couldn't wait
and went right to the direction...

1043
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,787
of where his packages were
and started unwrapping them...

1044
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,874
right there, and they were not
laid out in the open.

1045
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,994
He unwrapped his presents,
just like sharing with all of us.

1046
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,541
It's amazing that there are...

1047
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,006
so many different aspects of this.

1048
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,966
It's not just...

1049
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,178
You know,
an opening in the ground...

1050
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,592
somebody prefers a casket or not...

1051
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,887
and the ground is put back
into the opening - no.

1052
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,602
Sometimes the people
like to come up...

1053
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,188
and witness the actual burial
of the animal.

1054
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,559
Sometimes they don't.
And we pick out a date...

1055
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,936
that's convenient for them,
and they come up.

1056
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,105
And as far as preparation...

1057
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,235
a hole has to be dug, prepared.

1058
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,784
We have to make sure
the hole is gonna fit the casket.

1059
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:18,953
You don't want to make it too large.
You're gonna waste space.

1060
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:22,370
You don't want it too small
because you can't get the thing in.

1061
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:26,419
Mentally-wise, I don't worry about
putting an animal down into an opening...

1062
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,295
because if I don't do it,
somebody else is gonna have to.

1063
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,173
It's just mind over matter.
You have to prepare yourself for it.

1064
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,895
We pick up animals
that are 150 pounds - greyhounds -

1065
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,685
and they're very heavy.

1066
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,776
We have to bring them in
to our bodies...

1067
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,145
to hoist them into the truck.

1068
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,399
So it's mind over matter
once again.

1069
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,651
<i>Sometimes they come in</i> -

1070
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,995
<i>When we get them,
their hair is matted."...</i>

1071
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,616
<i>and they're very moist from being
in a freezer where they're kept.</i>

1072
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,415
So they have to be combed
and dried out a bit...

1073
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,005
which isn't the most
pleasant thing in the world...

1074
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,087
but ifs not that bad, really.

1075
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,801
After a while it becomes
something you don't really -

1076
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,920
doesn't really bother you at all.

1077
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,843
<i>Bu! I don't know
what happens down there. I really don':</i>

1078
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,391
<i>The moisture, the contraction...</i>

1079
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,389
<i>the expansion of the ground...</i>

1080
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,142
<i>of course, the insects,
and so on and so forth.</i>

1081
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,611
<i>There</i> b <i>another world
down there, you know.</i>

1082
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:47,166
He'd go down on his front knees,
and I knew something drastic -

1083
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,540
He was just blacking out.
He'd just black out.

1084
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,255
Fall over and black out,
just for a few seconds.

1085
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,969
- Then he'd get back up again.
- Ready to go strong.

1086
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,963
We took him down to the vet's...

1087
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,386
- and we had -
- Tests.

1088
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,302
Test after test.
They couldn't find nothing.

1089
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,055
- One day we took him to -
- Back again to the -

1090
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,271
back to the same vet,
because this vet, he's darn good.

1091
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,268
We like him a lot.

1092
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:14,443
And he called us and said,
“I found out what's wrong with York."

1093
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,408
He says, the -

1094
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,493
- “He has heartworms."
- Heartworms.

1095
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:22,911
I'm telling you, if I never tell anybody
anything else again...

1096
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,542
please watch your dogs
for heartworm.

1097
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,832
It's carried by mosquitoes...

1098
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,547
just like your malaria,
and you don't know -

1099
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:34,089
We used to think we were free
from it here, but we're not.

1100
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:38,097
It was a Southern disease. But here
in California, why, it's very prevalent.

1101
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:40,511
I ask myself,
“What does this mean to me?

1102
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:44,262
What does this park mean to me?
What does this opportunity mean to me?"

1103
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,184
Well, it means a lot.

1104
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,932
It means
I'll be able to have something...

1105
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,693
to work for
for many years to come.

1106
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,939
It will provide
the things that I will need...

1107
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,483
and you know...

1108
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,827
the long line
of the other things, events.

1109
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,082
<i>Phil has moved into the business.
He's slowly learning it.</i>

1110
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:13,457
He's learning the route right now,
and he'll be taking that over...

1111
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,625
but at the same time,
he's learning...

1112
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,341
about the private burials,
about handling the people...

1113
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,635
because there's definitely things
you have to know...

1114
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,760
to be able to talk to the people here
about their pets.

1115
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,559
<i>You have to see by example.
You have to learn by example.</i>

1116
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,103
<i>We're working together.
We have our ups and downs.</i>

1117
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,819
<i>He's a bit older than lam,
so it provides some hardships...</i>

1118
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,861
<i>because I'm telling him what to do,
and he doesn't always like that.</i>

1119
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,110
<i>He resents it at times.</i>

1120
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,998
So my father
is in charge of the park.

1121
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,243
He's “el presidento."

1122
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,335
He's number one.

1123
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:54,172
Danny, by virtue
of seniority and knowledge...

1124
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,257
is number two...

1125
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,048
and I guess
I would be the third person.

1126
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,217
My father now...

1127
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,807
is trying to work
out of the business...

1128
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,971
<i>because he's getting on in years...</i>

1129
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,063
<i>and he wants to do a little traveling
before he passes on.</i>

1130
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,182
<i>So he's letting up...</i>

1131
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,273
<i>and he's letting me take over
handling the people...</i>

1132
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,395
<i>and he's staying
pretty much in the background...</i>

1133
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,615
<i>although I don't think he'll ever stay
completely in the background...</i>

1134
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,201
<i>because
he's a fairly dominant person.</i>

1135
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:29,666
Then he came out of it,
and he was perfectly normal...

1136
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,457
and racing through Golden Gate Park
along the ocean beach.

1137
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,705
<i>And then just as suddenly...</i>

1138
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,173
<i>we took him over for a checkup...</i>

1139
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,419
<i>to recheck the prior prognosis...</i>

1140
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,343
<i>and they said
they thought he was all right.</i>

1141
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,558
<i>He came home
on a Wednesday afternoon.”</i>

1142
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:50,895
<i>and I recall he was so relieved
to get out of that veterinarian office...</i>

1143
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,398
<i>having been in there all day,
he had a habit -</i>

1144
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,859
To me, I always got
a kiss on the knee area...

1145
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,524
and I recall that
as probably the last time...

1146
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,522
I remember him doing that.

1147
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,945
And then just
as suddenly as the kiss...

1148
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,239
he seemed to go right down...

1149
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,658
and we kept phoning the vets...

1150
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,033
and they said not to worry,
that they didn't like to eat...

1151
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:14,536
on medication of this son,
but to bring him in on Monday.

1152
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,789
But before that happened,
we ran him...

1153
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:21,419
to the All Animal Emergency Hospital,
and Dr. Benjamin there.

1154
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:24,137
It was too late.
He was gone by then.

1155
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,598
He just passed away
on the Sunday after.

1156
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,638
But the main thing is
for people who have dogs...

1157
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,433
and they don't breed them...

1158
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,314
the most intelligent thing
I would recommend would be...

1159
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,686
when the dog is about-
I suppose the same for cats -

1160
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,859
two or three years old,
that is the time...

1161
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,574
- to make a decision to have them -
- Neutered.

1162
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,740
You keep that idea
of building this place up...

1163
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,705
of fixing it up, and eventually
it will be something...

1164
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,291
that nothing
else can compare with.

1165
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,294
That idea keeps
the whole thing together...

1166
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,297
and, that -

1167
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,800
that concept is what...

1168
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,177
keeps us together, I think.

1169
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,468
My dad used to tell me
when I was a young kid -

1170
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,133
I'd look at a job
that had to be done...

1171
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:13,228
and he'd say to me,
“Nothing's impossible."

1172
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,974
That always stuck in my craw. I couldn't
believe it. “Nothing's impossible."

1173
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,019
I kind of learned, when I got
in the insurance business...

1174
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,111
that everything is possible.

1175
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,528
You have to look at it
with the right frame of mind.

1176
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,446
And that's important:
your mind.

1177
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,867
There's a tendency
to sit on your laurels...

1178
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,162
and be somewhat complacent...

1179
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:38,002
about small advances...

1180
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,838
and small accomplishments.

1181
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,716
Or even sometimes
large accomplishments...

1182
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,302
have a tendency
to put you at ease.

1183
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,592
However, this is a trap...

1184
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:52,934
because we are not content...

1185
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:56,100
with just having an ordinary...

1186
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,940
nice or good pet cemetery.

1187
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,810
Ours is going to be the finest.

1188
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,108
We're not going to stop until ours...

1189
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,527
is the finest in the country.

1190
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,151
There'll be no finer
when we're through.

1191
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,199
When I'd hire a guy...

1192
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,073
I'd bring him into my office...

1193
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,451
and I'd specifically
designed my office...

1194
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,670
so I could display
the maximum trophies...

1195
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,915
on walls and stuff.

1196
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,384
And I'd bring this guy in,
who had probably been making...

1197
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,595
maybe 9,000 a year or less.

1198
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,260
I'd bring him into this office
with nice furniture...

1199
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,806
and he'd see these trophies
and he'd - “jeez,” you know.

1200
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,805
You know, they were taken away.

1201
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,933
It's kind of like flaunting it, I guess.

1202
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,402
To hire him,
all I did was tell stories...

1203
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,111
about what each trophy meant to me
and what it could mean to him...

1204
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,360
and if he'd like to increase
his income and his future.

1205
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:55,076
The names of our gardens
were created...

1206
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,201
by words...

1207
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,329
that seemed to depict...

1208
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:06,799
the qualities of pets,
like our Garden of Companionship.

1209
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,465
A pet is a companion.

1210
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,588
The Garden of Devotion.

1211
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,977
Almost all pets
are devoted to their masters.

1212
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:21,473
The Garden of the Gentle Giants,
again, is descriptive.

1213
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,976
Kitty Curve.

1214
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:29,652
The Reserve Garden is set aside
and reserved for smaller pets.

1215
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,275
The Garden of Memory...

1216
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,787
is set aside
because it will bring...

1217
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,165
happy memories
in the future, we hope.

1218
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,126
We had a Valentines Day party
for all the wives.

1219
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:46,256
I think there was about six of us.
I told the guys to come over.

1220
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,090
“We're gonna have a cake...

1221
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:51,381
and we're gonna celebrate
Valentine's Day."

1222
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:55,132
<i>So</i> we had a big cake,
and all the wives came over...

1223
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,300
and I had this motivational
meeting planned.

1224
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,970
They didn't know
exactly what was going on.

1225
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,597
And I had
all these signs on the wall...

1226
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:05,771
and I had made up a chart,
a commitment chart.

1227
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:08,145
Anyway, we had the cake...

1228
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,489
and we had the girls talk,
and we read the material...

1229
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,075
the motivational material
for prizes and trophies...

1230
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,536
to be won the subsequent week.

1231
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,906
And we got the girls motivated.

1232
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,204
And the girls
got the guys motivated.

1233
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:25,329
We created the Garden of Honor...

1234
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:28,374
and in this garden,
we will bury...

1235
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,047
a Seeing Eye dog
or a police dog...

1236
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,795
killed in the line of duty...

1237
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,218
at no cost...

1238
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,309
if it's killed in the line of duty.

1239
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,894
And for anybody else...

1240
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,355
who wants to share this garden...

1241
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,892
then we created a price...

1242
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,486
which amounts to more than
any other garden that we have.

1243
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,402
I kind of think
I'm motivated all the time...

1244
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:57,949
because I have so many
experiences of motivation...

1245
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,948
and I understand it quite well.

1246
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,040
One thing that...

1247
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,418
this gentleman to my left...

1248
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:09,585
<i>always said, and it sticks
in my brain all the time, is that...</i>

1249
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,459
<i>"Emotions are not always
subject to reason...</i>

1250
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,006
<i>but they're always
subject to action."</i>

1251
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:18,007
<i>And we all have
periods of inertia...</i>

1252
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,135
<i>where we don'! want
to get up and do things.</i>

1253
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,557
<i>So I have to tell myself
psychologically...</i>

1254
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,974
<i>"It's gonna be a great day.
I'm gonna have a great day today. "</i>

1255
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:30,978
<i>I repeat it over and over and actually
do the thing with that in mind.</i>

1256
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,026
I've been trying
to teach it to my brother.

1257
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:37,947
As a matter of fact, couple of months ago,
I wrote him a letter.

1258
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,695
I tried to write him
a very motivational letter...

1259
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,324
because at the time,
he was very inspirationally dissatisfied.

1260
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,793
I don't go out very much...

1261
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,583
so what I do to pass the time...

1262
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,999
aside from watching television,
of course, is...

1263
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,878
I would sit down and put
these tracks down on tape...

1264
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,346
and just play guitar.

1265
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,558
It's something that gives me
a lot of personal satisfaction.

1266
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,598
I mean, with any type
of a musical instrument...

1267
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,729
you're never gonna be bored.

1268
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,848
So much of the time,
people say...

1269
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,317
“What am I gonna do?
There's nothing to do."

1270
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,436
They're continually complaining.

1271
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:16,110
But with a musical instrument,
you can sit down...

1272
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,366
and you can provide
your own entertainment.

1273
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,840
Even my kids -
You know, I try to abstain...

1274
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:25,592
from the word “not”
and “can”? and “no”...

1275
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:28,765
and stuff like that,
which are very negative words...

1276
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,763
and try to instill...

1277
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,516
rather than physical punishment...

1278
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,685
but just saying -

1279
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,689
My youngest girl is
2 1/2 years old...

1280
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:41,441
and it's very hard
for her to understand...

1281
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,819
the language, rationalize it.

1282
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,538
So I sit her down when she's done
something wrong and tell her...

1283
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,703
“Good girls don't do this.

1284
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,870
Good girls do things
that make us happy."

1285
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,838
We created our little lakes...

1286
01:12:55,955 --> 01:13:00,210
because we feel that this gives
an atmosphere of tranquility...

1287
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,712
and helps to break up...

1288
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,098
the rows of little headstones...

1289
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,592
<i>which could be very monotonous...</i>

1290
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,719
<i>and not too appealing.</i>

1291
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:37,057
In former years, I would write
three and four songs a week...

1292
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,434
and I've got a little notebook...

1293
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,311
where I've got
about probably 50 songs.

1294
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:45,155
You know,
you always have the dream...

1295
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,487
in the back of your mind
that someday...

1296
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,244
these songs will be published,
and you'll be famous.

1297
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:53,240
But as you get older,
you start realizing that maybe...

1298
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,164
those are just what they were -
dreams, nothing more.

1299
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,421
But dreams are nice to have.

1300
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,337
Something to look forward to,
you know.

1301
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:07,712
It gives you more satisfaction,
something you can think about.

1302
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:11,683
Our mind is like a computer.
If our mind read...

1303
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,678
or extracted a data line from it...

1304
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,643
if you put in positive,
you would get out positive.

1305
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,141
If you put in negative,
you get out negative.

1306
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,689
So you have to understand that.
Our mind is -

1307
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,690
We can go into a negative pan
and into a positive part...

1308
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:29,863
and if you really want to get more
involved, there's an in-between...

1309
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:33,530
that people never get really negative,
and people never really get positive.

1310
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,790
They call it “the gray area."

1311
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,250
But the mind reacts to suggestion.

1312
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,041
And suggestion is merely...

1313
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,332
an external force
or an external thing...

1314
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,711
that you perceive
through your senses -

1315
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:50,930
like your smell,
your sight, your feeling.

1316
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:54,517
You could even be
smelling a big vat of spaghetti...

1317
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,637
and it suggests to you
that you're hungry.

1318
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,982
So therefore,
our strongest power...

1319
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,523
that we have is in suggestion
and the power of prayer.

1320
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,987
That's the strongest power
that we have.

1321
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,490
<i>Success is like a journey...</i>

1322
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:16,865
<i>and when you finally
achieve success in your given field...</i>

1323
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,083
<i>the journeys over.</i>

1324
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,586
<i>You have to look for another -
something else to motivate you.</i>

1325
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,798
<i>There was a famous doctor
who was one of the first people...</i>

1326
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,963
<i>to climb Mount Everest,
and at the end...</i>

1327
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,588
<i>he looked up at the mountain -
The first time he tried, he failed.</i>

1328
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,179
<i>And as he was coming dawn
from the mountain, he looked at it...</i>

1329
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,267
<i>and he said,
“H! climb Mount Everest!'</i>

1330
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,396
<i>He says, “Mountains don't grow,
but men always will."</i>

1331
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:47,653
There's a principle of law that
with every benefit, there's a burden...

1332
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,649
and the responsibility
that you have with a dog -

1333
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,743
It's not just an inanimate object.

1334
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,112
In our life today, we do focus...

1335
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:58,456
a lot of our attention
on material things...

1336
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,708
such as automobiles, clothes...

1337
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,577
trips, and things of that son...

1338
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,124
and even objects -
paintings and...

1339
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:08,341
other kinds of things
at home that you cherish.

1340
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,051
Well, an animal, I think,
much more so you cherish...

1341
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:12,886
because he does respond to you.

1342
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:16,303
He doesn't talk like a human being,
but he is much more so...

1343
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,676
than just an inanimate object,
and I think therefore...

1344
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,099
a responsibility
that a person has with an animal...

1345
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,143
you'll sense that
when you have them...

1346
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,478
'cause their love and affection
comes to you.

1347
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:28,478
And that love and affection,
over a period of years...

1348
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:32,573
becomes a pan of your life,
and you just can't discard them...

1349
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,988
to such a degree like you can...

1350
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:37,407
a wrapper
around some food and say...

1351
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,576
“Well, it's finished
and disappeared."

1352
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,870
Of course, it is a very -

1353
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,289
When a dog dies suddenly,
like Trooper died...

1354
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,505
the moment of decision came:
“What do we do with him?”

1355
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,623
I could often think
of Trooper's face...

1356
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,921
and I say,
“Where are you gonna put me?"

1357
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,761
<i>There's something to life that,
even when you discard something...</i>

1358
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,927
<i>of an inanimate nature,
you dispose of it...</i>

1359
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,049
<i>with some kind of a reverence.</i>

1360
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:06,023
I got a stereo system
aside from a recording system.

1361
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,561
It's a Pioneer SX-1010...

1362
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,814
and ifs a hundred watts per channel,
which is very powerful.

1363
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,986
And on some occasions...

1364
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,236
say, late afternoon, when there's
nobody up here at the park.-.

1365
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,533
I'll take my speakers,
and put 'em outside...

1366
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,698
and turn it up.

1367
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,709
You can hear it.
It goes through the whole valley...

1368
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,828
and you can hear it...

1369
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,331
from miles away.

1370
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,552
<i>N I Electric Guitar Rock: Blaring I</i>

1371
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,460
I think we'll all be
together again.

1372
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:52,295
I think we're gonna live
pretty much like we do here.

1373
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:54,632
I want to be able
to find my pets.

1374
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,464
I don't want 'em dug up
and scattered all over creation.

1375
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,095
I want 'em right where
I know where they are...

1376
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,637
where it's like in the hunting fields
like they've had in this life.

1377
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,676
I believe we'll all be reunited.

1378
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,805
I really do. I believe that
from the bottom of my heart.

1379
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:12,020
She's got me believing that now.
I never believed in it, but-

1380
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,360
Before, but I still do.

1381
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:18,856
'Cause after all, there's your dog,
your dog's dead.

1382
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,484
But where's the thing
that made it move?

1383
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,576
It had to be something,
didn't it?

1384
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:25,822
There's your spirit.
There it is.

1385
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,082
I might be dead,
but I'm not moving.

1386
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,326
And you can't put that
back in 'em.

1387
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,621
But I can take the body
where it'll be with it...

1388
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:37,171
and lay it to rest
for a beautiful thing...

1389
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,215
and it can rest there
or be right around there.

1390
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,762
It'll stay close. it'll stay where he is,
and I'll find it again.

1391
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,976
I really will.

1392
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,561
They'll be with us.

1393
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,181
- I hope she's right.
- I think I'm right.

1394
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,400
In fact,
I almost know I'm right.

1395
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,020
- You'd bet on it?
- Yeah, I'd bet a lot on it.

1396
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,818
My assurance to the pet owner...

1397
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:08,038
that they will be reunited
with their pet...

1398
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:10,499
at some time in the future...

1399
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,960
maybe under
different circumstances...

1400
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,705
and in a different form.

1401
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,877
As remote as this might be...

1402
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,759
and as hard for them
to visualize...

1403
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,346
it still gives them
a degree of hope.
