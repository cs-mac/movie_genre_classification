1
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:13,199
Be honest.

2
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,267
You miss him.

3
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,272
Every day.

4
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:24,776
And so you came up with this...

5
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,845
idea.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,180
The frozen man.

7
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,816
He doesn't age.

8
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:35,485
He doesn't change.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,221
You don't like change.

10
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,359
I'm okay with change.

11
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:46,230
Hon. Please.

12
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,733
You told me about your house.

13
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:53,811
You still have his voice
on the answering machine,

14
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,680
his clothes in the closet.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,968
Can't I miss my husband?

16
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:02,478
Dr. Bird, don't bullshit me.

17
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:05,882
You've been in my seat.

18
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:08,716
If I were sitting here
right now telling you

19
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:12,364
how my husband died 20 years ago
and I haven't touched a thing,

20
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,623
and not only, but I keep this fantasy alive

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,059
that he isn't dead.

22
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:22,497
He's actually frozen in some kind of...

23
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,132
cryogenic chamber.

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,203
He's coming back.

25
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,708
But you see it, right?

26
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:36,844
How you're the one who's frozen?

27
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,748
Tell me about your mother.

28
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:53,226
She died loading the dishwasher.

29
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:58,163
January 2nd, a Thursday. I was five.

30
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,934
We were in the yellow
house on Potsdamer Platz.

31
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,940
This was when Pops was
stationed in Germany.

32
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:11,014
I'm in half pants and a dinosaur shirt

33
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,678
playing with Silly Putty on the floor.

34
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:15,168
Remember how you could
press it into the funnies

35
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,605
in the newspaper and make a copy?

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,568
- "Marmaduke," etcetera.
- (chuckles)

37
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,985
(laughs)

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,920
9:15 in the morning.

39
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,389
It was raining.

40
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:28,893
Then it stopped and the sun came out.

41
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:34,130
And I'm pressing the Silly Putty
into this paper on the floor.

42
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:39,836
This black and white linoleum
in, like, a chevron pattern.

43
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:43,673
And the kitchen is warm from the steam

44
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,109
<i>when you open the dishwasher.</i>

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,748
And she finished the plates,

46
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:51,780
and took out the cutlery basket.

47
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:54,569
(laughs) Did you know they called it that?

48
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:57,019
A cutlery basket?

49
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,855
- No.
- (laughs)

50
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,459
She's unloading the dinner dishes,

51
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:07,161
singing along with the radio.

52
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:09,730
"99 Luftballons."

53
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,700
She had a nice voice.

54
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,836
You spend a lot of time in this memory.

55
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,841
In the past.

56
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,044
I like to think I'm a time traveler.

57
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,082
I go back, back, back.

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,821
But all I can do is... watch.

59
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,726
You see how unhealthy that is,

60
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:43,996
this attachment between you.

61
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,798
Oh... (stammers)

62
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,647
I know why you'd think
that, but we're really...

63
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,436
- The same person.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,737
both: Basically.

65
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:54,206
The way we move and how we...

66
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:57,208
Finish each other's sentences almost.

67
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:58,884
Not that we're... I mean, I know

68
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,614
we're not literally the
same, like, sharing a body.

69
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,450
That'd be...

70
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,385
We're not crazy.

71
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,242
- We just really...
- Really like being together.

72
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:14,691
Or not <i>like,</i> but, um...

73
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:16,526
what's it... who's it hurting?

74
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:20,230
- That's my...
- That's what I wanna know.

75
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.

76
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,008
Didn't you tell me...

77
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,445
how you were the last boy
in your class to mature?

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,513
Your voice dropping.

79
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:40,950
The hair coming in down there.

80
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,019
It's not a race.

81
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,154
What a boy goes through.

82
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:49,924
His physical and emotional growth.

83
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:55,597
What matters is where you end up.

84
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:01,003
Do I seem like less than a man to you now?

85
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:07,674
I'm just trying to help you see the truth.

86
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,978
This constant anger.

87
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:13,187
You feel isolated by the world,

88
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,131
but it's not the world isolating you.

89
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,951
It's you.

90
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,054
Look, I know you're just...

91
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,190
trying to help.

92
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:27,593
But it just doesn't, for
some reason, feel real.

93
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,031
Talk about that.

94
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:36,436
I don't know. There's a...

95
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,638
Something's wrong.

96
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,610
Like a dream, you know?

97
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:49,181
But not an interesting one.

98
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,084
More like the one where
you're folding laundry.

99
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,520
Or eating.

100
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:59,790
Everything seems normal,
but somehow you know.

101
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,863
Okay.

102
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,466
Well.

103
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,735
The old clock on the wall
says it's time for your meds,

104
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,938
so let's pick this up tomorrow.

105
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,707
Okay?

106
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,646
(indistinct chatter)

107
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:39,579

Sydney Barrett, nurse's station.

112
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,984
This is warning number one.

113

115
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:47,066
29 you have, and 14 you have.

116
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:48,435
It's your serve.

117
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,904
Spot check. Arms out.

118
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,407
Do we...

119
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,342
I just...

120
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:57,779
You know I can't stand to be touched.

121
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,211
There's a note in...

122
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,502
PTONOMY: It's just spit, right?

123
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,771
Human spit?

124
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,407
Maybe he ate yogurt.

125
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,076
Like a creamy...

126
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,978
What's he on? Klonopin?

127
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,415
Yeah, Klonopin'll... Or...

128
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,016
Hold the phone.

129
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,754
Yogurt <i>and</i> Klonopin. That'll...

130
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,457
a cocktail.

131
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:52,795
Do you ever wonder what he
was like before this place?

132
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,466
Like, did he have a bank
account or a girlfriend?

133
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:00,369
Maybe he loved dogs.

134
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:03,038
Everybody loves dogs.

135
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,473
Not me.

136
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:10,645
I'm saying, who was he before... this?

137
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,083
Who were you? Who was I?

138
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:17,985
There is no before.

139
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:21,188
Not once the sickness starts.

140
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:24,124
That's the lie, the cruelest joke.

141
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,462
How somehow, with the right
dosage, the right therapy,

142
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:31,565
stand on one leg, touch your nose,

143
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:35,669
we could all go back to... what?

144
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,170
Loving dogs?

145
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,811
20 bucks it breaks
before it hits the floor.

146
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,248
It never breaks.

147
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:50,816
Never say never.

148
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:53,519
Hi.

149
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,354
There's pie at lunch.

150
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,256
I got an inside track.

151
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:02,193
Fish fingers, broccoli florets, and pie.

152
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,695
Cherry.

153
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:08,900
Paul knows this guy in the cafeteria.

154
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:12,836
That's... I know you love that.

155
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,917
Hey, did you guys notice
there's a different door

156
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:19,977
in the south hall?

157
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,646
Different how?

158
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,783
It's like a bedroom door, like from a...

159
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:26,141
David, hey.

160
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,551
It's time for your session.

161
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:40,297
So how are you feeling?

162
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,432
Good, you know.

163
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:47,035
I've been... much clearer actually.

164
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,805
<i>I really feel like
I've found myself here.</i>

165
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,644
(smooth music plays on record)

166
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,414
<i>A rhythm.</i>

167
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,217
<i>A sense of peace.</i>

168
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:06,287
<i>Been reading a lot, painting.</i>

And these issues you used to raise...

173
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,769
feelings of separation,

174
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,971
of difference from the rest of the world?

175
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:28,074
Well, I have somebody now, you know?

176
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:31,812
A relationship, and that... I don't know.

177
00:11:31,847 --> 00:11:35,281

178

179
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,719

have so much more than...

181
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:45,591
Do you ever worry you'll lose it?

182
00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:50,796
I-I used to.

All the time...

184
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:59,203
think about the mirage, or
how this feeling, clarity...

185
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:02,659
how maybe that's just, you know, a symptom

186
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:04,809
of the other side of
the disease kicking in.

187
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,011

- Yes.

188
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:11,749
'Cause people always talk
about the depression side,

189
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:14,012
but it's the... the other side,

190
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:18,789
that invulnerable feeling

191
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:21,692
that's...

192
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,494

Hello, David.

529
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:20,044
Our session's not until the morning.

530
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:22,882

Please.

00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:41,760

00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:44,629
What do you... we're in love.

538
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:50,168
Do you know what love is?

539
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:52,604
A chemical.

540
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:58,443
Electrons in your brain sending signals.

541
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:03,713
Are you familiar with
Ophiocordyceps unilateralis?

542
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,950
It's a fungus that infects ants.

543
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,619
It's amazing, really.

544
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:12,256
The spores take over their
central nervous systems

545
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,824
and force them to climb to a high point,

546
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,061
and then the fungus begins to grow up,

547
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,731
bursting from the tops of their heads

548
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,568
like a branch.

549
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,737
And it kills them, of course.

550
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:33,759
All so it can spray new
spores over the jungle,

551
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:36,278
infecting more ants.

552
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,113
When people say love,
that's what I think of.

553
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,119
A simple "I haven't seen her" was all I...

557
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,764

fucking point of babies?

558
