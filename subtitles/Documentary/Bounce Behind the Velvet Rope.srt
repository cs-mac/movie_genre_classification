00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,244
Open it.

3
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,443
Don't.

4
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:17,844
- We've got to see if -
- I know.

5
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,046
But not just yet.

6
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,240
Let's stay this way for a minute.

7
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:47,437
Phillip, we don't have too much time.

8
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:53,923
It's the darkness that's got you down.
Nobody feels really safe in the dark.

9
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:57,921
Nobody who's ever a child, that is.
I'll open these, alright?

10
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:04,516
There. That's much better.

11
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,122
What a lovely evening.

12
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:22,406
Pity we couldn't have done it with
the curtains open in the bright sunlight.

13
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,039
Well...

14
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,521
We can't have everything, can we?

15
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,326
We did do it in daytime.

16
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,284
Alright now, Phillip?

17
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:35,277
- Yes.
- Good.

18
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:39,565
You better put those away in my
chequebook drawer behind the box.

19
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,838
Now...

20
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,521
It's a museum piece now.

21
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,406
We really should preserve it for posterity,

22
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:08,719
except, it's such good crystal
and I'd hate to break up the set.

23
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:16,442
Out of this,
David Kentley had his last drink.

24
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:20,685
It should have been ginger ale,
or even beer.

25
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:25,477
It was out of character for David
to drink anything as corrupt as whiskey.

26
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,241
Out of character
for him to be murdered, too.

27
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:33,401
Yes, wasn't it? Good Americans
usually die young on the battlefield.

28
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,004
Well, the Davids of this world
merely occupy space,

29
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:43,161
which is why he was
the perfect victim for the perfect murder.

30
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:47,322
'Course,
he was a Harvard undergraduate.

31
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:50,047
That might make it justifiable homicide.

32
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,085
He's dead and we've killed him.
But he's still here.

33
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:57,206
In less than eight hours
he'll be resting at the bottom of a lake.

34
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,358
Meanwhile, he's here.

35
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,960
- What are you doing?
- It's not locked.

36
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:08,200
All the better. It's more dangerous.
And the lock's too old. It won't work.

37
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,279
I wish it would.
I wish we had him out of here.

38
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,597
I wish it were somebody else.

39
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:17,043
It's a trifle late for that, don't you think?

40
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:20,119
Whom would you have preferred,
Kenneth?

41
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,085
I don't know,
I suppose anyone was as good...

42
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,522
or as bad as any other.

43
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:30,157
You, perhaps. You frighten me.

44
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:33,956
You always have,
from that very first day in prep school.

45
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,119
Part of your charm, I suppose.

46
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,283
I'm only kidding, Brandon.

47
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:47,157
I obviously can't take it as well as you,
so I'm turning on you a little.

48
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:52,355
- That's rather foolish, isn't it?
- Yes, very.

49
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:55,599
May I have a drink now?

50
00:06:56,407 --> 00:07:00,480
By all means. This is an occasion.
It calls for champagne.

51
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,877
- Champagne?
- I put some in the icebox.

52
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:06,483
- When did you put it there?
- Just before David arrived.

53
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,207
- You knew it would work.
- Of course.

54
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:12,723
You know I never did anything
unless I did it perfectly.

55
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:15,685
I've always wished
for more artistic talent.

56
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,997
Well, murder can be an art too.

57
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:23,036
The power to kill can be just
as satisfying as the power to create.

58
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:29,043
Phillip, do you realise we've actually
done it, exactly as we planned?

59
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:32,916
And not a single thing has gone wrong.
It was perfect.

60
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:35,476
- Yes.
- An immaculate murder!

61
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:39,162
We've killed for the sake of danger
and for the sake of killing.

62
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:42,717
We're alive, truly and wonderfully alive.

63
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:45,276
Champagne can't equal us,
or the occasion.

64
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:46,880
I'll take it, though.

65
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:48,958
You aren't frightened any more, are you?

66
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,561
Neither of us can have fear.

67
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,763
That's the difference
between us and them.

68
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:56,600
They talk about committing
the perfect crime but don't do it.

69
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01,124
Nobody commits a murder just for...
the experiment of committing it.

70
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,403
Nobody except us.

71
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,486
- You're not frightened still, are you?
- No.

72
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,922
Not even of me?

73
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,955
- No.
- That's good.

74
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,966
You just astound me, as always.

75
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,083
That's even better.

76
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,522
To David, of course.

77
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,565
- Brandon, how did you feel?
- When?

78
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,319
During it.

79
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,284
I don't know, really.

80
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,883
I don't remember
feeling very much of anything,

81
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,525
until his body went limp

82
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,842
and I knew it was over.

83
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:55,523
- And then?
- Then I felt tremendously exhilarated.

84
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,960
H-How did you feel?

85
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,003
Oh, I... I...

86
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:10,197
- You don't think the party's a mistake?
- No, it's the finishing touch to our work.

87
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,927
It's more.
It's the signature of the artists.

88
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,203
Not having it would be like, uh...

89
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,120
Painting the picture and not hanging it?

90
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:20,039
That's not a good choice of words.

91
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,596
It may end up too choice,
thanks to the party.

92
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,998
Oh, rot. This party will be
the most exciting ever given.

93
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,442
- With these people?
- Oh, they're a dull crew.

94
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:32,919
The Kentleys couldn't be duller if
they tried, but we did have to have them.

95
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:36,682
After all,
they are David's mother and father.

96
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,122
That doesn't make them
any easier to talk to.

97
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,120
Don't worry.
Janet'll be buttering them up, poor girl.

98
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:45,404
She's banked everything
on hooking David.

99
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,355
Somehow, I don't think
she's going to succeed.

100
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:53,315
- Do you?
- No, somehow I don't.

101
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,047
Well, she can switch back
to Kenneth tonight.

102
00:09:56,207 --> 00:10:01,884
You must admit, it was most considerate
of me in view of recent events to...

103
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,325
- Phillip?
- What?

104
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,478
- Take the other one.
- What for?

105
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:14,764
Never mind. Come with me.

106
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:19,284
- What's this all about?
- You'll see. It's brilliant.

107
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,843
What the devil are you doing?

108

Making our work of art a masterpiece.

109
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:35,284
- Brandon, you're going too far.
- Why? What do you mean?

110
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:39,599
I just thought it'd be nice
to have supper in here...

111
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,166

112
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,877
Isn't it a good idea?

113
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:50,486
Well, at least this way
no one will try to open it.

114
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,320
I don't think you appreciate me, Phillip.

115

I'm beginning to, Brandon.

116
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,962
Come on, we don't have much time.
Mrs Wilson will be back soon.

117
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:01,880
Did you forget to borrow her key?
I might've known -

118
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,845
I didn't forget. I have her key.

119
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:07,316
- Oh, good.
- How are you going to explain this?

120
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:09,955
- I'm not.
- We've got to have some excuse.

121
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,877
- We can't leave our guest alone.
- We must have an excuse for the others.

Let me think.

123
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:26,598
Really, you get much too upset
much too easily, Phillip.

124
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:30,157
We have a very simple excuse

126
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,281
What are you worrying about, Phillip?

127
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:39,041
Mr Kentley's coming
mainly to look at books.

128
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,801
What could be better than having them
on the dining room table

can easily get at them.

What is it?

00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:34,239
- Well, go on, yank it out.
- I can't.

139
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:36,637
If Mrs Wilson were here,
she'd yank it out for you.

140
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,800
A stupid display like that in front of
others will be as good as a confession.

Take these and get ahold of yourself.

We agreed there was only one crime we
could commit, that of making a mistake.

146

- Being weak is a mistake.
- Because it's being human?

It's just as well.
We didn't expect you back until now.

But I tell ya, the next time
we give a party, I'm only going to -

156
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,958
Good evening, Mrs Wilson.

157
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,722
What, may I ask,
is happening to my table?

158
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,323
We're just moving the things in here.

159
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,478
Well...

160
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,800
I personally
thought my table was quite lovely.

161
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:51,161
Oh, it was quite lovely.

162
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:56,720
But Mr Kentley is coming to look
at these old books I had in the chest.

163
00:13:56,887 --> 00:14:01,677
You wouldn't want the poor old man
to have to get on his knees to see them?

164
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:03,644
Well, I think it looks downright peculiar.

165
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,206
- Peculiar?
- Very.

166
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,961
Particularly those candlesticks.
They don't belong there at all.

167
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,405
On the contrary, I think they suggest a...
a ceremonial altar,

168
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,479
which you can heap with the foods
for our sacrificial feast.

169
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,160
Hmph, heap is right.

170
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:20,319
Isn't enough room for me to set
things out properly, is there, Mr Phillip?

171
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:21,602
Oh, you can make it do.

172
00:14:21,767 --> 00:14:23,519
You two'll be the death of me.
What's to be done with the books?

173
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,484
We'll lay them out
on the dining room table.

174
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,683
A crazy idea, if you ask me.

175
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,156
Well, I have too much to do
to discuss this thoroughly, dear.

176
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,636
I still think it's peculiar.

177
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:34,718
- What on earth is the matter?
- I was sure she'd notice.

178
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,957
- Notice what?
- The rope, of course.

179
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,116
Brandon, we've got to hide it.

180
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,686
- Why?
- Why?

181
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,442
Yes, why? It's only a piece of rope,
an ordinary household article.

182
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,677
Why hide it?

183
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:48,486
It belongs in the kitchen drawer.

184
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:07,921
- Mrs Wilson?
- Yes?

185
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,600
There's champagne in the icebox.

186
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,361
- We're not giving them champagne?
- We are.

187
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:16,281
Oh, it's going to be that kind of party.
I'd better doll up a little.

188
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,359
We only serve champagne
at Mr Cadell's on very high occasions.

189
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:23,202
Matter of fact, he and I once had
a glass together on my birthday.

190
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,076
Tonight, Mrs Wilson, you'll have
an opportunity to renew that romance.

191
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:30,045
May I? Mr Cadell's coming.

192
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:33,882
Oh, my. Oh, Mr Cadell is terribly nice.

193
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:37,323
- Rupert's coming?
- Yes, I thought I told you.

194
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,126
No, you didn't.

195
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,122
Some people say he's a little peculiar,
but I always thi...

196
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,755
Well, you might let me finish.

197
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,680
I thought you liked Rupert.

198
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,042
- I do.
- Well, then?

199
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:56,916
Of all the people on this Earth, Rupert
Cadell is the one man likely to suspect.

200
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,124
He's the one man who might appreciate
this from our angle, the artistic one.

201
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,676
- That's what's exciting.
- I'm glad it excites you. It frightens me.

202
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,361
I suggest you keep your voice down.

203
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,997
It would have been too easy
with the others, Phillip, and too dull.

204
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:13,285
As for Rupert,
I once thought of inviting him to join us.

205
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:16,484
- Why didn't you? The more the merrier.
- He hasn't the nerve.

206
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:18,558
Oh, intellectually,
he could've come along. He's brilliant.

207
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,558
But he's a little too fastidious.

208
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:23,480
He could've invented and admired
but he never could have acted.

209
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,366
That's where we're superior.
We have courage. Rupert doesn't.

210
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,156
Mr Cadell got a bad leg in the war for his
courage. You've got your sleeve in the celery.

211
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:35,002
[ Door Buzzer ]
They're here. Are we ready?

212
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,486
As ready as we'll ever be.

213
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,480
Don't you be so busy
at that piano that you don't eat.

214
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:40,875
You're getting too thin.

215
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,880
And don't you let them gobble up
that pâté before you have any.

216
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:47,198
Let's hope it's a success. Oh, my tray.

217
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,483
Take it in the kitchen.
I'll answer the door.

218
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:53,322
There wouldn't be this last minute
hustle bustle if you'd kept my table...

219
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:56,718
Now the fun begins.

220
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,478
- <i>Hello</i>, <i>come in.</i>
<i>[ Kenneth ]</i> - <i>How are you</i>, <i>Brandon?</i>

221
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,842
- <i>Fine. Just put your hat there.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

222
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,326
<i>It's been quite a while.</i>

223
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:11,515
<i>Yes</i>, <i>that's why I sounded so stupid</i>
<i>on the phone. Surprised</i>, <i>I guess.</i>

224
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:14,637
- Hello, Kenneth. Good to see you.
- You too.

225
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:17,879
- Been up to much lately?
- Oh, nothing to speak of. You?

226
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:22,677
Trying to get ready for exams. I have
to start cramming before everyone else.

227
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,122
- Am I the first?
- You are.

228
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,164
Why is it I'm always too early
at parties?

229
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,158
Probably because you're always on time.

230
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,682
Mrs Wilson, champagne.

231
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:32,836
Oh.

232
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,044
It... It isn't someone's birthday, is it?

233
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:39,756
Don't look so worried, Kenneth.
It's really almost the opposite.

234
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:40,723
The opposite?

235
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,880
Phillip's bidding the world a temporary
farewell. I'm driving him to Connecticut.

236
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,082
Oh. Where are you going?

237
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,681
To Brandon's mother's place
for a few weeks.

238
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,917
- I'm to be locked up.
- What?

239
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,317
To make sure he practices
six hours a day.

240
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,604
- I've finally wrangled a debut for him.
- Town Hall, at that.

241
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,883
That's wonderful.
I hope you knock 'em dead.

242
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,366
Thank you.

243
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:03,166
Mmm. Most decorative.

244
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,197
Think so?

245
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,597
- Hey.
- What is it?

246
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,883
- I feel pretty honoured.
- Oh, why?

247
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,481
Well, it looks like
a pretty small farewell party.

248
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,559
Well, we're really killing two birds
with one stone.

249
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,558
The party's also for Mr Kentley.

250
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,604
- David's father?
- Yes.

251
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,203
Oh. Is... David going to be here?

252
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,359
- Of course.
- Who else is coming?

253
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,279
No one you don't know,
if that's what's bothering you.

254
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:32,723
- The Kentleys, Janet Walker -
- Janet?

255
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,084
Yes. I thought you'd be glad to see her.

256
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:38,196
Won't you be?

257
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,484
Brandon, Janet and I are all washed up.

258
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,276
- Didn't you know?
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

259
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,482
Well, you knew, Phillip?

260
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:50,845
Oh, I'd heard vague rumours, but I never
pay attention to that sort of thing.

261
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,281
I wish you had. [ Door Buzzer ]

262
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:56,201
- Why?
- Well, Janet and David are -

263
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,244
<i>[ Janet ] Hello</i>, <i>Mrs Wilson.</i>

264
00:18:58,407 --> 00:18:59,556
- May I?
- Help yourself.

265
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:04,323
Cheer up. I have a feeling your chances
with the lady are better than you think.

266
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:07,160
- What do you mean?
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Janet.</i>

267
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,721
Hello, ducks. Angel!

268
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,957
Be careful of my hair. It took hours.

269
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:17,279
- You smell dreamy. What is it?
- That swill you gave me last Christmas.

270
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,519
- I knew I had good taste.
- You do. You look lovely.

271
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,201
I won't by the time it's all paid for.

272
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,835
Was that funny?
I never know when I'm being funny.

273
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,680
Whenever I try to be,
I lay the bomb of all time.

274
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,281
- Phillip, sweet.
- Hello.

275
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,915
What's this rumour
I hear about you and Town Hall?

276
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:37,841
I bet you're going to play a foul trick
on all of us and become...

277
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:38,996
horribly famous.

278
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:42,204
I believe you've met.

279
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,079
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Jan.

280
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:49,876
That was fascinating, wasn't it?
I seem to have run down.

281
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,720
What would you say
to some champagne?

282
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,843
"Hello, champagne".

283
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,044
You see what I mean
about trying to be funny?

284
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,765
- How've you been, Ken?
- Fine, thanks.

285
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:01,599
- How's the new job?
- What are you doing?

286
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,442
Writing that same dreary column
on how to keep the body beautiful.

287
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:09,839
- For whom this time?
- An untidy little magazine called Allure.

288
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,725
Thanks, chum.

289
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:18,797
- Oh, isn't that painting new?
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Yes it is. Do you like it?</i>

290
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,164
- Well, what is it?
- New Young American Primitive.

291
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,885
I have a new young American sister.

292
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:27,039
She's three
and her stuff is really primitive.

293
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>[ Laughing ]</i>
[ Janet quietly ] - You dirty dog.

294
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:33,284
[ Brandon quietly ] - Why?
- Didn't I notice another one in the foyer?

295
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:36,280
I don't think so. Which?

296
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,486
This.

297
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,718
- I could really strangle you, Brandon.
- What have I done now?

298
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,720
At times, your sense of humour
is a little too malicious, chum.

299
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:52,445
What are you chattering about?

300
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,802
- Why did you invite Kenneth?
- Well, why not?

301
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,685
You know perfectly well why not.

302
00:20:56,847 --> 00:21:00,362
We called it quits ages ago and I'm
practically engaged to his best friend.

303
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,916
- David?
- Yes, David.

304
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,964
Which makes everything
just ginger-peachy.

305
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:10,042
I'm terribly sorry, but it is difficult
trying to keep up with your romances.

306
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,244
After me came Kenneth,
and now it's David.

307
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:16,797
Why the switch
from Kenneth to David, anyway?

308
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:21,802
- Obviously, I think he's nicer.
- Well, he's certainly richer.

309
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:25,357
That's a new low even for you, chum.

310
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,200
<i>[ Kenneth ]</i> - <i>Gave me a 'D' in conduct.</i>
<i>[ Phillip ]</i> - <i>How's your drink doing?</i>

311
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:32,645
How many years has it been since I said,
'Oh, it tickles'? And don't you tell me.

312
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:35,958
- I hear Rupert's coming.
- He was invited, but you never know.

313
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,243
- I hope he does. How is he?
- Who is he?

314
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:41,797
Rupert Cadell
was our housemaster in prep school.

315
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,117
Housemaster for you three little dears?

316
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:48,121
Four little dears.
He tried valiantly to teach David, too.

317
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,720
Rupert's a publisher now, isn't he?

318
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:51,718
Successful? Maybe he can give me a job.

319
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:55,482
Rupert only publishes books he likes,
usually philosophy.

320
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh. Small print, big words, no sales.

321
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,127
- Right.
- Rupert's extremely radical.

322
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,437
Do you know that he selects
his books on the assumption that

323
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:06,565
people not only can read
but actually can think.

324
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,400
- Curious fellow, but I like him.
- You always did.

325
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,559
Golly, those bull sessions you
and Rupert used to have in school.

326
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,366
Brandon would sit up till all hours
at the master's feet.

327
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,280
Brandon at someone's feet!
Who is this Rupert?

328
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:21,837
- He used to tell you the weirdest things.
- Really? What sort of things?

329
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:27,479
I suppose Kenneth means Rupert's
impatience with social conventions.

330
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:32,675
For example, he thinks murder
is a crime for most men, but -

331
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,758
- A privilege for the few.
- Yes.

332
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,765
It's alright, Mrs Wilson,
I'll answer the door.

333
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,999
- Mr Kentley. So glad you could come.
- Thank you, Brandon.

334
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,965
Mrs Kentley isn't well, so I took
the liberty of bringing my sister-in-law,

335
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:49,924
Mrs Atwater, who's staying with us.

336
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:53,079
- Delighted to have you.
- Delighted to come, dear boy.

337
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,445
I've been in New York two weeks.
Alice has been ill almost the whole time.

338
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,599
Henry is forever cataloging his library.

339
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:03,679
Oh, no, Anita. Occasionally,
I even read one of my books.

340
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:07,601
But I'm on a visit.
This is just my second party.

341
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,884
- I suppose it's only fair -
- Let me take your things.

342
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,117
- I'm sorry to hear Mrs Kentley's so ill.
- Oh, it's just a cold.

343
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:15,721
Colds can be very dangerous
this time of the year.

344
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:18,765
I hope Mrs Kentley's staying
in bed with lots of fruit juice.

345
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,804
- She is, thank you.
- Well, that'll do the trick.

346
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:25,119
Colds dangerous, in this heat?
I don't understand that at all.

347
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,847
Exactly two years ago
this summer I had one myself.

348
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,077
I was down for three weeks.
The doctors -

349
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,239
Excuse me. This way, Mrs Atwater.

350
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,045
<i>[ Janet ] ...particularly at parties.</i>

351
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,277
<i>[ Kenneth ] This is over my head.</i>

352
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:38,766
David! <i>[ Glass Crunching ]</i>

353
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:40,758
<i>[ Brandon ]</i>
<i>Uh</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>you've made a mistake.</i>

354
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,599
<i>This is Kenneth Lawrence.</i>

355
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:43,961
<i>[ Mrs Atwater ] Oh</i>, <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

356
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,640
<i>[ Henry ] That's alright</i>, <i>Anita.</i>

357
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:50,244
<i>Kenneth is often mistaken for David</i>
<i>even by people who aren't nearsighted.</i>

358
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,241
<i>We haven't had much opportunity to</i>
<i>observe the resemblance lately</i>, <i>my boy.</i>

359
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,080
- Haven't been studying, have you?
- I've been trying to, sir.

360
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,477
Oh, dear.
The resemblance is only physical.

361
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,922
I believe you both know Miss Walker.

362
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:03,645
Janet, my dear.

363
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:07,402
I finished working out your horoscope
just before we came.

364
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,877
- Oh, tell.
- The stars are very kind.

365
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:14,005
They indicate a marriage very soon.

366
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:18,445
To a tall, fair-haired young man
with a very lovely father.

367
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,963
- Oh, Anita, I told you that a week ago.
- Oh, well, I suppose you did.

368
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,846
- But the stars confirm it.
- Wonderful.

369
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,077
<i>[ Brandon ] Mrs Atwater</i>,
<i>may I present Mr Phillip Morgan?</i>

370
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,078
- How do you do?
- Oh, you've hurt your hand.

371
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,317
- Oh, it's nothing, just a little cut.
- What happened?

372
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,047
Nothing. The glass was cracked
and it broke. That's all.

373
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,324
- May I get you some champagne?
- Oh, I should adore some.

374
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:40,285
Daddy used to have a glass
every morning at eleven.

375
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,803
But of course, Henry doesn't like it.

376
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:45,640
Mr Kentley, may I get you some?

377
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:48,605
I'd prefer a little Scotch
with a lot of water, if you don't mind.

378
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:51,076
Is David here?

379
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,080
I expected him to come with you.

380
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,238
He called and said
that he'd meet us here.

381
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,875
- Where did he call from?
- Our maid spoke to him.

382
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,119
He was at the club,
studying for his examinations...

383
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,278
In tennis.

384
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:08,044
The trouble with David is, he doesn't
have to study. He's too bright.

385
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,722
- David does alright, very much so.
- Thank you.

386
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:16,119
- How's Mrs Kentley?
- As usual. It's a cold this time.

387
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,404
I hope David arrives soon.
She wants him to call her.

388
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,603
David's her only child, Mr Kentley.

389
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:25,043
He's my only child too,
but I'm willing to let him grow up.

390
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,198
Why don't I call
and tell her he's been detained.

391
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,518
- No, you mustn't pamper her.
- David might have stopped to see her.

392
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,359
- Mr Kentley?
- May I use the phone?

393
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,483
- Of course. It's in the bedroom.
- How cosy.

394
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:37,764
- Aren't you ready for another?
- I will be.

395
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,157
I am, thank you.

396
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:43,966
<i>[ Henry ] What a charming young man.</i>
<i>I wish David saw more of him.</i>

397
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,642
<i>[ Janet ] Yes. I'll go and call.</i>

398
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,275
Kenneth,
there's too much air in your glass.

399
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,166
- Mine's fine, thanks.
- Would you mind taking this in to Janet?

400
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:55,079
Sure. Why?

401
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:59,604
No particular reason. I thought you'd like
to take it to her. She's in the bedroom.

402
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,486
- Then you'd like David to walk in.
- No, that'd be too much of a shock.

403
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:06,559
<i>[ Atwater ]</i> - <i>When were you born?</i>
<i>[ Phillip ]</i> - <i>July 14.</i>

404
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:10,515
- <i>Can you really tell my future from that?</i>
- I'm only an amateur astrologer.

405
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:13,155
- I'm sure you're very good.
- I do my best.

406
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:16,125
I suppose you want to know
if your concert will be a success.

407
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:19,165
- Yes, I do.
- Let me see now.

408
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,399
You were born on the 14th of July.

409
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,525
You're Cancer, the crab.
You're a moon child.

410
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:29,885
You're very much influenced
by the moon. May I see your hand?

411
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,766
You don't remember the hour
of your birth, by any chance?

412
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,246
No.

413
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,922
Good fingers, strong, artistic.

414
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,202
What about the concert?

415
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,837
These hands will bring you great fame.

416
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,484
<i>[ Henry ] Well</i>, <i>I consider myself</i>
<i>a very fortunate man today.</i>

417
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,956
- <i>I'm on hand for the grand opening.</i>
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Of what?</i>

418
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:59,119
- <i>Of your collection</i>, <i>so to speak.</i>
- <i>Oh yes</i>, <i>of course.</i>

419
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,847
<i>[ Atwater ]</i>
<i>Are you going to play? How lovely.</i>

420
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,805
<i>[ Janet ]</i> - <i>Your wife sends her love.</i>
<i>[ Henry ]</i> - <i>David wasn't there?</i>

421
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:10,406
<i>No. He'll probably be here</i>
<i>in a minute</i>, <i>though.</i>

422
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,603
- Your touch has improved, Phillip.
- Rupert!

423
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:31,759
I... I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

424
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,883
You know me better than that.

425
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,800
Mrs Atwater,
may I present Mr Rupert Cadell.

426
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:38,195
- Delighted.
- Thank you.

427
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,323
- Mr Kentley.
- How do you do, Mr Kentley?

428
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,603
Rupert Cadell,
the housemaster at Somerville?

429
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,725
- I used to be.
- You must have taught my son, David.

430
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:48,242
- You flatter me. How do you do?
- Hello, chum.

431
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:50,477
- Oh, Miss Walker.
- How'd you know?

432
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:53,161
- Brandon spoke of you.
- Did he do me justice?

433
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:56,524
Do you deserve justice? Well!

434
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,360
Well, little Kenneth Lawrence,
how you've grown.

435
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:03,042
- Hello, er...
- Kenneth, school's out. You can say it.

436
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:06,119
Rupert, you're the same as ever.
It's awfully good to see you again.

437
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,960
- Why?
- Uh, well...

438
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:12,278
Don't mind me.
Very pleased to see you again.

439
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,280
And that bears a curious
resemblance to champagne.

440
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,597
- It is.
- Very good champagne.

441
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,327
- What's the occasion?
- I told you on the phone.

442
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:24,605
It began as a little party for Mr Kentley
so he could look over the first editions.

443
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,803
Then it turned out Phillip
and I were going to the country -

444
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,639
Yes, you told me that too, Brandon.

445
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,035
- Did I?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,199
Well, I thought I'd make it
sort of a farewell for Phillip.

447
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,198
- Therefore, champagne.
- Yes.

448
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:38,245
- I see.
- Well, it's true.

449
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:41,319
You always did stutter
when you were excited.

450
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,160
Well, I-I guess I'm always excited
when I give a party.

451
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:45,840
- Really?
- <i>Mr Cadell.</i>

452
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:48,441
Oh, Mrs Wilson.

453
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:50,882
Well, what have we here?

454
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:52,799
[ Whispering ]
I got that special pâté you like.

455
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,798
[ Whispering ] - I don't like it anymore.
- Oh, no!

456
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,844
No, I'm just teasing, just teasing.

457
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:00,317
- You're awful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

458
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:02,159
You'd better get along with the carving.

459
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,443
The rest of the things'll be here
in two shakes.

460
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,598
Oh, Mr Brandon, I found it.

461
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,281
I haven't the least notion
what it was she lost.

462
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,166
Wonderful Mrs Wilson.

463
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,443
I may marry her.

464
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:17,041
It looks heavenly.
I hope David gets here soon.

465
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,675
- Yes, where is David?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

466
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:22,077
But he's so late,
Mr Kentley's getting annoyed.

467
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:25,284
- And you?
- Me? I'm hungry?

468
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,642
Brandon, exactly what is this?

469
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,958
- A cassone I got in Italy.
- No, I mean why are we eating off it?

470
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:34,324
Oh, I've turned
the dining room into a library.

471
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,557
Trust you to find a new use
for a chest.

472
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:40,686
One was always turning up in the
bedtime stories he told in prep school.

473
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:45,238
"The Mistletoe Bough",
that was your favourite tale, wasn't it?

474
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:48,683
- What was that one about?
- I don't quite remember how it started.

475
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,281
- It was about a lovely, young girl -
- She was a bride-to-be.

476
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:54,166
On her wedding day,
she playfully hid herself in a chest.

477
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:57,285
- Yes, that's right.
- Unfortunately, it had a spring lock.

478
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,802
Fifty years later,
they found her skeleton.

479
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,164
- I don't think I'll get that playful.
- Would you all please help yourselves?

480
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,797
Talking of skeletons, have you seen
that new thing at the Strand?

481
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,197
- Yes, I adored it.
- Did you? Good.

482
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:12,439
I didn't like the new girl much.
Definitely Scorpio.

483
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:15,360
No, I didn't like her either,
but her clothes were fabulous.

484
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,882
- Simply divine!
- Absolute heaven!

485
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,562
- I must see it.
- I have a passion for James Mason.

486
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:23,797
- Is he good?
- Absolutely terrific.

487
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:27,482
So attractively sinister!
Taurus, the bull, you know.

488
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,126
- Very obstinate.
- Really?

489
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,845
But I have a confession to make.

490
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:34,761
Do you know, I think I like Mason
as much as Errol Flynn?

491
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:38,442
- I'll take Cary Grant, myself.
- Oh, so will I.

492
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:41,758
Capricorn, the goat. He leaps, divine!

493
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,679
- So much "oomph".
- Yes.

494
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:47,999
- Absolutely.
- He was thrilling with Bergman.

495
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:51,318
What was it called?
"Something of the something'".

496
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:55,082
No, that's the other one.
This was just plain "Something".

497
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:57,283
You know, it was sort of, you know.

498
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:58,846
It was right on the tip of my tongue.

499
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:02,397
Mine too. It was just plain
"Something" I'm sure. I adored it.

500
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,286
- And Bergman!
- She's the Virgo type!

501
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,076
- Like all these, you know.
- Oh, I think she's lovely.

502
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:13,126
I once went to the movies.
I saw Mary Pickford.

503
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:16,120
I was mad about her!
Didn't you love her?

504
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:18,278
Well, the Virgo type, like all of these.

505
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:21,405
- What did you see her in?
- I don't quite recall.

506
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:24,001
"The Something Something".

507
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:28,001
Or was it just plain "'Something"?
Something rather like that.

508
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:30,727
I don't believe you ever went.

509
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:36,839
If I were you, I'd go easy
on the pâté, dear - calories.

510
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:39,760
Phillip,
would you mind helping Mrs Atwater?

511
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:42,566
I'd be glad to. Sit down, Mrs Atwater.
I'll bring it to you.

512
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,285
Thank you so much, dear boy.

513
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,120
I must apologise for David.
I can't think what's keeping him.

514
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:49,323
He's only in town for the weekend
and David is very popular.

515
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:55,720
- Here, let me help. White or dark?
- A little of both on this for Mrs Atwater.

516
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:58,720
- What about you?
- I don't eat it.

517
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,321
How queer! I never heard of anyone
who didn't eat chicken.

518
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,559
Did you, Brandon? Oh, you probably did.

519
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,605
- Why don't you eat it, Phillip?
- I just don't.

520
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:08,836
There must be a reason.

521
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,283
Freud says there's a reason
for everything, even me.

522
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,642
There's no reason, Janet.

523
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,082
As I remember,
you have a very funny reason.

524
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:18,521
- Doesn't he, Brandon?
- Yes.

525
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,679
- I knew there had to be one. What is it?
- It's nothing too much.

526
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:24,361
<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>It's fascinating.</i>
<i>[ Janet ]</i> - <i>Come on</i>, <i>Brandon</i>, <i>please.</i>

527
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,803
Well, it happened about
three years ago in Connecticut.

528
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:30,242
Mother has a place there, you know.

529
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:34,082
We were going to have chicken
so we walked over to the farm.

530
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:36,920
It was a lovely
Sunday morning in late Spring.

531
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:39,920
Across the valley,
the church bells were ringing.

532
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:43,921
In the yard, Phillip was doing likewise
to the necks of two or three chickens.

533
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,122
Oh, dear!

534
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:47,960
It was a task he usually
performed very competently.

535
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:52,325
But on this particular morning, his touch
was, perhaps, a trifle too delicate.

536
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,559
Because one of the subjects
for our dinner table suddenly rebelled.

537
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:57,877
- Like Lazarus, he rose -
- That's a lie!

538
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,559
<i>[ Phillip ] That's not true.</i>

539
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,683
<i>I never strangled a chicken in my life!</i>
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Now look here</i>, <i>Phillip</i> -

540
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:07,361
<i>[ Phillip ] I never strangled a chicken</i>,
<i>and you know it.</i>

541
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:11,042
<i>[ Janet Laughing ] Forgive me</i>,
<i>but it just seemed very funny</i>,

542
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:14,517
<i>you two being so intense</i>
<i>about an old</i>, <i>dead chicken.</i>

543
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:17,645
<i>[ Brandon ] Sorry.</i>
<i>We were ridiculous and very rude.</i>

544
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:20,526
<i>I apologise for both of us and the story.</i>

545
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,678
Well!

546
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,601
- Is it all over?
- I'm afraid so, Rupert.

547
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,280
Oh, what a pity.

548
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:31,962
In a moment, you might have strangled
each other instead of a chicken.

549
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:35,722
<i>[ Atwater ]</i> - <i>Mr Cadell</i>, <i>really.</i>
- But a man's honour was at stake.

550
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:39,084
And personally, I think a chicken
is as good a reason for murder

551
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:42,239
as a blonde, a mattress full of dollar bills,

552
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:46,446
or any of the customary,
unimaginative reasons.

553
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,963
Now, you don't really approve
of murder, Rupert, if I may.

554
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,085
You may, and I do.
Think of the problems it would solve -

555
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:58,082
unemployment, poverty,
standing in line for theatre tickets.

556
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,761
I must say,
I've had a perfectly dreadful time

557
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:03,964
getting tickets for that new musical,
what's it called?

558
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,085
- You know.
- "Something" with what's-her-name?

559
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:11,081
My dear Mrs Atwater,
careful application of the trigger finger

560
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:14,205
and a pair of seats in the first row
is yours for the shooting.

561
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:17,837
And have you had any difficulty getting
into our velvet rope restaurants?

562
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:20,362
- Frightful!
- A very simple matter.

563
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,518
A flick of the knife, madam,

564
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,723
and if you'll kindly step this way...

565
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,436
Oh, no, step over the head waiter's body.

566
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:30,040
Thank you, and here's your table.

567
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:32,596
<i>[ Janet laughing ]</i>
<i>Rupert</i>, <i>you're the end.</i>

568
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,917
<i>[ Kenneth ] There's a hotel clerk</i>
<i>I could cheerfully flick a knife at.</i>

569
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:39,126
Oh, no, sorry. Knives may not
be used on hotel employees.

570
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:43,599
They are in the
"death by slow torture" category,

571
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:47,646
along with bird lovers,
small children and tap-dancers.

572
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:51,117
Landlords, of course, are another matter.
You seeking an apartment?

573
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,517
Call on our Miss Sash Weight

574
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:55,598
of the blunt instrument department.

575
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,201
What a divine idea!

576
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,439
If it suits your purpose, merely...

577
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:05,276
- But we'd all be murdering each other.
- Oh no. Oh no.

578
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:09,884
After all, murder is, or should be, an art.

579
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:13,164
Not one of the seven lively, perhaps,
but an art, nevertheless.

580
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:17,684
As such, the privilege of
committing it should be reserved

581
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:21,157
<i>for those few who</i>
<i>are really superior individuals.</i>

582
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,842
And the victims - inferior beings
whose lives are unimportant anyway.

583
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,122
<i>[ Rupert ] Obviously.</i>

584
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,357
<i>Now mind you</i>,
<i>I don't hold with the extremists</i>

585
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,246
who feel there should be open season
for murder all year round.

586
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:34,877
No, personally, I would prefer to have...

587
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,117
"Cut a Throat Week".

588
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:40,199
Or "Strangulation Day".

589
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,879
Probably a symptom
of approaching senility,

590
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:47,484
but I must confess I really don't
appreciate this morbid humour.

591
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:51,037
- The humour was unintentional.
- You're not serious about these theories.

592
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:53,084
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Of course he is.</i>
- You're both pulling my leg.

593
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:54,646
No. Why do you think that?

594
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:59,722
The notion that murder is an art
which superior beings should practice -

595
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:01,798
<i>[ Rupert ] In season!</i>

596
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:05,755
- Now I know you're not serious.
<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>I'm a very serious fellow.</i>

597
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,839
Then may I ask who is to decide
if a human being is inferior,

598
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:10,884
and is therefore
a suitable victim for murder?

599
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:15,802
- The privileged few who commit it.
- And just who might they be?

600
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,959
Oh, myself, Phillip...

601
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:21,524
possibly Rupert.

602
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,803
<i>[ Rupert ] I'm sorry</i>, <i>Kenneth</i>, <i>you're out.</i>

603
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:26,242
- Gentlemen, I'm serious.
- And so are we, Mr Kentley.

604
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,558
The few are those men of such
intellectual and cultural superiority

605
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:32,958
that they're above
the traditional moral concepts.

606
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:36,324
Good and evil, right and wrong were
invented for the ordinary average man,

607
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,920
the inferior man, because he needs them.

608
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:40,078
So you agree with Nietzsche
and his theory of the superman.

609
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:41,965
- Yes, I do.
- So did Hitler.

610
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,038
Hitler was a paranoid savage.

611
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:47,244
His supermen, all fascist supermen
were brainless murderers.

612
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:48,806
I'd hang any who were left.

613
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:52,482
But then, you see,
I'd hang them first for being stupid.

614
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:56,083
I'd hang all incompetents and fools.
There are far too many in the world.

615
00:36:56,247 --> 00:37:00,684
Then hang me. I must be stupid, because
I don't know if you're serious or not.

616
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,236
In any case,
I'd rather not hear any more of your,

617
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:05,762
forgive me, contempt, for humanity,

618
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,236
and for the standards of a world
that I believe is civilised.

619
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:09,522
- Civilised?
- Yes.

620
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,757
Perhaps what is called
"Civilisation" is hypocrisy.

621
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:16,398
<i>Well</i>, <i>I'm sure Rupert</i>, <i>fortunately</i>,
<i>has the intelligence and imagination</i> -

622
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:22,085
<i>[ Kentley ] Please</i>, <i>Brandon</i>,
<i>we've had had just about enough.</i>

623
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:25,319
Phillip, where did you put those books
you set out for Mr Kentley?

624
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:29,241
- I'd like to see them myself, if I may.
<i>[ Phillip ]</i> - <i>They're in the dining room.</i>

625
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:31,762
Mr Kentley, wouldn't you
like to see the books now?

626
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:33,997
I apologise, sir.

627
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,806
Again, I'm afraid
I let myself get carried away.

628
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:39,481
Oh, that's quite alright, my boy.

629
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:42,366
I think it's a good collection,
the first editions, I mean.

630
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,280
Yes, I'd like to see them.
May I use the telephone first?

631
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:48,280
I'd like to talk to my wife.
She may have some word of David.

632
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:51,564
<i>[ Phillip ]</i> - <i>Of course</i>, <i>it's this way.</i>
<i>[ Atwater ]</i> - <i>Oh</i>, <i>dear</i>, <i>oh</i>, <i>dear</i> -

633
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,037
- Uh, Brandon?
- Yes.

634
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,165
You were pushing your point rather hard.

635
00:37:58,327 --> 00:38:01,797
You aren't planning to do away with
a few inferiors, by any chance?

636
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:05,755
- I'm a creature of whim. Who knows?
- I see.

637
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:07,758
<i>[ Janet ]</i>
<i>I think he's definitely Scorpio.</i>

638
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:11,124
Uh, Mrs Atwater,
wouldn't you like to see the books?

639
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:13,039
Oh, I'd love it.

640
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,279
Do you know, when I was a girl,
I used to read quite a bit.

641
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:19,598
Oh, we all do strange things
in our childhood.

642
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:25,921
Kenneth, why don't you switch on
the radio or play some records.

643
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:29,477
Atmospheric music goes a long way.

644
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,485
He is such a sly, little devil, isn't he?

645
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:37,684
[ Record ] Bringing us back together
with sweet music.

646
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,805
Don't let it get you.
He's always doing something like this.

647
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,037
- I'm going in the other room.
- To see the books?

648
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,402
No, to let Brandon see me.

649
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,206
- Do you care what he thinks?
- I know what he thinks.

650
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,246
He thinks I threw you over because
David has a bigger bank account.

651
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,238
Then, why do you go?

652
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:55,726
Because...

653
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,358
Because I'm embarrassed
at being here with you.

654
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,404
Oh, Janet!

655
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,080
Never thought I could be, did you?

656
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:04,885
Honestly?

657
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,446
No.

658
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:10,202
Well, I am and I don't like it one bit.

659
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:13,279
I should think you'd have the decency
to be embarrassed yourself.

660
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:15,756
- Why?
- Well...

661
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:19,124
You threw me over, chum, remember?

662
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:23,200
My, wouldn't friend Brandon
love to know that?

663
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,518
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm just thinking.

664
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:31,077
- What about?
- Female vanity.

665
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,637
Well, I'm also embarrassed because...

666
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,126
Go on.

667
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,243
Well, you and David
used to be such good friends.

668
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:41,921
You're not now and it's my fault.

669
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:44,396
- I'm such an idiot girl.
- No, you're not.

670
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:47,957
Then I'm certainly giving
a good imitation of one.

671
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:51,483
Why must I try and be so smart
with everyone but David?

672
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:54,923
Don't you kid with David too?

673
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:58,523
I relax with David, thanks to you.

674
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,078
- To me?
- Yes.

675
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:05,762
That... That grim Sunday at Harvard,

676
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:08,397
when you called it quits,

677
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,127
David took me for a walk.

678
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,676
My chin was about an inch
from the ground.

679
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:16,566
I just couldn't be the gay girl.

680
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:20,515
I just relaxed and let everything pour out.

681
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,326
The real, real me stuff.

682
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:28,366
Did you hear that phrase?
I hear myself saying things like that...

683
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:29,562
Oh, where's David?

684
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,924
You know, I'm not very smart.

685
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,406
Why?

686
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:39,005
I never realised you were...

687
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:43,287
[ Sighs ]
Brandon and his atmospheric music.

688
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:46,086
You are in love with David, aren't you?

689
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,566
Yes.

690
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,443
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

691
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,484
Brandon made a crack when I got here.

692
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:56,605
He implied I'd have a chance with you
again because David's out of the running.

693
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:00,157
Wait. You mean, before I got here
Brandon knew we had broken up?

694
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:03,046
- He even knew about you and David.
- What?

695
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,846
Kenneth, he pretended to be completely
ignorant when I told him. He said -

696
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:06,996
What's going on here?

697
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:10,557
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out once and for all!

698
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:12,880
- Brandon?
- Yes?

699
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:14,924
- May I see you for a moment?
- Certainly.

700
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:18,045
Why can't he keep his hands off people?

701
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:20,198
Well?

702
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,718
Just exactly what are you up to?

703
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:26,038
- Up to getting you a coffee, if you like.
- Let's dispense with the charm!

704
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,526
I'd like to know why you had gall

705
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:30,485
to tell Kenneth he wouldn't have to
worry much longer about David and me.

706
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,399
I don't think that's precisely what I said.

707
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,922
It's what you implied
and I want to know why.

708
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:37,885
Some women are quite charming
when they're angry, Janet.

709
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:39,321
Unfortunately, you're not.

710
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,921
- Cut that out, Brandon.
- Well, chivalry rears its ugly head!

711
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,601
- I don't believe David's coming.
- Wait and see.

712
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:47,679
I don't have to. He's never this late.
He's never late at all.

713
00:41:47,847 --> 00:41:50,122
If something had come up,
he'd have phoned.

714
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,085
I think you deliberately arranged it
so that he wouldn't come.

715
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:54,475
How clever of me.

716
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:57,480
I might have known you couldn't
just give a party for Mr Kentley.

717
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,638
You'd have to add something
that appealed

718
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,638
to your warped sense of humour.

719
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:05,766
I hope you've enjoyed
yourself, Brandon. I haven't.

720
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,646
<i>[ Janet ] He's really impossible.</i>

721
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,638
<i>[ Kenneth ]</i>
<i>You shouldn't let him upset you.</i>

722
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:10,956
Something gone wrong, Brandon?

723
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:15,086
No, Janet has a talent
for being bothersome at times.

724
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:18,683
However, I suppose I'd better...

725
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:22,601
Uh, what did you mean,
'something gone wrong'?

726
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:26,919
You always plan your parties so well,
it's odd to have anything go wrong.

727
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,726
She seems to be missing David.

728
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:33,804
<i>[ Rupert ] As a matter of fact</i>,
<i>I'm beginning to miss him myself.</i>

729
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,400
Aren't we all?

730
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:42,085
- Two desserts, Mr Cadell?
- One for you and one for me, my love.

731
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:45,125
The others don't seem to be
in the mood for ice cream.

732
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:48,006
No, well, they could
all do with a little cooling off.

733
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:52,285
My, it's a peculiar party,
not that that surprises me.

734
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:54,956
- Why not?
- I could have predicted it this morning.

735
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,516
Both of them must have got up
out of the wrong side of the bed.

736
00:42:57,687 --> 00:42:59,166
They've been in a state all day!

737
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,205
Mr Brandon says he's always
in a state when he gives a party.

738
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:03,482
First time I've seen it.

739
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,922
Usually, he lets me prepare
everything my own way.

740
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:09,204
But, look at this,
the chicken's hardly been touched.

741
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,756
- What was so different today?
- What wasn't?

742
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:15,397
Mr Brandon was in the maddest rush
for me to clean up and get the table set.

743
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,603
And, oh, it looked so lovely!

744
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,644
<i>[ Mrs Wilson ] But when</i>
<i>I was whisking out to do shopping</i>,

<i>the whole afternoon for it.</i>

746
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:26,558
<i>The whole afternoon</i>,
<i>after that mad rush in the morning.</i>

747
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:30,003
- Did he say why?
- <i>No</i>, <i>just a whim</i>, <i>I suppose.</i>

748
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,921
<i>But when I came back</i>, <i>he and Mr Phillip</i>
<i>were going at it hammer and tongs.</i>

749
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,555
Oh. What about?

750
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:40,686
<i>Now</i>, <i>Mr Cadell</i>, <i>even if I did know</i>,
<i>do you think I'd tell?</i>

751
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:44,283
- Well, I hope so.
- <i>Not me. I'm like the grave.</i>

752
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:47,086
Look at this mess!
Just makes double the work.

753
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:48,965
After I have this cleaned off,

754
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,483
I have to clear all those books off
the dining room table,

755
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,683
bring them here,
put them back in the chest,

756
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,758
which is where
they were in the first place.

757
00:43:56,927 --> 00:44:00,556
- Why did you serve from here, anyway?
- It wasn't my idea.

758
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:04,959
I had everything laid out in the
dining room and it was just beautiful.

759
00:44:05,127 --> 00:44:08,005
[ Whispering ] On this thing,

[ Undiscernable ]

761
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:24,115
Is she still harping on her table and
how awkward it is to serve from this?

762
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,357
It's much more convenient, you know.

763
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:29,166
Because this way, people don't have
to go all the way into the dining room

764
00:44:29,327 --> 00:44:31,124
to get food and come
all the way back to eat it.

765
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:34,518
Seems to me they've gone in there
now for their dessert and coffee.

766
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:39,363
Mrs Wilson, please serve the guests.
Don't lecture them.

767
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,799
We did get up on the wrong side
of the bed, didn't we?

Would you mind turning that off?

00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:20,237
- Sorry.
- I don't like the light in my eyes.

You know, Phillip,

776
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:31,277
I get quite intrigued when people don't
answer questions and quite curious.

777
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:34,678
- Did you ask me a question?
- Yes, Phillip, I asked you a question.

Well, what was it?

I asked you what is going on here.

781
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:49,482
- A party.
- Yes, but a rather peculiar party.

782
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,285
What's it all about, Phillip?

783

What's what all about? Stop playing

Wait, I'll get it for you. Keep playing.

There's nothing going on at all, Rupert.

You're, uh...

more than usually allergic
to the truth tonight, Phillip.

That's the second time
you haven't told it.

Thanks. When was the first?

818
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:43,563
When you said that you'd
never strangled a chicken.

819
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:44,955
You're confused.

820
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:48,199
Brandon dreamt that up
for the sake of a very unfunny joke.

821
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:51,757
No, he didn't. No, he didn't, Phillip.

And if you'll think back carefully,
you'll realise that I know he didn't.

About a year ago,
I was up at the farm. Remember?

One morning
I saw you display your handiwork.

You're quite a good chicken strangler,
as I recall.

Well, I... I just meant
that Brandon's story wasn't true.

- I didn't mean I hadn't killed chickens.
- That's what you said.

Well, I didn't think it was a suitable topic
of conversation while we were eating.

829
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:21,559
- You could have said that.
- Alright, I didn't.

00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:24,287
We're not eating now, Phillip.
What did you lie to me for?

- Because I don't like to talk about -
- About what? Strangling -

- I can't play with that thing!

Don't you want

- No. I don't care if he has them, I just -

<i>[ Rupert ] We might have a better chance</i>

881
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:44,004

882
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,317
<i>[ Brandon ] I haven't the least idea</i>
<i>where he was this afternoon.</i>

883
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,320
<i>[ Rupert ] Don't you think it would help</i>
<i>if we found out where he was?</i>

884
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:50,761
<i>[ Brandon ] I suppose so.</i>

885
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:53,122
<i>[ Kentley ] I know he went to the club</i>
<i>this afternoon to play tennis.</i>

886
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:55,084
- <i>I know he got there.</i>
<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>Why?</i>

887
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:58,796
<i>[ Kentley ] Someone phoned with a</i>

<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>Yes</i>, <i>I see.</i>

897

<i>You didn't speak to David at all today?</i>

898
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,677
<i>[ Brandon ] No. Why do you ask?</i>

899
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,964
<i>[ Rupert ] I thought he might have have</i>

<i>[ Brandon ] He didn't.</i>

901

<i>Neither Phillip nor I have talked to</i>
<i>David since we invited him to the party.</i>

<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>What do you mean?</i>

903

906

That's alright, Mrs Wilson.

You can put the books back
when you come to clean in the morning.

911
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,638
I didn't have any idea
of coming in in the morning.

912

I'm afraid you'll have to.
Just let the books go for now.

Well, alright.

914

Henry, Alice hasn't had a word
from David. She's frantic.

915
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:15,321
- I better talk to her.
- She hung up.

916
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,877
She began to cry so badly.
Oh, Henry, I'm worried.

917
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:20,116
What did she say?

918
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:24,280
She's called every place he might be,
not once, but several times.

919
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,076
And now, Henry, she thinks
he may have had an accident.

920
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:30,886
- She wants you to call the police.

- No, of course, I understand.

- Thank you, Janet.

- Oh! Oh, yes.

I can't tell you how sorry I am.

- Yes?

This is hardly the time,
but I'm very glad we had that talk.

So am I, and David will be too.

Yes, I'll just carry it. Oh, thanks.

Well, come on, it's over, and it
couldn't have gone more beautifully.

Yes, it could, without Rupert.

964
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:04,563
But he was brilliant. He helped me
say all I wanted to say to those idiots.

965
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:06,922
He gave the party
the very touch I predicted.

The touch of what?

967

Prying, snooping, or just plain pumping?

968

Do you know how busy
he was questioning me?

- About what?
- Oh, what difference.

You were busy in there arranging
that other little touch of yours.

- What touch?
- Tying up the books that way.

Oh, I thought that was wonderful.
Didn't you like it?

No, Brandon, I didn't like it one bit.

You'll ruin everything

- I am drunk.

And just as childish as you were before
when you called me a liar.

00:55:43,847 --> 00:55:46,600
- You had no business telling that story.
- Why did you lie, anyway?

00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:48,041
I had to.

980
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,118

to understand how
someone else might feel?

982

I'm not sentimental,

That's not what I mean,
but it doesn't matter.

Keep drinking
and you'll have a worse morning.

At least if I have a hangover,
it will be all mine.

Y-You know, Phillip, I've been thinking.

Where would you like to go?

Of course, we should come back here

Who is it?

1024
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,921
- Brandon. Brandon, it's Rupert.
- What?

1025
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:38,318
He wants to come up.
He says he left his cigarette case here.

1026
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:42,321
- Well, let him come.
- You know he's lying! He's caught on.

1027
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:44,921
- Shut up and get back to that phone.
- I won't.

1028
00:58:45,087 --> 00:58:47,078
- Get back to that phone.
- Brandon, I can't.

1029
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,726
- You've got to.
- No! He knows -

1030
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:50,878
Shut up!

1031
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:07,999
Rupert? Come on up.

1032
00:59:09,527 --> 00:59:12,439
No, uh, course not.

1033
00:59:12,607 --> 00:59:14,802
He's just a little tight.

1034
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:19,645
No, but we'll find it in no time.

1035
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:22,726
Right.

1037
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:37,523
Rupert's on his way up now,
and you've got to pull yourself together.

1038
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:39,518
Phillip, did you hear me?

1039
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:42,678
Come on, have another drink if you must,

1040
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:46,556
but get hold of yourself
and keep your mouth shut.

1041

It'll be over in five minutes.

1042

I don't know how much,
if anything, Rupert knows,

1043
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:58,798
but I promise you he'll be out of here
in five minutes, one way or the other.

1044
00:59:58,967 --> 01:00:03,119
Phillip, for those five minutes,
you've got to pull yourself together.

1045

- Brandon, Brandon -
- Now look.

1046
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:10,723
I'm not going to get caught
because of you or anyone else.

<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>Sorry to bother you</i>, <i>Brandon.</i>
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>It's no bother. Come in.</i>

1052
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:55,159
I knew you were leaving tonight.
I didn't want to be left without my case.

1053
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:56,646
- Hello, Phillip.
- Hello.

1054
01:00:56,807 --> 01:00:58,445
I didn't mean to alarm you before.

1055
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:02,077
You didn't alarm him. I'm afraid
Phillip's a little antisocial tonight.

1056
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:06,001
- Oh? I thought perhaps -
- Any idea where you left the case?

1057
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:08,158
No. No, not at all.

1058
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:11,757
Completely unlike me to forget it, isn't it?

1059
01:01:11,927 --> 01:01:16,000
I suppose a psychoanalyst would say
that I didn't really forget it at all.

1060
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:20,524
I unconsciously left it
because I wanted to come back.

1061
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:23,478
But, uh...

1062
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,444
- Why should I want to come back?
- Yes, why?

1063
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:30,201
For the pleasure of our company
or another drink.

1064
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:32,278
That's a good idea.
May I have one for the road?

1065
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:34,165
Of course. A short one?

1066
01:01:34,327 --> 01:01:36,557
No, I'd prefer a long one,
if you don't mind.

1067
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:39,287
Not at all.
Phillip, will you fix Rupert a drink?

1068
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:43,679
Now let me see,
the last I remember having the case

1069
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:47,638
was when I was there.

1070
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:54,601
I was just going to open the chest
for Mrs Wilson, when you came over.

1071
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:56,958
And then what?

1072
01:02:01,007 --> 01:02:02,998
I think I, uh -

1073
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:08,401
Wonder where it could be.

1074
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:11,445
Oh, well, here it is, right where I left it.

1075
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,565
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon.
I'm very sorry.

1076
01:02:14,727 --> 01:02:17,002
I, uh -

1077
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,123
Well, may I have that drink anyway?

1078
01:02:19,287 --> 01:02:20,766
Of course.

1079
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,395
- You really don't mind?
- No. Why should we?

1080
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:25,523
- Well, you might be -
- What?

1081
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:29,521
- Tired. You're sure it's alright?
- He said you could have it!

1082
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:31,040
- Thank you.
- Don't mind Phillip.

1083
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:35,837
- I'm afraid he's had a few too many.
- Well, why not? Why not?

1084
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:38,999
After all, it was a party.

1085
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:46,358
Well, it's very pleasant to sit here
with a good drink and good company.

1086
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,518
I'm glad.

1087
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:53,847
- Please don't let me be in the way.
- Of what?

1088
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:56,680
- I know you have things to do.
- What do you mean?

1089
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:58,599
Packing, last-minute odds and ends.

1090
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:00,678
You are driving
to Connecticut tonight, aren't you?

1091
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:04,635
- Yes, but we're all packed.
- Oh, I see. All ready.

1092
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:09,317
All except one guest,
who must be gotten rid of.

1093
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:11,717
Well, I'll be off as... uh...

1094
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,321
as soon as I finish my drink.

1095
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:18,046
There's no need to hurry, Rupert.

1096
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:21,563
Thank you.
I, uh... would like to stay a bit.

1097
01:03:22,727 --> 01:03:25,116
Perhaps even see you off.

1098
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:28,885
I always hate to leave a party,

1099
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:35,287
especially when the evening
has been unusually stimulating,

1100
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:38,245
or strange, like this evening.

1101
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:41,236
What do you mean, 'strange'?

1102
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:45,206
Did I say 'strange', Brandon?

1103
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:48,996
You often pick words for sound
rather than meaning.

1104
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:52,716
I don't exactly know what I meant,

1105
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:56,436
unless I was thinking about David.

1106
01:03:58,327 --> 01:04:02,002
- What was strange about David?
- His not showing up.

1107
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:05,045
You don't think anything
really did happen to him, do you?

1108
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:08,483
- What could have?
- He could have been run over or held up.

1109
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:13,118
- In broad daylight?
- That's right, I'd forgotten.

1110
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:17,280
Yes, it must have been broad
daylight when it happened.

1111
01:04:17,447 --> 01:04:20,644
When, uh... what happened?

1112
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:25,605
When whatever did happen to David.

1113
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,558
Nothing, probably.

1114
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:36,155
Still... where is he?

1115
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:39,319
- What's your theory?
- Mine?

1116
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:41,284
I was considering
Janet's for the moment.

1117
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:44,644
- Oh? I didn't know she had one.
- Yes, you do.

1118
01:04:44,807 --> 01:04:47,879
I couldn't help overhearing Janet.

1119
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:51,596
She thinks you kidnapped David, or did
something to prevent him from coming.

1120
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:55,555
I'm not interested in Janet's prattle,
but you always interest me, Rupert.

1121
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:58,799
Do you think I, uh... 'kidnapped' David?

1122
01:04:58,967 --> 01:05:02,039
It's the sort of mischief that would
have appealed to you in school,

1123
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,199
for the experience,
the excitement, the danger.

1124
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:10,202
But it would be slightly more difficult
to pull off now, though, don't you think?

1125
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:12,278
- Ah, you'd find a way.
- How?

1126
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,836
I mean, suppose you were I.

1127
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:18,361
How would you
get David out of the way?

1128
01:05:18,527 --> 01:05:20,119
You're much better
at this sort of thing than I am.

1129
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:23,359
What would you do if you were I?

1130
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:30,557
Well... if I wanted to get rid of David,

1131
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:35,039
I'd invite him for a drink
at the club or some quiet bar.

1132
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:37,163
Or better still, I'd invite him here.

1133
01:05:37,327 --> 01:05:40,399
- Then no one would see us together.
- That's good. And no witnesses?

1134
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:43,035
- Yes, that's right.
- Then what?

1135
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,758
Well...

1136
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:52,118
Well, let me see.

<i>At the right time</i>, <i>David would arrive.</i>

1138
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:59,281

<i>out of the room</i>, <i>into the hall.</i>

1139
01:05:59,447 --> 01:06:03,725
<i>I'd greet him</i>, <i>tell him how fine</i>
<i>he's looking and so forth</i>,

1140
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:05,878
<i>and</i>, <i>uh... take his hat.</i>

1141
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:10,362
<i>Then I'd bring him in here</i>,

1142
01:06:10,687 --> 01:06:13,724
<i>make some small talk</i>
<i>to put him at his ease</i>,

1143
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,276
<i>probably offer him a drink</i>,

1144

- <i>and then he'd sit down.</i>
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Yes?</i>

1145
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:24,679
<i>[ Rupert ] I'd try to make it all</i>
<i>very pleasant</i>, <i>you understand?</i>

1146
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:28,078
<i>Phillip would probably play the piano.</i>

1147
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:32,276
<i>Now</i>, <i>as I recall</i>, <i>David was quite strong.</i>

1148
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,915
<i>He'd have to be knocked out.</i>

1149
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:40,923
<i>So I'd move quietly behind the chair</i>
<i>and hit him on the head with something.</i>

1150
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:44,597
<i>His body would fall forward on the floor.</i>

1151
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,725
<i>[ Brandon ]</i>
<i>Then where would you put him?</i>

1152
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:55,565
<i>[ Rupert ] Well</i>, <i>uh...</i>

1153
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,677
<i>Well</i>, <i>let me see.</i>

1154
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:06,042
Well, I think I'd get Phillip
to help me carry him out of the room,

1155
01:07:06,207 --> 01:07:10,723
<i>down the back stairs</i>, <i>and the</i>
<i>two of us would put him in the car.</i>

1156
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:12,525
- You'd be seen.
<i>[ Rupert ]</i> - <i>What?</i>

1157
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:15,724
Well, you said yourself
that if anything did happen,

1158
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:17,400
it must have happened in broad daylight.

1159
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,205
Oh, that's right. I'd forgotten.

1160
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:22,165
I'd have to find someplace
to hide the body until dark.

1161
01:07:22,327 --> 01:07:25,160
Yes, you would, but where, Rupert?

1162
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:28,758
Yes.

1163
01:07:30,527 --> 01:07:32,518
Yes, where?

1164
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:37,881
- Cat and mouse! Cat and mouse!
- Phillip!

1165
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:40,845
- Which is the cat and which the mouse?
- That's enough of that.

1166
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:43,123
- Mind your own business.
- That's enough, Phillip!

1167
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:46,882
I told you before,
mind your own business!

1168
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:51,437
It really isn't any of my business.
I'm not his keeper.

1169
01:07:53,807 --> 01:07:55,160
With him in this condition, though

1170
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:58,558
there doesn't seem to be
much point in your staying, Rupert.

1171
01:07:58,727 --> 01:08:00,160
That is...

1172
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:04,445
unless you came back to find something
besides your cigarette case.

1173
01:08:04,607 --> 01:08:07,758
You mean, for example,
to find if you really got rid of David?

1174
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:11,158
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- Oh, you're as romantic as Janet.

1175
01:08:11,327 --> 01:08:14,399
I don't think for a moment
that you kidnapped David.

1176
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:19,721
I'll admit Janet put the notion in my head,
but I never would have mentioned it,

1177
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:24,244
if it weren't that you seem to be carrying
fear of discovery in your pocket.

1178
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:26,238
- What?
- That's a gun, isn't it?

[ Laughing ]

1180
01:08:28,847 --> 01:08:31,486
That teased my suspicions
more than anything else.

1181
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:36,562
And to tell you the truth,
it really scares me a little.

1182
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:41,482
I'm terribly sorry, Rupert.
I don't blame you, but... well, here.

1183
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:43,842
You can relax.
I have to take it up to the country.

1184
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:48,239
There have been several burglaries,
and mother's a bit on edge.

1185
01:08:48,407 --> 01:08:51,683
- Uh, finished, Phillip?
<i>[ Phillip ]</i> - <i>Alright.</i>

1186
01:08:51,847 --> 01:08:53,599
<i>[ Brandon ] Did you hear</i>

1188
01:08:57,087 --> 01:09:00,875
It's odd the way one can pyramid
simple facts into wild fantasies, isn't it?

1191
01:09:07,927 --> 01:09:10,157

<i>I almost wish I were going with you.</i>
<i>It might be rather exciting.</i>

1196

<i>Driving at night always is</i>,

1197
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,922
<i>but driving with you and Phillip now...</i>

1198
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:34,080
<i>might have an additional</i>
<i>element of</i>, <i>uh... suspense.</i>

1199
01:09:35,647 --> 01:09:37,797
<i>You were right</i>, <i>Phillip.</i>

1200
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,401
<i>Those books were tied clumsily.</i>

1201
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:43,035
- He's got it. He's got it!
- Phillip.

1202
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:45,277
He knows. He knows. He knows.

1203
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,837
- Alright, easy. I'll take care of it.
- No, you won't.

1204
01:09:49,007 --> 01:09:53,285
I'd just as soon kill you
as kill him - Sooner.

1205
01:09:53,447 --> 01:09:55,915
This is what you wanted,
somebody else to know.

1206
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:59,523
Somebody else to see how brilliant
you are, just like in school.

1207
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:02,804
I told you he'd find out,
but you had to have him here.

1208
01:10:02,967 --> 01:10:04,844
- Now we're done for!
- Shut up!

1209
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:07,999
You made me do it
and I hate both of you. I was -

[ Gunshot ]

1211
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:26,997
- <i>Stupid babbling drunk. I'm sorry</i>, <i>Rupert.</i>
- It's alright.

1212
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:30,797
It's alright. If you really want to kill,
you don't miss, not at that range.

1213
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:32,605
Of course he didn't want to kill you.

1214
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:36,077
He didn't know what he was doing, any
more than he knew what he was saying.

1215
01:10:36,247 --> 01:10:40,081
I didn't want anyone to know this but
he's becoming an alcoholic, Rupert -

1216
01:10:40,247 --> 01:10:42,807
Brandon,
will you step over there, please?

1217
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:45,322
Phillip's drunk, Rupert.

1218
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:48,399
Surely you don't take those
nightmare ideas of his seriously?

1219
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:52,162
Brandon. Brandon, I'm tired.

1220
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:56,603
And in a way, I'm frightened, too.

1221
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,156
- But I don't want to fence anymore.
- What are you going to do?

1222
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:03,798
I don't want to,
but I'm gonna look inside that chest.

1223
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,798
- Are you crazy?
- I hope so.

1224
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:09,596
- With all my heart I hope I'm crazy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

1225
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:10,756
- I've got to.
- Don't.

1226
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:14,283
- I have to look inside that chest.
- Alright!

1227
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:16,438
Go ahead and look.

1228
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:19,201
I hope you like what you see.

1229
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,398
Oh, no. No!

1230
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:42,165
<i>[ Brandon ]</i> - <i>Rupert</i> -
- I couldn't believe it was true.

1231
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:45,163
- Rupert, please -
- Please what?

1232
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:47,682
Listen to me. Let me explain.

1233
01:11:47,847 --> 01:11:49,883
Explain?
Do you think you can explain that?

1234
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:52,959
- Yes, to you, because you'll understand.
- Understand?

1235
01:11:53,127 --> 01:11:56,802
Rupert, remember the discussion
we had before with Mr Kentley?

1236
01:11:56,967 --> 01:12:01,279
Remember we said, 'the lives
of inferior beings are unimportant'?

1237
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:04,803
Remember we said,
we've always said, you and I,

1238
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:09,006
that moral concepts of good and evil
and right and wrong

1239
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:11,317
<i>don't hold for the intellectually superior.</i>

1240
01:12:11,487 --> 01:12:14,081
- <i>Remember</i>, <i>Rupert?</i>
- Yes, I remember.

1241
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:18,126
<i>[ Brandon ] That's all we've done.</i>
<i>That's all Phillip and I have done.</i>

1242
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:21,245
He and I have lived
what you and I have talked.

1243
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:26,003
I knew you'd understand, because,
don't you see, you have to.

1244
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:41,882
Brandon -

1245
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:47,843
Brandon, till this very moment,

1246
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:50,600
this world and the people in it

1247
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:54,680
have always been dark
and incomprehensible to me.

1248
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:58,362
I've tried to clear my way with logic

1249
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:00,961
and superior intellect.

1250
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,881
And you've thrown my own words
right back in my face, Brandon.

1251
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:09,006
You were right, too. If nothing else,
a man should stand by his words.

1252
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:14,002
But you've given my words
a meaning that I never dreamed of!

1253
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:15,566
And you've tried to twist them

1254
01:13:15,727 --> 01:13:19,845
into a cold, logical excuse
for your ugly murder!

1255
01:13:21,007 --> 01:13:24,363
Well, they never were that, Brandon,

1256
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:26,483
and you can't make them that.

1257
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:30,117
There must have been something
deep inside you from the very start

1258
01:13:30,287 --> 01:13:33,359
that let you do this thing,

1259
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:35,643
but there's always been
something deep inside me

1260
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:38,116
that would never let me do it,

1261
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:41,085
- and would never let me be a party to it.
- What do you mean?

1262
01:13:41,247 --> 01:13:45,206
I mean that tonight you've made me
ashamed of every concept I ever had

1263
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:48,359
of superior or inferior beings.

1264
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:51,246
But I thank you for that shame,

1265
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:56,640
because now I know that we are each
of us a separate human being, Brandon,

1266
01:13:56,807 --> 01:14:00,720
with the right to live and work
and think as individuals,

1267
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:03,879
but with an obligation
to the society we live in.

1268
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:07,158
By what right do you dare say

1269
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:11,718
that there's a superior few
to which you belong?

1270
01:14:11,887 --> 01:14:14,082
By what right did you dare decide

1271
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:19,765
that that boy in there was inferior
and therefore could be killed?

1272
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:22,441
Did you think you were God, Brandon?

1273
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:25,804
Is that what you thought
when you choked the life out of him?

1274
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:29,198
Is that what you thought
when you served food from his grave?

1275
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:32,916
I don't know what you thought,
but I know what you've done.

1276
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,884
You've murdered!

1277
01:14:35,047 --> 01:14:37,641
You've strangled a fellow human being

1278
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:41,277
who could live and love
as you never could.

1279
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:43,085
- And never will again.
- What are you doing?

1280
01:14:43,247 --> 01:14:48,605
It's what society's going to do. I don't
know what that will be. I can guess.

1281
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:52,760
And I can help. You're going to die,
Brandon, both of you!

You're going to die.
