00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,949
who're you?

7
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,003
Oh, you came to
give me hush money?

8
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,325
- I...
- Don't worry.

9
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,825
I'm not a busybody.
I won't tell the cops.

10
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,223
You can't tell anyone.

11
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,446
I won't.
Go away.

12
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,356
I have some money.

13
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,791
You're so uncool.

14
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:11,834
I'm really...

15
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:13,525
I didn't say
you could come in.

16
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,295
I...

17
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,611
My husband's a cop.

18
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,317
He's a detective in the
Ikejiri precinct.

19
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:29,250
So if this gets out...

20
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,933
I can get you some more.

21
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,734
Enough already.

22
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,814
Don't stare.

<i>Tm son-y.</i>

24
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:58,608
I won't tell anyone
you are a thief.

25
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,945
Will this do?

26
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:02,311
Thanks.

27
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,645
Leave.

28
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,080
I appreciate it.

29
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:11,626
May I clean your house
to thank you?

30
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,954
What should I do?

31
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:14,209
Wait.

32
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,904
I didn't say
you could come in.

33
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,248
Let me do something.

34
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,753
Hey, you.
Don't touch anything.

35
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,644
I said don't.

36
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,619
Hit me some more.

37
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,855
Are you satisfied?

38
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,795
You still want
to do something?

39
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,203
I'll do anything.

40
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,967
Then lick the milk
off the floor.

41
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,248
You said you'd do
anything.

42
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,255
You're a pig.

43
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:23,682
Since you're a cop's wife.

44
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,792
You cut my mouth.

45
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,541
Does it hurt?

46
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:13,780
There's dust in the milk.

47
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,434
You're very pretty-

48
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,426
You have cute breasts.

49
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:58,343
Do you want to suck them?

50
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,714
Damn you.
You forgot again.

51
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,285
Stop.

52
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:42,677
But... no.
Use protection.

53
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:45,945
Protection?

54
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,251
Okay.

55
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,019
Which one today?
The red one?

56
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,314
I can't get in the mood
just like that.

57
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,330
What about dinner?

58
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,504
What's this scratch?

59
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,947
Scratch?

60
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:15,736
This is no ordinary scratch.

61
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,903
I don't know
how it got there.

62
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,889
You must know.

63
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,671
Someone scratched you.

64
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,238
It's just an abrasion.

65
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,125
I must have...

66
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,866
That's a lie.
A lie.

67
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,007
What do you suspect me of?

68
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,606
Damn you.
Tell me.

69
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,141
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

70
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,278
You must know
You're lying.

71
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,071
I can't know everything
about myself.

72
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,380
Do you think
I'm having an affair?

73
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,063
Don't forget
the protection.

74
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:27,454
Welcome.

75
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,266
Sony to keep you waiting.

76
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,881
I thought I had
the wrong restaurant.

77
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,424
<i>Tm son-y.
Forgive me.</i>

78
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,823
This is my treat.

79
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,202
The paella here
is fabulous.

80
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,318
I love paella.

81
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,295
I thought so.

82
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,471
Two beers please.

83
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:49,317
Or do you prefer wine?

84
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,793
How long did you wait?

85
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,017
Three days.

86
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,708
But...

87
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,357
...here we are.

88
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,760
This is so extreme.

89
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,612
Yes. Like a horse.

90
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:48,482
An iron horse. This model
costs about 50,000 dollars.

91
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:52,954
Five? Mitsuko, you know
a lot about bikes?

92
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,674
I have an RZ.

93
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,027
Doesn't it have
a nice behind?

94
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,690
Yeah, how much?

95
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,784
I'll give it to you
for free.

96
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,845
Idiot.

97
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,211
Fool.

98
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:45,892
Oh.

99
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,662
I need to pee.

100
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,996
Hold it in.

101
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,758
I can't.

102
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:05,727
Hum!-

103
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,947
Sonoko?

104
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:14,141
Say' Pee...
Pee...

105
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,234
Pee?

106
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,703
Pee...

107
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,950
Peeee...

108
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,757
I can't go.
Do it again.

109
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,821
Peee...

110
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,332
Peee...

111
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:46,167
Peee...

112
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:04,391
That's the third train.

113
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,865
Will you get on the next one?

114
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,843
I'll watch you go.

115
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,171
I don't like this.

116
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:21,001
Why won't you see me home?

117
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,308
It's already 11 p.m.

118
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:27,085
I'm not good at goodbyes.
Always.

119
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,954
I'm not a sprinter.

120
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:33,327
I want to be in
for the long run.

121
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,267
Along distance runner...

122
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,256
Someone I can run
with forever.

123
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,312
That's the kind of person
I like.

124
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:45,114
Then I'm not your type.

125
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,785
You can run.

126
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:51,052
Do you think
I can still run?

127
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:52,583
Not still.

128
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,419
I can run.

129
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,003
You should be positive.
Now.

130
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,673
Bye.

131
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,745
Mitsuko.

132
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm home.

133
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,162
You're late again.

134
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:40,927
<i>Tm son-y.</i>

135
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:46,258
I hear the number of husbands

136
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,079
who don't want their wives
hanging around is increasing.

137
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,583
Do you have something
on your mind?

138
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,266
You can't do this
while you're pre-occupied.

139
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,637
You're not feeling well?

140
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,156
Yes?

141
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,944
Then let's not.

142
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:16,826
Did something happen?

143
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,731
Are you hiding
something from me?

144
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,706
No?

145
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:36,478
Is that the truth?

146
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,183
Okay then.

147
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,356
Go to sleep.

148
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:12,904
Wine and spare ribs.

149
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,169
Thanks for bringing them.

150
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,966
I've been hungry
since morning.

151
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,189
But I didn't feel like
doing anything.

152
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,631
My period started
this morning.

153
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:36,045
I have heavy periods,
I feel blue.

154
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,771
- Is that so?
- How about you?

155
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,332
Mine are light.

156
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,273
I envy you.

157
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:50,822
I'd rather do a lump-sum
payment. Don't you?

158
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,421
Lump-Sum payment?

159
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:58,454
Yeah, it's like paying
interest every month.

160
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:02,103
You think it's finished but
it keeps coming back...

161
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,828
Look, Sonoko.

162
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,465
Wouldn't it be great

163
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,772
if ours happened
at the same time?

164
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:17,014
If yours is heavy,

165
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:20,203
I wish mine could be too, so
I could feel blue.

166
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,629
Then I'll look forward
to my periods.

167
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,586
Well?

168
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,880
I couldn't tell what was
happening inside.

169
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,375
- Who is she?
- I asked the super.

170
00:21:52,386 --> 00:21:56,050
She comes from Osaka,
2-18-3 Ashiya City.

171
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,104
Her name's Mitsuko,
an eldest daughter.

172
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,939
She works at Tokyo Research
in Jinnan, Shibuya.

173
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:03,537
It's a part-time job.

174
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:08,285
Did she have a man
in there?

175
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,273
I was outside the door.

176
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:13,510
But her hair seemed
a bit disheveled.

177
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,108
Disheveled?
Is that so?

178
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:42,550
Where are you going?

179
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,500
Please don't leave.

180
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,217
I won't.

181
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,828
You're lying.

182
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,603
You were looking
at your watch.

183
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:59,666
My husband comes home
at seven.

184
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,297
Oh?

185
00:23:05,992 --> 00:23:08,177
I'm the type
who won't be lonely

186
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,507
even if I'm left alone.

187
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,691
Does he get mad when
you come home late?

188
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:20,641
Do you make up in bed, then?

189
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,169
You probably moan
while you're doing it.

190
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:25,953
Mitsuko.

191
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,985
Even so, I love you.

192
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,788
Your body,
your tender heart...

193
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,655
I can't leave.

194
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,189
When you say such things,

195
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:46,291
I don't care what happens
anymore.

196
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:49,586
Sonoko.

197
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:50,618
I had to hear your voice
before I went home.

198
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,350
I can't go home,
I won't sleep if I did.

199
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:59,414
Sonoko. Did you think
you could sleep tonight?

200
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:03,497
I've given up long ago.

201
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,969
No matter how many sheep
I count, I can't sleep.

202
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,026
I'm going to drink with
a friend till morning.

203
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,104
Friend?

204
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:21,855
I have friends from Osaka
and from work.

205
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,612
I have two friends
with me now.

206
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,060
I'm not lonely.

207
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,225
So don't worry
and go home.

208
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,504
Go home to your husband.

209
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,249
Mitsuko.

210
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:54,816
Come for just one hour.
Please?

211
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,530
I will.

212
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,289
Mitsuko.

213
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,687
Welcome home.

214
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:45,457
What are you doing?
You're a housewife.

215
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,845
I have obligations.
It can't be helped.

216
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,326
You have to be
more responsible.

217
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:55,280
Mitsuko Shido.

218
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,427
Who is she? The woman
in that apartment.

219
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,957
<i>What do you do
in that room?</i>

220
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,947
What apartment?

221
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:16,005
Don't act innocent.

222
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,439
But...

223
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,689
It's no use denying it.

224
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:34,140
Look.

225
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:39,965
You left home at 10 a.m.
and went to Hiroo in a taxi.

226
00:27:39,983 --> 00:27:42,384
There you bought wine
and spare ribs.

227
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,158
Then you went to this
Shido woman's apartment.

228
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,841
Not me.

229
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,987
I didn't go to Hiroo today.

230
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,725
You...
That's a big lie.

231
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,329
Was it really me?

232
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:04,601
Can you say definitely
it was me?

233
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:06,513
Then why didn't you
call out to me?

234
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,685
You...

235
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,442
You followed
some other woman.

236
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,709
If you're following someone,
you don't announce yourself.

237
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:31,840
Who is it?

238
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,269
Yes?

239
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,982
Are you Miss Shido?

240
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,252
Yes...

241
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:04,070
What's your relationship
with my wife?

242
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,846
- Huh?
- Don't "huh" me.

243
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:10,255
How do you know my wife?

244
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,317
What do you mean?

245
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:15,782
You're brazen.
Lying like that.

246
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:21,712
I'm not really...
But who are you?

247
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,305
- I...
- You keep quiet.

248
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,034
You must be in the
wrong apartment.

249
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:31,306
You've got
the wrong person.

250
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:33,879
I don't. I saw.

251
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,564
What did you see?

252
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:38,325
I have something on the
stove. Please leave.

253
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:41,927
Tum it off.

254
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:45,025
I don't take orders
from you.

255
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,023
Who are you?

256
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,153
I have never set eyes
on this woman before.

257
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,731
That won't fly.

258
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,292
I'm a cop.

259
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,263
How long has it been
since I last saw you?

260
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,224
When I try to remember
your face at night,

261
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,335
the details escape me.

262
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,381
I hate myself for
not remembering.

263
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:46,811
I wrote letters to you...
many times.

264
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,717
Although I didn't send them.

265
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,606
Give them to me.

266
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,247
I tore them up.

267
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,488
Idiot.

268
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,486
We can't use my place
anymore.

269
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:15,107
Since the cop came,

270
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,894
my super warned me
in a roundabout way.

271
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,411
Let's meet somewhere else
from now on.

272
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,485
Where?

273
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,183
Let's see...

274
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,721
What was the grave
we just saw?

275
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,897
There were two names
on the same grave.

276
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:14,311
Two people who committed
double suicide

277
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,104
are buried together there.

278
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,072
Oh.

279
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:25,418
I'd like to be buried
with you, like that.

280
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,569
Let's buy a plot somewhere
for the two of us.

281
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,332
Then we can be buried
together.

282
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,737
We'll be together
forever.

283
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,595
You promise?

284
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:01,545
Look I'm going to hide
behind that grave.

285
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,296
Pretend I'm dead

286
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:06,665
and tell me everything
you're feeling.

287
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,614
I can't.

288
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:13,870
I want you to tell me honestly
how you really feel about me.

289
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,598
You can do it if you think
I'm really dead.

290
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:21,438
All right?
Tell me everything.

291
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,967
This is my grave.

292
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,138
Mitsuko.

293
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:45,087
Mitsuko...

294
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:03,859
You know...
When you were alive,

295
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,119
I always wanted you
so much it hurt.

296
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,373
That's right.

297
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,887
I loved everything about you.

298
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:21,096
Your breasts...

299
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,500
I wanted to rip them off
and make them my own

300
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,287
and always have them
with me.

301
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:34,333
When I kissed the eyes
I loved,

302
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,899
I wanted to suck them in

303
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,297
and swallow them.

304
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:50,709
Sometimes, I'd want to
tear you to pieces.

305
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,933
I was afraid of
my own feelings.

306
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:00,727
No...

307
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,796
I still am.

308
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,898
Mitsuko.

309
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,163
Say something.

310
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:15,105
Why did you die?

311
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,768
We should have died
together.

312
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,039
Exactly at the same second.

313
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,721
Mitsuko?

314
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:34,128
I can tell you this
because you're dead.

315
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,200
Laugh from beyond
the grave.

316
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:48,155
I wanted our bodies to be
connected deep inside

317
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:52,616
and do anything,
no matter how hard,

318
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,691
to create something
between the two of us.

319
00:36:00,566 --> 00:36:05,891
You could have been
the one. Or I.

320
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:11,328
No, I wanted you
to have it.

321
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,354
Our baby.

322
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:20,476
If we had to die, I wanted
all three of us...

323
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,490
You and I alone, all three
of us to die together.

324
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,248
I'm freezing.

325
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:49,608
I wish the whole world
would just freeze over.

326
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,412
I wish everyone else would die,

327
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,950
leaving just the two of us.

328
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:44,261
I'm going to bury the sea.

329
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,501
It's so serene,
it's such a liar.

330
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,056
Idiot!

331
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,596
Pretending
everything': fine.

332
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,254
That's right.

333
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:08,408
Life's not like that.

334
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,398
She's right.

335
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,773
Say it will be.

336
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:40,431
Mitsuko. I got my period.

337
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,521
Now?

338
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm hot.

339
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,037
I'm so hot.

340
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:02,782
Huh?

341
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,408
Me, too.

342
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,972
Mitsuko.

343
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,054
We're...

344
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:27,158
Sonoko,
we buried the sea.

345
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:35,013
Sea? We can do anything.

346
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,335
If you look serene
tomorrow

347
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,150
I won't forgive you.

348
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,674
Yes, this is Kakiuchi.

349
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,751
What?

350
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:27,189
Oh, you're staying over?

351
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,926
You're staying there?

352
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:33,938
You don't want
to come home?

353
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,242
Er, no. That's fine.

354
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,004
Yes go ahead.

355
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,785
Here you go.

356
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:55,444
You have to think about
the last train

357
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,734
when you're having an affair.

358
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:58,405
It's not like that.

359
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,664
You were always bad at
details, Sonoko.

360
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,978
Shoko, are you...?

361
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:10,644
Does it show?

362
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,132
How far along?

363
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,134
Twenty-four weeks,
so six months.

364
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,284
You're brave.

365
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:18,589
Single parents are in
these days.

366
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:27,707
Oh, you have a guest?

367
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,595
Here, Shoko.

368
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:34,642
Why did you come all
the way from Osaka...

369
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,915
You drank my liquor.

370
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:41,844
I thought you wouldn't mind.
Don't scold.

371
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:46,448
What about the
news dealership?

372
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:50,951
Who's going to manage it
if you're not there?

373
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:55,191
I hired a new guy.

374
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,673
He's really handsome.
A hard worker.

375
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,305
I left him in charge.

376
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,309
Oh, another man.

377
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:10,381
Forgive me. I really feel
guilty about you.

378
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:17,172
I was giving up men
and focusing on the business.

379
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,694
That was my intention, but
before I knew it,

380
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:24,361
I had a man. I don't know
how it happened.

381
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:25,992
How should I know?

382
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:31,596
I need to talk to you.

383
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,411
Have some.

384
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,757
Thanks.

385
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:44,527
Don't get mad.

386
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:48,251
I won't know until
you tell me.

387
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:55,486
You're so cold towards me.
It's hard on me.

388
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,654
I'm pregnant.

389
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,115
Again;

390
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,915
I didn't plan it.

391
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,014
It happened
all of a sudden.

392
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,025
At your age?

393
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,152
No? I guess I shouldn't.

394
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:21,923
I'm asking why
you weren't careful?

395
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:25,037
I was just drifting off.

396
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,479
I didn't want to refuse him.

397
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,723
So it just happened.

398
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:40,107
Tell me what to do.

399
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:43,088
What's there to do?

400
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:45,640
If you say get rid of it,

401
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,300
I was going to do it in
Tokyo secretly.

402
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,501
How shameful.

403
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,663
If I were you, I'd killed
myself long ago.

404
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:02,796
It's not like
I'm a nymphomaniac.

405
00:45:06,028 --> 00:45:07,985
I'm just lonely.

406
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,358
Sometimes I'm so lonely
I can't stand it.

407
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:18,159
You'll understand when
you're my age.

408
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,436
As you get older,

409
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,893
you find a cold weight
settling on you.

410
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,611
A sorrow you can't
explain to anyone.

411
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,445
I bet Sonoko': awake.

412
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:52,556
She's all uptight.

413
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,209
Why don't you
help her relax?

414
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,657
Idiot.

415
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,510
No!

416
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,831
Stop.

417
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:01,965
Sonoko!

418
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,512
Mitsuko...

419
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:33,926
I'm home.

420
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,559
Hi.

421
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:40,765
We have a guest?

422
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,302
It's Ms. Shido.

423
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,220
- What?
- It's not like that.

424
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:48,281
I ran into her in Shibuya
after that.

425
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,902
We got friendly
over coffee.

426
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,729
You have lots of awards.

427
00:50:01,907 --> 00:50:06,811
Any cop who's been working
for ten years has them.

428
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:12,323
You were so happy when you received
the Commissioner's Award.

429
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:15,579
He was like a kid. He did
a painting about it.

430
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,411
Commissioner's Award?

431
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,600
Does he do oil painting?

432
00:50:23,003 --> 00:50:24,801
He's a weekend painter.

433
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,544
Rather, he paints
on his days off.

434
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,301
A cop Henri Rousseau?

435
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,659
- Is this his?
- Yes.

436
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:42,227
A clothes hanger?
What a strange painting.

437
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,840
This is a crime scene.

438
00:50:54,368 --> 00:50:55,847
Crime scene?

439
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:05,014
The corpse was
under the hanger.

440
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,464
A Corpse?

441
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,241
<i>“Di a girl.</i>

442
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:13,266
I thought for a moment

443
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,498
the girl slipped off the
clothes hanger and died.

444
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,992
Scary.

445
00:51:25,132 --> 00:51:27,749
I was a detective in
Fukagawa then.

446
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:30,935
The crime scene was
in Shimotakaido.

447
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,174
Shimotakaido?

448
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,058
When I moved to Tokyo,

449
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,676
my first apartment
was in Shimotakaido.

450
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:40,043
Oh yeah?

451
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,418
Then you must know
the theater near the station.

452
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:44,438
Of course.

453
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:47,704
It happened in
an old apartment behind it.

454
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,048
I see...

455
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:10,397
You're still up?

456
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:15,051
Why?
Does it bother you?

457
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,894
I thought you said you'd
see her to the station.

458
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,033
We got talking...

459
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,832
Come here.

460
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:41,845
I was hoping I was wrong...

461
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,507
What do you mean?

462
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:48,238
You must know what
I suspect.

463
00:52:50,658 --> 00:52:52,877
Why don't you come out
and say it?

464
00:52:57,783 --> 00:53:01,811
You two are...
you know...

465
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,849
les... lesbians.

466
00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:11,617
You're so vulgar.

467
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:15,805
I'll try to forget everything
until now.

468
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,309
- So stop seeing her.
- No.

469
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,853
What if I refuse?

470
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,243
I'll kill.

471
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,089
Which one of us?

472
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,903
Me or Mitsuko?

473
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,638
I don't care which.

474
00:53:36,754 --> 00:53:39,815
If one dies, the other won't
keep on living.

475
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,508
Don't you get it?

476
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:49,579
What you two are doing is...
unnatural.

477
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:51,727
<i>It's abnormal.</i>

478
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,750
I can't help being
in love with her.

479
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:58,531
I love Mitsuko so much...

480
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,495
It's not as though I'm
having an affair with a man.

481
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:07,012
What's it's to you if I have
a close woman friend?

482
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,877
Of course it matters.
Since we live together.

483
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,564
Are you out of your mind?

484
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:20,598
You're older so you'll be
held responsible.

485
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,819
I know that.

486
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:25,667
What about me, then?

487
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,021
Even if I look the other way,
even if I didn't know,

488
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:34,027
I'd be the one people
will blame.

489
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,922
I'll be mined.

490
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:44,191
You always think
of yourself.

491
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,397
You won't try to understand...

492
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,002
<i>me GS a WONG“.</i>

493
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,859
That's not true.

494
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,148
I've gone along with you
about not having a baby.

495
00:54:55,892 --> 00:55:00,762
I've always worn protection
the past ten years.

496
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:06,470
I've tried to live
according to your wishes.

497
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:11,557
But I won't condone
lesbianism.

498
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:17,498
Then we'll have to split up.

499
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,966
Divorce me.
Let me go.

500
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,240
I have no reason to.

501
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,877
"Why did you get divorced?"

502
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:28,775
"My wife had an illicit lesbian
relationship."

503
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,502
How can I admit that in public?

504
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,228
Think about it.

505
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:40,434
What did our lives together
mean, then?

506
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:45,717
We can argue because
we have a ten-year history.

507
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,652
But you talk of divorce
so easily.

508
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,960
Let's try to work this out.

509
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,408
Right.

510
00:55:55,502 --> 00:55:59,359
Then consent to my
seeing her.

511
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,798
I won't.
Are you kidding?

512
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:06,070
Think of your age!

513
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,915
It was a gift.

514
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:15,197
It's too much for me alone.

515
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:21,916
Dear? Can Mitsuko
stay over tonight?

516
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:25,368
Really? You sure?

517
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,572
Right?

518
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:37,639
I loved Kamakura.

519
00:56:39,304 --> 00:56:41,193
Don't you want to go again?

520
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,510
Kamakura?

521
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,222
That cemetery, remember?

522
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:53,053
I wonder if the sea is flat
again tonight.

523
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,791
When did you go
to Kamakura?

524
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:03,656
When?
I forget.

525
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:07,457
I'm going to sleep.

526
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,216
But...

527
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:17,259
I'm not saying
you can't go.

528
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:32,350
I think your husband's cold.

529
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,753
Dear? Can you try
not to cough?

530
00:57:37,771 --> 00:57:39,330
I can't sleep.

531
00:57:39,865 --> 00:57:41,959
But I'm cold.

532
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:49,279
I have an idea.

533
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:52,138
It'll be warm if all three of
us slept close together.

534
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:55,513
Just like kids,
we'll squish together.

535
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,606
There's nothing dirty about it.

536
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,895
So let's.

537
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:11,692
Good night.

538
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,358
Good night.

539
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:39,219
- Rice.
- Coming.

540
00:58:59,752 --> 00:59:01,038
Aren't you eating?

541
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:03,607
I want to watch you eat.

542
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:17,826
I want to many you.

543
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,428
We're already a couple.

544
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:27,635
Why don't you move in?

545
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:33,108
I could... but I'm scared
of your husband.

546
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,405
I wasn't going to tell you...

547
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:42,543
but when I woke to go
to the bathroom,

548
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:45,561
your husband got up, too,

549
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:47,769
and when we passed,
he groped my ass.

550
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:49,997
I'm scared.

551
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:03,438
Is she still there?

552
01:00:04,926 --> 01:00:08,385
What?
How brazen of her.

553
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:12,407
I... I hate that type
of women.

554
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:17,007
She's staying over again?

555
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,967
All right.
I'll come home early.

556
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,843
Dear which necktie?

557
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:28,582
What? The right.

558
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:30,607
Right? You mean this?

559
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,476
The other one.

560
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,608
Hey. Is that woman
still asleep?

561
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:39,210
She got up ages ago.-

562
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:44,940
Be careful. She's pushy.
There's no end to this.

563
01:00:51,756 --> 01:00:52,587
'Morning.

564
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,397
Six.

565
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,828
He really is a cop.

566
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,983
He sneaked up on me
and whispered,

567
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:17,423
"We need to talk."

568
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,774
He's pretending he has
business with you and said,

569
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,394
- "Come to Ginza."
- "I'll buy you dinner."

570
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:25,515
"Meet me in front of Wako
at six p.m."

571
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,348
I wonder what he wants
to talk to me about.

572
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:34,047
I wonder if he's going
to seduce me.

573
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:36,559
Are you going?

574
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,758
Should I?

575
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:41,993
Go.

576
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,254
If you say so.

577
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,469
I'll go.

578
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,071
Let's go together.

579
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,255
What?

580
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,071
Sorry-

581
01:02:44,035 --> 01:02:46,891
I love babies.

582
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:54,401
Go to your mama.

583
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,614
I have to go to work.

584
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,482
Oh, he's wet.
Excuse me.

585
01:03:11,946 --> 01:03:15,701
Sonoko? Can you stop by
my apartment and get my boots?

586
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:16,757
Sure.

587
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:19,932
It's the slouchy one
near the door.

588
01:03:19,954 --> 01:03:22,571
- All right.
- Thanks.

589
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:27,486
Mitsuko. Why don't you
just move in?

590
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:33,660
But, don't you like having
a second house?

591
01:03:34,193 --> 01:03:40,451
And it's the place
where we first...

592
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,396
You'll be late.
Why don't you go?

593
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:56,432
I'm leaving.

594
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:59,327
- Come again.
- Thanks.

595
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:09,716
Sonoko?

596
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:13,178
Does your husband know
about you two?

597
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,242
Yes.

598
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:18,828
How long has she been
living with you?

599
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,540
Three months.

600
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:27,666
I think you're going to
lose control of her.

601
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:56,821
- It happened here?
- Oh, wait.

602
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,398
Now.

603
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:54,561
Wow.
It's that painting.

604
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:51,344
How old was she?

605
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,371
Sixteen.

606
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:01,932
Her grandpa killed her.

607
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:04,793
Her grandpa?

608
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,757
How old are you?

609
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,549
Sixteen.

610
01:07:18,692 --> 01:07:20,342
Sixteen?

611
01:07:25,149 --> 01:07:27,129
Should I strangle you?

612
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,568
You mustn't.

613
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,022
No.

614
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,364
No.

615
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:58,682
I can't, where someone
was strangled.

616
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,615
You're a special guest
to my workplace today.

617
01:08:06,632 --> 01:08:08,589
You mustn't object.

618
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:40,320
Not these.

619
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:42,920
I wanted the short one.

620
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,786
<i>Oh. Tm son-y.</i>

621
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:51,792
I'm home.

622
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,862
It's cold.

623
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,750
I asked her to fetch my
boots from my apartment.

624
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,048
She brought the wrong one.

625
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,429
I'll go exchange them
tomorrow.

626
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:08,232
No. I'll go.

627
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,096
I can fetch them
on my way home.

628
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,434
Really?

629
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:18,270
It's the grey one in the hack
of the shoe cabinet.

630
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,463
The grey one?
Okay,

631
01:09:20,472 --> 01:09:22,395
If you need anything else,
write it down.

632
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:24,326
Is the bath ready?

633
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh, my earrings...

634
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:56,639
I...

635
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,504
I'm thinking of going back
to my apartment.

636
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,701
I don't get
enough sleep here.

637
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,809
Why?

638
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,010
When you and your husband
are fast asleep,

639
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:14,175
I try not to disturb you
so I can't sleep.

640
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:16,190
All this time?

641
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:18,340
Yes.

642
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,441
Why didn't you tell me?

643
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:24,526
I can't be so selfish.

644
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:29,574
If you can't sleep,
I'll stay awake, too.

645
01:10:33,212 --> 01:10:35,533
I will never sleep.

646
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:48,383
Can you sleep?

647
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:52,617
No.

648
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,481
I can't either.

649
01:11:01,673 --> 01:11:08,170
Look, since we're all up,
why don't we play a game?

650
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:11,352
Whit game?

651
01:11:12,426 --> 01:11:14,315
I'll be the wolf.

652
01:11:14,595 --> 01:11:16,313
You two are travelers.

653
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:19,145
Us, travelers?

654
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:22,146
The travelers will be
mauled to death.

655
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:30,476
The travelers are camping
in a cold hut in the fields.

656
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:36,956
At midnight, the wolf starts
to howl outside the door.

657
01:11:41,872 --> 01:11:45,775
You two. In here.

658
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:51,896
Sit and pretend
to be travelers.

659
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,154
Hum!-

660
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:11,231
Now. Make a campfire.

661
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,709
Hey, listen to the wolf.
Add wood into the fire.

662
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,273
What are you doing?

663
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:15,589
Slop!

664
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:26,462
Sonoko. I ate your leg.
You can't walk.

665
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:27,062
You win.

666
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:41,138
You're a corpse.
Don't get up.

667
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,606
Die.

668
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,872
When you killed me,
you did it so quickly.

669
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,520
Dear?

670
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:02,771
Bathroom.

671
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:07,901
Mitsuko?

672
01:15:10,822 --> 01:15:12,176
What?

673
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,858
I want to be alone with you
like before.

674
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:21,541
Mitsuko?

675
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,697
When did you live here?

676
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,217
It was just when I moved
to Tokyo...

677
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,023
so three years ago?

678
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,778
Did you live here alone?

679
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:44,633
What are you asking?

680
01:16:47,018 --> 01:16:51,410
You had sex with a man
here before haven't you?

681
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:54,681
I suppose.

682
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,879
How many?

683
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:06,305
One, two, three, four...
lots more.

684
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,205
I'm a savage, so I can't
count higher.

685
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:15,980
You're avoiding
my question.

686
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:20,082
Mitsuko?

687
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,238
How about women?

688
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:27,983
You fool.

689
01:17:35,559 --> 01:17:38,540
I wanted to come here with you.

690
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:46,064
It's so quiet,
I love it here.

691
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:05,769
The hanger': strong.

692
01:18:07,341 --> 01:18:09,139
<i>It's a weird room.</i>

693
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:13,836
You can see the firehouse
from the back window

694
01:18:13,847 --> 01:18:17,033
and there's two firetrucks
in an otherwise empty garage,

695
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:18,668
crouched like beasts.

696
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:49,784
Mitsuko.

697
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:12,571
Let's play police
interrogation tonight.

698
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,991
Police interrogation?

699
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,008
- You're hurting me.
- Sit.

700
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,749
I am going to
start the interrogation.

701
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,020
We don't say that.
First...

702
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,490
I'll start the interrogation.

703
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:38,334
Tell us everything.

704
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:40,180
Takeshi Kakiuchi.

705
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:43,737
You know a woman
named Mitsuko Shido?

706
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:45,729
Yes, I do.

707
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:48,663
You do not have to make
incriminating statements,

708
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:51,084
but you must not lie.

709
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,169
When did you
and Mitsuko Shida

710
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,782
become intimate?

711
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,083
Answer me.

712
01:20:08,045 --> 01:20:10,901
I did not have sex
with Mitsuko Shido.

713
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,333
How many times have you met her

714
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,274
in the room with the hanger?

715
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:18,925
I have proof.

716
01:20:23,635 --> 01:20:26,559
I want dates and times of
the sexual encounters.

717
01:20:27,731 --> 01:20:29,210
Sexual encounter?

718
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:33,240
I forget.

719
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:36,138
- Don't lie.
- Hey, don't do that.

720
01:20:36,148 --> 01:20:37,946
Answer me.

721
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:40,998
Takeshi Kakiuchi affidavit.

722
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:45,296
About 6 p.m. on January 25th,

723
01:20:45,306 --> 01:20:49,493
I met Mitsuko Shido at Sakamoto
restaurant in Dogenzaka Shibuya

724
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:52,853
and afterwards went to
Hotel Chateau nearby

725
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,779
and had sex with her
for the first time.

726
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:57,561
We were at the hotel
for three hours.

727
01:20:57,594 --> 01:20:59,642
The hotel cost 62 dollars.

728
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,829
Since February 2nd
was a Saturday,

729
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:05,366
Hotel Chateau was full.

730
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:07,324
We went to Hotel Eden
next door.

731
01:21:08,013 --> 01:21:09,845
After sexual intercourse,

732
01:21:09,848 --> 01:21:12,613
Mitsuko asked my opinion
of the difference

733
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:16,491
between her body and
that of my wife Sonoko.

734
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:20,911
When I said Mitsuko's taut
stomach was more appealing

735
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,252
to my wife's sagging stomach,

736
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,621
Mitsuko was inordinately
happy-

737
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,593
Because of that, the
second sex act

738
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:31,947
seemed more pleasurable
than the first.

739
01:21:31,962 --> 01:21:34,613
Stop, stop. I quit.

740
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,506
This isn't funny.

741
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,950
- I'm quitting.
- You can't.

742
01:21:37,968 --> 01:21:39,675
- Don't run.
- This isn't play acting.

743
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:40,733
Sit.

744
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,603
- This isn't fun.
- Sit.

745
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:45,901
This is a real investigation.

746
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,320
You just listen and answer
the questions.

747
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,077
What is this?

748
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,540
Takeshi Kakiuchi.

749
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,189
First you were annoyed

750
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:59,036
when Mitsuko started
living in your house.

751
01:21:59,822 --> 01:22:04,032
But in the end, you gave your
implicit consent

752
01:22:04,043 --> 01:22:05,932
of a man and two women
living together.

753
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,410
Is that correct?

754
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:11,597
- Yes, that may be...
- It wasn't implicit.

755
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,217
He was very pleased.

756
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,877
Are you kidding?
I was just...

757
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:18,687
If you didn't want the
three of us to live together,

758
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,714
why didn't you
chase us out?

759
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:23,956
I thought many times
of leaving myself.

760
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,994
Then why didn't you?

761
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,828
You're really stupid.

762
01:22:30,929 --> 01:22:34,866
If I left, how could you two
keep on living in police housing?

763
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:37,024
Have you lost your minds?

764
01:22:38,694 --> 01:22:42,483
I was prepared to face
public opinion.

765
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:45,068
Who cares about
public opinion?

766
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,190
Don't underestimate it.

767
01:22:49,456 --> 01:22:51,288
You're small-minded.

768
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:02,793
You had a lover then.

769
01:23:05,396 --> 01:23:06,921
Tell me her name.

770
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:11,960
Sonoko Kakiuchi.

771
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:18,580
Yet, you had sex with
her husband.

772
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,954
Didn't you think
that was a betrayal?

773
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,116
I did.

774
01:23:28,954 --> 01:23:35,326
But there isn't a law that
punishes a lover's betrayal.

775
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,794
But if you love someone
you want to be hers alone...

776
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:42,529
Even if you think so,
it's impossible to do.

777
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,949
In the first place,

778
01:23:45,995 --> 01:23:48,965
why do you think I fell
in love with Kakiuchi?

779
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,526
Because he was
your husband.

780
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,383
That was huge.

781
01:23:55,814 --> 01:23:58,340
If he wasn't your husband,

782
01:23:58,341 --> 01:24:01,436
I wouldn't look twice
at this middle-aged man.

783
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:03,546
I bet it was the same
with him.

784
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:09,553
Because I was yours,
he was intrigued by me.

785
01:24:09,936 --> 01:24:11,017
Isn't that right?

786
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:16,116
Then what am I?

787
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:23,192
Hey, Detective.
Shine the light on her.

788
01:24:23,675 --> 01:24:24,665
You used the light on me.

789
01:24:24,676 --> 01:24:27,111
Why don't you do the same
and make her talk?

790
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:28,723
Shut up!

791
01:24:31,016 --> 01:24:33,030
Look...

792
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:43,258
I felt sexual pleasure
with him.

793
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:49,747
But what about him?
I wonder about that.

794
01:24:52,895 --> 01:24:59,119
I wonder how
ejaculation feels.

795
01:25:00,879 --> 01:25:02,643
- Do you want to know?
- I do.

796
01:25:03,715 --> 01:25:05,547
But I'll never know.

797
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:14,649
A woman can't know
how intense it is.

798
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,007
Does a man really enjoy it?

799
01:25:20,924 --> 01:25:26,818
When I think like that,
I find men unsatisfactory.

800
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:32,536
Do you mean you weren't
satisfied with my body?

801
01:25:32,568 --> 01:25:34,366
That's not it.

802
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,853
I can't trust men.

803
01:25:40,243 --> 01:25:43,042
Is it Takeshi Kaikuchi
you can't trust

804
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:44,730
or all men?

805
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:49,480
That's important, so
you must think carefully.

806
01:25:52,805 --> 01:25:55,024
I will.

807
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:59,291
Who can't you trust?

808
01:26:00,063 --> 01:26:01,861
Takeshi Kakiuchi.

809
01:26:05,985 --> 01:26:11,037
But... I fell in love
with him

810
01:26:12,825 --> 01:26:19,231
and I couldn't stop
myself even for you

811
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:22,411
because my body
responded.

812
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:24,252
- Mitsuko...
- It's true.

813
01:26:24,253 --> 01:26:26,506
- When I...
- Stop.

814
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:36,037
You know,

815
01:26:36,074 --> 01:26:38,657
sometimes it was
a burden...

816
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:43,526
You were so serious.

817
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,757
"I, Sonoko Kakiuchi

818
01:26:52,765 --> 01:26:55,951
"begged Mitsuko to continue
the relationship

819
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,156
"in her apartment.

820
01:26:58,187 --> 01:27:01,407
"I groveled for
three hours licking

821
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,331
<i>“Mitsuko Shido's attractive
breasts, her underarm</i>

822
01:27:05,337 --> 01:27:07,533
"and lower abdomen...
every inch of her body.

823
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,842
"And was in ecstasy."

824
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:13,793
Did you really do that?

825
01:27:15,455 --> 01:27:19,119
How did you do it?
Show me.

826
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:24,216
Were you always a lesbian?

827
01:27:26,716 --> 01:27:28,002
Answer me.

828
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,919
I plead the fifth.

829
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:33,532
I inquire for background.

830
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:38,201
Are you glad you were
born a woman?

831
01:27:39,562 --> 01:27:41,041
- Yes.
- Why?

832
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:43,381
Why is it better
than being a man?

833
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:48,269
Because women
have a uterus.

834
01:27:49,381 --> 01:27:51,759
That doesn't mean anything.

835
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,086
Never mind that.

836
01:27:53,993 --> 01:27:57,679
Talk about your relationship
with your husband.

837
01:27:57,688 --> 01:27:59,884
No, don't.
Don't talk.

838
01:28:04,395 --> 01:28:07,547
"What shocked me

839
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:11,993
"was being in bed with my
back to my husband

840
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:13,934
"and masturbating.

841
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:19,374
"I've done it several times
after my husband fell asleep.

842
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,995
"I loved the certainty of
masturbation.

843
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,636
"My husband confided that
he did it sometimes, too."

844
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:29,770
So what's wrong
with that?

845
01:28:29,779 --> 01:28:31,611
How does that reflect
on our marriage?

846
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,072
Listen to me, Sonoko.

847
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:45,819
You must have enjoyed
doing it the last ten years?

848
01:28:47,296 --> 01:28:49,128
Tell me the truth.

849
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:52,112
It just hurt.

850
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,762
Don't lie.

851
01:28:54,946 --> 01:28:57,267
I remember, although
the times were few,

852
01:28:57,281 --> 01:28:59,443
when you were convulsing
with pleasure.

853
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,792
There are those
infrequent moments.

854
01:29:01,811 --> 01:29:03,734
More frequent than that.

855
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:08,889
So, Sonoko.

856
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,326
Tell me one thing.

857
01:29:13,297 --> 01:29:15,550
That room with the hanger?

858
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:19,397
Why did you take
Sonoko Kakiuchi there?

859
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:22,135
When did you go?

860
01:29:23,249 --> 01:29:25,468
Did you want to end all this?

861
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,843
Confess.

862
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:33,724
I said, confess.

863
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,166
What the...

864
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:38,011
No, not like that.

865
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:41,307
This is how it's done...

866
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:43,668
Ow...

867
01:29:44,854 --> 01:29:47,653
Tell me.
Confess.

868
01:29:49,776 --> 01:29:51,460
Answer me, Mitsuko.

869
01:29:52,195 --> 01:29:53,674
Say something.

870
01:29:53,697 --> 01:29:55,176
The telephone': ringing.

871
01:29:56,115 --> 01:29:58,038
Aren't you going
to get it?

872
01:29:59,844 --> 01:30:01,824
Hello?
Yeah?

873
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,590
What?

874
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,073
All right.

875
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:10,139
Who are you?

876
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:12,617
What?
What?

877
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:15,563
He hung up.

878
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,196
What?

879
01:30:17,888 --> 01:30:19,538
A whistle blower.

880
01:30:21,866 --> 01:30:23,459
<i>Mitsuko Shido': hiding</i>

881
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,629
that she's three months
pregnant.

882
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,577
That's ridiculous.

883
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,980
Who impregnated you?

884
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,568
He didn't say.

885
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,085
- Who is it?
- Stop this nonsense.

886
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,382
You have to tell the truth.

887
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,737
It's true.

888
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,497
I am pregnant.

889
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,508
Tell me the truth.

890
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,654
I'm pregnant with
your child, Sonoko.

891
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:36,290
Sonoko.

892
01:31:39,469 --> 01:31:46,455
We've already paid
a heavy price.

893
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:54,271
Can we start over?

894
01:31:58,154 --> 01:32:02,148
Live an uneventful life...

895
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,379
peaceful...

896
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:15,720
Then what was the ten years
you spent together?

897
01:32:17,757 --> 01:32:22,115
It's no use trying to be
considerate of each other now.

898
01:32:26,099 --> 01:32:28,227
Sonoko.

899
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:33,563
You have to leave him.
With me.

900
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:48,159
<i>Why not?</i>

901
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:55,305
You're pregnant,
Mitsuko.

902
01:32:59,549 --> 01:33:01,165
Yes.

903
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:06,008
My period...

904
01:33:08,474 --> 01:33:12,229
started this morning.

905
01:34:08,618 --> 01:34:10,712
That interrogation?

906
01:34:13,372 --> 01:34:17,434
That was Sonoko
holding her own wake.

907
01:34:31,224 --> 01:34:32,305
Sonoko.

908
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:40,888
You mustn't say that.
Don't.

909
01:34:50,468 --> 01:34:51,856
Sonoko.

910

Directed by
HIROTO YOKOYAMA
