1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,918
-Whatare you gonna cook?
- Your favourite.

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,911
What, again?

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,356
- Well, this is the last one.
- What, you mean no more tomatoes?

4
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,750
You can never have
enough tins of tomatoes, eh?

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,195
Instead...

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,113
we've got five tins of chickpeas.

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,590
That should last at least five year, eh?

8
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,279
- Fancy a glass of wine?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

9
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,790
We're in luck.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,396
Drinkable.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,629
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,469
Well, I'm not fine, it's all fucked, but...

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,314
- Our children are safe, aren't they?
- Totally. Yeah.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,676
Thank God we paid for that school trip.
Imagine if we hadn't!

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,957
I can't. I can't imagine. I can't imagine.

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,034
And I don't want to imagine. I don't...
Listen, they're far, far away.

17
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,076
And they're safe and sound.

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,151
OK?

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,469
OK.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,991
Don't worry...

22
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,914
gorgeous.

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,315
Not interrupting, am l?

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,388
No.

25
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,755
I found this in the cellar.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,516
I'd forgotten all about it.
I thought we could have them after dinner.

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,238
Yeah.

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,952
- It smells wonderful.
- And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

29
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,998
- It is indeed, Geoff.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,197
There's chocolate for after,
courtesy of your good wife.

31
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,590
What have we here? I get blackberries.

32
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,717
Vanilla. Notes of autumn.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,036
Karen?

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,716
He'll be hungry.

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,997
When he gets back
he'll want something to eat.

36
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,116
- Here we go again.
- Jacob, no.

37
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,193
Let me tell you something. It's five days
since your boyfriend ran out on us.

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,238
If he's still breathing,
he won't be interested in pasta.

39
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,038
Jacob!

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,953
- lt'll be your fucking neck!
- Don't say that!

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,076
- Out of order, Jacob.
- Why?

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,470
We all know it's true.
The sooner she faces it, the better.

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,872
There are no survivors.
It's just us in here and them out there.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,510
- Sam?
- Quiet!

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,388
- God, it's a boy.
- Wait, wait. You don't know who's out there.

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,189
- Please, let me in!
- Don, it's a kid!

47
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,158
Help! Let me in!

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,037
Bloody hell.

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,270
- Please! Please, let me in!
- We're coming.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,271
Let me in!

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,999
Please! Help! Let me in!

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,196
Please!

53
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,431
Get in. Come on, get in. Come here.

54
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,875
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,353
- Where have you come from?
- Sandford.

56
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,034
Sandford's upriver a few miles.

57
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,991
- How did you get here?
- They were chasing me. Screaming.

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,389
I was scared. I ran.

59
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,950
I tried other houses.
They were empty.

60
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,592
I came through the woods
and I followed the river until I got here.

61
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,910
- Who were chasing you?
- My mum.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,230
My dad.

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,073
They're trying to kill me.

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,118
- There's others, too.
- How many?

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,277
- Loads.
- Sam?

66
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,150
- It's got me! It's got my arm!
- Karen, no!

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,151
Help me!

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,589
Alice! Get outta here!
Get down the escape hatch, go! Go!

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,795
- Geoff, I can't see. I can't see!
- Hold onto my hand!

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,357
Die, you fucker! Die!

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,909
Come back!

72
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,031
Oh, God!

73
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,755
Keep going. Follow Jacob.
Keep going. Sally, there's no time.

74
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,513
- We can't leave them!
- Sally, come on!

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,397
Go!

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,235
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

77
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,196
Where are you?

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,317
- Where are you?
- Alice! Alice, no! Alice!

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,717
Geoff, come on!

80
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,834
Come on!

81
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,509
Geoff!

82
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,198
Sally, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, Sally!

83
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,157
No! Jacob! Help me!

84
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,598
Alice! Alice!

85
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,679
- Where are you?
- Come on! Leave him!

86
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,591
- I see him there!
- Leave him!

87
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,750
Let go!

88
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,555
Quick!

89
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,469
Don! Help us!

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,913
Don!

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,115
Don!

92
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,191
Get in there!

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,637
Don!

94
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,993
Don!

95
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,396
Don!

96
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,875
Jacob!

97
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,311
Come on!

98
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,669
Jacob!

99
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,917
Dear God!

100
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,396
Jacob!

101
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,269
Jacob!

102
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,194
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

103
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,271
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

104
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,916
Welcome to London.

105
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,553
Hey, Doyle, you having fun down there?

106
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,995
You can kiss my ass.

107
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,356
This is the worst combat I ever saw.
Where's the combat?

108
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,509
I hear you.

109
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,830
- Give me something to shoot.
- Too easy.

110
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,957
North-east of med centre,
20th floor, three windows in.

111
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,828
- Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.
- Oh, bug-nuts. Him again.

112
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,354
I don't see him.
Where is Fester Fucknut?

113
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,954
His dick in his hand on the 20th floor.

114
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,476
Next to the fire exit.
I think he needs a jerk-off extender.

115
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,120
Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

116
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,077
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

117
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,755
- Think it might be your dad, Doyle.
- You got me.

118
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,519
Shit.

119
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,712
- Colonel Phillips here. What is your status?
- Good morning, Colonel.

120
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,679
- Morning.
- I'm watching the new arrivals disembark.

121
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,388
Yes, Major?

122
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,597
- lt'll take all morning to process them.
- Copy.

123
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,990
No one told me that
we're now admitting children.

124
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,195
Just follow around to your right.

125
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,439
Green and brown. Interesting iris variation.

126
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,514
It's usually hereditary.
Do one of your parents have the same?

127
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,670
My mother. She did.

128
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,193
- How old are you, Andy?
- 12.

129
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,236
I think that makes you
the youngest person in the country.

130
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,754
Well, your blood pressure is A-OK

131
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,071
and you're negative
on any serious diseases or afflictions.

132
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,230
I think you're OK to come in.

133
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,276
Welcome back to Britain.

134
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,879
We are headed for our area
of security and reconstruction

135
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,235
designated as District One.

136
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,357
District One is located on the lsle of Dogs.

137
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,675
Although the lsle of Dogs is completely safe,
the surrounding area of London is not.

138
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,754
Large numbers of bodies are still not cleared
from the original outbreak of infection.

139
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,628
Rats and wild dogs are prevalent,
as is disease.

140
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,917
New arrivals are reminded
for their own safety

141
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,120
it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

142
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,877
You will be joining 15,000 civilians
who are already resident in District One.

143
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,478
As we approach your new home, you'll notice
a dramatically increased military presence.

144
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,279
The US Army is responsible for your safety.

145
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,718
We will do everything we can do
to make your repatriation as easy as possible.

146
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,873
Inside District One, however,
we believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

147
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,953
We have hot and cold running water,
24-hour electricity,

148
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,318
a medical centre,
a supermarket and even a pub.

149
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,949
We're nearly home.

150
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,993
- Dad! Dad!
- It's Dad! Come on.

151
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,677
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

152
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,109
I missed you so much.

153
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,832
Are you all right? Are you all right?

154
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,392
Guys. I never thought
I'd see you again, you know that?

155
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,358
Let's get something to eat.

156
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,349
I should have been notified
before children were brought in.

157
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,159
We've not established
the protocol for minors.

158
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,314
We have issues of disease and sanitation.
We don't fully understand the virus yet.

159
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,870
We understand that it did not manage
to go cross-species,

160
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,988
that it did not manage to go airborne and that
the last infected human died six months ago.

161
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,878
- We weren't here six months ago.
- Major.

162
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,428
- What are you afraid of?
- What if it comes back?

163
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,114
- It won't come back.
- What if it does?

164
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,794
If it comes back, we kill it.

165
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,311
Code Red.

166
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,231
Come on, guys.

167
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,828
What about this place, then, Andy?

168
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,676
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

169
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,517
Look at the camera.

170
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,795
This way. Come through.

171
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,798
It's 25 floors. We've got the penthouse
up there. Believe me.

172
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,314
ID, sir. Thank you.

173
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,075
- So, what do you do here, Dad?
- What do I do? I'm a section officer.

174
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,711
I keep the lights on, the water running,
the heat running. See this? Look.

175
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,113
That says triple A - "access all areas".
That's me. I basically run the place, you know.

176
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,079
No. You're the caretaker really, aren't you?

177
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,989
No, I run the place.

178
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,639
Like it?

179
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,632
- It's amazing!
- Even better than sunny Spain?

180
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,397
You ought to have seen the camps. There
were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets.

181
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,233
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

182
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,275
We'll be moving to a new house soon.
A couple of months, in fact.

183
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,590
A new house?

184
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,716
Yeah.

185
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,831
Listen, I hope you guys understand.

186
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,629
We're not gonna be able
to go back to our old house.

187
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,239
It's outside the security zone and I don't think
I'd want to go back there, even if I could.

188
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,914
What happened, Dad? To Mum?

189
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,591
Yeah.

190
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,031
Yeah.

191
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,158
Do you wanna sit down
and I'll tell you all about it?

192
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,712
Your mum and I were hiding in a house.

193
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,071
A wee cottage.

194
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,830
It was an old couple that owned it

195
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,595
and they were there, too.

196
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,911
Three other people.

197
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,955
And we were...

198
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,238
just trying to stay alive, I suppose.

199
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,359
We were doing OK for a while.
And then we were attacked.

200
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,468
They came in through the kitchen window.

201
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,873
They were really fast, you know.

202
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,111
Chased us.

203
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,831
Chased your mum.

204
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,588
And we were trapped.
Trapped in the bedroom.

205
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,269
Don!

206
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,311
And I see...

207
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,831
I see them...

208
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,834
biting her.

209
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,115
I couldn't do anything.

210
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,195
I tried to go back.

211
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,989
She was already gone.

212
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,755
She was already gone.

213
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,595
Was there nothing you could do?

214
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,832
No, there was nothing I could do.

215
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,435
I managed to get away.

216
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,677
Just running, running, running...

217
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,358
I got to this military camp.

218
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,236
And you know the rest. You know I've been
in quarantine waiting for you to come back.

219
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,718
We're just happy you're still alive.

220
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,075
I'm sorry.

221
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,591
Doyle...

222
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,070
- Doyle, you bastard.
- Boy, I've never seen you get so white.

223
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,957
- Fuck you.
- Good morning.

224
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,749
Yeah, fuck outta here, man.
I'm having all good dreams.

225
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,231
Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies,
I'm laying in bed with my wife...

226
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,118
And now I'm back in this shithole.

227
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,553
- I know.
- Yeah?

228
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,677
I had that same dream about your wife.

229
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,116
- Quit fucking with me.
- Get outta here.

230
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,196
- All right. Next time I'm gonna shoot you.
- All right. See you later, family man.

231
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,478
I told you, I'm gonna shoot you.

232
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,914
What's on the TV tonight?

233
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,118
Are you OK? Bad dream?

234
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,194
I get worried I'm gonna forget
what she looks like.

235
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,271
You won't forget.

236
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,718
I don't even have a picture of her.

237
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,711
You won't forget.

238
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,116
Promise?

239
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,191
Yeah.

240
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,600
Andy, we agreed.
You heard what they said.

241
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,673
It's only dogs and rats out there.
We'll get what we want and come back again.

242
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,991
- We should've told Dad.
- It's fine. Trust me.

243
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,753
They won't even know we're gone.

244
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,949
Where are you going?

245
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,955
Base, come in. We have two strays
who slipped out the north gate.

246
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,589
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

247
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,955
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

248
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,519
Yes! Yeah!

249
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,875
London's mine!

250
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,274
That's what we need.

251
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,275
Yeah, if it had keys.

252
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,111
Wait here.

253
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,635
Let's go.

254
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,191
There you go.

255
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,913
Tam!

256
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,711
Tam!

257
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,951
Tam?

258
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,275
Tammy, are you there?

259
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,395
Tam?

260
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,198
Tammy!

261
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,391
Tammy!

262
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,438
Tammy, this is stupid.
You're not being funny.

263
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,069
I knew it.

264
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,108
You're hurting me!

265
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,516
No! No! No! No!

266
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,716
No, don't go! No!

267
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,872
No!

268
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,309
No!

269
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,279
Doyle.

270
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,954
I got your puppies.

271
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,436
No!

272
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,830
Get off me! Get off me!

273
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,797
I apologise for these precautions.

274
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,954
It's standard protocol with any survivors,
though we haven't had to do it for a while.

275
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,716
The last survivor we came across
was over two months ago.

276
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,030
Can you tell me anything
about how you managed to keep alive

277
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,031
while you were gone so long?

278
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,878
Do you know of any other survivors?

279
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,111
OK.

280
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,795
I'm just going to take a blood sample.

281
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,871
It won't hurt.

282
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,079
Have you come into direct contact
with the infected?

283
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,514
OK.

284
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,035
I want to see my children.

285
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,110
Of course. Of course.

286
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,114
- Mr Harris.
- Yeah.

287
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,159
- We've found your kids.
- Oh, thank God. Thank you so much.

288
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,435
We found your wife, too.

289
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,920
Can they hear me?

290
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,788
- So, what do you two think you're playing at?
- You said you saw her die.

291
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,348
- What?
- You said you saw her die!

292
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,956
- I didn't say that.
- You did. You did.

293
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,508
Baby, I didn't use those words.

294
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,990
This is... I don't know.
I mean, it's confusing, you know.

295
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,755
It's... it's very hard
for you to imagine, you know?

296
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,594
- l... It's too hard to explain.
- Well, try to explain it, Dad! Try!

297
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,196
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mum... die.

298
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,670
Or I wouldn't have told you that.
I was sure.

299
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,118
Look, guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here...

300
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,509
but it's good. OK?

301
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,273
That's the point. Mum's alive.

302
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,555
I want to see her!

303
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,559
There's no question, sir.

304
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,790
She has the virus. She's infected.

305
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,472
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

306
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,917
- I don't know.
- Speculate.

307
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,353
A genetic abnormality which acts
as some sort of natural immunity?

308
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,276
But the virus is still in her blood and saliva,
so technically she's not immune.

309
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,476
She's a carrier.

310
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,154
She has the ability to infect others?

311
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,231
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

312
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,510
If this woman has natural immunity
she is incredibly valuable.

313
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,674
Her blood could contain
the key to a vaccine, even a cure.

314
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,309
Alice.

315
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,591
Hey, baby.

316
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,070
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was scared.

317
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,950
I shouldn't have run away.

318
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,951
I was scared.

319
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,749
Please forgive me.

320
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,355
Please, sir. We need time to study her.
We need to run some tests.

321
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,432
You can run tests on her corpse, Major.

322
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,635
I love you, Don.

323
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,711
Yeah.

324
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,990
Oh, God, I love you, too.

325
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,439
Don!

326
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,478
Clear channels to control room.
Control room, this is General Stone.

327
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,917
All forces under my control, prepare
to execute Code Red on my command.

328
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,638
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

329
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,395
Break, break, break, all stations.
Sunray in 30 seconds.

330
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,234
We have an outbreak in the med centre.
All units, safeties off.

331
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,880
- Affirmative.
- Open air cav transmission.

332
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,238
- Prepare containment areas.
- Move civilians to containment areas.

333
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,313
Command personnel secure in bunker.
Confirm order to lock down.

334
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,630
Lockdown confirmed.

335
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,915
Execute Code Red.

336
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,349
Flynn, come in. Flynn, do you hear
that Code Red or am I losing my shit?

337
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,237
I was about to ask the same thing.

338
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,634
Ten-hut!

339
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,230
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll be back in a moment.

340
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,355
- It's probably nothing.
- Tam, it didn't sound like nothing.

341
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,749
He said he'd be back in a moment.

342
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,395
Are you OK? Let's go.

343
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,708
Come on.

344
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,315
- Move, move, move! Let's go!
- Andy, keep hold of my hand.

345
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,595
OK, come on. Keep it moving.

346
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,716
Come on, people. Come on.

347
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,349
- Don't push.
- Sir, all civilians into the containment area.

348
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,753
These kids are with me. It's important they are
kept protected. I need to get them out of here.

349
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,072
- Sir, no exceptions. It's a Code Red.
- I know what it is. My name is...

350
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,832
- Andy!
- Scarlet!

351
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,433
Andy!

352
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,748
- Tammy!
- Andy!

353
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,512
- Andy, wait!
- Scarlet!

354
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,398
- Just wait, Andy! We're coming!
- Calm down. Calm down, now.

355
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,748
Move down. Move down the room.
Keep moving. Go, go, go. Come on.

356
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,958
- You think it's a drill?
- Of course not. Someone saw an infected.

357
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,952
Keep moving. That's it.
Good, good. Let's go.

358
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,873
- Why are you sealing us inside?
- For your protection.

359
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,669
- Just guard the door. Don't lock it.
- It's for your own protection.

360
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,354
- We've got to find Andy.
- We'll find him.

361
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,715
- Shut down civilian areas.
- Sector one, lockdown.

362
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,191
- Sector eight, lockdown.
- Sector three, lockdown.

363
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,910
Switch to emergency lighting.
Use of non-lethal force authorised.

364
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,434
All snipers in position.

365
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,230
- Ground forces to med centre.
- Ground force to med centre.

366
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,076
Sector one covered.

367
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,993
Everyone, stay calm.

368
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,917
Dad.

369
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,311
No! My dad... my dad!

370
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,877
He's in here!

371
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,319
No!

372
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,428
Containment area, containment area,
move into position.

373
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,788
No!

374
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,315
I confirm, only target infected.

375
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,709
Roger that. Only target infected.

376
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,239
Targeting right. I've had two down.

377
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,834
Watch out for the friendlies.

378
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,150
I can't get a shot.

379
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,394
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

380
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,113
We got a group there at 12 o'clock.

381
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,479
- We've got one at three o'clock.
- On the ground, got four.

382
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,750
16 down.

383
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,435
I got two by the Jeep.

384
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,037
- Jesus.
- I don't see who's a target.

385
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,799
On the move! On the move!
Moving right! Moving right!

386
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,399
I can't find
the designated target here.

387
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,394
I cannot be target-specific.

388
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,109
Whisky Three, why have you stopped firing?
Come in.

389
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,433
Abandon selective targeting.
Shoot everything. Targets are now free.

390
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,590
We've lost control.

391
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:20,430
All units, all units, this is Medical
Commanding Officer Sierra Lima.

392
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,274
Please be on the lookout for a young boy,
age 12, name, Andy.

393
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,950
If he is located he must be immediately
evacuated from the containment zone.

394
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,031
We have to find Andy.

395
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,873
- We have to find him!
- It's OK. It's OK.

396
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,509
We're gonna find him, OK?
We're gonna find him, I promise.

397
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,072
I'm gonna get him out of here.
I'm gonna get you both out of here. Trust me.

398
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,709
- New shot.
- Abandon selective targeting.

399
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,352
- Confirm order?
- Target everyone at ground level.

400
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,716
No exceptions. Repeat, no exceptions.

401
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,514
Come on!

402
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,076
Three down.
One of ours down there. Three o'clock.

403
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,270
- Taking them down.
- Left sector, three o'clock.

404
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,275
Kid! Over here!

405
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,794
Kid! Over here!

406
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,470
- I got him.
- Well, take him out. Take him out.

407
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,916
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

408
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,316
Fuck.

409
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,751
Fuck.

410
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,711
Fuck!

411
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,639
Tam?

412
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,311
This is madness.

413
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,472
- What's happening?
- They're shooting everybody.

414
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,475
- Why? It makes no sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

415
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,357
It's Code Red.

416
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,637
I saw Dad.

417
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,029
Where?

418
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,554
He's one of them.

419
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,877
Step one, kill the infected.

420
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,997
Step two, containment.

421
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,675
If containment fails...

422
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,878
step three, extermination.

423
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,075
Now they won't stop until everyone is dead.

424
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,711
So what do we do?

425
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,513
I mean, I'm not sitting around here
to get exterminated.

426
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,477
We've gotta get outta here.

427
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,190
If we take one step out of that door,
if the infected don't get us, the snipers will.

428
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,477
Well, you don't have a choice, my friend.

429
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,997
Right now it's dark out there. The snipers
can see you through their night scopes,

430
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,995
but at least you have
some limited cover from the infected.

431
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,278
But, you know, if you wanna wait till sun-up
then you're as good as dead.

432
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,476
Who are you?

433
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,552
Sergeant Doyle. Delta rooftop unit.

434
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,469
Why aren't you at your post?

435
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,317
Why aren't you?

436
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,919
Look, you guys do what you want,
but I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.

437
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,794
You coming?

438
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,951
All right, come on.

439
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,234
- Less shooting.
- Maybe it's under control.

440
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,629
Or there are less shooters.

441
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,751
All right, listen. I need you guys
to look at me and only me, OK?

442
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,276
You run when I run.
Be my shadow. That's it, all right?

443
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,555
Get around back. Watch her.

444
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,669
Ready? Let's go.

445
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,675
Stay.

446
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,149
Doyle, come in.

447
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,994
- Flynn, go.
- Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

448
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,075
- Ground level, District One.
- Shit. Close frequency.

449
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,196
Copy that.

450
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,592
What the fuck are you doing there?
You got some serious shit coming your way.

451
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,195
- We already got some serious shit.
- I'm not playing. This is worse.

452
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,273
The air cav just got their orders.
They're firebombing all of District One.

453
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,715
- That was fast.
- Outbreak is out of control.

454
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,999
They're taking no chances. So unless you are
out of the target zone, you are getting cooked.

455
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,356
- How long we got?
- They're on their way. Four minutes, tops.

456
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,673
But listen. I got some clear landing ground
at Regent's Park. That's the pick-up point.

457
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,629
- I'll be back in touch.
- Doyle, you fucking better be.

458
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,755
All right, look, guys, we gotta run.
Just stay low and stay fast, OK?

459
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,035
After me. Let's go.

460
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,592
- Snipers! Get down! Snipers!
- Back! Back! Back!

461
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,432
Get back! Get back!

462
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,318
Andy, get back!

463
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,198
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

464
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,277
- Shit.
- Fuck!

465
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,158
It's OK. It's just a flesh wound.

466
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,197
Multiple shots, one hit.

467
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,028
He's a panicker, no marksman.

468
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,350
OK.

469
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,558
- What's your name?
- Sam.

470
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,110
OK, Sam. Come here. Get closer.
Do you see that doorway?

471
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,832
I need you to run as fast as you can in a
zigzag like this, OK? Don't stop for anything.

472
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,278
- You want me to be bait?
- He'll take shots at you, but he'll miss.

473
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,148
He's gonna expose his position.
Means I get a shot at him. I won't miss.

474
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,232
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Stay back.

475
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,598
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.
You want that?

476
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,999
No!

477
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,479
Andy!

478
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,595
Fuck!

479
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,070
Good work, kid.

480
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,433
- The fence!
- Watch it, watch it. Behind me.

481
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,476
Go! Go! Go!

482
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,509
Come on. Come on, come on.

483
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,151
Jump!

484
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,518
This is Red Fox One pouring whisky.

485
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,310
Keep going!
We'll be safe under the river.

486
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,993
Go! Go!

487
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,833
Come on. Come on!

488
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,991
Run! Run!

489
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,868
Bring in biological units.
Fan out from predesignated positions.

490
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,155
Bio units, copy.

491
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:58,076
Use of chemical weapons authorised.
Repeat, chemical weapons are authorised.

492
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,031
Stay close.

493
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,835
They left us again.

494
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,599
Do you think Mum's still alive?

495
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,511
Not this time.

496
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,509
- You look a little pale.
- Blood makes me nauseous.

497
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,637
You never answered my question.

498
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,154
About why you left your post.

499
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,390
When I got that boy in my sights.

500
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,920
That's not a target any more.

501
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,437
When we were separated...

502
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,034
I thought I'd lost you, too.

503
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,751
We won't get separated again.

504
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,276
We'll stay together, whatever happens.

505
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,037
Whatever happens.

506
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,075
It was all fucked.

507
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,588
You could hear it all over the radios. Fucked.

508
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,029
Anyway, what about you?

509
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,756
- Why the hell are you here?
- Their mother had very special blood.

510
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,710
A natural kind of immunity to the virus.

511
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,719
Not all genetic traits are passed on, you know.

512
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,952
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

513
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,918
But they might have it.

514
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,991
It's a possibility.

515
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,999
So their lives are far more valuable than mine.

516
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,315
Or yours.

517
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,593
I got it.

518
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,071
Doyle!

519
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,439
Doyle!

520
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,353
- Flynn, go.
- You made it!

521
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,433
I knew you'd do it. Listen. I'm coming
to you right now, but keep a lookout.

522
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,956
There's sightings of infected
that have escaped the firebombing.

523
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,918
- Give me an ETA.
- About 60.

524
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,912
- Minutes?
- No. Seconds.

525
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,195
All right, kids. Come on.

526
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,796
Get down. Down! Down!

527
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,234
I see you. I'm coming in.

528
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,952
Jesus, Doyle, you got people with you.
Who the fuck are those people?

529
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,353
Doyle! Who the fuck are those people?

530
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,513
I can't take 'em. We will be shot out of the sky
if I try to land at the base.

531
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,990
No, no, don't take 'em to base!
Take 'em over the Channel!

532
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,469
- What?
- We gotta get these kids outta here.

533
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,279
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking 'em!

534
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,796
- Get me out of here!
- Sam, come back!

535
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,317
Hey, get the fuck off there!
Get that fucker off my ski!

536
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,392
- OK, you wanna fly with me, asshole?
- Sam!

537
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,869
Come on!

538
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,634
Fuck!

539
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,632
We're gonna die down here!
Do something!

540
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,029
You wanna fuck?

541
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,116
Come on, you fuckers!

542
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,957
Get up! Run! Move it!

543
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,077
Don't look back! Keep going!

544
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,156
Keep going.

545
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,915
Fuck you, pussy!

546
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,750
Doyle, come in! Doyle!

547
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,628
You need to get to safe ground.
Get to the stadium. Ditch those people.

548
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,870
I'm not taking 'em.

549
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,755
Flynn, come in.
Flynn, I know you can hear me.

550
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,389
Fuck the Code Red, fuck the chain
of command. I need an extraction.

551
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,835
You better fucking be there, cos we will be.

552
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,878
You OK? Yeah?

553
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,394
I bet you're tired, huh? Me, too.

554
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,871
OK, I need you to help me, OK?
Help me with your sister. You got that?

555
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,270
Come on. Gotta go. Gotta go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

556
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,668
Gas! Get back! Get back!

557
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,355
- Tammy, Andy, get in the car!
- It's gas! Run! Come on!

558
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,069
Come on, get in the car! Get in the car!

559
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,754
Come on! Get in! Get in!

560
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,356
Get in, Andy!

561
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,276
Go, go, go!

562
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,996
Lock the doors!

563
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,509
Get the vents, get the vents.

564
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,068
- It won't start!
- We'll be fine, all right? Just keep trying.

565
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,151
It won't start!

566
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,070
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep trying. Keep trying!

567
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,790
- It won't start! It won't fucking start!
- Fuck me!

568
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,348
- It won't start!
- Put your foot on the clutch.

569
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:30,233
All right. You pop the clutch when I tell you,
OK? You get them to the stadium. OK?

570
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,794
Keep your head down.

571
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,035
I'll meet you there.

572
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,269
OK.

573
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,118
- Doyle!
- Doyle!

574
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,510
Pop it! Pop it!

575
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,511
Go! Go!

576
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,755
Go!

577
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,194
Oh, my God...

578
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,549
OK.

579
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,031
Fuck!

580
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,718
- Scarlet!
- Fuck!

581
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,231
They're shooting at us!

582
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,635
Hold on!

583
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,715
Shit.

584
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,311
OK, let's go.

585
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,718
Come on, through here, guys.

586
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,875
Just hold onto the rails.

587
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,591
Careful, guys.

588
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,275
OK.

589
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,313
OK.

590
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,198
It's OK. I can see. I can see.

591
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,238
Keep going down.

592
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,948
OK.

593
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,113
Just keep walking straight, guys.

594
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,395
Holding against the wall.

595
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,597
You're doing really well. You're doing great.

596
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,353
OK, get back! Get back against the wall!

597
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,715
OK. Good.

598
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:23,237
Just stay close. Slightly to the right, Andy.

599
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:27,036
It's OK. I can see. It's OK.
I've got the night sight on.

600
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,750
You're doing great. Just hold... hold the rail.
Nice and slow down the stairs, OK?

601
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,638
Stop! Stop! Stop right now!

602
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,029
OK, Tammy, to your left. Good.

603
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,954
OK. Good girl. Just straight down.
Nice and slow. Slower.

604
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,758
Stop! Stop, honey.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. All right?

605
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,517
Grab hold of the other railing, OK?
Go to your right.

606
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,116
- Scarlet, I can't see anything!
- Go to your right. Go to your right.

607
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:59,035
All right. Keep trying to skip... Just put your
leg far out in front of you, OK? Good girl.

608
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,395
Hold onto the rail. Careful!

609
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,350
Tammy!

610
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,715
Andy!

611
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,791
Where are you?

612
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,754
Andy! Where are you? Andy!

613
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,796
Answer me!

614
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,553
Where are you?

615
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,199
Tammy!

616
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,993
- Where are you?
- Scarlet!

617
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,993
- Tammy, I'm coming. I'm right here.
- Scarlet, I've lost Andy!

618
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,958
- I'm right here.
- I've lost Andy.

619
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,476
There we go.
Just come slowly towards me.

620
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,596
I've lost Andy.

621
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,391
We'll find Andy.

622
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,079
Scarlet!

623
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,718
Andy!

624
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,234
Where are you?

625
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,198
Scarlet.

626
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,998
Tammy?

627
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,150
Tammy?

628
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,992
Scarlet?

629
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,439
No!

630
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,869
Don!

631
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,198
We stay together - whatever happens.

632
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,669
- No!
- Andy!

633
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,796
Andy, no!

634
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,871
No! Andy!

635
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,434
Andy! Andy!

636
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,154
No!

01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,112
No!

638
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,714
Andy!

639
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,635
Tam, am I one of them?

640
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,791
No.

641
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,276
No, you're not.

642
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,871
Stop!

643
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,279
Where's Doyle?

644
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,835
Where's Doyle?

645
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,954
It's just us.

646
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,913
Come on.

647
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,831
Get in. Come on.

648
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,628
Vous m'entendez?

649
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,870
Can you hear me?

650
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,509
Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me?

651
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,591
Is anybody there?

652
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,235
We need your help.
