1
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,042
America...

2
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,375
I say to the people of America...

3
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:20,708
This moment is our chance to...

4
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,542
Enough...

5
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,500
To make of our own lives
what we will. It is...

6
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,417
That pushes us forward.

7
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,500
The American promise alive.

8
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:48,667
It is that promise that's
always set this country apart.

9
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,375
It's a promise
that says each of us has the freedom...

10
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,167
to make of our own lives what we will.

11
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,542
You're late!
You're fucking 3 hours late!

12
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,750
Don't start on me.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You couldn't
have gotten me somebody else?

14
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,083
This item looks like shit,
and he's got no fucking manners.

15
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,667
I'm not gonna
put up with shit like this.

16
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,625
All right, look, you asked me
to get somebody that was all right.

17
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,417
You know, Russell here,
he's kind of a wiseass,

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
but he's all right if you can stand him.

19
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,333
Yeah, and a guy like you,
you want a job done...

20
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,250
you don't
have the balls to do it yourself,

21
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,292
I think you ought to try pretty hard to.

22
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't like this guy.
He's too fucking fresh for my blood.

23
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,292
Russell, will you shut the fuck up
and stop jerking the guy's chain?

24
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,542
He's trying to do us a favor here.

25
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,417
He's trying to do us a fucking favor?

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,333
Yeah, he's trying to do us a favor.

27
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,792
I thought
he wanted us to do him a favor.

28
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:55,208
Is that the straight shit, Squirrel?
You trying to do me a favor?

29
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,375
Get the fuck out!

30
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:00,000
Man, what are you
talking to me like that? Come on.

31
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,083
You sell people dry cleaning
and you talk to them like that?

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,208
You know something,
the two guys I get to do this...

33
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,250
they're gonna cut up about 30,
I figure 30K.

34
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,750
And Australians like him. Frankie...

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,667
Australians like him
I can buy for 80 cents a dozen.

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,500
They throw another one in for free.

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,542
So you know what you do, Frankie?
You get me another guy...

38
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,417
cause I'm not gonna
put up with this kind of shit.

39
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
Look, John,
it'll be all right, okay? Trust me.

40
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,667
Hey, my friend, you picked
the wrong guy for a thing once.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,583
You remember that?
You remember the doctor?

42
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,333
And I knew, I just knew
that this was the wrong guy.

43
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,667
What do I do? I take him anyway.

44
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,042
John, I need the dough.
Don't fuck around with me like that.

45
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,292
And after 7 years in the can
and my kids are growing up...

46
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,292
and my business isn't doing
what it should be, you know,

47
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,292
I can't get that back.

48
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,667
So from now on, I'm taking
my time and that's all there is to it.

49
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
I had my last fuck-up.

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,750
Call me Thursday. Thursday I'll know.

51
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,167
I've got to give
a new direction to this economy.

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,792
Come on. That a girl. Good girl. Look.

53
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:19,375
All right, you're here.
So we going out there or what?

54
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,167
That depends.

55
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,167
Don't depend on me.

56
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,208
It's Thursday.
You coming with me or not'?

57
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:27,250
Man. Fuck that guy. He's a dick.

58
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,667
Doesn't know if he wants me or not.
Well, I don't need him, mate.

59
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,625
I got my own thing going on, mate.

60
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,083
Me and Kenny, you know,
we're snatching these dogs...

61
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,083
purebreds,
and selling 'em down in Florida.

62
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,000
I got 5 grand in the kit, mate.

63
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,333
When I get 7, I'm gonna go
and buy an ounce of smack...

64
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,583
and I'm gonna become a dealer.

65
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,583
Plus this afternoon...

66
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,042
I got a girl I can go and fuck.

67
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,667
Right?

68
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,542
So I'm thinking it's a choice,
you know. Tough one.

69
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,042
Am I gonna go and fuck a girl

70
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,500
or am I gonna go to a meeting
with the Squirrel?

71
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,625
Fuck a girl, meeting with Squirrel.

72
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,500
Fuck Squirrel.
I think I'll go fuck the girl.

73
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,542
I'd like to see this girl.

74
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,792
The kind of girl you can
screw off an ad in the paper?

75
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,208
Beautiful. Probably got a couple
of handfuls of broken glass in there.

76
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:18,583
Well, yeah, these girls, you see 'em...

77
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,755
you probably wouldn't want to rape them,

78
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,583
but all the plumbing works just fine.

79
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,333
So I guess you're not coming then.

80
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:34,583
Look, go ahead, see if you can
get him to tell you anything about it.

81
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,542
If you still like it then, then I'm in.

82
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,333
If not, if he doesn't want me, I'm out.

83
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,125
But I'm not wasting an afternoon on it.

84
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,208
That much, I'm not doing.

85
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,000
There it is.
All right, fuck it.

86
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know. I've been asking around
about him, you know and...

87
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,083
I mean, not too many people.

88
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,125
Now.l don't want
everybody to think that...

89
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,208
maybe I got something in mind

90
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,458
and well, nobody knows this guy.

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,333
I'm afraid he's not the kind of guy
we want to have in with us.

92
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,792
See, these people
are not the kind of people

93
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,167
that are around a bank or something.

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,625
They expect maybe someday some guy's
gonna come in there and rob them

95
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,125
and it's not their money.

96
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,000
These are not
these kind of people at all.

97
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,333
They see somebody come in there
that's not absolutely cool...

98
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,042
that they can tell right off
doesn't know what he's doing...

99
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,333
they're liable,
some of them to get up off their ass

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,083
and start making trouble.

101
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,500
They're gonna fucking shoot somebody,

102
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,792
for Christ's sake,
and I don't want that.

103
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,458
There's no reason for that, you know?

104
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,208
You don't get any more money
or anything like that.

105
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,458
It don't make any sense.

106
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:36,292
Yeah, I don't mean anything.
At least you got an idea, you know?

107
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,000
You still coming up dry'?

108
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,042
Yeah. You know what I did?

109
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,167
I goes down to probation,

110
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,375
like I actually believe in all that shit
they're handing out there.

111
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,417
"Here's something for you.

112
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,250
Place in Halbrook needs assemblers..."

113
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,667
"$130 a week,
4:00 to midnight, steady work."

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,417
"It'll keep you
out of trouble." Beautiful.

115
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,375
Well, I live in Somerville.

116
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,042
How the hell am I gonna get to
Halbrook in the middle of the afternoon?

117
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,708
Never mind,
for Christ's sake, how the fuck...

118
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,292
am I gonna get home
in the middle of the night?

119
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,417
"Buy a car."
"With what? I haven't got no money."

120
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,000
What the fuck am I gonna buy a car with?

121
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,583
Why the fuck they think
I need a job in the first place?

122
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,667
Fucking assholes.

123
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,000
You know, then I see Russell.
You know, he's coming right along.

124
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,125
You know, probably buy himself
a hotel in the next couple weeks or so.

125
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,292
Not on dogs.

126
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,458
He's just doing that.

127
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,167
He's gonna use that to buy
some stuff, soon as he gets enough.

128
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,458
He's gonna get nabbed.

129
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,375
He ought to go in the drugstore
and buy himself a new toothbrush

130
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,167
cause he's gonna need it.

131
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,250
Well, John, you know,
you're the guy with the angle.

132
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,292
Tell me what the angle is.

133
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,458
You think dog-lover there
can handle a card game?

134
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,625
Shit, those fucking things?
Those things are protected.

135
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,000
You can't do those things
unless you're so fucking stupid...

136
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,667
you actually like everybody
going around trying to off you.

137
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,333
There's one you can do.

138
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,083
John, there's 10 I can do.
I know of at least 10 I can do..

139
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,250
But then after, I'm gonna have

140
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,333
at least 8 hot ginzos out
looking for me.

141
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,000
No, no, not this one,
because the minute it fucking happens..

142
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,167
They're gonna know right off who did it.

143
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,167
For some reason, John,

144
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,708
that don't
make me feel better, you know.

145
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,208
No, not us. They're not even
gonna be thinking it might be us.

146
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,380
They're gonna pick one guy right away...

147
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,458
go whack him out
and that's gonna be end of it.

148
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:11,000
You and I are gonna cut up about
$40,000, $50,000, no fucking sweat.

149
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,417
I don't know how I goes for
setting somebody up, you know?

150
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,083
You're not setting him up.
He set himself up.

151
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,542
Markie Trattman runs this game.

152
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,792
This is Markie's second game.

153
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,208
The first one got knocked over...

154
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,458
and it was Markie who did it.

155
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,625
See. Four years ago.
Markie was running this game...

156
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,375
and he sees all the cash
flying around the room...

157
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,125
and he thinks... "Jeez. Two guys
with shotguns and stocking masks..."

158
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,333
could come in here and really clean up."

159
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,542
So he thinks,
"What the fuck," and he does it.

160
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,167
Put your hands on the fucking table
with your fucking money!

161
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,792
Mike, all right, all right,
give him the money. Go, Mike!

162
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,500
Now all the games have to shutdown.
It's a real pain in the ass.

163
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,083
Total fucking economic collapse.

164
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,333
Everyone's pissing and moaning.

165
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,333
No one's got any money.
Everybody's, you know, really upset.

166
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,750
Fuck me.

167
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,042
Markie!

168
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,708
They send Dillon out to find out
who did it.

169
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,667
The fuck are you looking at'?

170
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,500
Markie!

171
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,583
What?

172
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,208
And Dillon interrogates Markie.

173
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,667
Hey. What's going on? Hey! Hey.

174
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,667
You knock over the card game?

175
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,042
Jesus Christ! What the fuck'?

176
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,417
Dillon!

177
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,542
And Markie holds up under questioning.

178
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,000
Dillon, what the fuck'?
What's this all about?

179
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,333
Dillon can't work it out.
Who did it. So they think...

180
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,583
"What the fuck.
It's just one of those things."

181
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,167
Let's have a beer.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,542
What the fuck, man?

183
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,500
Stop crying...

184
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,458
So eventually, the games start up again.

185
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,792
Everything's getting back to normal.
Everyone's making money again...

186
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,375
and everyone's happy.

187
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,583
One night. They're all sitting around
and they're talking about...

188
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,583
"Remember the time
when all the games were shutdown...

189
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,625
and everyone's hearing footsteps
and what a fucking drag?"

190
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,708
Yeah, yeah, that was horrible.

191
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,042
And Markie starts laughing.

192
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,750
He can't help himself.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,792
You know what?

194
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,000
He tells them it was him
that robbed his own game.

195
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:20,667
I did it!

196
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,542
And everyone thinks it's funny.

197
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,333
Where was I'?

198
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,000
What the hell. It really
wasn't their money that was stolen...

199
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,667
and everyone loves Markie,
so they give him a pass.

200
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:32,667
But if it happens again,

201
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,125
if Markie's game gets knocked over...

202
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,500
they're gonna know it was Markie

203
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,000
and Markie's gonna take the fall for it.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,667
All right, well, fuck it. I'm in.
What about Russell?

205
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,333
I don't give a rat's ass.
You can go in there with...

206
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,583
fucking Tarzan and his fucking
spotted jockstrap for all I care...

207
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,250
if you can get him to do it.

208
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,667
But this thing's gotta move, all right'?

209
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,750
All right with me. Look,
I gotta do something soon.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,250
If I don't think of something
soon, I'm gonna have...

211
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,333
to go back and knock
on a gate and say, "Let me back in."

212
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:00,167
I can't think of nothing
d it's starting to get cold.

213
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,333
Because just a matter of time...

214
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,250
some other fresh bastard's
gonna think of this...

215
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,667
and then it's gonna be gone,
we don't have the money.

216
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,625
We're not the only smart guys
in the world.

217
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,125
Fuck, this a good car you got.

218
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,292
It's like the lounge room,
mate, but it's a good car.

219
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,250
Yeah, I wish you could
still get a car like this.

220
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,625
Keep this one.

221
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,583
Yeah, that's just
what I need is a nice, hot car.

222
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,375
You're not getting any, are you?

223
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,167
Go fuck yourself. Tomorrow night,
I'm getting some. All right'?

224
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,083
You know, if this thing goes all right,
this is my last night a priest.

225
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,000
Fucking take care of my own hog.

226
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,542
You certainly had a bunch of practice
at taking care of your own hog.

227
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,417
Yeah, that's real fucking nice talk.

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,167
A guy like you,
sticking it in Goat-Ass' satchel.

229
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,583
Fucking really nice talk.

230
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,208
Hey, we're in jail, you know.

231
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:48,708
Rule number one,
find yourself a lovely, clean older man.

232
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,542
Who the fuck told you
that Goat-Ass was clean'?

233
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,333
Rule number two

234
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:55,667
if you can't find that lovely.
Clean older man...

235
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,542
take the dirty one.

236
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,000
You're fucking sick.

237
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,333
You know, we shoulda actually
had them get you a goat, you know.

238
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,792
Have 'em bring it into the jail
and you could fuck the goat.

239
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,792
You know,
I had some clout with the keepers.

240
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,500
Those poor dogs.

241
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,417
You sure you're not
fucking around with those dogs?

242
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,417
No, no, 'cause they're dogs,
they bite, you know.

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,583
I mean, I'll give you some advice, mate.

244
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't-not with a dog, you know.

245
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,417
They can nip, from what I hear...

246
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,458
and that's very painful,
from what I hear.

247
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,750
You know, you're better off
with women, mate...

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
if you can get yourself one, that is.

249
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,625
Well, maybe I'm not sure I can.

250
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,333
They're around.
There's broads just like us, mate.

251
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,667
Just as crazy as us too.

252
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,333
Like this one, she's beautiful,
mate, but she's crazy.

253
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
She's crazy.

254
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,042
Let me tell you, all right.
I go up to the house, okay?

255
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,583
I've got a hard-on already.

256
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:53,000
She opens the door and, fuck, mate,
she was completely naked, you know.

257
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,167
I got quite nervous, mate,
'cause it's been a while, you know.

258
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,667
And she's like, "Well, are you
gonna come and fuck me..."

259
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,042
or you gonna stand there all day?"

260
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,333
So I take her in there. I fuck her.

261
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,667
It's really. Let me tell you...

262
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:05,542
she fucked like

263
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,583
a fucking crazy alien
from the planet Gobble, you know?

264
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,667
She started moaning and gobbling, mate.

265
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,500
I mean, really going crazy,

266
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,542
just, like, the cock goes in and.

267
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,000
So roll off, done, fantastic.

268
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,333
Next words out of her mouth,

269
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,667
"I'm gonna kill myself."

270
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,083
They all say that.

271
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:35,250
That's the first thing they think
of to say, you know, a lot of them.

272
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,292
Yeah, it don't mean anything.

273
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,083
Yeah.

274
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,542
Here you go, man.

275
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,167
Jesus, that's what you fucking got,
dishwashing gloves?

276
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,625
Look, you take
what you can fucking get, all right'?

277
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,000
These fucking things are too thick.

278
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,667
It's what they had.

279
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,750
They might
had some fucking latex gloves...

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,167
from, like,
a fucking hospital or something.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,417
You'll make do.

282
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,792
There you go.

283
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:28,417
Jesus, the fuck is this?

284
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,208
What does it look like?

285
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,667
It's a fucking sawn-off shotgun, okay?

286
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,500
It's what you asked me
to fucking get you.

287
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,167
I mean, you asked me for this, mate.

288
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,708
We shoot somebody
with this fucking thing...

289
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,958
it's gonna kill everybody
in the fucking room.

290
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
Well, tell them that.

291
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,417
We're gonna look like a bunch of
fucking amateurs when we go in there.

292
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,708
Take a breath.

293
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,042
All right, you ready to do this?

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,375
You don't even have your glove on.

295
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,208
I got my fucking glove on.

296
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,292
Just shut the fuck up.

297
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,500
You shut the fuck up.

298
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,583
You know. I'm going out there
with a fucking hand grenade...

299
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,708
and there's a fucking condom on my hand.

300
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,667
All right, hands, hands,
hands, all of you, hands!

301
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,583
Get your fucking hands up.

302
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,333
Okay.

303
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,458
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

304
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,542
Should I get the money?

305
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,417
Just take it easy.

306
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,792
Hands, hands!

307
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,500
You stop fucking looking at me.

308
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,333
Stop fucking looking at me
Get your fucking hands up.

309
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,708
You know they're gonna kill you.

310
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,208
You know that, don't you?

311
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,250
That doesn't have to happen.

312
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,167
It shouldn't happen to you.

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,167
You should just put the gun down...

314
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,167
turn around and walk out the front door.

315
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
I'll take care of your friend.

316
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,458
I ain't gonna fucking tell you again,
you stop fucking looking at me.

317
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,375
Don't worry about him.

318
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll take care of him for you.

319
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,500
What's going on in there?

320
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,333
Come on, now.

321
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,042
Hands, hands, hands!

322
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,292
Get your fucking hands up!

323
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,042
What's going on in there?

324
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,583
Talk to me! What's going on in there?

325
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,292
You sure you want to do this?

326
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,042
All right, put it on the table.

327
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,000
You want me to sit down'?

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,208
Nice.

329
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,625
All right, you motherfucker,
give it up right now!

330
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,708
You got the money. Leave him alone.

331
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,500
Hey, take out what you got in
your pockets and put it on the table.

332
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,458
Hey, leave the poor bastard alone!

333
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,750
You got all the money.

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
Hey, shut the fuck up!

335
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,167
Leave the fucking bastard...
You shut the fuck up!

336
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
All right. You fucking cocksucker...

337
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:18,625
get your fucking money out of
your pockets and put it on the table...

338
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,333
nice and fucking slow.

339
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,750
All right, you fucking prick.

340
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,167
All right, now you.
Put it on the fucking table...

341
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,000
nice and fucking slow. Stop fucking
looking at me. Hey, get your hands up!

342
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,333
Not you yet. Get your fucking hands up!

343
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:35,583
Get your fucking hands
out of your pocket!

344
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,458
All right, now,
there's two ways we can do this.

345
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,417
There's the easy way and the hard way.

346
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,042
All right, the easy way is to do what
these two guys are doing.

347
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,042
All right. The hard way is to
make us come around and all...

348
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,000
which is gonna make him nervous.
Now. You can sit there...

349
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,542
and act like you haven't
got it in your sock

350
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,542
or something, but then after...

351
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,292
me and my nervous friend
are gonna come around and make sure.

352
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,899
And for all the guys
that didn't remember everything...

353
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,583
we're gonna knock every
last one of their fucking teeth out.

354
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,292
How's that?

355
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,667
Good. That's the way I feel too.

356
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,500
All right, the less guys that get hurt,
the better, so don't fuck around.

357
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,625
Just keep quiet and give it
all up and nobody gets hurt.

358
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,292
It's only money.

359
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,375
Good evening.

360
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,042
This is an extraordinary period
for America's economy.

361
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,167
Over the past few weeks,
many Americans have

362
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:28,708
felt anxiety about
their finances and their future.

363
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,792
I understand their worry
and their frustration.

364
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,583
We've seen triple-digit swings
in the stock market.

365
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,750
All right, do it.
Major financial institutions

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,750
have teetered on the edge of collapse...

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
and some failed.

368
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,292
As uncertainty has grown,

369
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,667
many banks have restricted lending...

370
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,667
credit markets have frozen...

371
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,583
and families and businesses
have found it harder to borrow money.

372
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:54,292
We're in the midst
of a serious financial crisis...

373
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:58,042
and the federal government
is responding with decisive action.

374
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,542
We boosted confidence
in money market mutual funds.

375
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,042
I know many Americans
have questions tonight.

376
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,667
How did we reach
this point in our economy?

377
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,292
How will the solution I propose work?

378
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,500
And what does this mean
for your financial future?

379
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,667
These are good questions
and they deserve good answers.

380
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,292
First...

381
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,500
Go, go. Go, go. 90.

382
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:31,667
They told me when they heard that
if Dillon wasn't available...

383
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,083
that I was supposed to talk
to the fella he sent. Is that you?

384
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,750
I don't see nobody else
who might be here to meet you. Do you?

385
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,417
Let's get out from
under these construction guys.

386
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,708
Bang a right and go a couple blocks.
Most of the Republicans we know

387
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:50,417
doesn't like this bill
and President Bush,

388
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,625
I mean he's in the position now
of trying to sway public opinion...

389
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,500
and build support for it.

390
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:59,708
With the situation becoming
more precarious by the day...

391
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,667
I face the choice to

392
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,667
step in with dramatic
government action...

393
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,583
or to stand back

394
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,333
and allow
the irresponsible actions of some...

395
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:11,792
to undermine
the financial security of all.

396
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,083
There has been
a widespread loss of confidence.

397
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:14,750
Left.

398
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And major sectors
of America's financial system are

399
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,125
at risk of shutting down.

400
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,625
The government's top
economic experts warn that...

401
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,083
without immediate action by Congress...

402
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,167
America could slip into
a financial panic. -So,

403
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,083
they were very concerned
when I told them...

404
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,667
I called Dillon, Dillon said to see you.

405
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,125
They're very concerned.

406
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,708
How is the fella?

407
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,042
Not good. Saw him yesterday.

408
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,292
He said he feels like somebody
stuck a knife in his chest.

409
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:41,000
So he probably won't be able to
handle anything for a while.

410
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,792
He sure can't right now.

411
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:46,333
Personally,
I think the guy's in very bad shape.

412
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,042
Go under the bridge and you can park.

413
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,333
So, Mark Trattman's game
was hit a couple of nights ago.

414
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,667
I heard that.

415
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,583
Yeah, two kids.

416
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,583
Yeah?

417
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,167
You or Dillon hear anything
about two kids?

418
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,083
We hear lots of things. I heard
they had masks on, for one thing.

419
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,083
Correct.

420
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,250
So maybe they're not kids.

421
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,125
Well, they were dressed like kids,
dungarees.

422
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,750
Smelled like animals, Trattman said.

423
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,750
Trattman said.

424
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:30,417
Well, Trattman also said that the one
who talked had a voice like a kid's.

425
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,333
Trattman said.

426
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,667
Well. As far as I know...

427
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:39,333
there's nothing wrong with Trattman's
hearing or his nose or anything.

428
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,625
No, nothing I've heard about, anyways.

429
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,167
So where do we go from here?
What do you think?

430
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,625
It could have been Trattman.

431
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,208
He coulda decided to do it again.

432
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:00,167
No one'd ever think
he's dumb enough to do it twice.

433
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:03,333
But I know Markie. He's not that dumb.

434
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,708
So I figured some other smart guys
knew he did it before.

435
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,500
For now, it don't matter.

436
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,083
It doesn't?

437
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:13,000
We start with Trattman.
We start real good too.

438
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,625
Wait a minute.
I'll wait a week if you want.

439
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,167
No, I don't understand.
I thought you believed him.

440
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,500
My friend, I do.

441
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,542
But the games are closed, right'?

442
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,625
Grant's Tomb.

443
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,292
People are losing money.

444
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,292
A fair inference.

445
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,333
They don't like to lose money.

446
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,458
We hit Trattman.
Get things started up again...

447
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:34,083
get people back to doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

448
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,625
They want to find out
if he did it first.

449
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,583
It don't make a bit of difference
if Trattman did it...

450
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,417
or someone did it to Trattman.

451
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,792
If people think he did it

452
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,375
and he's still walking around...

453
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,667
you're gonna have kids waiting in line,
knock them fucking games over.

454
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,708
They just want you to talk to him.

455
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,042
Talk to him?

456
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,292
What does that mean?

457
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,500
Talk to Trattman, see what he says.

458
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,333
Talk to him?

459
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,667
Really talk to him.

460
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,667
A beating?

461
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,083
How badly they want him beaten?

462
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,625
Shove him around a little...

463
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,083
you know, but don't hurt him too badly
'cause they don't want him hurt.

464
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,000
Of course you do.
You guys, you always do that.

465
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:23,397
All right.

466
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:24,500
Quit shitting me, all right'?

467
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,125
- All right.
- Stop the bullshit.

468
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,542
All right, it's stopped.

469
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,125
But why?

470
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,667
What's he gonna do,
fold under questioning?

471
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,500
If he does, they'll kill him.

472
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:33,167
If he doesn't,

473
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:35,667
they'll figure he's lying like
last time and they'll kill him.

474
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,792
Either way, Markie's dead.

475
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,333
So why put the poor bastard
through a beating?

476
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,667
It's a waste of time...

477
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,792
not to mention a really
unpleasant experience for Markie.

478
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:47,708
Just put him out of his misery,
poor bastard.

479
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,708
What's the problem?

480
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,333
It's murder and they are squeamish.

481
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,375
For fuck's sake.
Who's running things?

482
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,125
You have no idea.

483
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,250
No decision-makers.

484
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,292
I got to take them by the hand
and I got to walk them...

485
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:08,375
slowly through it like
they're retarded children.

486
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,667
What is it, a committee?

487
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,667
Total corporate mentality.

488
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,625
Christ's sake.

489
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,125
This country is fucked, I'm telling you.

490
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,333
There's a plague coming.

491
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,667
Today we are taking decisive actions...

492
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:31,333
to protect the US economy.

493
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,500
We regret having to take these actions.

494
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,500
Today's actions are not
what we ever wanted to do...

495
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,333
but today's actions
are what we must do...

496
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,750
to restore confidence
in our financial system.

497
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,208
Today I'm announcing...

498
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:51,333
that the treasury
will purchase equity stakes.

499
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,750
It's this gray
one right here on the left.

500
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:58,792
That's where he lives?

501
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,333
Yep.

502
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,375
Jackie, that prick.

503
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,458
Jackie's all right.

504
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,083
He's a mean little prick.

505
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:15,250
But we gotta deal with
Markie's fucking feelings, not him.

506
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,417
Markie's gonna be okay.

507
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,000
He's gonna make it hard on us.

508
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,625
No, he's not.

509
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,375
Yeah, he will. Fuck.

510
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,083
He insists it has to be done..

511
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:31,417
Without meaningful discussion

512
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,333
or debate or any change...

513
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,083
sort of. You know...

514
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,667
a immediate authorization
for use of financial force.

515
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:43,083
That is Mr. Paulson's plan,
former head of Goldman Sachs.

516
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:47,625
We should not be rolled
by our Wall Street exec...

517
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,708
who's masquerading
as Secretary of the Treasury.

518
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,500
Does this remind
anybody of anything...

519
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:58,042
like the rush into Iraq
on election eve a number of years ago?

520
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,000
It's all too familiar.

521
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:23,625
There need to be consequences
and there needs to be major change...

522
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,500
- Hey.
- Get in the car, Markie.

523
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,333
For what?

524
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:31,958
For what?
Get in the fucking car, Markie.

525
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,208
Steve, I didn't do nothing.

526
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,458
You're gonna get in the car.

527
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:39,333
You know you're gonna get in
the car, so get in the fucking car!

528
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:43,167
Barry, open the fucking door.

529
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,250
Shoot me.

530
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,125
I'll fucking shoot you.
Go on, shoot me.

531
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,167
Fuck you, Markie.
Get in the fucking car now!

532
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,000
Get in the fucking car, motherfucker!
Get in the fucking car!

533
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,167
You fuck.

534
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,000
Get out of the car, Markie.

535
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,708
Please, Steve,
let me talk this over, okay?

536
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,208
Get out of the car now, Markie.

537
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,708
I didn't do nothing.

538
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,333
I told you, didn't I?

539
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,500
I told you he was
gonna make it hard on us.

540
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,042
Why you gotta do this, Markie?

541
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,208
I mean,
this is hard for us too, you know.

542
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,375
Why you gotta make it hard for us?

543
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,333
Cause I didn't do nothing.

544
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,458
Move, Markie.

545
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,292
Fucking little prick,
just get the fuck out of the car.

546
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,500
Get the fuck out. Come on!
Get out of the car, Markie.

547
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,083
He's not speaking fucking Chinese.

548
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,542
Come on, Trattman. Let's go.

549
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,583
Close the fucking door.

550
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,792
Okay, move over here.

551
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,042
Move down there, down there.

552
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,500
By the door.

553
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,792
Jesus fucking Christ.

554
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,000
May my mother get cancer...

555
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,333
I had nothing to do with this.

556
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,250
You can't tell them that?

557
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,125
I know how it looks. I know.

558
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,667
Honest to God, I didn't.

559
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,667
Fuck, Barry.

560
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,000
He's got fucking blood all over me.

561
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:45,625
Who are the kids, Markie?

562
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,583
I don't know. I don't know.

563
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,042
No, I don't know.

564
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,000
You're making this hard for us, buddy.

565
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:57,000
Come on, baby. Okay.

566
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,042
- No, no, no.
- Hold your hands.

567
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,792
Markie, I don't want to hit your hands.

568
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:01,625
Just fucking hit him!

569
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,000
Turn him around.
Fucking hit him!

570
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,333
Right there.

571
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,958
Get his hands, Steven.

572
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,750
No, no.

573
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,333
Hey, man. You okay, Markie?

574
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:24,708
Hey, Markie, you all right'?

575
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,292
Okay, let's give him a try now.

576
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:33,208
Markie, about the kids,

577
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,292
are you sure you don't know
who those kids are?

578
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,167
You really sure?

579
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,083
I'm sure.

580
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,417
I'm sure, Steve.

581
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,000
Cause I gotta be.

582
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,792
I gotta be sure, Markie,

583
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,292
and you make me stay out here
all night making sure,

584
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,125
I'm not gonna like it.

585
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,250
It's gonna be an awful
long night for you, Mark.

586
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,083
You bastard.

587
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,667
You cocksucker!

588
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,417
What do you say, Steve?

589
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Shut up!

590
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,458
Let's get the fuck out of here.

591
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:10,083
Fuck.

592
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,000
Steven.

593
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,000
What?!

594
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,500
Get in the car.

595
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,208
You fucking dirty fucking dog.

596
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,708
Hey, asshole.

597
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,000
Look at you! Look at you!

598
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:10,625
How are you?

599
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,333
You look fucking ridiculous.

600
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,167
Look at your fucking hair.
Go fuck yourself.

601
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,125
What are you talking about?
What spray shit did you put in it?

602
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,417
It ain't spray. I'm not fucking queer.

603
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,333
There's gel on it, you fucking prick.

604
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:22,208
You sure you're not.
Yeah, the guy

605
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,843
a little bit of a queer?
That out it gave me the stuff.

606
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,167
Look at this. New car.

607
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,500
What the fuck is that?

608
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,500
It's dog shit. Come on, let's go.

609
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:31,583
Let's go, come on. I've got to get home.

610
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:34,625
Russell, you fucking smell like shit.
You're not getting in my car like that.

611
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,583
You smell like shit too, like gay shit.

612
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,542
Look at this.
Everything's going good. Shut up.

613
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,000
It was beautiful.

614
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,583
Yeah, we leave in the middle
of the night, forfuck's sake.

615
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,583
All the way to Florida,

616
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,750
we're in this fucking rainstorm.

617
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,292
The dogs are all pissing
and farting and shitting...

618
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:46,500
and we can't roll the windows down.
We don't want to drown.

619
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,500
Put the fucking window...
what are you, an asshole?!

620
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,625
Put the fucking cigarette out!

621
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:56,000
It was awful.
It was like riding in a shithouse.

622
00:37:56,375 --> 00:38:00,375
And then after got over to Orlando
we're gonna burn the oar...

623
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:04,458
so Kenny sticks a rag
in the gas tank, and he lights it off.

624
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,417
You're gonna need to get a stick.
Don't do it by hand, mate.

625
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,667
Don't be a such...
Russell, you're a fucking pussy.

626
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,667
I've done it a million fucking times.

627
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,583
It's fine. It goes up like
a fucking bonfire. I love it.

628
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,542
See?

629
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:32,625
Fuck!

630
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:39,125
Kenny. He didn't
have no eyebrows left...

631
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,000
not much hair...

632
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,958
and no sense of humor either.

633
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:48,000
You know, I thought dogs was gonna
be an easy way to make money.

634
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,625
I was half right.

635
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,208
You look all beat to shit.

636
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,500
Yeah.

637
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:58,000
And the thing of it is,
I've been up for a week, all right...

638
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,458
and I got to keep going
until I finish this thing off.

639
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,125
What, you haven't dumped the stuff'?

640
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:07,000
Dumped it? Christ, no.
I haven't stepped it yet.

641
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,333
Look, I put it to a guy fast,

642
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,292
I'm gonna no more than 15 or 16.

643
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:15,042
I take it up a step...

644
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:19,292
I can move it to two guys for 25.

645
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:23,333
Russell, it's stupid.
It's fucking stupid.

646
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,458
That's a thousand dollars a year.

647
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:30,375
You're as dumb as I am.

648
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,625
Maybe you think we were
smart doing that other thing...

649
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,375
but we were dumb.

650
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,792
That worked out beautiful.

651
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:43,750
Sure, fucking cheesecake.

652
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,292
Course, we got a contract out on us.

653
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,750
But, yeah, beautiful.

654
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:05,208
What the fuck are you talking about?

655
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,375
The fuck you talking about?

656
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,167
Russell?

657
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,625
Russell?

658
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,167
He)'

659
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,250
What the fuck are you talking about?

660
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:31,125
There's a contract on us,
you, me and the Squirrel.

661
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,667
I'm gonna be as dead
as you guys if I hang around here.

662
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,667
I'm going to Montreal.

663
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,708
For what?

664
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:44,542
Hey. For what?

665
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,167
For what?

666
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:50,250
Cut the shit, for the Trattman game.

667
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,083
What the fuck's the matter with you?

668
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,500
Russell, Trattman's practically dead.

669
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,375
They beat him shitless.

670
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,583
You didn't know that, did you?

671
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,500
Course I did. Kenny told me.

672
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,500
Kenny?

673
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:12,083
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

674
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,625
Hey, Russell, is this Kenny Gill
we're talking about?

675
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,583
Russell, wake up!

676
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,125
What'd you say?

677
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:29,083
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

678
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,750
Yeah.

679
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,458
Russell, Kenny Gill works for Dillon.

680
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,042
Kenny Gill works for Dillon!

681
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:39,792
SQ?

682
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,708
So you go talking to
a fucking guy that works...

683
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,792
Fucking guy that works
for fucking Dillon.

684
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,167
So fucking what?

685
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:52,000
What else did you tell him?

686
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,000
What did you tell him,

687
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,125
in case Kenny didn't get
the whole fucking story before?

688
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:59,500
I didn't say shit.

689
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,333
Now. Aside from Squirrel...

690
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:37,667
we got the kids, two kids.

691
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,458
One of them is the motor mouth.

692
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,333
Drove to Florida with Kenny...

693
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,333
Kenny Gill, our Kenny,

694
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,958
guy he knows works for Dillon...

695
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,000
and starts bragging about
how he's a big-time operator

696
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,208
just knocked over
this guy's game for 100K.

697
00:42:49,292 --> 00:42:50,125
You serious?

698
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,458
I don't know what it is with these guys.

699
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,792
They can't keep
their mouth shut about nothing.

700
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:57,167
And Kenny, Kenny's just as dumb.

701
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,583
The way I found out was...

702
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,042
this guy's invested his money
in a couple ounces of smack...

703
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,167
wants Kenny to come in with him.

704
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,708
Kenny comes to me and wants
know what I think about that.

705
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,208
I guess these guys.
They just want to go to jail...

706
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:10,167
probably feel at home there.

707
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,500
So you want to move now
or you want to wait, what?

708
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,667
I talked to Dillon. We both think now.

709
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,542
Okay.

710
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,167
Whack Trattman,
get the games started up.

711
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,292
Trattman,
what brings Trattman into this?

712
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,750
You just told me that it was...

713
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,583
this Squirrel fella and his two friends.

714
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:30,333
It is, plus I had Trattman
talked to, I'm sure. -Yeah.

715
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,417
You ought to be. Your boys
went a little overboard there.

716
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,583
They damn near killed the man.

717
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:34,667
It wasn't my idea.

718
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,542
Waste of time, I said.
Waste of money, I said.

719
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,083
Why put Markie through it, I said.

720
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,750
You know, he called me up.

721
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,333
I had trouble understanding him.
Hell, I had trouble calling him back...

722
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,250
cause he got
my secretary the first time.

723
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,042
She couldn't understand him,
the numbers he left.

724
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,583
He's got a broken jaw.

725
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,292
I heard that.
Got broken ribs...

726
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,625
he got a broken nose,
three or four broken teeth.

727
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:56,125
There's some question about
his spleen, he said.

728
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,500
He was in the hospital
when I talked to him.

729
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,333
He's out now, I understand.

730
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:02,000
Must be his spleen's okay then.

731
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,500
You know, he's not happy, though.

732
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,208
I'm sorry to hear that
We aim to please.

733
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,125
That's what I'm supposed to tell them?

734
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,500
Tell them whatever you want.
Won't make a bit of difference anyways.

735
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,167
Trattman's got to be hit,
and they know it.

736
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,042
You know, you see...

737
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,500
I don't...

738
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,792
I don't understand that, I mean.

739
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,125
Do I have to explain this twice'?

740
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,417
What do you think the guys
on the street think?

741
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,042
I got no idea.

742
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,083
They think Trattman...

743
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:31,333
he did it before and now he did it again
and all he got was beat up.

744
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:34,333
But he didn't really do anything.

745
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:38,167
It's his responsibility. He did it
before and now it happened again...

746
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,167
so he's responsible for what guys think.

747
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:43,292
On the street, it's Trattman,
nothing but Trattman.

748
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:47,667
Look, there's no two ways
about it, counselor.

749
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,333
Trattman's gotta be hit.
He made a mistake.

750
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:55,292
Wait a minute. I get it.

751
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,333
I see what you mean,
the public angle and all.

752
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:00,750
Okay.

753
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,042
Okay.

754
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:08,000
Okay. If they agree with you.
Assuming that...

755
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,167
can you hit Trattman?

756
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,542
Sure.

757
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:17,042
Now. What about
this Squirrel fella because...

758
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,000
he seems like
the leading candidate to me.

759
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,292
Probably not.
I need Mickey for that one.

760
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,792
Mickey? New York Mickey?

761
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,583
Why can't you handle it?

762
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,000
Cause Squirrel knows me.
Didn't I say that already?

763
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,208
He needed something done once,
Dillon couldn't do it...

764
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,000
so I did it, so he knows me.

765
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,750
He's gonna figure if...

766
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,333
he's waiting on somebody,
he's waiting on me or Dillon.

767
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,792
So what?

768
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,458
You ever killed anyone?

769
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,042
No.

770
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,375
It can get touchy-feely.

771
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,042
Touchy-feely?

772
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:50,333
Emotional, not fun, a lot of fuss.

773
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,167
They cry. They plead. They beg...

774
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,792
they piss themselves,
they call for their mothers.

775
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,000
It gets embarrassing.

776
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,375
I like to kill them softly...

777
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,708
from a distance,
not close enough for feelings.

778
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:06,167
Don't like feelings.
Don't want to think about them.

779
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,167
You need Mickey. What's the problem?

780
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,792
Mickey is expensive.

781
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:11,500
Not at the moment.

782
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,250
You get him for 10?

783
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,292
He'd do it for 15?

784
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:17,792
15, asshole.

785
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:20,000
I think in this economy.
A quick 16 for two days work...

786
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,042
would sound pretty good to Mickey.

787
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,250
We'll sell him a party.

788
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:27,000
Fly in, whack a guy, fly out, quick 15.

789
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,292
Fly coach.

790
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:46,500
America's financial system
is intricate and complex.

791
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:48,417
But behind all the technical terminology

792
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,583
is a critical human factor.

793
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:54,292
Confidence.

794
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,542
Confidence in our financial systems
is essential...

795
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,167
to the smooth operation
of our economy...

796
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:05,292
and recently
that confidence has been shaken.

797
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,167
All of us have a responsibility
to solve this crisis...

798
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,167
because it affects

799
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,667
the financial well-being
of every single American.

800
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:18,375
The House of Representatives
failed to act on Monday.

801
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:23,417
We saw the single largest decline
in the stock market in two decades.

802
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,542
But in the end of the day,

803
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:29,250
there's no real separation... between
Wall Street and Main Street.

804
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,292
There's only the road
we're traveling on as Americans...

805
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:34,458
and we will rise or fall on that journey

806
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,583
as one nation, as one people.

807
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:38,292
Hey, come here.

808
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,625
So where'd you have to go for these?

809
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,667
Sir?

810
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,417
I said, where did you
have to go for these?

811
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:49,708
Out of the building, right'?

812
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,667
What, you have to walk a couple blocks,
take a cab or something?

813
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:57,500
No, sir, we only have one man
on service today and he's very busy.

814
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,458
Are the drinks all right'?

815
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:02,542
No, as a matter of fact, they're mostly
evaporated by the time you get here.

816
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,583
Mickey. Yeah, the drinks are all right.

817
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:05,708
Bring me another one.

818
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,167
Yes, sir.

819
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,417
You mind if I drink
that beer while I'm waiting for...

820
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,708
Lurch to get back
from the airport over here?

821
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,167
Make you fat, though,
I thought you said.

822
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:20,542
Yeah.

823
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:38,500
So they grabbed me down in Maryland
on this gun thing.

824
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,292
What gun thing?

825
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,333
Well, I was going hunting,
for Christ's sake.

826
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,208
Me and this guy, Topper.
You know Topper?

827
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,625
- No.
- Nice guy.

828
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:51,167
Anyway. We were going down
to Maryland to hunt geese...

829
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,083
down at Maryland shore.

830
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,667
Then we go down there and...

831
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:58,042
all of a sudden. There's a couple
hundred cops all over the place...

832
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:00,125
and I got the shotgun in the trunk.

833
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:01,958
Fucking beautiful.

834
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,333
Fucking shotgun,
I just bought the fucking shotgun.

835
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,250
I never even used it once.

836
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:09,125
Now, I'm under arrest...

837
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,083
felony possession,

838
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,000
so I might go to jail
for a fucking shotgun...

839
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:17,000
I bought in a fucking store to hunt
fucking geese with, for Christ's sake.

840
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,333
Jesus.

841
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,583
Did you bring him a beer?

842
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:27,208
No, sir, he only wanted the one,
I thought.

843
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,333
What?

844
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,667
He only wanted one drink, I thought.

845
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,708
I'm drinking his beer.

846
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,083
I'm drinking the man's beer.

847
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,750
Get him a beer.
I don't want another one.

848
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,750
It's all right.

849
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,125
All right, don't have no more.

850
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:46,750
So, yeah, Topper-—.

851
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,208
You're hitting that stuff pretty hard,
aren't you, Mickey?

852
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,208
I can handle it.

853
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,167
So, Topper, yeah, Topper...

854
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:02,042
he feels responsible and,
you know, he's an old guy.

855
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:04,083
He hasn't been pinched
in about 30 years.

856
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,500
So we figure
the shotguns are gonna be his.

857
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,750
I'm just doing the old man a favor
driving him down there and all.

858
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,708
Yeah, but if they don't...

859
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,750
I do time.

860
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,625
If the shotguns aren't his, I do time.

861
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,417
It's that simple.

862
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:28,750
Done it before. I can do it again.

863
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,250
Rough on the wife, though.

864
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,167
Yeah.

865
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:40,333
The last time,
she actually took out the papers.

866
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,625
I didn't blame her.

867
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,792
She's been through it twice before.

868
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:54,042
So the papers come up.
I was gonna sign them. You know...

869
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,125
let her have what she wants
if that's what she wants.

870
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,667
The girl don't owe me nothing.

871
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:01,583
But I asked her to come up.

872
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:05,000
I says, "Margie, do this for me.
Don't do nothing now."

873
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,625
Do like when I come out
the last time and decide then."

874
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,500
She looks at me.

875
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,625
She says, "And you promised me then... ".

876
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,750
She says. "And you promised me
then you were through..."

877
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,167
and here I am again
and I'll wait five more years...

878
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,292
and I'll be five more years older...

879
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:23,167
"and you're gonna get out again
and you're gonna do something else."

880
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,792
And I said, "Margie, I mean,
what can I say? You're right."

881
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:32,458
You're right,
but all I'm asking you to do...

882
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:34,625
"is wait till I come out again."

883
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,208
Cause I don't know who the guy is.

884
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:40,458
But I did.

885
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,000
I did. I knew she was seeing somebody.

886
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,000
I knew two days after
she was with him the first time...

887
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:49,750
and I didn't like the feeling it gave me
in my nuts knowing it.

888
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,333
But I didn't blame him.

889
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,125
Anyway, I said, "Margie..."

890
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,208
you ought to do this for me.

891
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,500
I ought to be around the same as him...

892
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,667
"because you and me,
we always got along all right."

893
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:16,625
Then she started crying
and shaking her head and...

894
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,458
I thought, you know...

895
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,375
But she didn't.

896
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,542
And it was all right.

897
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,792
You're not having any more of those.

898
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,625
You'll fall on your ass if you do.

899
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:38,708
I was drinking before you
got out of your father's cock.

900
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,542
Don't tell me what I do.

901
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,292
Next time. You know.
She takes out the papers...

902
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm just gonna sign them...

903
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,167
because it's too fucking rough on me.

904
00:52:57,042 --> 00:52:58,542
Check.

905
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,042
Terrible amount of shit
you got to go through.

906
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,500
What are you gonna do?

907
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,667
Do the best you can.

908
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,583
What, am I gonna leave the country like
some fucking draft dodger or something?

909
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,292
Fuck that.

910
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:20,625
Besides, none of this shit
means anything anyway.

911
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,417
It's all bullshit.

912
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,667
So what are we doing?

913
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:49,750
We got two guys.

914
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,762
Actually, there's four guys,

915
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:53,542
but it takes fucking forever
to get the okay around here.

916
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,292
So we got two guys for sure

917
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:59,667
and one them knows me, so here you are.

918
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:03,500
So, what, you want me
to do a double or what?

919
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,125
You want to take the double,
it's all right with me. You need that?

920
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,625
Look, I ought to
take you up on it, but...

921
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,208
I'm not supposed to
be up here, you know.

922
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm restricted in New York
and Maryland and all that shit.

923
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,500
I want to go anywhere,
I'm supposed to ask them.

924
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,625
Well, I didn't ask them.

925
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,458
So I probably shouldn't be up here
anymore than I have to, you know.

926
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,250
Besides, a double's risky.

927
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,750
I'll just take the one.

928
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,250
Okay.

929
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:42,542
Now, here's the thing.
That's gonna be the guy that knows me.

930
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:43,792
The other guy, I'm doing.

931
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:46,250
I'm gonna put his light out tonight
if everything goes right.

932
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,333
Fuck.

933
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,292
What are we gonna do, Jackie?

934
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,000
Never mind thinking about
what I'm gonna do.

935
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:07,083
You just think about
what you're gonna do.

936
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,083
I'm gonna make some money, right'?

937
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:13,583
500, same as always.
500, you don't fuck anything up.

938
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:15,500
When did I ever fuck
anything up with you?

939
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:18,042
Kenny, the world's full of guys
that never fucked up...

940
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:20,125
and then they fucked up once
and now they're doing time...

941
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,292
so tonight's not the night to start,
not when I'm with you.

942
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,792
I never fucked anything up.

943
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,667
Where's the fucking car'?

944
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:39,667
It's around the side. I thought you said.

945
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:40,744
Never mind what you thought I said.

946
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,417
Move your big, dumb ass.
He's going home.

947
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,250
I don't get it.

948
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,667
Yeah, neither is he tonight.
Never again, either.

949
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,542
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I want to get home early for a change.

950
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,250
Put the dollar back.

951
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:55,083
Put it back. Forfuck's sake.

952
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:58,708
America has the most talented,
productive...

953
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,667
and entrepreneurial
workers in the world.

954
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,792
Right up easy, nice and smooth.

955
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:28,500
Right up next to him. Kenny...

956
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,417
and a little bit ahead.
Put me right up next to him.

957
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,167
The first one, she wasn't bad.

958
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:40,042
She wasn't good, but she wasn't bad.
She was all right.

959
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,750
She seemed like she was
in an awful hurry, though.

960
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,125
Honey, could you zip me up?

961
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,000
No.

962
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,083
I thought you were kidding.

963
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:54,750
No. Get your trick to do it.

964
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,333
You know, screwing's no different
than anything else.

965
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,542
Nobody gives a good shit anymore.

966
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,708
You hire somebody to do something,

967
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:03,000
you tell them
you're willing to pay for it...

968
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:05,500
they say they'll do it and they have to.

969
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,083
Yeah, well, for a guy
who's been having himself

970
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:08,292
a regular party for three days or

971
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,417
so you sure bitch and moan a lot.

972
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,125
I've been paying for it.
I can bitch about it if I want.

973
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,125
So you know this broad Polly?

974
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:19,375
Honey?

975
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,292
It's on the nightstand over there.

976
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,250
The wallet's on the nightstand.

977
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,125
Yeah, everybody knows Polly.

978
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:30,250
Yeah, that's what the first broad
you sent up said.

979
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,708
There's $283 in there, okay?

980
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:35,667
When I get up, I want to
see $183 in there, you got that?

981
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,458
Okay. No tip?

982
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:41,000
No tip.

983
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,333
You're the original sport.

984
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:43,708
Fuck her.

985
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,125
You want a tip, honey?
I'll give you a tip.

986
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,167
You put the condom on with your mouth...

987
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:53,458
and you stop acting like your anus
is a national treasure.

988
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:55,458
You're a fucking hooker
for Christ's sake.

989
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:56,500
Fuck you.

990
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,000
Let me tell you something, honey.

991
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,417
One day.
One old bastard that you milked...

992
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,667
he's gonna carve you up,
talking like that.

993
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,708
How would you like that?

994
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,125
Jesus, I don't know.

995
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,750
You think I'd come?

996
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:17,000
If you could, maybe you would.

997
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,625
But I'm thinking no.

998
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:20,792
Fuck you.

999
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:26,208
Which is pretty much what I had in mind
when she come up here.

1000
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:35,208
You know, I haven't had a real piece
of ass since Florida.

1001
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:39,333
- Sunny.
- Sunny. Yeah.

1002
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:45,667
You probably fucked her too
didn't you, after I left?

1003
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,292
Mickey.

1004
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,417
When me and Dillon got there,
she was with you.

1005
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,125
When we left, she was still with you.

1006
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,708
You were there, what?

1007
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,333
Three weeks.

1008
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,458
Three weeks.

1009
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,042
I was there five days in the middle.

1010
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,208
How the fuck am I gonna do that?

1011
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't know.

1012
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,167
Empty again.

1013
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,792
You sure you won'tjoin me?

1014
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,625
Not late enough yet either.

1015
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:25,292
Sammy fucked her.

1016
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,667
Guy from Detroit,

1017
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,125
sharp-looking little ginzo?

1018
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,792
He's a fucking Jew.

1019
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:34,292
All those years I knew that guy...

1020
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:39,500
he fucking did it anyway, scumbag.

1021
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,083
Son of a bitch.

1022
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:51,208
I don't know why I care about this.

1023
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:56,083
I mean. You know. I know when...

1024
01:01:56,167 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm there, I'm there, she's with me...

1025
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,500
and when I leave and you're there,

1026
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,292
she's with you.

1027
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,417
She wasn't with me.

1028
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,750
I don't mean you. I mean any guy.

1029
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,417
Yeah, I don't care.

1030
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:25,292
It's not like I love her or nothing.

1031
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,667
You know,
I just give her for when I'm there.

1032
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,750
Fucking Sammy.

1033
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,333
Mickey.

1034
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,167
She good, you know, Sunny.

1035
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,000
She's a good girl.

1036
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,250
If she can't get you up,

1037
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:46,958
you're probably dead.

1038
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,792
And let me tell you something...

1039
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:53,792
I've seen every kind
of ass there is in this world.

1040
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:55,667
Yeah, you've seen it this week.

1041
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:56,667
You been here, what, three days?

1042
01:02:56,792 --> 01:02:59,167
What I hear, you've seen
most of the ass in town.

1043
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:05,042
Well, I like it. It's, like, my hobby.

1044
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,375
Yeah, well, I couldn't fuck
like that for three days.

1045
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,958
I get all fucked out.

1046
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,208
You want ass?

1047
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,292
There's no ass in the whole world...

1048
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:20,000
like a young Jewish girl that's hooking.

1049
01:03:21,958 --> 01:03:23,750
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

1050
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,208
You take that to the bank.

1051
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,000
First time I met Sunny...

1052
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:43,333
she walked in the room,
I got a fucking enormous hard-on.

1053
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:47,083
I could have fought five guys
with this fucking prong I had.

1054
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:52,000
So fucking hard.
The skin from under my eyes...

1055
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,167
just kinda went down into the cock
so it could expand.

1056
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,000
Mickey.

1057
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,500
My fucking... you know, after,
I just wanted to fuck her so bad.

1058
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,250
She was so fucking beautiful.

1059
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,292
Mickey.

1060
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,958
I felt like a man - Mick!

1061
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:05,333
She made me feel good. What?

1062
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:09,375
You gonna be all right...

1063
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,333
tomorrow night, the next?

1064
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:22,583
I'm all right now. What the fuck'?
Leave me alone.

1065
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:24,792
Look, this after, we're supposed to
meet a guy, all right'?

1066
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:27,458
I got a guy to take you around and all.

1067
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,000
I can't go out.

1068
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,458
What the fuck are you talking about?

1069
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,542
No, I can't go out.

1070
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:54,000
You come up here to do something
remember? For that.

1071
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,458
All right, go get him.

1072
01:04:57,542 --> 01:05:00,167
Go get the fucking guy
and we'll set this thing up.

1073
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,667
Go get him now!
We'll set the fucking thing up!

1074
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,417
Go get him!

1075
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,583
You, I'ma tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go to fucking bed.

1076
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:09,708
It's 2:30 now, you shit
I'ma call you at 7:30...

1077
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:11,083
and if I don't wake you up,

1078
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,167
I am gonna drop a dime
on a couple of cops

1079
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,292
I know who are gonna take you back
to where you're supposed to be.

1080
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:16,667
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

1081
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,458
No ass. No more booze.

1082
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:21,083
No nothing.
Get yourself a shower and go to bed.

1083
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,083
I'll get you up and tell you
where you gotta be.

1084
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:25,458
I don't take orders from shits like you!

1085
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:30,667
7:30. Get some sleep.

1086
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:33,083
He's been here three days.

1087
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:36,167
What he didn't fuck in them
three days, he drank.

1088
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:37,375
He was drunk when I left him.

1089
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:40,000
2:00 in the afternoon and he's drunk.

1090
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,333
And when I chew him out for it,

1091
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:44,000
he's go out in the skivvies
and do the job now.

1092
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,042
Won't fucking shut up.

1093
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,375
You asked for him.

1094
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:50,083
You said you couldn't do it,
so we got you what you asked for.

1095
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:52,208
I need the Mickey
from a couple of years ago.

1096
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:53,292
He's fucking worthless now.

1097
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:55,000
Did you talk to Dillon about it,

1098
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,750
I mean, or is he even
able to talk to anybody?

1099
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,208
Dillon thinks what I think.

1100
01:05:58,292 --> 01:05:59,625
We need this guy out of town yesterday.

1101
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,250
You invited him here. Send him back.

1102
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,667
Won't go. He needs the dough.

1103
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,083
Well, I can't get in touch
with him today.

1104
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,333
It's not like that.

1105
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:16,000
What I got in mind,
I'm gonna get him grabbed.

1106
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,542
Won't he talk?

1107
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,500
If he thought it was me who did it,
he might.

1108
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,625
Let's just say
in about a day from now...

1109
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:29,500
he's gonna get into a fight with a whore
in a hotel that don't like whore fights.

1110
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,125
He's gonna get busted for that.

1111
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:33,000
They'll revoke his bail,
and back he'll go.

1112
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,000
Kind of rough on him.

1113
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,750
Actually,
I think it's the best thing for him.

1114
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,500
Won't get enough potato jack
in the can to kill him.

1115
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,042
And if he's not in the can,
he's going to kill us.

1116
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,458
So how much is the girl gonna cost'?

1117
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:46,667
$500, maybe a grand.

1118
01:06:46,792 --> 01:06:47,792
Jesus.

1119
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:48,625
It's a grand.

1120
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,583
Yeah, well, I still got to okay it.

1121
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:53,042
You know. This running back to them
every time with the latest bad news...

1122
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,333
they're raising hell with me.

1123
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,708
Well, we got a little problem.

1124
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,208
We weren't supposed to have
any little problems, no problems at all.

1125
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,417
Please don't smoke in my car, please.
Come on.

1126
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,667
All right, looks like
our boy finally made it.

1127
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:38,125
Yeah, I've got him now.
He's about to enter the building.

1128
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,375
All units, this is unit three.

1129
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:02,667
He's headed
to the lockers on the west side.

1130
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,583
You have the right to remain silent.

1131
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,583
You have any guns. Knives.
Or anything else I should know about...

1132
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:05,292
needles or anything
I'm gonna get stuck on?

1133
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,667
I dunno, maybe.

1134
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,083
- What?
- Yeah.

1135
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,000
Yes or no?
Left pocket, left jacket pocket.

1136
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:13,375
You have the right to talk to a lawyer
for advice before we ask you questions.

1137
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:14,167
Don't move that hand.

1138
01:09:14,292 --> 01:09:17,125
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

1139
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,500
Do you understand
what I've just read to you, sir?

1140
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:22,125
That poor bastard.

1141
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,583
You know, I knew this was gonna happen.

1142
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,500
I told him, you know.
What the fuck, you know.

1143
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,375
You know, I like the guy.

1144
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:30,417
You know. He was always
all right to me. You know...

1145
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
and now I can't do nothing to help him?

1146
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:34,167
Took his chances.

1147
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,375
Sure. John.
And you're taking your chances...

1148
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,708
and I'm taking my chances, all right...

1149
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,958
and sooner or later,
they're gonna grab us.

1150
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,625
You know, and then who am I
gonna call, you know, you?

1151
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,708
I haven't got no friends either.
You know, you look at it.

1152
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,792
You. Me. And Russell are in exactly
the same position...

1153
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,750
except for he's in it now
and we're not in it yet.

1154
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,750
Frankie, you gotta relax.

1155
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,208
It's like Trattman.

1156
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,292
It come outjust like you said.

1157
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:00,667
You know, when it didn't happen and...

1158
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,138
Russell was telling me
all that stuff. You know...

1159
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:04,417
I was scared shitless
it wasn't gonna happen.

1160
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,417
You know, I thought
it was gonna happen to me.

1161
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:11,083
You know. That don't mean... well. Yeah.
I mean. I'm glad it happened to him...

1162
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,708
but I still wish it didn't even
happen to him, you know?

1163
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:15,583
It didn't have to.

1164
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,292
It's just shit, you know.

1165
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,250
This world is just shit.

1166
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,042
We're all just on our own.

1167
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,542
What the fuck, man, whatcha gonna do?

1168
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,000
Get off my block, bitch!

1169
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:37,042
This my block!

1170
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,000
I run this motherfucking block!

1171
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,208
Get off my block!

1172
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:42,000
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

1173
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:45,542
I run this show! I run this show!

1174
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,542
What you gonna do, homey?
Get off my fucking block, man!

1175
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,333
Get off my block!

1176
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,708
Our eye now is to the future...

1177
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,583
to shine the bright light
of accountability.

1178
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:58,333
Can I get you a Bud?

1179
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,792
Yeah.

1180
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:01,292
Bottle or draft?

1181
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,750
I don't give a shit.

1182
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:08,333
They always do that.

1183
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,667
Pain in the ass.

1184
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,583
Wouldn't come in here I know
I got to go through shit like that.

1185
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:14,417
Shit, I would.

1186
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,208
This guy, I don't know how he does it.

1187
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:20,458
He must have the best-built girls
in town working for him.

1188
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,042
I come in here every day.

1189
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,292
I know.

1190
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,167
I've never seen you in here before.

1191
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,417
Look, I don't know you.

1192
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,250
Very few guys know me.

1193
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,667
I've never been here before in my life.

1194
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:41,708
I was looking for you.

1195
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:46,083
A guy told me you come in here
a lot around this time of the day,

1196
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,667
so I came in.

1197
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,500
Who's the guy?

1198
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,125
The guy? A friend.

1199
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:59,167
A friend of yours, actually.

1200
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:02,500
Who is the friend?

1201
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,000
A friend.

1202
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:06,083
Your friends
are worried about you, Frankie.

1203
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,625
They think you need somebody around...

1204
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,625
who knows about things. Advise you...

1205
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,125
teach you how to cover your ass.

1206
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1207
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,375
See, it's not so much
what you've been doing.

1208
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:24,333
It's what guys think
you've been doing...

1209
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:27,000
and that's what you got to look out for.

1210
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,208
And when it happens...

1211
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:31,625
you got to be prepared to do something.

1212
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah.

1213
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:41,417
So where's he gonna be tomorrow night?

1214
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:45,333
Who?

1215
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:51,125
Johnny Amato. Tomorrow night,
where's he gonna be?

1216
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,500
I don't know.

1217
01:12:57,625 --> 01:12:59,250
Frank.

1218
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,042
You got to keep in mind what I told you.

1219
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:04,125
Your friends are worried about you.

1220
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,708
It's your friends that want to see you
get a second chance...

1221
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:08,375
you know what I mean?

1222
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,625
And it's your friends that wanna
know where Squirrel's gonna be.

1223
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:14,667
Yeah, well, I don't know
who the fuck you are.

1224
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,667
Very few guys do.

1225
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,625
Well, Dillon, maybe.

1226
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,708
Yeah, Dillon knows me.

1227
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,500
Yeah.

1228
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,625
You want me to call Dillon for you...

1229
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:36,125
so you can talk to Dillon
and see who I am'?

1230
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:44,333
No.

1231
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,500
Okay, then, where's he gonna be?

1232
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:56,000
I haven't got no idea.

1233
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:10,042
Okay.

1234
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,542
See you around, Frankie, my friend.

1235
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,792
No, no, hey, wait a minute.

1236
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,792
Fuck you, I don't get paid to wait.

1237
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,792
You tell me you don't know, okay.
I accept that.

1238
01:14:26,042 --> 01:14:29,125
But I got something to do.
I got to find a guy who does know.

1239
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,333
Where John's gonna be tomorrow night?

1240
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:35,583
Yeah. There's something else now.
I guess...

1241
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:39,292
like where you're gonna
be the day after.

1242
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:49,292
Except you're in a position
very few guys ever get in.

1243
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:53,167
You can do something about it.
You have choices.

1244
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,083
I've known very few guys
in a position like that.

1245
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,375
Kid, I hope you don't think
I'm shitting you.

1246
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,375
Kid, I hate to see you go like this.

1247
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,708
And you're going for fucking nothing.

1248
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,458
Jesus, look, I can't do this, like...

1249
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:30,125
Let me ask you something.
You think about this.

1250
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,458
You think I was to go down
to Wollaston and see him there...

1251
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:36,458
now and I would say.
"Squirrel. It's you or Frankie...

1252
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,333
who's it gonna be?"

1253
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:39,042
You think he'd even
think twice about it?

1254
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,500
You think he would?

1255
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,750
I don't know.

1256
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,792
Asshole.

1257
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:46,458
Fucking asshole.

1258
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,208
It's no wonder you did time.
Look, I...

1259
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,792
I don't have to look.
I know what's going on.

1260
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:52,500
I know what I gotta do.
I gotta find the right guy.

1261
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:54,625
Now, make the pick, kid,
and make it now.

1262
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,583
I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm not gonna do you a favor.

1263
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:58,458
It don't matter to me.
Just let me think.

1264
01:15:58,542 --> 01:16:01,458
No thinking.
Go or no go right now.

1265
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:02,458
I gotta get going...

1266
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:06,375
Fucking Jesus. Look, I don't know
if I can do this, you know.

1267
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:08,667
Can you do the other thing?

1268
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,208
No.

1269
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:20,042
Okay.

1270
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:22,250
So I guess you know then.

1271
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:25,708
That's the selection.

1272
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:36,167
All right. So, what do I got to do?

1273
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,167
You got to find out
where Johnny's gonna be.

1274
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,250
I already know.

1275
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:41,667
Yeah?

1276
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:45,708
He's got a girl.
You know, he told me that before.

1277
01:16:46,542 --> 01:16:48,625
Okay, and where you gonna be?

1278
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:53,000
I told him I'd be home, I'd be home.

1279
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,042
No, you're not.

1280
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:54,370
I'm not'?

1281
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,333
- No.
- Where?

1282
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:59,292
You're gonna be with me
and we're gonna be where he's gonna be.

1283
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,667
Jesus, look, I can't do that.
Look, if he sees me, it's allover.

1284
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:05,667
He's gonna know something's wrong.
I can't do that.

1285
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,167
I'll tell you...

1286
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,083
Okay, okay.

1287
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:12,167
So you made
the other choice then I guess.

1288
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:18,333
Have I really got to do that?

1289
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,417
All of it?

1290
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:24,458
I got to be there and everything?

1291
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:27,708
Frank. You made a mistake...

1292
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:31,000
and you got to show you understand
you made a mistake...

1293
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,042
and you gotta make things right...

1294
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:36,458
otherwise they're gonna
want someone to do something...

1295
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:38,375
like with Trattman.

1296
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,167
Never did the right thing.

1297
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,458
Jack, he's not a bad guy, you know.

1298
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:28,333
I mean, he's not a bad guy at all.

1299
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:32,250
None of them are, kid.
They're all nice guys.

1300
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,375
He was always all right to me.

1301
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:40,250
Sure, got you almost six years
in the fucking slammer.

1302
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,250
That wasn't his fault.

1303
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:44,167
Kid. When somebody does something...

1304
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:46,667
and gets somebody else jail for it,
it's his fault.

1305
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:48,167
That's the rule.

1306
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,167
Well, he didn't mean it.

1307
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,292
That's got nothing to do with it,
nothing at all.

1308
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,000
That them?

1309
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:01,375
No, John's got a Caddy.

1310
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,208
I know what he's got.
What I want to know is, that them?

1311
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:07,167
Nope. I'd have said it if it was.

1312
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:12,000
I think you got him all wrong
You know, that jail thing...

1313
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:13,333
you know, he had it worse than I did,

1314
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,458
you know,
with his family and everything.

1315
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,708
He's never gonna have to do it again.

1316
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,708
That's him.

1317
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:43,500
I'm not sure.

1318
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,625
Yes, you are.

1319
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,500
How long is he gonna be, kid?

1320
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,333
I don't know.

1321
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:27,333
Okay, I asked you nice.

1322
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:28,417
Now, does he fuck her here

1323
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,375
or does he fuck her someplace else?

1324
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:34,000
She's got a roommate.

1325
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:37,333
He knows a guy that's
got a motel down in Haverhill.

1326
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,583
Okay. It's just gonna be friendly then.

1327
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:52,625
Look, now, I was gonna get it started
and everything so we could have a start.

1328
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,500
There's probably going to be
a lot of noise and...

1329
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,042
I've known guys. Heard a lot of noise...

1330
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,708
got too good a start
and left somebody standing around...

1331
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:00,542
with their thumb up their ass.

1332
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,458
Fuck, fuck.

1333
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:04,958
Give me that start, kid.

1334
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,083
Kid, you're going too fast.

1335
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,708
Jesus, they're gonna have
all kinds of cops up in here.

1336
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:28,167
Yeah, and one of them's
gonna catch you. Slow down.

1337
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:32,625
Kid.

1338
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:36,375
Kid, just slow down.

1339
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:37,458
I can't.

1340
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:38,500
Kid, you got to.

1341
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,417
Slow the fuck down.

1342
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,583
Kid, my car's in Primrose.

1343
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:48,125
We got a long way to go.
Just slow the fuck down.

1344
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,167
You want to fucking drive?

1345
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,292
You know what you got to do, right'?

1346
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,333
Sure. I go down to where my car is,

1347
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:19,708
I leave this one, and I go home.

1348
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:21,250
Just leave it?

1349
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:24,667
Christ, I wipe it down.

1350
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,500
You gonna be all right and everything?

1351
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,667
Yeah, I'm gonna be fucking fine.

1352
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,375
Where's your car parked again?

1353
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:40,000
For Christ's sake,
it's in a lot down on Brownwood.

1354
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,458
Okay, just making sure.

1355
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:44,292
Sometimes guys forget.

1356
01:24:47,292 --> 01:24:48,958
I fucking got it.

1357
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:56,042
Okay, you gonna remember now?

1358
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:58,583
I know, I know.
I dump the fucking car...

1359
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:02,292
and I don't go too fast
and I wear my fucking seat belt.

1360
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:53,500
It's the answer spoken
by young and old...

1361
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:58,042
rich and poor.
Democrat and Republican...

1362
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,167
black, white, Hispanic,

1363
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:01,958
Asian, Native American,

1364
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,417
gay. Straight...

1365
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,667
disabled and not disabled.

1366
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:09,167
Yes, we're all the same.
We're all equal.

1367
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:13,167
That we have never been
just a collection of individuals...

1368
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:16,417
or a collection of red states
and blue states.

1369
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:21,125
We are and always will be
the United States of America.

1370
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,792
Next he'll be telling us
we're a community,

1371
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:24,417
we're one people.

1372
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:28,333
In this country,
we rise or fall as one nation,

1373
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:30,417
as one people.

1374
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,167
Had yourself quite a party.

1375
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:36,250
I do the best I can. Beer.

1376
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:41,208
So everything is under control,
I take it, at long last?

1377
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:44,292
For someone I'm trying to
help out and everything...

1378
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:46,458
you're awful hard to get along with.

1379
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:47,957
Could have made you drive up
to see me. You know...

1380
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:50,000
I didn't have to come down here.

1381
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,667
Trying to be nice to you.

1382
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:53,542
You're trying to be nice to me'?

1383
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:57,042
Sure. I'm a nice guy.
I like to make things easy on people...

1384
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:58,708
do people favors now and then.

1385
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:01,667
Do me a favor, don't do me any favors.

1386
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,292
I see how you work.

1387
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:05,625
Tell you what, just give me the money.

1388
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,625
Excuse me.

1389
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,167
Are you gonna count it?

1390
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:14,708
I gotta take a leak.
Leave me alone, all right'?

1391
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,000
Have another ginger ale,
for Christ's sake.

1392
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,417
Beyond our shores.
Parliaments and palaces...

1393
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,208
those who are huddled around radios...

1394
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:24,375
in the forgotten corners of the world...

1395
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,667
our stories are singular,

1396
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,958
but our destiny is shared.

1397
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:30,125
Tonight we proved once more

1398
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,042
that the true strength of our nation...

1399
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:35,250
comes not from the might of our arms
or the scale of our wealth...

1400
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,750
but from the enduring power
of our ideals...

1401
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,750
democracy, liberty,
opportunity and unyielding hope.

1402
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:50,500
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

1403
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:55,292
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

1404
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,542
Feel better?

1405
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:02,375
No. There's only 30 in there.

1406
01:29:03,583 --> 01:29:04,625
Three guys.

1407
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,792
Yeah, I had to ask them
if I should pay you for the kid.

1408
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:09,083
But, you know, they said I should, so.

1409
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:12,000
They were right too.
That's only ten apiece.

1410
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:13,125
Correct.

1411
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,667
The price is 15.

1412
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:17,500
Dillon charges 10.

1413
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:20,500
Recession prices.
They told me to tell you that too.

1414
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,083
I made a deal with Mickey for 15.

1415
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,667
Yeah, yeah, but the way they got it...

1416
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:30,000
Mickey got in a fight with a whore
the dumb shit...

1417
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:32,792
and now they got him in the can
and you're filling in for Dillon...

1418
01:29:33,042 --> 01:29:36,333
and you get what Dillon gets, no more.

1419
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:42,583
Talk to Dillon. Take it up with him.

1420
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:46,583
Dillon's dead.

1421
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Dillon died this morning.

1422
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,000
They're going to be
very sorry to hear that.

1423
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:02,167
Sure, sure, they are.
It's gonna cost them more.

1424
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,542
You know, this business
is a business of relationships.

1425
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:09,292
Yeah, and everyone loved Markie.

1426
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:14,333
You are cynical bastard, you know that?

1427
01:30:14,417 --> 01:30:16,042
To reclaim the American dream

1428
01:30:16,125 --> 01:30:19,625
and reaffirm that fundamental
truth that out of many,

1429
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:20,667
we are one.

1430
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:23,208
You hear that line? Line's for you.

1431
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:26,708
Don't make me laugh. We're one people.

1432
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,000
It's a myth created by Thomas Jefferson.

1433
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:31,500
Now you're gonna
have a go at Jefferson?

1434
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:34,000
My friend.
Jefferson's an American saint...

1435
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:35,083
because he wrote the words,

1436
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:37,167
"All men are created equal"...

1437
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,417
words he clearly didn't believe,

1438
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,500
since he allowed his own
children to live in slavery.

1439
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,000
He was a rich wine snob who was sick

1440
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:44,625
of paying taxes to the Brits...

1441
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:47,000
so. Yeah. He wrote some lovely
words and aroused the rabble...

1442
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,750
and they went out
and died for those words...

1443
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,625
while he sat back and drank his wine

1444
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,583
and fucked his slave girl.

1445
01:30:53,792 --> 01:30:56,375
This guy wants to tell me
we're living in a community.

1446
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:58,375
Don't make me laugh.

1447
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:00,667
I'm living in America,

1448
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:02,750
and in America, you're on your own.

1449
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:07,167
America's not a country.
It's just a business.

1450
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,708
Now fucking pay me.
