<i>I… I couldn't possibly have done it!</i>

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,330
I know what I say may seem unreasonable to you.

40
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,060
I also shouldn't pressure you like this.

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,570
But… but he is my brother.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,480
Just see it as my asking you to do me a favor.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,430
Could you impersonate CEO one more time?

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,210
Are you kidding me? Impossible!

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,890
William Yi can live without me, but not without Yi Shan.

46
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,320
Even if he recovers, when he finds out<br>the CEO position has been replaced,

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,620
he won't be able to live with that.

48
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,010
Ah Bin, I beg you.

49
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,710
Please...

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,860
No.

51
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,690
Can you please stop pressuring me?

52
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,290
Look at the way he is now. He really is very sick.

53
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,040
I don't want to! Why should I?

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,400
Then do you want to take a look at my mom's blood stains?

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,290
What wrong has my mother done?

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,720
She is still in a coma. Don't you know?

57
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,190
She is not better off than your brother.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,020
I'm very sorry.

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,420
I really can't help you.

60
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,610
<i>CEO, this way please.</i>

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,520
Not yet. Not quite yet.

62
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,180
The order for you to be the interim CEO<br>will be issued sooner or later.

63
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,910
It will surely happen soon.

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,380
By the way, CEO Zhao

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,450
how would you like your office decorated?

66
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,820
Just give me an order, I will hire a designer<br>to take care of it right away.

67
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,510
Haste can make a person blind.

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,450
Once I get the last straw that'll break the camel's back,

69
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,880
my plan will not be like this anymore.

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,580
I've endured everything for so long.<br>Do you think I can't wait another day or two?

71
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,920
Aren't we waiting for the board of directors<br>to have a vote in the board meeting?

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,180
All the directors are on your side, so the camel has already fallen. Why do we need the last straw?

73
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,820
Seriously, you...

74
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:14,140
With a brain like yours, how am I going to make you<br>the head of the secretarial department?

75
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,930
CEO, you mean...

76
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,490
I just took the medicine. Ask Maka Long to get the car ready.

77
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,160
I have to go to work.

78
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,740
- Brother..<br>- Ok, ok.

79
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,070
I will call Maka Long right away for you.

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,450
Did he lose his temper again?

81
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,240
He yelled at all the doctors and the nurses just now.<br>But at least he was willing to take the medicine.

82
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,260
Otherwise the doctor might suggest to tie him up again.

83
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,040
Are you ok? Your clothes are all wet.

84
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm fine.<br>Oh, don't be mad at him.

85
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,810
The doctor said, at first, because his mental state<br> is still unstable, so the dosage is higher.

86
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,450
Very soon when the drug begins to take effect,

87
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,890
his mood will be more stable.

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,550
You've done a lot these days.

89
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,150
William is suffering more than me.

90
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,610
William, lie down for awhile.

91
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,400
I will let you know when Maka Long is here.

92
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,410
Be good and lie here.<br>I need to go home now,

93
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,700
but I'll be back soon.

94
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,650
Don't worry.

95
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,900
You have to take good care of yourself.

96
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,590
You must be exhausted.

97
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,890
Take a rest after you get home.

98
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,780
No. I will be right back after I change my clothes.<br>It won't take long.

99
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,210
Brother. Take a nap.

100
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,550
Don't think about the company, ok?

101
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,490
Have you told the board of directors

102
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,680
that I can go back to work now?

103
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,730
Brother, I'm sorry.

104
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,590
None of them wanted to see me.

105
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,280
There is nothing I can do to help.

106
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,620
I don't think I can protect your CEO position.

107
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,090
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:47,470
Mom, God did hear what we were asking him.

109
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,220
There is a chance Mei Village might not get torn down.

110
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,170
Dad's sea will still belong to all of us.

111
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,580
But… you need to get better soon.

112
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,190
Without you at home, no one nags me.

113
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,600
I am too lazy to clean up now.

114
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,450
Our house is almost like a pile of garbage!

115
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,550
Do you hear me?

116
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,330
Also, didn't you, Uncle and Aunt Ah-Zhu

117
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,710
plan to take a trip to Hokkaido during the New Year?

118
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
If you don't get better soon,

119
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,450
you'll miss the tour.

120
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,010
Don't complain to me when that happens,

121
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,620
or ask me to take you there instead.<br>You hear me?

122
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,790
Mom!

123
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,660
Did your hand just move?

124
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,380
Move your fingers one more time.

125
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,980
I saw your hand moved. Do that again!

126
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,220
Ms. Lai Yu Xia, do you hear me?

127
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,770
Move your fingers again for me.

128
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,090
Mom!

129
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,390
Mom… I knew you could hear me.

130
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,360
<i>Come out with me for a second.</i>

131
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,480
Is it really a good idea to give him those books<br>about bipolar disorder?

132
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,790
I think my brother needs to face his problem directly.

133
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,920
That's the only way to solve the current difficult situation.

134
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,830
Exactly what else can we do to help William?

135
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,450
Every time when I remember it was my dad<br>who made William the way he is now,

136
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,630
I feel everything is my fault.

137
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,630
- I have done wrong to William…<br>- Katy Zhao.

138
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,600
Please don't look at it this way.

139
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,590
Your dad was only the last flash point.<br>As the doctor has said,

140
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,290
the cause of bipolar can be very complicated.<br>I think...

141
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,920
this is a test for my brother.

142
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,980
Perhaps if he can get through it this time,<br>we'll all learn to understand ourselves better,

143
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,170
and to understand others better.

144
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,270
But I am very worried. I worry whether or not

145
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,970
William will dislike me because of my dad.

146
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,240
He won't. He is not that kind of person.

147
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,510
Besides, you've done so much for him.<br>I'm sure he knows.

148
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,860
OK?

149
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,790
What the heck!

150
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,670
I don't believe any of these. Take them all away!

151
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,940
Where is Maka Long?

152
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,900
Why hasn't he come to tell me what's going on in the company?

153
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,570
Brother, could you let go of the company just for now?

154
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,130
You must face your illness first.<br>Only then we can really solve the problem.

155
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,800
Besides, the doctor has said

156
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,290
bipolar is something that might stay with you<br>for the rest of your life.

157
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,490
Yi Xin!

158
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,840
Why should I let a incompetent doctor decide my future?

159
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,280
I am only here to rest. I am fine!

160
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,760
I must go back to the office. I am going to Yi Shan.

161
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,540
Ok. I understand.

162
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,890
Let's rest a few more days then we'll go home, ok?

163
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,210
The weather is nice today. Take me out to get some sunlight.

164
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,170
Have a walk with me, ok?

165
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,810
Come!

166
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,700
"A bigot in power will soon find his punishment."

167
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,810
“It's never too late for a gentleman to take his revenge!"

168
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,020
Secretary office. How may I help you?

169
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,630
Secretary Song? He is not here right now.

170
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,650
To confirm the meeting time with Interim CEO?

171
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,440
Hello, this is Secretary Song.

172
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
Yes. Wednesday afternoon at 3PM.

173
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,880
Ok. I got it. Thank you.

174
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,490
Maka Long. From this day on,

175
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,550
all the documents and phone calls in the secretary's office

176
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,050
are off-limits for you. Do you hear me?

177
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,340
It's your working hours. Why are you here?<br>Go away now while William is still resting.

178
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,430
If he sees you, he'll definitely ask you<br> what's happening in the company.

179
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,410
- There is one thing I must tell you.<br>- What is it?<br>- It's...

180
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,620
Is this something I shouldn't know?

181
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,180
I don't think this is a good idea.

182
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,000
That's ok. There is nothing we can't let Katy know.

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,370
Tell us!

184
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,500
I found out that General Manager Zhao and Shiji Bank's VIP service department

185
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,730
made an appointment to open CEO's safe.

186
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,300
Is this something strange? He is the Interim CEO.

187
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,030
He is given the power to do so.

188
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,390
But I don't know why, I just find it weird.

189
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,790
So I called and asked Secretary Wan.

190
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,750
He said, in the safe, there are all the operating-before-authorization agreements between Yi Shan and its collaborators.

191
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,800
In short, those are the original copies of the memos<br>that were given to you.

192
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,430
If General Manger Zhao gets hold of the information,<br>I'm afraid he might use it against William.

193
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,950
I am going to scold him right now!

194
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,790
He has already made William this way,<br>what else does he want?

195
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,750
Calm down first. Don't act so impulsively!

196
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,390
How can I calm down?

197
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,210
Yi Shan is William's life.

198
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,910
What does your dad want to achieve<br>by getting these documents?

199
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,930
He is already the Interim CEO.

200
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,790
Even if he needs to call for a board meeting,<br>all the board members are on very good terms with him.

201
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,820
If they are to elect a new CEO,

202
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,740
your dad is very likely to get elected.

203
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,090
So why does he want to get these documents?

204
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,500
There is more…<br>Recently I found out that

205
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,750
they opened another company.

206
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,770
That company's capital flows look very strange.

207
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,550
Secretary Wan worries that, as the first step, Zhao wants to<br>completely defeat William

208
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,400
and make him unable to return to Yi Shan forever.

209
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,680
Next, he will drain Yi Shan's bank accounts.

210
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,340
So we definitely can't let him get hold of these documents,<br>otherwise we'll be doomed!

211
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
William?

212
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,250
I have to go to the office!

213
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,100
- Calm down!<br>- I'll definitely find a way to stop Daddy.

214
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,820
Go away, all of you!

215
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,190
Maka Long, hold on to him.<br>I'm going to call for help.

216
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,600
- Let me go!<br>- CEO, please calm down!

217
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,030
Problem… can't be solved this way.

218
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,100
Maka Long, let's go get the documents from the safe.

219
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,090
- I don't believe I can't do anything. Let me go!<br>- Brother!

220
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,060
Can't you focus on dealing with your<br>mental and physical health first?

221
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,990
I don't want to. I must protect Yi Shan.

222
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,920
I am nothing if I can't protect Yi Shan.<br>Go away!

223
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,840
Don't be like this, please!

224
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,190
We'll definitely find a solution.

225
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,540
Scram! Go away!

226
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,960
You want to go, right? I'll come with you.

227
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,680
I will come with you. So please calm down.

228
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,470
Katy Zhao, don't do this.

229
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't always yield to him, ok?

230
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,040
William Yi! We won't leave you.

231
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,020
Even if you don't have Yi Shan, or if you're not CEO,

232
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,010
I believe Dad would rather use Yi Shan<br>in exchange for your health. Do you understand?

233
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,240
I don't understand! I don't.

234
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,650
- Go away!<br>- Don't be like this.

235
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,310
Let me go! Let me…

236
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,300
Let me go!

237
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,180
<i>What are you doing?</i>

238
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,350
<i>Let me go! Let me go...</i>

239
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,580
<i>Katy, Katy! Tell them to let me go.</i>

240
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,800
<i>Let me go...</i>

241
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,990
All done! We can eat now.

242
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,760
Why are you standing there?

243
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,730
I forgot.

244
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,310
That's ok. Sit down first.

245
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,530
The doctor said

246
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,590
if there is a place to sit, don't stand.

247
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,550
He said we still need to watch out for<br>the increase of pressure in your brain.

248
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,530
But the doctor also said

249
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,320
after I'm home, I should also move around.

250
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,750
I was actually a "model patient" when I was in the hospital.

251
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,210
But after we came home, you won't let me do anything.

252
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,580
This feels harder than staying at the hospital.

253
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,810
Fine. Model patient.

254
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,000
Let me ask you. What exactly do you want to do?

255
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,950
Stop thinking if you can't figure out.

256
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,670
The doctor said this is the aftereffect of your head injury.<br>We have to be careful in the next couple of years.

257
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,690
What exactly should we do now?

258
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,050
Are we going to keep sitting here without<br>coming up with an idea?

259
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,960
If you have nothing to say, I'll go and talk to Daddy directly.

260
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,110
There is one solution.

261
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,370
It won't be possible.

262
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,950
Even if it's not possible, we still need to give it a try.

263
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,510
Otherwise should we ask CEO to give up Yi Shan?

264
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,660
What solution?

265
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,380
I won't go!

266
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,510
Exactly what is it?

267
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,270
We'll go and talk to Ah Bin.

268
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,930
Buddy, we can only count on you now.

269
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,190
If you don't help, General Manager Zhao will take away<br>the entire Yi Shan, you know?

270
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,690
Lower your voice. My mom is resting inside.

271
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,380
Ah Bin, we really don't have much time left.

272
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,520
William was going to rush out of the hospital<br>when he heard the news.

273
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,030
But he really is in terrible shape right now.

274
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,070
I beg you.

275
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,790
Frankly speaking, don't you think it might work better<br>if you go and beg your dad directly?

276
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,740
Do you think I don't want to?

277
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,370
I already threatened to cut the ties with him,

278
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,890
but he didn't cancel the appointment with the bank.

279
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,780
We must get to those documents before he does,<br>so we can protect William,

280
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,550
and protect Yi Shan.

281
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,880
We are not begging you to go back to being the CEO.

282
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,590
We only hope you'll help us for just one day.

283
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,550
I beg you...

284
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,740
Alright. Please say no more.

285
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,850
Even if I want to help, I can't.

286
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,860
I really can't leave my mom home alone.

287
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,250
Besides, I really don't care what happens to<br>Yi Shan Construction.

288
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,010
You should go now.

289
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,700
Very well. Let's go.

290
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,770
William has to take care of his own future.

291
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,700
We shouldn't put all the responsibly on you.<br>Let's go.

292
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,810
If Ah Bin doesn't go back to Taipei with us,<br>I won't leave.

293
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,190
Miss Katy. Let's not make this difficult for Ah Bin anymore.

294
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,530
Let's go.

295
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:48,960
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Royal Team @ Viki</i>

296
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,330
Mom, how come you didn't stay in your room and rest?

297
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,990
These days, in order to take care of me,

298
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,400
you have lost a lot of weight.

299
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,360
Not… not really.

300
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,090
When you eat, I eat too.<br>Look at my tummy.

301
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,460
You're all skin and bones.

302
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,500
Madam Lai Yu Xia.

303
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,800
Couldn't you just simply enjoy the 6-star service that I offer you?

304
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,030
Be good. Go and rest.

305
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,370
I'm fine.

306
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,110
Sit down.

307
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,210
Son. Are you really not going to help Stonehead?

308
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,670
Very soon we'll get that last straw.

309
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,890
Yi Shan… Yi Shan.

310
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,290
I might feel reluctant to rename you "Zhao Hai" one day.

311
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,900
Congratulations, CEO!

312
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,430
Listen. Let's find a place tonight

313
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,960
and have a big celebration!<br>This last blow

314
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,060
will definitely knock down William Yi so hard<br>that he can never get back up.

315
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,430
Only then will Katy give up on him.

316
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,680
Thank you.

317
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,750
Silly. Why did you say "thank you"?

318
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,100
Are you done being corny?

319
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,200
We're getting late.<br>Let's go.

320
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,840
Let's go.

321
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,530
Hurry!

322
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,180
I thought my appointment was with General Manager Zhao.

323
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,720
Let me make a call and check.

324
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,140
I am the current CEO. Can't I open the safe<br>without an appointment?

325
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,850
Perhaps you prefer that I ask your General Manager<br>to come and see me?

326
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,570
I'm been here so many times.<br>What's the situation now? What's going on?

327
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,340
Sorry. My apology.<br>This way, please.

328
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,350
Please key in the password.

329
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,200
Password?

330
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,060
<i>♫ I want to build <br>a whole new different world. ♫ </i>

331
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>♫ I welcome you, <br>welcome you to experience it. ♫ </i>

332
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,870
I've signed the form.<br>Can we go to the safe now?

333
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,920
Just a moment, please.

334
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,650
Please key in the password.

335
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,030
Password?

336
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,490
Sorry. It's not correct.

337
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,850
I haven't come here for a long time.<br>Don't quite remember the password.

338
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,810
I thought everyone uses his own birthdate as the password.

339
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,520
Dad's birthdate is 0715

340
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,010
Try it.

341
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,740
Sorry. It's not correct either.<br>You have one last chance.

342
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,370
Daddy… Daddy!

343
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,870
I've finally found you.

344
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,040
What are you doing here?

345
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,230
Daddy, didn't you tell me, because William's mind is unstable,<br>that we'll have domestic violence?

346
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,720
I have thought it through. You should call President Guo<br>and arrange a blind date for me and his son.

347
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,540
We'll talk about this later!

348
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,770
- Daddy!<br>- What?

349
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,010
I want you to ask Secretary Song to make the call right now.

350
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,360
No… not now...

351
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,650
Come on, Daddy!<br>See? I've waited so long that my hair has turned grey.

352
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,850
- General Manger Zhao, we're late.<br>- Enough… stop...

353
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,120
- Daddy!<br>- Hey! Stop this nonsense.

354
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,140
- Close the door.<br>- Yes, Sir.

355
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,650
Oh, no!

356
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,460
Hello? My daddy just went up.

357
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,750
Yes. I understand.<br>Very good.

358
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,000
Have you thought of anything?

359
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,060
We can try mom's birthdate, 1031.

360
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,780
CEO, this way, please.

361
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,550
CEO, this way, please.

362
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,910
How come no one is here?

363
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,160
Why haven't they come down yet?

364
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,120
<i>♫ I walk with my chin up<br> to pursue my own kingdom. ♫</i>

365
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,870
Please help them get the documents, God.

366

<i>♫ I don't need a royal mace or cape,<br> or even a prestigious lineage, ♫</i>

368
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,970
So? Did you get it? Did you?

369
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,230
Yes!<br>Hurry, let's go!

374
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,710
How did you guess that my brother would use the date<br>my mom passed away as the password?

375
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,750
Judging from your brother's eccentric personality,

376
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,320
I think the most conflicted and painful day in his life

377
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,980
is probably the most important day for him.

378
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,940
About your mother's passing away, I don't know <br>if that brought him feelings of hate or sadness.

379
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,290
He probably couldn't tell himself.

380
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,700
I didn't expect that you would understand him so well.

381
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,750
I probably got too into it after<br>pretending to be William Yi for so long.

382
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,070
Right now I don't know if I feel happy or unhappy.

383
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,920
You two! Are you done yet?

384
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,480
If General Manager Zhao sees us, we won't see the end of it.<br>Let's go now.

385
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,300
Okay!

386
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,920
Are you reading the books Yi Xin bought for you?

387
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,170
I'm going to tell you some good news.

388
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,870
About the documents in the safe, we've got them!

389
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,050
You don't need to worry anymore.

390
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,400
You? How did you do that?

391
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,120
Come. Come with me.

392
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,050
But you have to promise me that<br>you definitely won't get mad.

393
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,990
Come on!

394
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,950
You guys are so strange.

395
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,100
You said you were taking me to the airport,<br>but you brought me here instead.

396
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,250
Why do you want me here? <br>You can simply hand him this stuff yourself.

397
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,920
He and I have nothing to say to each other.

398
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,030
Besides, I have to go back to Mei Village today.<br>Uncle is helping me take care of my mom.

399
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,760
- I'm going.<br>- Wait.

400
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,630
Ah Bin. I really think you two should have a talk.

401
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,950
Since you agreed to help him, why not<br>hand him the documents yourself?

402
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,790
I don't want to.<br>This really feels weird to me.

403
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,370
I've got to go.

404
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,620
Actually we've still got things to do.<br>So you should have a chat with CEO.

405
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,710
Let's go! Go!

406

<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Royal Team @ Viki</i>

You…<br>Are you alright?

408
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,400
You…<br>Why did you help me?

409
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,930
Even my mom is not mad at you, why should I be?

410
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,020
Auntie doesn't blame me?

412
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,610
<i>Are you sure you're not going to help Stonehead?</i>

413
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,690
<i>Secretary Wan said</i>

414
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,920
<i>for Stonehead, Yi Shan is as important as his own life.</i>

415
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,390
<i>If the company is lost,</i>

416
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,740
<i>I wonder if worse things will happen to Stonehead.</i>

417
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,440
<i>Look at the way you are now,</i>

418
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,810
<i>you should stop worrying about him, ok?</i>

419
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,390
<i>However, if not because of what happened to me,</i>

420
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,640
<i>maybe I would never have had a chance to know</i>

421
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,610
<i>how much my son treasures and cares about me.</i>

422
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,720
<i>Do you know?</i>

423
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,320
<i>I really don't blame Stonehead at all.</i>

424
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,380
<i>Have you ever thought about it?</i>

425
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,040
<i>It was because his heart was sick,</i>

426
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,120
<i>that's why he couldn't control himself.</i>

427
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,620
<i>If he knew he would make me go through an operation<br>and stay in the hospital for so long,</i>

428
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,900
<i>I'm sure he would blame himself</i>

429
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,160
<i>and feel very bad.</i>

430
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,310
<i>I don't believe a bit of it.</i>

431
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,550
<i>He will feel bad? And blame himself?</i>

432
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,870
<i>That's because you don't know him.</i>

433
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,150
<i>When Stonehead was staying in our house,</i>

434
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,140
<i>when I was feeling unwell, he cooked for me.</i>

435
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,670
<i>He also helped me hang the laundry to dry.</i>

436
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,740
<i>He did take care of me.</i>

437
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,690
<i>There is more.</i>

438
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,390
<i>When I had a car accident,</i>

439
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,100
<i>he was more anxious and worried than anyone else.</i>

440
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,230
<i>You… should believe that your mom is right about him.</i>

441
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,580
<i>Stonehead is definitely not a cold-blooded person.</i>

442
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,700
<i>Mom. Hasn't Yi Shan given us enough troubles already?</i>

443
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,700
<i>Every time when I think of William Yi,<br>I get incensed.</i>

444
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:16,730
<i>So… are you going to live your life in hatred?</i>

445
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,720
<i>Do you really think</i>

446
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,570
<i>you'll feel better this way?</i>

447
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,780
<i>You should put yourself in his shoes<br>and think about how he feels.</i>

448
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:39,580
<i>He has to manage such a big company.<br>Imagine how stressful that is.</i>

449
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,410
<i>Besides,</i>

450
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,930
<i>he only wanted to carry out his father's death wish.</i>

451
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,830
<i>So, I think he must be just like you.</i>

452
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,530
<i>He is definitely a very filial kid.</i>

453
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,790
<i>As you know,</i>

454
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:04,190
<i>he was kidnapped by his own mother when he was little.</i>

455
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,570
<i>What I got was a wound on my body.</i>

456
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:12,130
<i>But Stonehead? He had a wound in his heart.</i>

457
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,260
<i>Haven't you heard this before?<br>"No medicine cures heartsickness."</i>

458
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,190
<i>The pain in the heart can't be helped by medicine.</i>

459
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,930
<i>What Stonehead needs the most now</i>

460
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,550
<i>is his family and friends</i>

461
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,890
<i>who will sympathize with his pain</i>

462
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,090
<i>and care about him with love.</i>

463
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:42,880
<i>♫ Is this me? I guess so. ♫</i>

464
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,100
I'm really not used to this kind of situation.

465
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,070
This is the memo Secretary Wan gave me,

466
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,710
plus all the documents we took from your safe.

467
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,310
Now I'm giving them all back to you.

468
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:07,270
This is your reward for helping me. You should keep it<br>as a way to protect your house. I don't want it.

469
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,180
To be honest, that idea did cross my mind.

470
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,390
However, when I was on my way to Taipei,<br>I did a lot of thinking.

471
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,730
My dad used to tell me this.

472
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,240
Being a person, I should alway take the right path,

473
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,440
and do my best on everything.

474
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,860
Don't ever use dishonest methods to achieve my goals,<br>let alone hurting others.

475
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,840
About protecting Mei Village, I'll never give it up.

476
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,450
But I will use my own methods.<br>I don't need these documents.

477
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,820
Why?

478
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,320
How come I treated you this way

479
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,210
yet you chose to treat me like this?

480
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,630
I was once very mad at you.

481
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,280
I don't understand why you had to harass me like that.

482
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,980
But if I can't let this go, I can't move on with my life.

483
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,300
Aren't there a lot more beautiful things in the world?

484
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,360
My mom is right.

485
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,200
If I keep on hating someone. In the end,<br>I'll be the one who suffers the most.

486
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,910
This time, it's not that I'm helping you.<br>I'm helping myself.

487
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,890
So… we don't owe each other anything.

488
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:55,160
<i>♫ I don't want to be a shadow-like man<br>who loses traction and loses his way, ♫</i>

489
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:01,790
<i>♫ getting lost in the coldest valley without sunshine. ♫</i>

490
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>♫ The more I want to escape,<br>the more winding roads I have to take. ♫</i>

491
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,400
<i>CEO, I've sent someone to check.</i>

492
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,780
William Yi is still staying at the psychiatric center.

493
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,460
So the person who went to the safe that day<br>was definitely not him.

494
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,160
I knew it! It was Liu Wen Bin.

495
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,370
It looks like William Yi's illness is hopeless.

496
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,750
He couldn't even go to the safe himself.

497
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,000
But, CEO. Now we don't have the documents to prove that<br>William Yi and his father worked in collusion with the government.

498
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,280
We can't defeat William Yi.<br>What should we do next?

499
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,660
What are you afraid of?

500
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,770
Look at how sick William Yi is right now.

501
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,320
You don't believe I can handle a fishmonger?

502
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,230
Let me tell you.<br>As long as I'm still in this CEO position,

503
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,890
whatever tricks they want to play...<br>Bring it on!

504
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,300
<i>I sincerely thank all the board members,<br>despite your busy schedules,</i>

505
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,590
for attending this emergency board meeting.

506
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,850
The purpose of this meeting

507
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,670
is to elect a new CEO.

508
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,710
Allow me to thank you again for coming today.<br>Thank you.

509
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:19,060
I guess William Yi won't be able to attend this meeting.

510
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,160
Why don't we just count his vote as abstained?

511
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,070
- Secretary Song. Go and get the ballot box.<br>- Yes, sir.

512
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,500
<i>♫ I want to build a whole new different world. ♫ </i>

513
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,950
<i>♫ I welcome you, welcome you to experience it. ♫ </i>

514
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,540
I guess William Yi won't be showing up today.

515
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,680
Why don't we just count his vote as abstained?

516
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,800
Secretary Song. Go and get the ballot box.

517
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,440
Yes, sir.

518
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,720
General Manager Zhao. Both William and I are board members.

519
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,300
The meeting shouldn't have started without us.

520
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:21,140
Excuse me. I'm the CEO of Yi Shan Construction now.

521
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,420
Please stop calling me General Manager Zhao.

522
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,550
It's "interim" CEO.

523
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,760
Are you… the real William Yi or the fake one?

524
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,350
Maybe you're actually the fishmonger<br>from Mei Village, Liu Wen Bin!

525
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,990
What are you doing here? What are you trying to...

526
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,290
Everyone. You probably don't know about this.

527
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,530
William Yi, when he was sick,

528
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,970
got a stranger to impersonate him as CEO.

529
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,050
He treated Yi Shan Construction as a joke.

530
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,040
Do you think we should let this kind of person<br>continue to lead Yi Shan?

531
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,490
That's right. I have been sick.

532
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,490
Therefore, I've decided to take a long vacation.

533
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,950
Now that's better.

534
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,800
Since you're sick, you should take a good rest.

535
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,370
Being able to understand yourself is a sign of growth.

536
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:42,140
Don't worry. You can leave the company with me.

537
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,200
All you need to do is to rest and get better.

538
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,330
Secretary Song.

539
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,640
Yes.

540
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,230
Wait.

541
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,890
Although currently I am not suitable,<br>I would like to recommend someone for this position.

542
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,820
- How come they look so alike?<br>- They look like twins.

543
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,080
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Royal Team @ Viki</i>

544
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,620
Ladies and gentlemen. Allow me to formally introduce to you

545
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,810
Mr. Liu Wen Bin.

546
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,740
In these past few months,

547
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,230
he worked as CEO while I was sick.

548
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,910
That is the truth.<br>In addition to myself,

549
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,920
Secretary Wan and Maka Long can also testify.

550
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,340
In order to avoid any chaos,<br>we haven't been able to explain the situation to you all.

551
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,230
But please believe in us.

552
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,780
William never treats the management of Yi Shan lightly.

553
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,340
William Yi. What are you trying to do?

554
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,960
Do you think by finding someone who looks like you,<br>you can fool the board members?

555
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,950
What exactly do you want?

556
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:14,200
Don't tell me you're going to say you two are actually<br>blood-related brothers,

557
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,090
and use that as an excuse to keep your CEO position?

558
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,900
Of course there is a reason<br>why we made such a recommendation.

559
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,340
Director Zhang. Recently you just bought two houses.

560
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,060
I believe that was because Yi Shan's stock price<br>has gone higher,

561
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,140
and brought you quite a lot of profit.

562
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,310
Director Wang. I believe you're in a very good mood too.

563
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:41,300
I heard that you bought an<br>antique Qing Dynasty china piece at an auction,

564
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,490
and that you paid quite a lot of money for it.<br>Jennifer from Ju Yi Gallery already told me.

565
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,540
In the past three months, everyone could see<br>Mr. Liu Wen Bin's work as CEO was outstanding.

566
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,440
Yi Shan's stock price increased by 8%.

567
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,880
Because the negative news reports<br>about our Gentle Village project

568
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,090
got turned around because of his Resettlement Plan.

569
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:10,960
In addition, he also obtained the land in Xi Chuan, which our Development Department spent two years still failed to get.

570
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,770
Everyone. Can you think of anyone more suitable for the job?

571
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,100
You…!

572
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,810
Everyone. You definitely should not believe him.

573
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,630
What kind of nonsense is this?

574
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,400
If you let me be the CEO,

575
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,850
I can also let you earn a lot of money,<br>and enjoy a good, happy life.

576
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,490
You definitely shouldn't believe in<br>this pair of brother and sister.

577
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,530
Hey! Let's vote now. Hurry!

578
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,540
What are you doing?

579
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,410
Listen, don't do anything foolish.

580
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,550
If you insist on taking a vote,<br>I'll have no choice but to show the board

581
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,340
where the company's capital went<br>since you became interim CEO.

582
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,990
What do you think?

583
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:10,400
Everyone. If you would like to keep our company's stock price<br>at its current level,

584
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,910
and that the management of our company<br>can head to the right direction,

585
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,650
then please support Mr. Liu Wen Bin

586
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,040
and make him the new CEO of Yi Shan.

587
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,020
We've finally settled this.

588
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,420
I still don't think this is a good idea.

589
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,660
Can't you really come back to work?

590
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,550
Liu Wen Bin, if I could come back to work,

591
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,950
do you think I would've asked you to do me this favor?

592
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:56,010
You should know that I've never asked anyone for any favor.<br>You are the first one.

593
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,310
But you still gave me quite a fright.

594
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,760
Seeing Prince William from Yi Shan Construction<br>come to my house and refuse to leave,

595
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,330
my mom almost went nuts!

596
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,720
If I didn't agree to help you,<br>I'm sure she would have kicked me out.

597
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,750
Why have you changed so much?

598
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,490
I realized, pride may blind a person

599
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:34,380
and cover his ears, or even his heart.

600
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,220
It made me hurt people around me continuously.

601
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:43,120
I thought I was invincible, and that I could do anything.

602
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,790
I thought no matter what difficulties I was facing,<br>I would never get defeated.

603
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,660
But the truth is, I was only hiding my incapability.

604
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,260
Learning to understand myself

605
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,200
will be my life-long lesson.

606
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,110
Are you ok? Do you want me to pour you some water?

607
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,510
I'm fine.

608
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,120
This is only the side effect of the medication.

609
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,010
Oh. Let me get you some water then.

610
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,410
But seriously. Talking about your incapability<br>was really an overstatement.

611
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,340
You have such a fine educational background,<br>and you are such a hard worker.

612
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,130
You are very impressive already.

613
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,780
You, Prince William, belong to the team of winners.

614
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,450
When I was lying on the sick bed,

615
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,510
what often came to my mind was the time

616
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,290
when I was with your mother at your house,

617
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,180
and how I helped her sun the laundry and the salted fish.

618
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,220
Helping my mom sun the laundry and the salted fish?

619
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:26,600
Only recently have I realized that my mother<br>has passed away for almost 20 years now.

620
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:35,090
While I was staying at your house, I felt the most<br>peaceful and content, as I never experienced before.

621
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,640
<i>It was fate that brought us together.</i>

622
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,250
<i>In this dog-eat-dog world,</i>

623
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:58,640
all I think about everyday is how to be tougher than others.

624
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,830
I can never let anyone look down on me.

625
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:08,290
When you gave me those documents,<br>I was in complete shock.

626
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,580
Why didn't you use those as a weapon to attack me?

627
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,100
That was too insulting, Liu Wen Bin!

628
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,820
What you did put me at a loss what to do.

629
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,800
Does this mean I should apologize to you?

630
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,740
There is more.

631
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,940
Maka Long, Secretary Wan, Yi Xin, and even Katy.

632
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:42,080
The way they look at you is so different from<br>the way they look at me.

633
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,470
How come they love you more?

634
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:51,050
No doubt I'm more exceptional than you.<br>How could I lose to you?

635
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,310
You people in the winning team really have a tough life.

636
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,100
Therefore, I decided to hand the company over to you.

637
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,740
What… what did you say?

638
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,900
<i>♫ I've finally realized that<br>the ability to be my true self ♫</i>

639
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,580
<i>♫ is the most precious gift of all. ♫</i>

640
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,880
<i>♫ I want to build a whole new different world. ♫ </i>

641
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,770
<i>♫ I welcome you, welcome you to experience it. ♫ </i>

642
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,130
No doubt I'm more exceptional than you.<br>How could I lose to you?

643
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,590
You people in the winning team really have a tough life.

644
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:49,300
Therefore, I decided to hand the company over to you,

645
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,100
and make you work like a dog.

646
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,050
What… what did you say?

647
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:00,310
To admit that I am weak, imperfect,

648
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:03,310
and that I lost to a fishmonger

649
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,520
is much more painful than managing a company, you know?

650
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,920
I haven't been talking this much for a long time.

651
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,480
It does make me feel tired,

652
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,640
so I'm going back to rest.

653
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:27,160
There are so many things going on in the company.<br>If we don't have a discussion first, how am I to handle it?

654
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,250
Besides, my ideas are so different from yours.

655
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:39,140
Liu Wen Bin, Mr. CEO.<br>Just do whatever you like.

656
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,380
- Bye.<br>- Hey!

657
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,580
We agreed this is only temporary.<br>You have to come back after you get better. Hey!

658
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,240
You can do it.

659
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,830
Good morning, everyone.

660
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,890
Before today's meeting starts, I have<br>two announcements to make.

661
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:20,070
First. The development of Bella Villa Hotel Resort<br>will be halted immediately.

662
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,890
- No way!<br>- How can this be?

663
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,300
But… CEO.

664
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,340
This is a BOT case with a signed contract.

665
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:35,200
If we halt the development, we might be sued<br>by the county government for breach of contract.

666
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,150
About this case, I've already had a discussion<br>with the previous CEO.

667
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,620
We were going to begin the construction without<br>doing an environmental impact assessment first.

668
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,490
This would have brought us a lot of<br>public censure and social risk.

669
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:51,090
So if we insist on going ahead with the construction,<br>we'll have more to lose.

670
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,610
There were flaws in this BOT case.

671
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,370
If the county government decides to sue us,

672
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:00,210
that's fine. I'll take the responsibility.

673
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,430
Any other questions?

674
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,820
The second announcement.<br>Manager Wang.

675
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,720
I would like you to resume the Gentle Village Resettlement Plan.

676
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:26,560
Of course, the planning for Xi Chuan will have to be<br>as how we initially agreed with the land owner, Mr. Ou.

677
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,870
You won't change it again, right?

678
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,650
This is the last time?

679
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,170
Yes, the last time.

680
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:42,170
You've been working very hard. Sorry.

681
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:54,120
General Manager Zhao. Do you have any important suggestion that you would like to share with us?

682
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,450
No.

683
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,800
Now let's begin our meeting today.

684
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,790
If you're not ready, we can go back.

685
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,380
I didn't expect it would be this hard.

686
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,140
Mom. Brother is here to see you.

687
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,420
Mom.

688
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:00,020
I really hate you.

689
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,380
When every Mother's Day comes,

690
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,480
my heart aches as if being cut by a knife.

691
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,850
How could you treat me like that?

692
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:26,110
How could you be so heartless?

693
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,390
<i>Mom! Don't go! Don't leave me tied up here!</i>

694
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,750
<i>Why? Mom! Save me!</i>

695
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,890
<i>Be good, William. Don't cry.<br>Someone will be here to save you soon.</i>

696
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,270
<i>- Don't cry. Be good.<br>- Mom!</i>

697
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:44,390
<i>Don't leave me here. Mom!</i>

698
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,700
I really, really wish I could forgive you.

699
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,390
But… but I can't.

700
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:05,110
I can't.

701
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,880
However...

702
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,890
I miss you so much.

703
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,710
Mom...

704
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,880
I miss you...

705
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,110
<i>William. I'm sorry.</i>

706
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,380
<i>Mommy is sorry.</i>

707
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,900
Brother...

708
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:01,130
Please don't cry.

709
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:16,530
<i>The doctor said you've made a lot of improvement.</i><br>What great news!

710
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,810
Even though the doctor has already reduced my dosage,

711
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:26,350
if I had to go back to work right now,

712
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:31,120
to be honest, I'm not sure I could do it.

713
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,930
But life is like that.

714
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,100
I think you used to push yourself too far.

715
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,240
Don't you think it's a good thing to relax a bit<br>when you have this chance?

716
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,980
In fact, I'm quite happy,

717
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,690
because you have more time to be with me now.

718
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:50,570
I actually hope your vacation can go even longer.

719
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,200
Katy.

720
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,790
Thank you, for never giving up on me.

721
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:10,770
Without your being by my side and<br>supporting me unconditionally,

722
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,910
I don't know how I would have turned out.

723
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,860
This is just how love should be.

724
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:27,580
Besides… being able to stay next to you makes me feel... very happy.

725
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:36,970
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Royal Team @ Viki</i>

726
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,270
<i>♫ I want to build a whole new different world. ♫ </i>

728
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,550
<i>Daddy.</i>

729
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,390
Do you still see me as your dad?

730
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,000
I'm sorry, Daddy.

731
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,800
Would you please stop being mad?

732
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,380
<i>General Manager Zhao.</i>

733
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,710
What are you doing here?

734
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,720
This is my private place. Please get out.

735
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:28,420
Let me get straight to the point then.

736
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:32,410
I want to marry Katy.<br>Please give us your blessing.

737
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,580
Where did you get your confidence from?

738
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,330
Wasn't it enough how you humiliated me<br> in the board meeting?

739
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:51,590
You found a fishmonger to be my boss!<br>Now? What are you trying to do?

740
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:55,240
You want me to let you marry my daughter?

741
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,290
Who do you think you are?

742
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,590
During the board meeting,

743
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:08,080
I was simply presenting my standpoint as a CEO.

744
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,330
I had no intention to show you disrespect.

745
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:16,370
Besides, when that fishmonger was the CEO,

746
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,530
everyone could see what a good job he did.

747
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,190
Liu Wen Bin also said,

748
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,290
about our company's affairs, big or small,

749
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:25,560
no one knows them better than you do.

750
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,440
Therefore, while he stands in as CEO,

751
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,150
he'll definitely consult your opinions.

752
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,980
As to Katy and I...

753
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:45,610
If you would let her marry me,<br>will it still be necessary to say whom Yi Shan belongs to?

754
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:53,850
However, even if you oppose,

755
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,870
I will still marry her.

756
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,670
Is your face made of elephant skin?<br><i>(meaning "very thick-skinned)</i>

757
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:11,350
You really think you're a prince?

758
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,280
Can Katy only marry you?

759
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,510
Where did you get all that confidence from?

760
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:26,520
Daddy. William really loves me.

761
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,380
In my whole life, I'll only love him too.

762
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,240
Can't you just give us your blessing?

763
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,900
What are you talking about?

764
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,960
Daddy.

765
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,030
Dad.

766
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:46,060
Don't call me that!

767
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,700
You… watched me growing up since I was little.

768
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,130
As my father has passed away,

769
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,760
and Katy is your only child.

770
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,490
I really love her very much.

771
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:06,930
So… I will treat you as my own father.

772
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:12,480
You'll be the host of our wedding.

773
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,100
We will try to respect your

774
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,710
You're lucky that I haven't kicked you out of here.

775
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,550
What wedding?

776
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,610
I haven't agreed yet. What wedding?

777
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,090
Enough, Daddy.

778
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:40,460
You know William and I have been through a lot.

779
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,480
Now we're getting married.

780
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,310
Can't you just feel happy for me?

781
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,730
You silly girl. What's there to be happy about?

782
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:52,530
- Daddy…<br>- Why are you talking about getting married?

783
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,390
Dad. I'd like to toast to you.

784
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,420
Don't call me that.

785
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,230
Daddy.

786
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:18,610
Are you going to let me walk into the wedding by myself<br>without anyone holding my hand?

787
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:24,310
If I have to walk down the aisle alone, I'll be so wretched.

788
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,650
My biggest dream is to have you,

789
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:36,320
the person who loves me the most,

790
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,720
hand me to the man I love.

791
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,350
Can't you grant me this wish?

792
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:54,700
Don't cry. You…<br>I can't bear to see you cry.

793
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,970
Ok, ok...

794
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,770
Are you sure he is William Yi, not Liu Wen Bin?

795
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,600
Of course he is William.<br>I won't make the same mistake again.

796
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,360
But you did make the mistake last time.

797
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,050
I know I did, but not anymore.

798
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,000
You'd better not mix it up again.

799
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:05,670
Auntie. How are you feeling? Are you tired?

800
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:10,230
Not at all. It has only been a short walk.

801
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,520
I am supposed to take walks often anyway.

802
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,220
Otherwise, being trapped in the house everyday

803
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,990
and not being allowed to do any work,

804
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,520
I'd feel like I'm going to get sick.

805
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,760
I understand. This is how a patient feels.

806
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,640
All day long you're being watched. <br>You're not allowed to do this, and not allowed to do that.

807
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,340
Very annoying.

808
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,650
Actually, you really don't need to come and spend time with me.

809
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:42,580
I already told Ah Bin I can live alone. No problem.

810
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,070
If you have things to take care of, just go ahead.<br>Don't worry about me.

811
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,690
Right now, I'm not busy at all.

812
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,590
The one who is busy working is Ah Bin.

813
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:58,980
I'm enjoying my life, and I feel very content.

814
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,980
Auntie, thank you.

815
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,320
Thank you for making Ah Bin agree to help me.

816
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,260
Stonehead. Ah Bin said

817
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,530
you were the one who told him to cancel the development plan.

818
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:18,200
Do you know? As soon as you halted the development,

819
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,600
the county government immediately stopped<br>the expropriation plan.

820
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,570
I really want to thank you.

821
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:29,210
Thank you for letting the sea and the houses here

822
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,610
be preserved.

823
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:36,340
That project… shouldn't have been planned to begin with.

824
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,830
The coast of Mei Village really is very beautiful.

825
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:46,430
If a hotel resort is built, the coast<br>won't belong to everyone anymore.

826
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,070
Actually, we don't need to

827
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,660
keep things we like to ourselves.

828
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:59,560
Let things stay the way they are,<br>don't spoil them,

829
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,280
and just simply admire them.<br>That is the more correct attitude.

830
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,910
Stonehead, you really have changed.

831
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,980
That's all because of auntie.

832
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:18,660
That's strange. I didn't give you candies to eat.

833
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,860
How come you can say so many sweet words?

834
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,560
How about this? Tell me what you want for dinner.<br>I'll cook for you.

835
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,540
No way. You can't get too tired.

836
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:30,380
I will cook for you instead.

837
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,490
Really. It's not that I like to praise you.

838
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:39,400
Your cooking skill is getting better and better.

839
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,920
Last time the stirred fried salted fish rice you made,

840
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,970
it tasted better than Ah Bin's.

841
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,760
Of course. My cooking skill was better than<br>Ah Bin's from the start.

842
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,590
Ah Bin...<br>What does he know?<i>(In Taiwanese)</i>

843
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:58,560
Showing off your Taiwanese now? Beautiful!

844
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,970
Stonehead, do you smell something?

845
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,180
I think I do smell something.

846
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,430
<i>Help!</i>

847
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,550
<i>I burned my hair again!</i>

848
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,970
What happened to you?

849
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,940
Sorry, Auntie. I burned another pot of yours again.

850
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,000
But that's ok. I have a lot of pots at my house.

851
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,410
I will definitely buy you a new one.

852
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,970
That's ok. Don't worry about the burned pot.

853
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,690
But did your hands get burned?

854
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,990
No. I'm ok.

855
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,810
Are you alright?

856
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:37,760
I'm alright, but the kitchen is not.

857
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,080
Didn't I tell you that you don't need to cook?

858
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,020
Luckily you only burned a pot.

859
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,460
If you burn down this old house, I can't afford to repay.

860
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,390
I just wanted to help.

861
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,700
<i>Mom!</i>

862
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,600
Mom.

863
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,080
How come you're home already?

864
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,380
We took an airplane.<br>So we got here in no time.

865
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,390
How are you, Auntie?

866
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:05,690
Very good, very good.

867
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:10,220
Right now I feel very happy, with two sons here,

868
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,840
and two daughters-in-law!

869
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,840
- Katy, are you cooking?<br>- Mhm.

870
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,240
But... I made a mess.

871
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,290
Let me help you.

872
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:23,860
Great!

873
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:42,900
<i>♫ I want to build a whole new different world. ♫ </i>

874
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:48,240
<i>♫ I welcome you, welcome you to experience it. ♫ </i>

875
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,500
Right now I feel very happy!

876
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:57,030
I have two sons here, and two daughters-in-law!

877
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:03,000
- Katy, are you cooking?<br>- Mhm.

878
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,480
But... I made a mess.

879
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,400
Let me help you.

880
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,500
Great!

881
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,040
I'll take care of this.

882
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,650
Ok. You take care of it.

883
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:20,940
Auntie. Be careful.

884
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,610
<i>Ok!</i>

885
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,030
William Yi. My mom looks very well.

886
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,950
It looks like you do know how to take good care of her.

887
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:50,710
Of course. I use the discipline of managing a company to<br>take care of your mom.

888
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:54,030
I carefully select every thing she eats.

889
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,650
I also cook the food attentively,<br>making sure it's healthy and nutritious.

890
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:00,070
Really?

891
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,810
Bro. When are you going back to work?

892
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,670
You're having such a great time taking a vacation here,

893
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:08,520
but I have to read documents everyday,<br>which almost drives me nuts.

894
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,690
Actually... I like staying at Mei Village very much.

895
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,630
What did you say?

896
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:24,050
<i>Son! Go and bring me the biggest fish.</i>

897
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,210
- I'll be right there!<br>- Ok!

898
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,570
You've only stayed here a few days,

899
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:39,350
and you already think you are my mom's son<br>just because you look like me?

900
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:41,380
Please remember who you are.

901
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:46,370
You haven't touched any fish for such a long time, <br>how would you know what kind of fish your mom wants?

902
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,350
Give me a break.<br>Who am I?

903
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,030
I am Liu Wen Bin.

904
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:54,600
I am the best fish expert in Mei Village. Ok?

905
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,310
That's hard to say.<br><i>(in Taiwanese)</i>

906
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,640
That's right. I know you don't know how to speak Taiwanese.

907
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,230
You can just speak Mandarin with me.

908
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,300
I don't want to.<br><i>(in Taiwanese)</i>

909
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,420
Whatever.

910
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,320
Where are you taking me exactly?

911
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,990
Your mom was going to teach me how to cook.

912
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,090
Isn't the sea at Mei Village very beautiful?

913
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,310
You can never get tired of looking at it.

914
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,420
I know.

915
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:53,300
Actually, this place has beautiful mountains, ocean, and fresh air.

916
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:58,200
Anyone who lives here probably can stay very healthy. Right?

917
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:06,490
By the way! Next month a new CEO will be elected.

918
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:09,860
I probably can come back here to sell fish then.

919
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:15,550
My life probably will be just like the way it used to be.

920
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,440
That's really great.

921
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:23,990
You... What exactly are you trying to say to me?

922
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:28,360
Can it be... you're going to break up with me,

923
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,820
and telling me "going back to<br>the way things were", that sort of things?

924
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,560
No... no... That's not it.

925
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,840
It's... Eh...

926
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,140
I... I want to know if what you said<br>in front of the office building was true.

927
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,620
What did I say?

928
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:50,390
You... you said you were ready to move to Mei Village.

929
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:55,420
That...?

930
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,430
But... am I not living here right now?

931
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,940
That's true.<br>But...

932
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,030
Whenever I go back to Taipei, you also come with me.

933
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:12,120
When I come live at Mei Village, you do too.

934
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,720
This feel more like... traveling.

935
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:20,320
Therefore... you don't like it?

936
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,070
No... That's not what I mean.

937
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:26,550
Then what do you mean?<br>You're making me very nervous.

938
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,900
I'm very nervous too.

939
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,460
What?

940
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,280
Take this.

941
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,100
What is this?

942
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,460
Hold it.

943
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:43,170
Where are you going? Hey!

944
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,010
Hold onto it!

945
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:04,350
Yi Xin. Will you marry me?

946
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,670
What did you say?

947
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,690
I'll speak louder!

948
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:25,810
Yi Xin. Will you marry me?

949
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:41,050
Speak louder! I can't hear you!

950
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,370
Yi Xin!

951
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:57,590
I love you! Let's get married!
