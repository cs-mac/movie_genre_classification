A 7-week-old baby was in a crib,

you know, I was more or less
down with that.

883
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:16,402
At the same time that I started,
there was a new president.

884
00:53:17,073 --> 00:53:19,439
<i>O'Keefe was a different kind
of animal.</i>

885
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,443
<i>He had come
from sort of the business world</i>

886
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:25,581
<i>so he had a different mentality.</i>

887
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:28,115
He liked to mention
that he knew Karl Rove.

888
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:32,482
So in other words, he's plugged-in
and he's an operator.

889
00:53:32,655 --> 00:53:38,594
It's an incredibly complex subject,
and it's really about politics

890
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:41,026
and political control

891
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:46,726
and control of economic means
of production.

892
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:49,361
Climate is just a mechanism.

893
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:52,500
I'm pleased to be part
of your program

894

of the George C. Marshall Institute.

A small science-policy think tank.

896
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,643
KENNER:
Is Marshall actually doing science?

897
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:03,683
No, we're not doing science.

898

<i>What I try to do is make sure
our work reaches decision makers,</i>

900
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,828
so that we are part of shaping
the public policy debate.

901
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:21,197
<i>CRAWFORD:
I think a lot of people who get into that
think tank world start out as intellectuals</i>

902
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:24,135
<i>but, you know,

00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:26,969
<i>arguments become weapons.</i>

904
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:30,635
Part of this was gathering arguments
that were already out there,

905
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,476
they weren't always compatible
with one another.

906
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,813
Sometimes the argument was that,
"The Earth is not warming."

907
00:54:36,986 --> 00:54:41,514
We don't see a warming
of the atmosphere in the last 50 years.

908
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:45,593
<i>CRAWFORD:
At another time the argument would be,
"Well, yes, the Earth is warming</i>

909
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:48,491
<i>but it's not due to human activities."</i>

910
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:52,499
The fact that glaciers are melting
does not mean that the cause is human.

911
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:54,694
It only means that it's getting warmer.

912
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:58,034
<i>CRAWFORD:
At another time the argument would be,
"Yes, it is warming,</i>

913
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:02,668
<i>and it's due to human activities, but
the cost of doing something about it</i>

914
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:05,110
<i>would be ruinous for society."</i>

915
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:08,045
Of course there is a human influence
on climate.

916
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,209
We've known it for a decade or more.

917
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:13,219
If they go ahead
and regulate CO2 as a pollutant,

918
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:17,052
it will basically stop economic growth
in the United States.

919
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:20,321
And this is what many
of the enviros want.

I thought this was Marc Morano, my life.
No. Oh, okay. Ha-ha-ha.

1028
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:26,193
Catastrophic global warming is a hoax.

1029
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:29,492
<i>MORANO:
I got a call from Inhofe's office</i>

1030
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:33,294
to be the new communications
director. It was the lowest point

1031
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:37,803
when I started, in June 2008,
for global warming skeptics.

1032
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:50,782
<i>GORE:
If you look at the 10 hottest years
ever measured,</i>

1033
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:53,513
<i>they've all occurred
in the last 14 years,</i>

1034
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:56,658
<i>and the hottest of all was 2005.</i>

1035
01:01:58,327 --> 01:02:00,625
Al Gore's film--
I'd just watched the movie.

1036
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:03,731
I watched it the week
before I started the job.

1037
01:02:05,334 --> 01:02:08,861
<i>It was poised to win awards.
Later, he won the Nobel Prize for it.</i>

1038
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:11,666
So we decided for Inhofe
to go on the offensive.

1039
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:14,241
NASA scientist
and alarmist James Hansen--

1040
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:18,336
He's NASA's vocal man-made-
global-warming-fear soothsayer--

1041
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:21,347
He'd say almost anything
you asked him to say.

1042
01:02:21,517 --> 01:02:25,180
KENNER:
On some levels, it was not so much
directly talking about science

1043
01:02:25,354 --> 01:02:28,255
but it was going after
the scientists themselves?

1044
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:31,451
I mean, that was a change
that you brought to Inhofe.

1045
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,788
Yes, in fact we went after

1046
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:36,557
James Hansen
and Michael Oppenheimer

1047
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:38,700

<i>I couldn't believe they let me do this.</i>

1051
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:51,377
<i>I did a two-part, 10,000-word,
scathing critique on Hansen.</i>

1052
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,679
I'm not gonna question
his scientific work, but in terms
of his influencing the public.

1053
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:01,289
And actually his scientific work
isn't really in question,

1054
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:04,723
it's more of his public claims
and publicity and interviews.

1055
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:09,092
<i>I still felt restrained,

<i>"the underground newsletters,"</i>

1057
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:14,598

than anything else, had more fun,

01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:17,534
more humor, wit, sarcasm,

MORANO:

The challenge here is
it's a conversation started by liberals.
