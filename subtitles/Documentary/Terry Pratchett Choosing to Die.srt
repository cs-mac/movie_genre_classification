1
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,737
Well?

2
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,051
- I'm sending you the code.
- Yes, I see that. Thank you.

3
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,454
- What about my account?
- Delivering.

4
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,214
I just sent it. You should have it.

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,576
- Yes. Thank you.
- Hey, ...are you sure this is legal?

6
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,016
(woman) We're just running a test
on our security system, sir. It's fine.

7
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,456
You've got a sexy voice.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

8
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,496
- To you?
- We have all we need.

9
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,895
We're ready.

10
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,814
(gunfire/screaming)

11
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,336
Yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.

12
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,656
- What'd you do to my drive?
- I said I didn't touch it.

13
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,573
This isn't cool.
Don't ever, ever touch my computer.

14
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,412
(machines powering down)

15
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,737
Diagnostics show no damage,
but this was an intentional breach.

16
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,618
- We were hacked?
- It wasn't "Denial of Service" level,

17
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,373
but they definitely cracked our door.

18
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,651
OK. Open the Black Hat files.

19
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,574
I want every hacker in the country
who could have done this interviewed now.

20
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,529
Sir, that's close to 1,000 names. With the
holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.

21
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,454
We're the ones supposed to keep this from
happening, and it just happened to us. Do it.

22
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,008
Sir, it's the middle of the night.
They're scattered all over the country.

23
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,897
Get local law enforcement help.

24
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,974
Somebody out there thinks they can
screw with us. I wanna find out who.

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,049
( "Rock & Roll Queen" by The Subways
on car stereo)

26
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,129
- Jim! I said no.
- Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?

27
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,208
- Get out!
- What?!

28
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,416
- Get out of the car now!
- Don't touch me.

29
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,297
- No means no.
- What are you doin'?

30
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,690
- John, stop it!
- Don't call me that. I hate it when you call me that.

31
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,294
- You know this guy?
- Just shut your mouth right now.

32
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,974
Dad! Stop it. I mean it.

33
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,972
- "Dad"? You said your dad was dead.
- What?

34
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,692
You told this jerk-off I was dead?
You actually said that?

35
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,533
I may have exaggerated a little bit.

36
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,770
And this guy's what? Your boyfriend?

37
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,896
- No.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,572
I don't know, OK?
I'm sorry. We'll see.

39
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,418
What are you doing here?

40
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,175
- You don't answer your phone, you don't return my calls.
- Because I'm not talking to you.

41
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,776
- Why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
- Why not? What? You want a list?

42
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,411
How about stuff like this: you spy on me,
you drag my boyfriend out of the car...

43
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,411
- You said he's not your boyfriend.
- He's not!

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,378
- I thought you said I just was.
- Shut up.

45
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,569
You are such an asshole.

46
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,929
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend"
out of the car, OK?

47
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,494
- Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.
- No, no.

48
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,855
- Will both of you go away?
- Just talk to me.

49
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,534
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.

50
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,010
- Damn right you're going to bed alone.
- (sighs)

51
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,930
Lucy, honey, wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you. Just wait.

52
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,818
Dad, when I wanna talk to you -

53
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,131
if l wanna talk to you -

54
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,611
I'll call you.

55
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,851
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy!

56
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,489
- Lucy McClane.
- It's not McClane. It's Gennero.

57
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,931
Chicks, right?

58
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,376
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

59
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,771
(sighs wearily)

60
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,572
(beeping)

61
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,730
(man) John?

62
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,129
John? It's Sclavino.

63
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,455
- Go for McClane.
- What are you doing at Rutgers?

64
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,850
- How do you know where I am?
- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.

65
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,138
- I'm staring at exactly where you are.
- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.

66
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,337
Yeah, we did that.
John, we turned them on.

67
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,695
Listen, the feds have called in a favour.

68
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,012
They're doing a sweep. They want us to
pick up some computer hacker in Camden.

69
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,092
Last name: Farrell.
First name: Matthew.

70
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,933
Whoa, whoa. Camden?
What are you telling me this for?

71
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,296
- Just came in.
- Vino, it's 3am. I was on my way home.

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,213
Send a jughead from the Academy.
They'd be happy to do it.

73
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,612
I can't just send in a uniform.
The feds demanded a senior detective.

74
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,089
The kid's a high-value subject -
I don't know.

75
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,695
Just pick him up, escort him
to the Hoover Building in DC.

76
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,489
They had some kind of a computer breach
there this morning.

77
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,457
Great!

78
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,489
All right, give me that information.
Give me that name again. What is it?

79
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,298
You owe me one, Jack.

81
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,015
What?

82
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,977
Aw, come on.

83
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,538
Goddammit.

84
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,656
(knock at door)

85
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,332
(insistent banging)

86
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,175
(banging continues)

87
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,053
- Who is it?
- (McClane) NYPD. Open the door, please.

88
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,969
- Hi.
- NYPD?

89
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,656
OK. Oh, I get it. Don't worry, everyone
gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...

90
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,369
Hey, I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?

91
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,611
No. He, uh... actually
does not live here any more.

92
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,170
- Course not. Who are you?
- My name is Daisy Duke.

93
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,539
Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.
Please don't add to it.

94
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,295
- Can I see some identification, please?
- Yeah, sure.

95
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,731
Oh, "Detective"!

96
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,369
Yeah, that looks real!
You get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.

97
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,976
- Then of course...
- Yeah. That... actually looks pretty good.

98
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,816
Mmm.

99
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,132
Farrell! Sully just PDL-ed the new copy of
the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?

100
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,498
No! Thanks, though, man.
And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.

101
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,575
Open the door.

102
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,013
Shit.

103
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,489
Can I get you something?
Coffee? A warrant?

104
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,697
- What's this about?
- I don't know. Some computer thing.

105
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,658
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.

106
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,018
- Feds, huh?
- Yeah. The feds.

107
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,698
I've been White Hat for four years,
but once you're on that goddamn list...

108
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,498
Such a pain in the ass.

109
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,889
- You play with dolls?
- Huh?

110
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,255
- Could you not touch that?
- Like a Gl Joe?

111
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,615
No, it's not. It's a limited edition...

112
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,133
- Ooh.
-..and...

113
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,735
- That supposed to come off?
- No, but it's more valuable broken,

114
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,574
- so thanks for that.
- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.

115
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,810
I got some other cool shit you can break.

116
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,575
- Let's go, OK? Come on.
- I gotta power down my gear, OK?

117
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,570
More dolls. Not spending
a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?

118
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,690
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?

119
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,613
- (gunshot)
- Ow! Jesus, don't shoot!

120
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,053
Get down!

121
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,455
- Jesus Christ.
- Stay right there.

122
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,215
(Matt whimpers)

123
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,530
Go!

124
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,692
Let's go. Come on.
Low, low! Stay down!

125
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,896
- Agh!
- Come on.

126
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,095
(whispers) It's all right.
Stay low, all right? Stay down.

127
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,456
- You stay with me, all right? Here we go.
- OK.

128
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,858
OK.

129
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,011
That's gonna wake the neighbors.

130
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,977
Get down! Get inside!

131
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,658
They're back in the room!
They're back in the room!

132
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,211
Are you nuts? Get outta there right now!

133
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,858
- I'm trying to...
- Now!

134
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,379
Get back in there!

135
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,695
Aaargh! Argh!

136
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,331
Get ready to run.

137
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,690
(car alarms/barking)

138
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,455
(Matt sputters and groans)

139
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,377
- What the hell was that?
- What?

140
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,338
- Did you do that?
- No.

141
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,253
- Shit.
- I didn't do that. Come on.

142
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,697
- Shit.
- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.

143
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,577
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's go, goddammit!

144
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,976
Come on.

145
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,971
Watch it. Slow it down.

146
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,655
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

147
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,970
Hey, let's go. Come on.

148
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,610
Come on, come on. Stay close.

149
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,140
Stay with me. Stay with me.

150
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,216
Come on, let's go. Stay close.

151
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,768
Get in the car. Go, go.

152
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,290
- Kid, can you reload a gun?
- What? Me?

153
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,575
- Can you reload a gun?!
- l...

154
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,657
Open the glove box
and get a magazine out right now!

155
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,489
Grab the gun from the back seat!

156
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,973
You OK?

157
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,815
Get your head down.

158
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,495
Jesus! Is the circus in town?

159
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,174
Whoa!

160
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,415
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.

161
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,376
Camden base, 10077. Come back.
Camden base, 10077.

162
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,813
Go ahead.

163
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,609
I need to speak to your chief of your
detectives. Police emergency, asap.

164
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,133
Stand by.

165
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,452
- (man) This is Chief Detective Wiesman.
- This is Detective John McClane, NYPD.

166
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,738
Police emergency. I wanna report
a police shooting in your jurisdiction.

167
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,651
(phone rings)

168
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,530
- Yeah?
- (woman) What's the status?

169
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,493
Wait one.

170
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,700
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey.
Farrell's still alive.

171
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,289
- So he got away.
- Yeah.

172
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,610
I did send five of you, is that right?

173
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,130
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll
track 'em down. Think you can handle that?

174
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,697
- (Matt) Oh, my God.
- Just breathe.

175
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,056
I am breathing! I'm-I'm...
I can't stop shaking.

176
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,893
It's the adrenaline.
You're just scared. It'll pass.

177
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,973
Yeah, I'm scared!
Weren't you scared, back there?

178
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,132
Yeah. I was scared.

179
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,736
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, 'cause you seem really calm.

180
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,970
Have you done stuff like that before?

181
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,575
- Stuff like what?
- Like killing people.

182
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,610
Yeah. But not for a long time.

183
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,652
So who were those guys, huh?
Why were they trying to kill you?

184
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,016
Why did they blow up
my goddamn apartment?!

185
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,933
They were there to kill you.

186
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,969
- Why would they want to kill me?
- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.

187
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,249
We got seven dead hackers so far,
none of whom were high on our list.

188
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,889
- Get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,417
Trey. Matthew Farrell - find him for me.

190
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,252
On it.

191
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,575
What's with all the guns?

192
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,255
Operational prudence.

193
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,699
Think of them as hardware to your software.

194
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,496
(DJ) Good morning, DC! It's shaping up
to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.

195
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,210
If you've got any big plans, get started
early, 'cause the traffic is ramping up.

196
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,815
So here 's another golden oldie
for all the commuters out there.

197
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,811
( "Fortunate Son "
by Creedence Clearwater Revival)

198
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,494
What? What... What...

199
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,775
What are you doing? What is that?

200
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,737
- It's Creedence.
- Creedence?

201
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,813
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater
Revival? Classic rock?

202
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,017
I know who it is. It's old rock.
Doesn't make it classic.

203
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,933
- What sucked then sucks now.
- You don't like Creedence?

204
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,057
This is like having a pine cone
shoved in my ass.

205
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,815
- (turns up volume)
- OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.

206
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,777
Come on. I'm cooperating with you.

207
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,457
(man) We're at a heading of 060.
Making another pass.

208
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,339
Listen up, everyone.
Are we ready?

209
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,978
Transportation hubs are prepped and set.

210
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,016
Begin stage one.

211
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,329
(general consternation)

212
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,332
What? Nothing.

213
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,978
(snatches of radio talk shows)

214
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,138
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen
to popular music? Just give me a decade.

215
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,133
The '70s? I'm guessing.
Was Michael Jackson still black?

216
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,053
Pearl Jam.
I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.

217
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,971
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?

218
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,180
It's called news radio. I want to see if your
friends from Camden made the headlines.

219
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,535
Hold on. You listen to the news?

220
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,578
You got a problem with the news now?

221
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,572
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem
with the news.

222
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,209
Ready for this?
The news is completely manipulated.

223
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,372
Everything you hear, every single day,

224
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,409
is designed by corporate media to do
one thing only: to keep you living in fear.

225
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,297
- Oh, fear?
- Total fear.

226
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,339
So you'll go out and spend money
on things you probably don't even need,

227
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,059
so advertisers
keep buying ads on their stations.

228
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,019
I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this
all day. I got days of data at home...

229
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,738
- Hey.
- I'll drop a bomb on you...

230
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,809
- Hey!
- What?

231
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,178
- Shut up.
- That's good. Be dismissive instead of...

232
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,258
(car horns and tires screeching)

233
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,736
(sirens)

234
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,374
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

235
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,898
Just stay in the car. You'll be all right.

236
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,056
Hey, man. Hey.

237
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,658
You all right? Don't move.
Just call 911, all right?

238
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,651
OK.

239
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,373
Jesus Christ.

240
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,974
(sirens and alarms)

241
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,174
- All the lights are green.
- Huh?

242
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,820
All the lights are green.
Let's go. Right now.

243
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,892
- We gotta go?
- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.

244
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,579
- Let's go.
- I've never been in a car accident.

245
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,890
Well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.

246
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,732
- You been in a car accident?
- Yeah.

247
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,969
What are we doing?

248
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,497
It's a little thing they invented in the '60s
called jogging. You're gonna love it.

249
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,419
Sir, Chicago's reporting
a systems crash on the L train network.

250
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,970
(beeping)

251
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,052
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash
in their com system.

252
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,213
FAA just issued a critical alert.
Their ATC net just went down.

253
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,211
We're under attack.

254
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,499
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.

255
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,414
(alarm sounds)

256
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,256
That's the anthrax alarm.

257
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,858
All right, everyone out. Now! Now!

258
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,412
Taylor, move! Go! Move!

259
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,294
(alarm continues to sound)

260
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,654
(PA) All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

261
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,651
This is not a drill.

262
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,497
All personnel must evacuate and proceed
to the transportation shuttles immediately.

263
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,453
We need you inside, sir.

264
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,939
(siren)

265
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,851
Take your team. I want men
on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.

266
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,533
We gotta know what's there.

267
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,896
Run a trunk search on these data crashes,
try to lD the point of origin.

268
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,771
Begin stage two.

269
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,612
Hey, what's going on?

270
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,770
(shouts of "Sell! Sell!")

271
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,928
They're already starting to panic.

272
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,896
Of course they are.

273
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,414
They think that someone's
taking their money.

274
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,095
All those nickels and dimes they saved
had meaning.

275
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,092
"Useful idiots", as Lenin would say.

276
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,976
Prep the video package.

277
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,969
DC transportation system's crashing and
they just hit the financial sector. All of it.

278
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,656
Get me the secretary for trans and treasury
on the line and the chairman of the SEC.

279
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,972
Let's go, people. Somewhere
somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.

280
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,731
- Deputy Director Bowman in here?
- Not now. It'll have to wait.

281
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,779
Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.
I brought him here on orders from Bowman.

282
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,852
If you don't know what's goin' on,
find somebody that does.

283
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,089
I'm Bowman.

284
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,493
Video package is ready for upload.

285
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,055
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell,

286
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,018
but we are neck-deep
in damage control right now.

287
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,093
Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have
anything to eat, any snacks around?

288
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,569
I'd love...
I've got really low blood sugar...

289
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,855
- Sir?
- No?

290
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,095
As if the transportation breakdown and
anthrax scares weren't enough for one day,

291
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,138
the stock market
found itself in a selling frenzy.

292
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,018
The FTC believes this panic
might have been triggered

293
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,331
by a computer malfunction
in the stock exchange.

294
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,412
Oh, man, that is all bad.

295
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,493
It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills
to prepare for things like this.

296
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,137
- These your suspects?
- Were.

297
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,734
All seven were killed in the last 24 hours.

298
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,969
Recognise any of these people?

299
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,694
No.

300
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,498
Not one?

301
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,378
Sir, we got a system error.

302
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,413
( "Hail to the Chief" plays,
then breaks down)

303
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,855
- My fellow Americans...
-..it is time to...

304
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,932
strike... fear... into...
the hearts of... citizenry.

305
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,329
- Ask not...
- That's an unauthorised broadcast.

306
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,298
..what your country can do...
to avert... this... crisis.

307
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,053
- The answer is...
-..nothing whatsoever.

308
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,496
Our military... strength...
is... in this case...

309
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,808
..useless.

310
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,298
Read my lips.

311
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,535
The... great... confident... roar...
of... American... progress... and... growth...

312
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,180
has come to... an end.

313
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,253
All the... vital... technology...
that... this nation... holds dear...

314
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,299
all... communications... transportation...
the internet... connectivity...

315
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,292
electrical... power...
critical... utilities...

316
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,018
their... fate... now... rests...
in... our... hands.

317
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,456
We will not tire, we will not falter,

318
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,258
and we will not fail.

319
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,979
I don't know how they're getting in.

320
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,890
Thank you.

321
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,653
And a... happy Independence Day...
to everyone.

322
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,012
That was creepy.

323
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,897
I tried to find more Nixon.

324
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,497
Think they bought it?

325
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,536
Absolutely.

326
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,172
OK, I want telecom, transportation...

327
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,933
- Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
- What?

328
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,532
It's a fire sale.

329
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,895
Hey. We don't know that yet.

330
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,097
- It's a myth, anyway. It can't be done.
- It's a myth? Really?

331
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,614
Please tell me
she's not in charge of anything.

332
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,577
What's a fire sale?

333
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,938
It's a three-step systematic attack
on the entire national infrastructure.

334
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,218
Step one: take out transportation.
Step two: the financial base and telecoms.

335
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,054
Step three: get rid of all the utilities -
gas, water, electric, nuclear...

336
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,418
Anything that's run by computers,
which today is almost everything.

337
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,458
That's why they call it a fire sale -
everything must go.

338
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,929
Hey, listen... What's your name? Farrell?

339
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,013
Keep your voice down, OK?
No one here's talking about a fire sale.

340
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,979
Not unless you're telling me
you helped plan one.

341
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,290
No, man. I'm just saying...

342
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,894
Appreciate your concern.
We're on it. Thank you.

343
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,813
- You've done a bang-up job so far.
- What? What?

344
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,698
Nothing. I said I understand.

345
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,817
Hey. They didn't send the girl scouts out
to get this kid.

346
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,734
They sent professional guys, full
tactical gear. They blew the whole joint up.

347
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,416
Now, I don't know this kid,
and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence -

348
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,650
but somebody wants this kid dead,

349
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,779
and obviously it's got something to do
with whatever's going on here.

350
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,170
OK. Homeland's interrogating
the hackers we're bringing in.

351
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,058
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?

352
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,294
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.
I wanna know what he knows.

353
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,338
If he knew half the shit I know,
his head would explode.

354
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,249
Special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.

355
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,810
- Agent Johnson?
- That's right. Right this way.

356
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,212
Great. So is any of that actually possible,
what you were saying back there?

357
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,657
Is it possible? Look, you take out
any one thing, the system can recover.

358
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,939
If you take it all down at once, the system
crashes and... Look around, man.

359
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,491
Come on. Government's gotta have dozens
of departments dedicated to that shit.

360
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,653
It took FEMA five days
to get water to the Superdome.

361
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,294
How long till we get to DHS?

362
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,976
Laughlin, get on the DC police band
and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.

363
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,858
DC Metro, this is the FBl
requesting you to clear a route...

364
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,534
(scrambled noise)

365
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,696
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.

366
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,735
- Feds are taking him to Homeland.
- Good.

367
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,493
- Close that loop, now.
- lsolate the frequency.

368
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,892
Get us a location on the vehicles
and pull me up a file on this John McClane.

369
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,972
Rand, we just found Farrell.
Stand by for a location.

370
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:09,814
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed
another Arby's, and I'm starving.

371
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,970
- I could eat a wrapper.
- Shut up.

372
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,132
- I could just get some ketchup packets.
- Shut up.

373
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,893
You got about 14 minutes
to tell me why you lied to me.

374
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,255
Lied to you? What are you talking about?

375
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,615
The pictures on the wall -
you knew those guys.

376
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,214
- I don't...
- Kid, don't lie to me.

377
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,372
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
Who were they?

378
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,694
OK. OK, OK.

379
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,852
They were my competition.

380
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,529
Make the next right onto Concord.

381
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,817
They said they'd developed
a mutating encryption algorithm

382
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,209
and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.

383
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,610
That's what I do. I do math-based security.

384
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,211
Here's the thing. To pull off something
as massive and crazy as a fire sale,

385
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,213
you need tons of guys to write programs,
but only a few Black Hats to implement it.

386
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,737
At that point the start-up guys, who haven't
really done anything wrong, like me...

387
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,175
Would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.

388
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,459
I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you
I had no idea I was gonna be...

389
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,409
an accessory to Armageddon.

390
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,891
Take the next left at Lexington.

391
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,973
And that's a sexy voice.
What's she taking us this way for?

392
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,652
- Unit 510.
- Oh, my God.

393
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,732
Clear a route for two FBl vehicles
approaching on Concord.

394
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,048
Copy, dispatch.

395
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,539
That's her.

396
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,576
- Her who?
- What are you talking about?

397
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,815
- It's them.
- You're saying it's them them?

398
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,654
I swear to you I know her.
I would know her voice anywhere.

399
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,012
- No, don't say anything...
- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.

400
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,568
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?

401
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,892
Gotta be pretty crazy over there,
what with all those 587s, huh?

402
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,858
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.

403
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,939
You had to dispatch all units
for all the naked people walking around?

404
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,330
Cut the bullshit, honey,
and just put your boss on.

405
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,691
Laughlin, we're getting off this route.
Turn left on 14th Street.

406
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,974
- Officer McClane.
- It's Detective McClane, asshole.

407
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,054
Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get
to know each other when I visit you in prison.

408
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,337
But, John, I already know
so much about you.

409
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,456
Your address in Brooklyn,

410
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,011
the payments on your mortgage, how long
you've been a member of the NYPD.

411
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,772
And how's Holly?

412
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,933
Oh, that's sad. You're divorced.
Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?

413
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,980
Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought
you'd have a better pension plan annuity.

414
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,813
Oh, and it gets worse.

415
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,978
Your 401k no longer exists.

416
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,292
- Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
- Box them in at that intersection.

417
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,338
Shoot Mr Farrell in the head
and drive away,

418
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,014
and by the time you reach
the end of the next block

419
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,458
all your debts will be wiped clean
and your children will be set for life.

420
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,976
Now, that really is tempting,
especially that last part,

421
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,052
but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.

422
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,172
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.

423
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,012
You're gonna lose.

424
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,809
Yeah, well, the other thing that could
happen is I could come and find you,

425
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,336
kick your ass and throw you out of
your own party. What about that, dickhead?

426
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,615
Hold your position.

427
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,772
- He's not responding.
- (helicopter engine)

428
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,174
Get down! Get right down!

429
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,498
Just stay down!

430
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,735
Officers down at the corner of
Main and Constitution. Officers down!

431
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,295
Come on, come on, get out! Let's go!

432
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,292
Goddammit! Just stay down!

433
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,775
Get down! Just hang on!

434
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,294
Base, we've got a squad car under fire!
We need backup!

435
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,940
This is base. We're sending backup.

436
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,455
(McClane) Just brace yourself.

437
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,129
Hang on.

438
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,699
Hang on.

439
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,618
Oh, yeah!

440
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,452
- (pilot) We lost the tail.
- Stay with them.

441
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,212
- They're back.
- I know.

442
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,773
Take the tunnel. Left!

443
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,538
God, what are you... Oh, God!

444
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,056
Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.

445
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,619
The tunnel!

446
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,090
Open the gates on the north side entrance.

447
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,212
(cars honking)

448
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,851
Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.

449
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,894
- Now open the other side.
- What?

450
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,208
Move!

451
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,619
Hang onto something.

452
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,051
(cars honking)

453
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,291
Hey! Don't get out of the car!
Hey! Don't...

454
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,930
Just stay there! Stand still!

455
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,815
Run. Run!

456
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,615
Oh, God!

457
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,652
Don't hesitate like that again.

458
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,492
(man) Can you help me get my wife...

459
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,935
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

460
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,899
- (man #2) You OK?
- (man #3) I can't move my arms!

461
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,052
- Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.
- What?!

462
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,700
"lt can't be a uniform, John. No."

463
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,129
Get over to the wall, sir!
"Feds called in a favor."

464
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,137
"All you gotta do is go pick up a kid
down in Jersey, drive him down to DC."

465
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,656
"How hard can that be, huh?
It can't be that hard, can it?"

466
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,131
- (siren wails, then dies)
- "No, gotta be a senior detective."

467
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,173
Think a traffic jam, throwing a car
at me's gonna stop me? Huh?

468
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,296
Rand, get in there and get it done.

469
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,050
This is not a good idea.

470
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,452
(chuckles)

471
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,531
(groans with pain)

472
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,459
(chuckles)

473
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,413
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- OK, sorry, sorry.

474
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,616
Are you OK? Oh, my God!

475
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,260
(explosions continue)

476
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,889
- Pretty lucky shot, huh?
- Oh, yeah, lucky. That was...

477
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,130
You just killed a helicopter with a car.

478
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,211
I was out of bullets.

479
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,939
(both chuckle)

480
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,854
- How you doin'?
- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...

481
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,259
(laughs)

482
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,573
- Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.

483
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,771
(Thomas) Rand, check in.

484
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,854
What about Farrell and McClane?

485
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,289
Come back in.

486
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,416
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.

487
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,810
I just spoke to Emerson.
The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.

488
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,098
Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.

489
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,656
ID, sir.

490
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,410
Park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.

491
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,775
Man the gate. You're with me.

492
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,851
(alarms sound)

493
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,931
Anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
Below that you'll need DOD clearance.

494
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,013
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
There's nothin' down there but servers.

495
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,218
(groans)

496
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,329
(man) Go again. Rodriguez! I didn't copy.

497
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,258
- Gate secured.
- Copy.

498
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,655
OK, we are in.

499
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,249
This is insane.

500
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,173
Hey! Hey, this is absurd.

501
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,380
Man, there's tough and there's stupid.
You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.

502
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,891
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.

503
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,891
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- No!

504
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,208
Come on.

505
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,734
We don't need a doctor.
We need the cops.

506
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,215
He's in.

507
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,973
Get outta the way!
Make a hole, please. Come on.

508
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,417
Watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Come on.

509
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,458
NYPD. All right? I got this kid.
Come on. Let's go, kid.

510
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,691
(panicked voices)

511
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,498
Excuse me. Thanks.

512
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,889
NYPD. NYPD.

513
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,971
Coming through.

514
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,209
Sergeant?

515
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,178
Sergeant! I need to speak to you.

516
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,970
- The medic's in the back.
- I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.

517
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,335
Just give me a minute.

518
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,615
Sergeant!

519
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,931
(confusion of voices)

520
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,931
Oh, my God.

521
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,048
Let's get outta here.

522
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,858
Perfetto.
La sequenza due. Pronto...

523
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,976
(phone rings)

524
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,010
Siamo pronti.

525
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,971
We're a go.

526
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,051
Launch the downloads.

527
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,979
- Nothing's happening.
- Be patient.

528
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,296
- I don't know. It's not responding.
- Wait for it.

529
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,495
See? There you go.

530
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,018
- Tell me when the download reaches 20%.
- OK.

531
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,418
- I need you to please remain calm.
- (commotion/sirens)

532
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,931
Excuse me.

533
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,933
- Excuse me! Thank you.
- Holy shit.

534
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,170
- Kid? Kid, hey!
- Yeah, yeah.

535
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,694
- You got a phone in that bag?
- Yeah.

536
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,691
Come on. Let's go.

537
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,092
And here you go, Agent... Tovarek.
Guess that's you.

538
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,017
- Download's at 20%.
- Time to move.

539
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,058
Let's keep them chasing their tails.

540
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:15,055
(TV reporter) Due to recent activity, law
enforcement agencies are being cautious.

541
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,418
They are telling drivers to abandon
their vehicles until they are searched.

542
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,334
And, as you can see,
canine units are checking each vehicle.

543
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,730
Whether this is connected to
the anthrax reports we heard earlier

544
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,095
or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...

545
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,489
- FAA just grounded all flights.
- Good.

546
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,893
We have complete access over networks -
phones, power grids, water, nuclear.

547
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,096
- Hey, excuse me.
- Jack Parry, NSA.

548
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,775
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.
White House made the call.

549
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,614
- Anything you need, we're here to help.
- Help? Wow, that's great.

550
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,251
We're gonna need some work space
for our people. What can you do for us?

551
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,368
As you can see, we're using the space, so
you guys can stand in the corner and... liaise.

552
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,532
If I need something, I'll just wave to you.

553
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,933
- Wait! No, don't call.
- What are you talkin' about?

554
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,569
They probably cracked that hours ago.
They could trace us. Put it away.

555
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,378
- You sure?
- Yes.

556
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,577
Or... smash it.
You didn't have to smash it.

557
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,299
- Excuse me. It's a police emergency.
- Hey!

558
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,292
He'll call you right back.

559
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,019
Here, right in here. Come here.

560
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,818
- You got a signal?
- Yeah.

561
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,299
(ringing)

562
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,417
- Yeah.
- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.

563
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,695
Sir, John McClane is on the line.

564
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,130
- McClane, go.
- We never made it to DHS.

565
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,893
They came after the kid again.
All your men are down.

566
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,133
- What about Farrell?
- I got him with me right now.

567
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,211
- Sir?
- Hang on, John.

568
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,291
Yeah, I'll hold on.

569
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,258
Another day in paradise.

570
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,289
They just swarmed into everything - the
telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.

571
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,611
( "America the Beautiful"
starts up on TV)

572
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,331
(same song on all channels)

573
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,653
-  Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies...
- They're blanketing every station.

574
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:36,053
For amber waves of grain

575
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:42,172
For purple mountain majesties

576
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:47,971
Above the fruited plain!

577
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:53,817
America! America!

578
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,891
God shed His grace...

579
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,939
- Can you put the news back on?
- This is the news. It's on every channel.

580
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:05,378
- Been this way for a few minutes now.
-  And crown thy good with brotherhood

581
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,773
From sea to shining sea...

582
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,456
(shocked gasps)

583
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,577
Oh, my God.

584
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,818
McClane!

585
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,769
Look out.

586
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,373
Look out!

587
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,059
Look out.

588
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,690
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?

589
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,010
Bowman, it's a fake.

590
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,572
I see it.

591
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,331
Thank God.

592
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,492
Oh, shit.

593
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,298
- McClane?
- Bowman!

594
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,211
(call cuts off)

595
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,050
Satellite's down. Get me a land line.

596
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,897
(sirens blaring)

597
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,973
I wrote one little piece of code and the
world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.

598
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,096
- What?
- You know, it's crazy.

599
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,774
The first time I heard of the concept
of a fire sale

600
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,694
I actually thought it would be cool
if anyone ever really did it.

601
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,332
Just hit the reset button
and melt the system just for fun.

602
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,696
Hey, it's not a system. It's a country.

603
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,931
You're talkin' about people,
a whole country full of people,

604
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,410
sitting at home alone, scared to death
in their houses, all right?

605
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,496
So finish your nostalgic moment and think
a little bit and help me catch these guys.

606
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,414
Just help me.
Just put yourself in their shoes.

607
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,095
Come on. If this were your fire sale,
what would be your next move?

608
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:07,732
OK, uh, well, the whole point of a fire sale
is that it's mostly done by remote, right?

609
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,610
But not everything is run completely online.
Major utilities aren't.

610
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,409
They're run by closed circuits,
so you could breach the security,

611
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,493
but to shut it down you'd have to
physically go there. You'd have to show up.

612
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,332
And, uh...

613
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,654
- Give me that guy's PDA.
- Phones are all dead.

614
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:31,098
No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta
reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.

615
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,571
Hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what
these guys are using to talk to each other.

616
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,332
How do you know all this stuff?

617
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,572
Dude, I don't know. There's a lot
rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.

618
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,299
OK. National power grid.

619
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,770
Gas and electric is divided into three zones -
Eastern, Central, Western -

620
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,294
each with a primary hub.

621
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,371
Here it is.

622
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,173
- What are we looking at?
- That is the Eastern hub.

623
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,539
Now, they take this out, wipes out all
the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.

624
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,975
But, again, you'd have to do it manually.

625
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:08,815
- OK. Come on. Let's go.
- What? To West Virginia?

626
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,734
I honestly don't think I can handle
any more people trying to kill me. McClane!

627
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,015
- You get used to it.
- McClane. Oh, shit.

628
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,537
Sir, wireless networks are down
and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.

629
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,612
I don't care how, you find me a line.

630
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,851
- Come on, what you got?
- We swept the building. Seems clean.

631
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,411
- We can sweep it again...
- Don't bother. Don't bother.

632
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,697
It's a fake. This guy's playin' us.

633
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,340
OK, get everyone back inside
the crisis centre now.

634
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,058
OK, let's open it up!

635
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,340
- Come on, get in.
- Door's locked.

636
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,775
Unless you have an extra gun
I can use to unlock it.

637
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,252
Hey. Hey, don't do that!
You're gonna disable it.

638
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,859
Jesus Christ!

639
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,097
That was crazy. Did you see that?

640
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,253
Sorry about that, man.
I didn't know it'd come out so fast.

641
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,696
Man, this is a pain in the ass.
How'd you do yours?

642
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,698
You all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?

643
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,611
Sorry.

644
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,612
No, please don't touch those, OK?
I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.

645
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,419
I mean, I've read about it.

646
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,412
RoadAssist. We've detected
an air-bag deployment.

647
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,857
Yes... Please, we just hit a tree
and my... my dad is having a heart attack.

648
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,295
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.

649
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,053
Hold while we contact emergency services.

650
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:42,009
No, no! He's dying! I can get him
to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.

651
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,935
But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta
start the car for us, OK? Please, Dad...

652
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,534
- Your name, please?
- I'm...

653
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,332
My name is... Frank,

654
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,936
and my dad's name is, um... is...

655
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,337
(hesitant) Dvorak... Tsajanski.

656
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,295
Please... Please, just help us.
We need your help. Please.

657
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,496
Emergency services are on their way.

658
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,253
No, no, listen to me.
Ma'am, what is your name?

659
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,978
- Dolores.
- Dolores?

660
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,177
OK, Dolores, I don't know
if you have a dad, but I do,

661
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,490
and I wanna be able to say that
a year from now.

662
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:23,414
Because my dad is my hero,
and right now he is in my arms dying,

663
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,573
and his only hope is to get to a hospital
right now. We can't wait.

664
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,855
So please start the goddamn car!

665
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,408
(engine starts)

666
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,898
Thank you, Dolores.

667
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,335
(Matt) Pass the PDA.
I gotta call the Warlock.

668
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,856
- The what?
- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.

669
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,809
-Ma'am, you're not authorised to be here.
- FBl. We suspect a security breach.

670
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,573
You can't land here without authorisa...

671
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,939
That was pretty good back there, kid.

672
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,499
Thanks.

673
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,129
What's the matter with you?
Nothing else to complain about?

674
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,609
No. I'm just...

675
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,216
- Well, what? What's the matter you?
- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.

676
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,734
What's that mean? Like what?

677
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,371
I'm not, like, heroic and everything.
I'm not brave like you are.

678
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,054
- I'm not that guy.
- I'm nobody's hero, kid.

679
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,654
You've saved my life, like,
ten times in six hours.

680
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,812
Just doing my job, that's all.

681
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,976
Know what you get for being a hero?
Nothing. You get shot at.

682
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,973
You get a little pat on the back,
blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.

683
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,650
You get divorced.

684
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,698
A wife that can't remember your last name.

685
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,089
Your kids don't wanna talk to you.

686
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,337
You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.

687
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,856
Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.

688
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,168
- Then why are you doin' this?
- Because there's nobody else to do it right now.

689
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,218
If there was somebody else to do it,
I would let them do it.

690
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,133
But there's not. So we're doin' it.

691
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,895
Ah.

692
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,175
And that's what makes you that guy.

693
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,611
Thing's flying now.

694
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,498
Contact Emerson.
Tell him we'll be there soon.

695
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,449
What the hell are you doing?
This whole floor's restricted acc...

696
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,494
Stay here.

697
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,211
All right, come on.

698
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,813
- We're in.
- Good. Shut it down.

699
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,016
Guess you were right, kid.

700
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,217
OK, that's... awful.

701
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,578
We got company.

702
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,409
- How would they shut down a power grid?
- What?

703
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,459
- Come on.
- Uh... Central control room. OK...

704
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,012
- Uh, fourth floor. Fourth floor.
- Come on.

705
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,814
You take the right.

706
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,413
- (door opens and closes)
- Oh, shit.

707
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,058
Shh.

708
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,851
- Can we stop for...
- Try to keep up.

709
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,977
I am! I just wanna stop for two seconds
to catch our breath.

710
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:16,336
You know, they have these things
called gymnasiums.

711
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,854
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

712
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,214
Intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.

713
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,053
It's the only way
to avoid signal triangulation.

714
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,449
With the amount of hardware they're running,

715
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:03,011
we're probably looking for a large vehicle,
most likely a semitrailer rig.

716
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,694
All right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security

717
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,534
we need every agent, satellite
and functioning network they got. Now.

718
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,818
Play time's over, sweetheart.

719
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,015
Don't.

720
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,489
Take your hand off the gun. Hands up.

721
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,211
Stand up.

722
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,409
Go on. Now!

723
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,139
Let's go, kid. You're up.

724
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,812
OK...

725
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,898
As fast as you can.

726
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,889
Jesus!

727
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,011
That's enough of this kung fu shit.

728
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,332
I've known some bitches in my day,
but you are maybe the...

729
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,171
Still awake, huh?

730
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,410
- Just keep doin' what you're doin'.
- OK.

731
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,934
- How much time do you need?
- Um... Not much.

732
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,739
Whoo.

733
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,248
- Are you done?
- l, uh...

734
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,171
- Are you done?
- No, not quite.

735
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,138
- What?
- I'm not exactly checking my email here.

736
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,730
They used VM mode, so I'm isolating
their APl and booting the host.

737
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,051
- What?!
- It means about 30 seconds, OK?

738
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:00,415
Not the easiest thing to do when...

739
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,252
OK...

740
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,256
Undo everything you just did. Now!

741
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,456
OK. OK, OK.

742
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:24,219
I'm a righty, I'm a righty.
I need my other hand, I really do.

743
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,499
I'm a righty.

744
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,293
One last door to open.

745
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,214
Do you know what you're doing? Do you
realize what this'll do to the country?

746
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,213
Yes, I do. Now open the door.

747
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,690
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.

748
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,653
You do? I'm glad you know.

749
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,737
How you doin'?

750
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,972
Hang on.

751
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:58,212
(screams)

752
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,218
Listen, let's just talk about this
for one second.

753
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,532
How you doin'?
That's not too tight, is it?

754
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,297
Damn it!

755
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,136
Smile pretty!

756
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,975
(creaking)

757
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,609
McClane!

758
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,538
Shit.

759
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,608
McClane, get out of there!

760
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,890
Come on, man! Come on!

761
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,774
Come on, man.

762
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,658
Did you see that?

763
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,777
(triumphant laugh and yell)

764
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,371
(McClane) So you stopped it, right?

765
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,691
You know, a gun to your head
makes it harder to do this kind of work.

766
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:41,056
- What?
- I know that comes as a surprise.

767
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:47,096
- Can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
- I'm not sure.

768
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,013
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.

769
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:57,898
Western and Central hubs are ours.
We're just waiting on Mai's end.

770
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,529
Hang on. Something's up.
All the security's reactivating.

771
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,495
I think someone might be in the market
for some cheap Viagra.

772
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:12,176
Now your girlfriend's dead,
why don't you check out our sexy singles?

773
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,618
It's an e-bomb.

774
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,449
(phone rings)

775
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,698
Hey...

776
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,813
All right, wait, wait.

777
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,894
- Mai, talk to me. What's going on?
- Mai?

778
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,699
Oh, yeah - little Asian chick,
likes to kick people?

779
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,489
I don't think she's gonna be talking
to anybody for a really long time.

780
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:47,779
Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom
of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.

781
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,532
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

782
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,010
Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.

783
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:01,058
Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna
come and I'm gonna kick your ass.

784
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,010
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

785
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,660
When I'm finished here -
and I promise it'll be soon -

786
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,369
I will focus all my attention... on you.

787
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:17,293
You wanna make things personal, fine.

788
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,773
Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas
in the pipelines to that station.

789
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,777
- Can you get Bowman on this thing?
- Sure. I can get anyone on it.

790
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,975
Do it.

791
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,857
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

792
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,217
Please, no.

793
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,017
- It's Thomas Gabriel.
- Shit.

794
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,777
- (McClane) You know this guy?
- I worked with him.

795
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,250
He was DOD's chief programmer
for infrastructure security.

796
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,219
After 9/11, he's the guy that told
Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.

797
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,259
He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't
listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.

798
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,898
You think so?

799
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,052
When he tried to go public,
they crucified him.

800
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,179
Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
After that he disappeared.

801
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,569
- (beeping)
- We got a pretty serious problem.

802
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,730
Hold on one minute.
What?

803
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:31,699
I think we need to get out of here right now.

804
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,170
- They're sending the gas lines here.
- Gas lines? What gas lines?

805
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,852
Christ.

806
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:41,855
Oh... all of them. See that,
those flashing arrows? That's not good.

807
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,330
- All that's coming here?
- Yeah. I think we gotta go.

808
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,696
Listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.

809
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,089
McClane? McClane?

810
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,410
Let's go. Finish this up.

811
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,613
(rumbling)

812
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,011
Right now. Finish it up, come on! Let's go!

813
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,853
Get in there!

814
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,699
You OK?

815
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:12,136
(coughing and sputtering)

816
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,179
- Let's go. We gotta get outta here.
- What is the point? Man, what is the point?

817
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,455
Hey, knock that off, come on.

818
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:23,898
This has something to do with that code you
wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.

819
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:27,575
Win? When do we start winning? Huh?

820
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:31,812
Look around. Are you out of your mind?
Does it look like we're close to winning?

821
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,289
We just got the shit kicked out of us!

822
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,371
You think I'm holding out on you?

823
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,294
If I knew what they wanted, I would tell you!
I would happily tell you!

824
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,658
Jesus.

825
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,298
The Warlock. The Warlock.

826
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,292
Oh, great. Ah! There goes the cellphone.

827
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,850
- They knocked satellites out of the skies?
- No, your battery ran out.

828
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,658
- We should go see him.
- Who?

829
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,413
The Warlock. We should drive
to his house in Baltimore.

830
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,129
- Can't go to the Warlock's house now.
- Hey! This is me helping you.

831
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:40,374
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
That's our only hope.

832
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,419
- How do you feel about flying?
- Uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?

833
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,299
- Just stick it in the round thing.
- What brown thing?

834
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:01,053
Here, put these on.

835
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,608
Just stick it in there. That'll work.

836
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,534
- You OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.

837
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,975
- I used to be terrified of flying.
- Really?

838
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,370
Yeah. I took some lessons.
Face your fears, that kind of thing.

839
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,293
- Yeah? Did it help?
- Not really.

840
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,899
(engine starts up)

841
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:23,813
- Is it supposed to make that sound?
- Yeah.

842
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,692
- Maybe we should just drive.
- Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.

843
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,259
Really? I heard...

844
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:35,652
- To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
- Ha, ha, ha! You did? Really?

845
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,972
But you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?

846
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:43,496
- Oh, God.
- Hey-hey, here we go! We're up.

847
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,377
Oh, God.

848
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,253
That's good. That's pretty good.

849
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,458
Jesus, look at that.
This whole area's blacked out.

850
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,695
How we gonna find Warlock's house?

851
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,852
Um, it's probably gonna be
the one with the lights still on.

852
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,534
Power outage keeps spreading. About half
the East Coast has already gone down.

853
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,976
All right. Put everything
on emergency generators.

854
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,449
How the hell are they getting past us?

855
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:28,056
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.

856
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:29,778
- Down there?
- Left. Down.

857
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,378
What? Are we gonna land down there?

858
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,058
- All right, hang on.
- OK, OK. Ohhh!

859
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,772
Fence. Fence. Fence!

860
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,732
- Fence. Fence!
- I see it.

861
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,733
Watch...

862
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,777
Ow! Ohhh!

863
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:59,259
(Matt whoops with relief)

864
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,091
- Oh, Jesus.
- Come on.

865
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,490
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"Taking off's the hardest part."

866
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,490
Let's go.

867
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,250
Now, there's something you need to know
about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?

868
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,491
So just let me do all the talking, OK?

869
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,850
(clears throat)

870
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:29,771
Shit.

871
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,055
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.

872
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,732
Um, is Freddy home?

873
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,532
I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...

874
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,338
Billy.

875
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:45,130
We're friends from... Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.

876
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:48,457
Freddy!

877
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,100
- Freddy?
- You got company!

878
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,337
Frederick! Didn't you hear me?

879
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,376
All Baltimore heard you, Ma.

880
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,532
- Your friends are here.
- Friends? What the...?

881
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,019
Come on, Ma! How many times I gotta
tell you, don't bring people down here?

882
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:14,855
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded
Han Solo? You've lost so much weight!

883
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:18,057
No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?
Know what? Doesn't matter.

884
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:22,611
Dude, what are you doin' here? 'Cause of you,
I'm rocking five generators to stay online.

885
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:28,809
And since you're being hunted by assassins,
this visit is not a healthy use of my time.

886
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,698
And hey, don't touch that, all right?

887
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,455
CB radio?
A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?

888
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,010
That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world
insurance system, OK?

889
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,456
So when the last microchip goes down,
I can contact whoever's there,

890
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,656
whether they be zombies or not.

891
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:48,813
- What'd you bring your dad here for?
- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.

892
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,970
Nice poster.

893
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:57,172
- Oh, what? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.

894
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:00,454
- Star Wars guy. Who is this man?
- He's my...

895
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:02,849
Hey, dump truck. I'm not his dad.

896
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:06,819
- I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
- Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

897
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,130
Why'd you bring a cop
into my command center?

898
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:12,257
(laughs) Command center! It's a basement.

899
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,649
- It's a command center!
- Don't help McClane, I can explain.

900
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:18,449
Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
That's why we came here.

901
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,531
Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.

902
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,850
Get out! I want you outta here, right now.

903
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:26,057
Hey, calm down. Just calm down, big boy!

904
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,449
You calm down! It's my house!

905
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:33,056
You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,
or I'll beat you to death in your own house.

906
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:51,098
Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas
Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?

907
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,216
First day on the job, tells his bosses

908
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,736
this nation's security infrastructure
is open to compromise.

909
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:01,814
They say, "We'll take it under advisement."
But he don't ease up 'cause he is committed.

910
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,698
So he breaks into a meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

911
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:09,490
and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD
and shuts down our defense network.

912
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:12,777
So they put a gun to the man's head
and forced him to stop the hack.

913
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:16,853
Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down
NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.

914
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:19,579
- You think I'm scared of you?
- Tell us how to find him.

915
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,697
How do I know? He's a ghost, man.
He just fell off the grid.

916
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,896
- Another dead end. Come on.
- Wait.

917
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,256
Listen, Warlock,
a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...

918
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:33,733
A mutating algorithmic security code, that's
probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.

919
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,017
No, we know that. Yes.
Can you tell us what he's using it for?

920
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,729
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure that out. Here, look.

921
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,857
The only security system in the country
that I can find

922
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:48,218
currently employing that template
is the Social Security Administration.

923
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:53,454
But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.
They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.

924
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,532
- Whoa. What the hell? God!
- I know, right?

925
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,169
- What are you talkin' about?
- The power consumption's off the charts.

926
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,809
- It's hot. It's on fire.
- (Matt) Why are there chilling towers?

927
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,219
Hello.

928
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,689
What's a chilling tower?

929
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,089
See what I've been dealing with?

930
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:13,616
Large server farms generate a lot of heat
and need to be cooled.

931
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,053
But why there?

932
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:19,770
I don't know what's in that building,
but it's not Social Security numbers.

933
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:30,009
I got a red flag over here!
Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.

934
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,892
Honing in on the host server right now.

935
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,650
"Frederick Kaludis."

936
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,810
- Let's have a look at him.
- Fat bastard.

937
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,939
McClane.

938
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:49,252
- Where is his daughter?
- We just got a trace on her cell.

939
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,853
You'll love this.

940
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:57,454
All right. Let's get a better look at you.

941
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,969
(powering up)

942
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,897
- (Gabriel) Freddy?
- What?

943
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,416
What the hell are you doing
dickin' around inside my network?

944
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,338
McClane?

945
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:22,251
I thought I killed you already.

946
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,251
I get that sometimes.

947
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:30,650
- You think you can try to track where he is?
- Dude, yeah.

948
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:35,575
Detective, covering the camera with your
hand does not turn off the microphone.

949
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:42,736
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys
with all this computer shit,

950
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:46,335
but, hey, I'm still alive, ain't l?

951
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:52,493
I mean, you got to be runnin' out
of bad guys by now, right? Huh?

952
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,971
Gabriel?

953
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,731
Honestly, you can tell me.
How does that work?

954
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:06,416
You got some kind of service?
Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?

955
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,775
And I bet you're still on hold with,

956
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:14,173
"Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch
over here right away?" Huh?

957
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:20,017
But seriously, all that kicking aside, that
skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.

958
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,251
One of those gotta be real hard
to come by, right?

959
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,855
- You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
- I have my moments.

960
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,692
Yeah?

961
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,291
Is this one of them?

962
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:39,333
- (Lucy) Hello?
- Yes, this is Emergency Services.

963
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,172
- Thank God.
- Can she hear me?

964
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:44,809
My name is Lucy Gennero.
I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.

965
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,619
Can she hear this?
Lucy, hang up that phone!

966
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:51,693
Yes, calm down, miss.
We know exactly where you are.

967
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,577
Everything is gonna be all right.

968
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:58,131
- Lucy, hang up the phone!
- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.

969
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,658
We're a bit overloaded tonight,
as you may imagine,

970
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:06,174
but I assure you
we're gonna get you out of there.

971
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:10,412
- Even if I have to come down there and get you myself.
- Thank you.

972
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,936
In the meantime, is there anyone
we can contact for you?

973
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,658
Yeah.

974
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,570
My dad.

975
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,209
His name is John McClane.
He's a New York City cop.

976
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:28,810
We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,
and we'll get to you... very soon.

977
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,251
Thank you.

978
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,890
Wow. That's a great girl you got there.
Can't wait to meet her.

979
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,808
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

980
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,891
Come on, John.

981
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,494
Make a joke.

982
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,492
Say somethin' funny.

983
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,015
(low whistle)

984
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,530
Where...?
(whispers) Where you goin'?

985
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:02,331
Hey! McClane! Hold on.
Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?

986
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,459
What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
go kill this guy and get my daughter.

987
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,453
- But she can be anywhere...
- Listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.

988
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,976
- I think l...
- Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

989
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,369
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?

990
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,371
I'll take it from here.

991
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,769
Thanks for your help.

992
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:31,094
I wouldn't bet on you either,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.

993
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,811
Buckle up.

994
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,855
FBl, ma'am. Jersey field office.

995
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,851
Mind if I see your lD?

996
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:05,931
Not at all.

997
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,895
My dad's a cop. Force of habit.

998
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,850
Your father sounds like a very smart man.

999
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,370
Kid, can you get Bowman?

1000
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,451
Uh, yeah.

1001
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,611
It's completely dead.

1002
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,170
Gabriel must have shut down
all the satellite links. Shit.

1003
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,609
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.

1004
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,210
About all of it.

1005
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,019
It was my fault you got into this.
This wasn't your fight.

1006
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,738
You got nothin' to be sorry about.

1007
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,651
(bell)

1008
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,498
- Let go of me, you bastard!
- This bitch is a handful.

1009
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:16,535
Are you gonna be all right?

1010
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,972
Hey! Behave or I will hurt you.

1011
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,929
Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,
just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.

1012
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,970
You really are his daughter.

1013
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,652
Tie her wrists.

1014
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,770
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.

1015
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,294
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

1016
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,859
OK.

1017
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,419
I'll be back in a second.

1018
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:55,891
No, no, no, please!

1019
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,974
- (alarm)
- We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.

1020
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,369
Go take a look.

1021
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,050
Don't be long. We're packing up soon.

1022
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:05,769
Hey, McClane, do we have anything
resembling a plan?

1023
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:07,816
Find Lucy and kill everybody else.

1024
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,609
No, I mean more like a plan.
Like, a way to do that.

1025
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,651
Come on.

1026
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:22,656
OK, according to the layout, the chilling
towers are kept on the bottom level.

1027
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,931
I think mine's locked.

1028
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,169
OK. Now it looks like
we're gettin' somewhere.

1029
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,371
Uh...

1030
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:51,774
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling
system for the mainframe, which should be...

1031
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,611
If I can just hack in...

1032
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,979
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.

1033
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,651
(alarm)

1034
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,818
Someone set off the alarms.

1035
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:12,859
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.
Find a way to turn it off.

1036
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,816
What have you got?

1037
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,176
We got a problem.
The alarms went off at Woodlawn.

1038
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,251
It's gotta be him.

1039
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,456
And what's Woodlawn?

1040
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,333
It's NSA - a secure facility
outside of Baltimore.

1041
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:40,971
It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11
to back up all financial information.

1042
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:45,850
The moment networks were hit, all financial
data began downloading to those servers.

1043
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:50,809
Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,
government funds - all of it.

1044
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,575
Basically, a backup for
the accumulated wealth of America.

1045
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,969
All in one location?

1046
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,652
What could Gabriel do with it?

1047
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:03,528
If he could get in, he might try to transfer
the data to a portable hard drive.

1048
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:09,252
Then he'd have access to those accounts from
anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.

1049
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,853
We couldn't trace it.

1050
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:16,617
Or, knowing him, he could erase it all
and send us all back to the Stone Age.

1051
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:21,854
- Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.

1052
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,931
My pay grade?

1053
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:31,538
How the hell did Gabriel find out about this
when even I didn't know about it?

1054
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,536
He designed it.

1055
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,738
It was his program.

1056
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:43,894
He knew that hacking your system
last night would trigger the download.

1057
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,493
That's brilliant.

1058
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:49,289
You two geniuses, stay out of my way.

1059
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,931
(alarm sounds)

1060
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:57,935
Let me see if I can get a floor plan
of this place.

1061
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,337
Don't move!

1062
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:02,854
You, get away from the bag. Now!

1063
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,498
OK, OK.

1064
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,730
We've been waiting for you.

1065
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:10,691
Yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.

1066
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,088
(loud whir of machinery)

1067
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,652
McClane!

1068
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,373
McClane!

1069
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,219
Kid?

1070
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,689
Matt?

1071
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,849
Kid!

1072
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,816
(Gabriel) Emerson.

1073
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,009
We have a problem in
one of the cooling towers.

1074
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,419
- Tower seven.
- Tower seven.

1075
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,774
Find out what's going on.

1076
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,010
Arrivo subito. OK.

1077
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,569
Sir?

1078
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,254
Get the HR team to stand by.
We need to get to Woodlawn.

1079
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:25,013
The roads out are blocked.
DC's in total gridlock.

1080
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,852
Then get us some helicopters.

1081
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:29,773
They were all pulled by the Pentagon
for search and rescue.

1082
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,694
Molina, find me
some goddamn helicopters immediately.

1083
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:37,138
Look, the Pentagon
has jets flying CAP over DC.

1084
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:40,053
Have them send one to Woodlawn
and keep an eye on things.

1085
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:42,131
Let's go.

1086
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,016
(man grunts)

1087
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,811
Where's my daughter?

1088
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,209
(Gabriel) Russo, check in.

1089
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:04,975
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down
to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.

1090
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,291
Hold on a minute.
Looks like he's coming around.

1091
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,373
- It's McClane! He's on the third floor!
- (gunshot)

1092
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,977
Get all that? That's right.

1093
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:21,530
I'm on the third floor.
But I'm coming to get you.

1094
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:32,089
Don't move now. I'll send a doctor.

1095
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,608
Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.

1096
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:40,892
Je vous rejoins.

1097
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:23,857
My algorithm.

1098
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,699
(footsteps)

1099
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:32,094
OK, please, God.

1100
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,496
Oh, please, God...

1101
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:12,530
Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.

1102
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,898
You coming to get me, John?
Is that the plan?

1103
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:39,096
Yep, that's my plan.

1104
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,411
What makes you think I won't put a bullet
in your daughter's head?

1105
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,651
- 'Cause you're scared of me.
- You think I'm afraid of you?

1106
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:49,491
Otherwise she'd be dead already.
You need a bargaining chip.

1107
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:58,819
Stop there! Hands up.

1108
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,255
If you kill me, you'll never get it open.

1109
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:03,979
Eccoti qui, piccolo stronzo.

1110
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,210
Move away. Move!

1111
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:17,053
You know, John, I feel like
we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

1112
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:20,576
And because of that,
you think I'm the bad guy.

1113
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:23,333
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I'm the good guy.

1114
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:26,776
I told them this could happen
if they didn't prepare.

1115
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:30,296
Did I get a thank-you?
No, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.

1116
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:34,055
- You got their attention now, don't you?
- That's right.

1117
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:38,611
- I am doing the country a favor.
- (chuckles) By tearing it apart.

1118
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:43,615
Better me than some outsider.
Some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.

1119
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:46,260
Nobody wants to see that happen.

1120
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:52,336
Everything I've broken can be fixed
if the country is willing to pay for it.

1121
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:55,571
Ah, bullshit.
It's always been about the money.

1122
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:59,699
What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.

1123
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:03,295
Well, just sit tight, asshole.
I got a check for you.

1124
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:10,856
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,
see if you can get him to focus.

1125
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:11,929
Dad?

1126
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,776
Hi, baby.

1127
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:20,011
Now there are only five of them.

1128
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,968
Hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.

1129
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:27,731
(sighs)

1130
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,250
Would somebody
please kill this son of a bitch?

1131
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,577
We have a problem.

1132
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:45,134
There's actually no problem.
I just got off on the wrong floor.

1133
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,651
This is a mess.

1134
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,539
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man.
Hacking every byte of financial data

1135
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:59,693
for the entire country'd take weeks
unless you eliminated the congestion.

1136
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:02,817
That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?

1137
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:05,972
- That's brilliant.
- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.

1138
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,449
- Asshole.
- Who are you?

1139
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,539
Matt Farrell.

1140
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,570
Lucy McClane.

1141
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,970
I thought your name was Gennero.
Lucy Gennero.

1142
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,778
Not today.

1143
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:22,648
- Can you crack the code?
- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.

1144
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,890
That's encouraging.

1145
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,695
Take them with us.

1146
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,816
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1147
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,939
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent
an F-35 towards us.

1148
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:38,011
Keep an eye on it.

1149
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:42,732
Pulling down the "go" codes now.

1150
01:40:57,620 --> 01:41:01,169
You might wanna think about
what you want on your headstone, asshole.

1151
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,094
Christ. Goddamn hamster!

1152
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,093
There you go.

1153
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:14,535
Stay still, spider-boy!

1154
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,098
That's right.

1155
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,732
Goddammit!

1156
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,655
Oh, no!

1157
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:06,298
You probably shouldn't antagonise them,
since they have all the loaded guns.

1158
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:10,612
Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger
set of balls, 'cause you're gonna need 'em.

1159
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:15,569
Wow. I know that tone. It's just weird
hearing it from someone... with hair.

1160
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:51,735
Sir.

1161
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,617
ETA 15 minutes.

1162
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,689
There we go.

1163
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:47,412
Fix it.

1164
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:50,697
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.
I know that.

1165
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,732
Oh, shit.

1166
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,529
I'm not gonna do it.

1167
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:11,735
- Oh, no, no, no! Shit!
- Robinson is coming pretty fast.

1168
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:13,890
- I'm sorry, what?
- Something's wrong.

1169
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,936
Robinson is coming too fast.

1170
01:44:20,140 --> 01:44:22,017
It's not Robinson.

1171
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,011
That would be my dad.

1172
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,936
Freddy?

1173
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,538
Freddy?

1174
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,098
It's John McClane.

1175
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:45,570
Look, I know you can hear me.
This is your frequency, right? 666.

1176
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,299
Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.

1177
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:53,090
Nobody here by that name. Sorry.

1178
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:55,171
Hacker jerk-off!

1179
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:01,016
Warlock...

1180
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:06,128
I need you to do whatever it is you do
to patch me through to the FBl.

1181
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:08,131
To Deputy Director Bowman.

1182
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:10,688
- You hear me?
- Are you serious?

1183
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:13,214
You want me to intentionally
open up a com line

1184
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,929
to the head of the FBI's cyber division?
I don't think so.

1185
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:19,569
Freddy, goddammit,
they have my daughter!

1186
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:26,975
I can do that. Hold on.

1187
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,131
Thank you.

1188
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:39,291
(woman) This is Central.
We have a patch for Director Bowman.

1189
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:42,618
Sir. Central's trying to reach you.

1190
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:44,855
Go.

1191
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:47,295
- Bowman, it's McClane.
- McClane.

1192
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:51,089
Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695
headed north in a Hazmat truck.

1193
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:54,968
Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
We're headed there right now.

1194
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:58,132
Bowman. He's got my daughter.

1195
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:03,211
Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government
vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?

1196
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,416
Track that down, it should take you to him.

1197
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,890
- Give me the tag number.
- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.

1198
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,016
Golf... Tango...

1199
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:16,459
five... niner... two... November.

1200
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:19,054
Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?

1201
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,619
He's with them.

1202
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,893
Listen to me.

1203
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:27,258
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,
but if something happens to me,

1204
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:31,697
you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?
I mean everybody.

1205
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:33,850
Don't let that maniac get my daughter.

1206
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:37,216
- John, don't worry.
- I want your word, Bowman.

1207
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,735
Yeah, you have it.

1208
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:43,538
McClane out.

1209
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,655
There's the F-35.

1210
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:56,375
Did you get the "go" codes?

1211
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,769
- Trey. Did you get the "go" codes?
- Yes.

1212
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,374
Can you connect me to the pilot?

1213
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:04,257
Uh...

1214
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,729
Isolating his radio.

1215
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:27,014
Sending him the "go" codes.

1216
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,134
AV-81.

1217
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:39,340
- AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
- Go for AV-81.

1218
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:42,935
Confirmed terrorist vehicle
located in your sector. A big rig truck.

1219
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:47,138
- Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.
- I see them.

1220
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:49,859
You are authorized to engage and destroy.

1221
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:52,295
Copy that. AV-81 engaging.

1222
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,329
What?

1223
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:11,937
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!

1224
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:16,737
You're shooting at the wrong guy!

1225
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,650
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.

1226
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,770
Hey! Jackass!

1227
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,890
Is that it? Huh?

1228
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:34,459
Is that your best shot?

1229
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:16,099
Come on!

1230
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:25,528
Damn!

1231
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,978
Come on!

1232
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:50,855
(beeping)

1233
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:07,931
Yaaarrhh...

1234
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,418
Whoo!

1235
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:14,497
Let's go. Come on!

1236
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:16,571
That way. It's that way. Go!

1237
01:52:25,220 --> 01:52:27,780
We are leaving in three minutes.

1238
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,130
You have one.

1239
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:36,576
The rules haven't changed.
You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.

1240
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:39,290
- Aaargh! Aaargh!
- (Lucy squeals)

1241
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,728
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Matthew?

1242
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:44,014
Matthew!

1243
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:46,819
I really need you to pay attention.

1244
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:50,495
- The rules can always change.
- OK, wait.

1245
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,855
- I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.
- Wait.

1246
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,737
Nine.

1247
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:56,333
I can't.

1248
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,331
Eight.

1249
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:00,138
I can't.

1250
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,253
Oh, God.

1251
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:04,974
(shot fired)

1252
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:07,972
- OK!
- (Lucy cries)

1253
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,459
OK, OK, OK!

1254
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,053
Six.

1255
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:14,894
OK, stop! Stop, stop!
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1256
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:17,494
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1257
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,971
(tires screeching)

1258
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,735
(Trey) Feds are headed this way.

1259
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,334
- Get everything on the plane.
- Yep.

1260
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,977
- Dad!
- (Gabriel) Careful.

1261
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:49,416
Don't worry, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1262
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:53,296
Daddy!

1263
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:55,769
(Lucy sobbing)

1264
01:53:57,860 --> 01:53:59,816
- (groans)
- No!

1265
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:02,130
Hold this.

1266
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:18,454
Aaargh!

1267
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,012
No!

1268
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:28,330
Jesus Christ.

1269
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:30,536
You got her?

1270
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,731
You're sure?

1271
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:36,298
Nice effort, though.

1272
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:39,858
- Matthew!
- Oh, shit! All right, OK!

1273
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:41,692
OK! I'm doin' it. I know.

1274
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:51,171
McClane.

1275
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:54,058
Would you do me a favor?

1276
01:54:55,340 --> 01:55:00,095
I know the lights are beginning to dim,
but if you could just hang on for a second,

1277
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:03,252
when Matt's finished,
I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,

1278
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:06,093
and I would love for you to see that.

1279
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:09,975
Goddammit. Matthew?

1280
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:12,449
Ten seconds, OK?
You'll have all your money.

1281
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:16,453
- You just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK?
- A few seconds. Stay with me.

1282
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,531
McClane!

1283
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,009
- Ohh!
- Stay with me.

1284
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,579
Dad?

1285
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:27,688
On your tombstone it should read, "Always
in the wrong place at the wrong time."

1286
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,248
How 'bout,
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf...!"

1287
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:48,014
(sobbing) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

1288
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,137
- Are you OK?
- Yes, baby, I'm fine.

1289
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:54,579
I knew you'd come for me.

1290
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:59,176
Of course I'd come for you, honey.
Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.

1291
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,332
Move, move.

1292
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:14,738
(man) Freeze!

1293
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:17,573
Hold, hold! He's OK.

1294
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,060
- Get that vehicle.
- Come around!

1295
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:24,176
- Here, help Daddy up.
- OK.

1296
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:28,776
Oooh! Wait, wait.
I think I'll just stay here for a minute.

1297
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:32,819
- OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind.
- What are you talkin' about?

1298
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:37,530
- You shot yourself!
- It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1299
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:40,612
Don't tell these guys that I did that.

1300
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,173
- Thanks for all your help, John.
- Thank you.

1301
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:57,937
Is he OK?

1302
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:01,659
- Should I put my hands up?
- No, don't put your hands up.

1303
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:03,970
Put 'em down further?

1304
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:08,212
Might die of shock on the way to the hospital.

1305
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:12,458
All right.

1306
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:14,451
(groans)

1307
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:16,371
I'll be right back.

1308
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:20,090
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1309
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,694
- How's it feel to be shot?
- It actually feels great.

1310
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:26,056
He gave me some...
What's it called? Mor...? Morphine.

1311
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:31,578
- Well, you got your merit badge now.
- Yeah. I don't know what that means.

1312
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:35,494
- Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.
- Really? Hm.

1313
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,851
Not that one.

1314
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:40,658
- What?
- Don't even think about it.

1315
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:44,335
How did you know what I was thinking?
Did she say something to you?

1316
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:48,777
- I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
- Easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.

1317
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:50,213
Yeah.

1318
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:55,169
Besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.

1319
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:58,771
That would suck.

1320
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,052
- Good to go?
- Yeah, all set.

1321
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:05,689
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you at the hospital.

1322
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,172
Hey.

1323
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:16,292
- Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
- Hey...

1324
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:18,655
What was I gonna do?

1325
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:22,130
That's what makes you that guy.

1326
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:27,215
Yeah.

1327
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:35,213
So, um, did he say anything about me?

1328
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:39,016
Jesus, Lucy.

1329
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,216
What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.

1330
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,969
I'm in enough pain already.

1331
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,857
Hospital.
