1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,792
This film is based on historic events

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,472
The Hague, 1945
shortly after World War II

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,037
Mr. H.A.M.T. Kolfschoten,
Minister of Justice (Catholic party)

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,275
The case Oss.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,629
Oss.

6
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,230
A conflict between the MP,
the priests, the mayor.

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,518
Corruption, abuse of power,
excessive crime.

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,190
Minister Goseling took some
peculiar measures at the time...

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,718
and the entire cabinet resigned, just
before the invasion of the Germans.

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,992
Am I supposed to read all of this?

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,917
We could also throw it away.

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,914
Fine.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,431
The Gang of Oss

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,838
They call them the Gang of Oss,
but they're just a bunch of misfits.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,471
They steal from the rich
and give to the poor. Sometimes.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,591
Wim de Kuiper thinks he's the boss.

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,079
Harry den Brock, his counsellor,
is the only one who can read.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,959
Van Schijndel, a local cop,
looks the other way.

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,955
If you pay him, that is. And why not?
Everybody here is corrupt.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,634
Father De Roos sins
while taking confession.

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,429
Father Bakker does the altar boys
and washes his hands in innocence.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,193
In Oss the fires of purgatory are lit
to rip off the insurance company.

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,072
The government, based in the north...

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,277
sent the MP to us in the south,
to set things right.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,795
Protestants.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,114
It's not as if we're such devout
Catholics, but we hate Protestants.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,880
Most of us here work for the meat Jew.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,355
Sal Hedeman doesn't talk to male staff.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,996
But he talks to the women
in packaging. I work there too.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,351
At night I work behind the bar.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,193
We don't have a license,
but they drink anyway.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,989
I'm Black Mien's daughter
and a half sister of Trees.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,192
Mum isn't really sure
about who our fathers are.

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,912
I learned a lot from my mum.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,749
They don't call me
Johanna the Tramp for nothing.

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,708
- 100 guilders?
- For bodily injury it's 100 guilders.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,958
You need to make sacrifices
for a new bike.

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,955
No, like you had it before.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,075
Like that, like that.

40
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,117
We needed that as evidence.

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,076
I'll take care of it with the doctor.

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,516
I get out in two weeks.
For good behaviour.

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,111
You wouldn't have thought, huh?

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,358
- We're going to do things differently.
- Sure.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,870
I'm going to quit drinking,
fighting and burglary.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,673
I'm going to get a regular job
with the meat Jew.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,753
I'm only sticking my knife
in a cow or a pig.

48
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,073
- New or did it belong to your wife?
- Put it on.

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,392
I want you to have it.

50
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,231
I'm pregnant.

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,991
I think it's yours.

52
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,673
Now what?

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,992
Do you want money?

54
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,832
Or do you want to get married?

55
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,112
Don't touch. Your hands are dirty.

56
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,238
I'm married already.

57
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,029
Why don't you finish the job?

58
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,034
Then I took it in my hand...

59
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,110
and made slow movements.

60
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,113
Then I passed over it
with my tongue...

61
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,517
and I had to take it in my mouth.

62
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,671
Until he...

63
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,871
- Should I go on?
- If you have more to confess.

64
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,076
Ties and I
are going to do things differently.

65
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,909
I don't need to confess
for the time being.

66
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,674
That would be a pity.

67
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,071
Say two 'Our Fathers'
en ten 'Hail Marys'.

68
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,270
The Lord has forgiven you
for your sins.

69
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,193
- But are you pregnant?
- No, of course I'm not.

70
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,356
I just wanted to give him a fright.

71
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,914
Hi, Wim.

72
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,279
- I heard that you left Hedeman.
- Yes, and what about it?

73
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,471
- Why are you giving me that?
- What tone of voice is that?

74
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,952
Ties is my cousin.
You need to support your family.

75
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,430
And he kept his mouth shut, of course.

76
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,030
This is enough to rebuild the pub.
Put a pool table in it.

77
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,919
Then I can meet up
with the group there.

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,790
We'll manage without it.

79
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,156
Yes, I don't want to have anything
to do with it anymore.

80
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,595
Not with Hedeman
and not with Wim de Kuiper.

81
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,910
We're going to do things differently.

82
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,913
- And what about Trees?
- She can help me.

83
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,389
We're no longer welcome. She's going
to turn it into a restaurant, she said.

84
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,116
She's never eaten out before
and she wants to open a restaurant?

85
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,396
Could you write something down?

86
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,309
Soup, bread, coffee.

87
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,118
Surprising menu.

88
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,068
Ties is back.

89
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,119
Are you that happy?

90
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,990
- Had a lot of customers?
- Word needs to get around first.

91
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,918
Last week was our fourth
wedding anniversary.

92
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,236
You owe me something.

93
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,111
I need to report.

94
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,752
- Right now?
- Yes, I'm out on probation.

95
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,677
Come with me.

96
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,308
Hi.

97
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,513
How did you enjoy "the guest house"?
See lots of friends? Relatives?

98
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,833
Let's hope you learned from it.

99
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,752
I'm here for the note.

100
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,674
- I want to work for Hedeman.
- Give me names.

101
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,278
If you don't talk, no note.
And no note, no work.

102
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,749
I served my sentence.

103
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,835
I'm starting with a clean slate.
Two years, dammit.

104
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,918
Who were there two years ago?

105
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,518
You can read it, Van Heesch.

106
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,434
The light is not very good.

107
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,633
Ellie can read in the dark very well.
Can't you, Ellie?

108
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,834
I'm too dumb to read,
but smart enough to shut up.

109
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,276
Sergeant Kramer sends his regards
to Mr Hedeman.

110
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,199
Tell Kramer that I said hello too,
Van Heesch.

111
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,070
We don't need Hedeman's pennies.

112
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,070
When all of Oss eats at our place,
even if he begs, he's not coming in.

113
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,793
Welcome home, son.

114
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,195
- Hey, Wim.
- Was it hard in their "Pleasure Garden"?

115
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,078
It was okay.

116
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,755
- Let's celebrate. I'm buying.
- We were just going home.

117
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,192
- It's been so long. Let's go home first.
- There's plenty of time for that later on.

118
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,233
I know what you've been
thinking about, boy.

119
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,391
What?

120
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,313
A big glass of cold, frothing beer.

121
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,635
- Ties doesn't drink anymore.
- But I do. Come.

122
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,592
- Hey, Ties. Are you sure?
- Yes.

123
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,797
- One is okay, isn't it?
- Thanks, Uncle Wim.

124
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,078
- Damn.
- You know what it is?

125
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,159
The damn MPs decide who gets to
work around here and who doesn't.

126
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,037
The Northerners
are running the shots in Oss.

127
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,031
Last week they arrested 12 guys.

128
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,917
Eight of them are still in jail.

129
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,873
Van der Heijden
was practically beaten to death.

130
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,758
But enough is enough.

131
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,714
On Palm Sunday we're going
to show them who's boss in Oss.

132
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,472
Are you in?

133
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,236
I'm...

134
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,399
Yes, never mind. I can tell.
It's fine.

135
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,711
What?

136
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,068
What?

137
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,869
I promised your father on his death bed
that I'd take care of you.

138
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,758
Here.

139
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,951
You can rebuild the pub with that.

140
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,351
Put a pool table in there
and a real tap.

141
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,593
- Go and see Den Brock for a license.
- I can't take that.

142
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,997
Johanna and I want to start
a restaurant.

143
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,398
It's your damn place.
You inherited it.

144
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,438
We want to start all over again.

145
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,357
Restaurant van Heesch. Food,
drink and a good fuck for dessert.

146
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,633
It's not working.

147
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,790
Sure it is.

148
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,712
Just stop it.

149
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,839
Are you burying your mother-in-law?

150
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,791
A Webley. It didn't suffer
from being buried for 28 months.

151
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,997
That wouldn't be the same
for your mother-in-law.

152
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,475
Nice bike.

153
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,830
Yes, I got it
from the insurance company.

154
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,754
You should chop off your hand
so you can buy a car.

155
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,908
Sell it to Wim de Kuiper.
Ten guilders, 2.50 for you.

156
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,274
- We need to eat.
- You have a restaurant, don't you?

157
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,828
Johanna has a restaurant.

158
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,751
I hope you have a license?

159
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,354
- A license?
- A restaurant license.

160
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,358
- Regulations.
- We've only just opened up.

161
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,433
We'll get one as soon as
business picks up. Of course.

162
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,076
- Are you hungry?
- No, I've already eaten.

163
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,953
But perhaps we could make
another arrangement?

164
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,638
- I didn't make a reservation but...
- I've got a table here.

165
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,394
Alright. I'll see how it goes.

166
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,072
Van Schijndel.

167
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,754
What's the daily special?

168
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,239
Soup.

169
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,514
Nice.

170
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,599
Just one.

171
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,838
To wash away the coffee.

172
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,795
I'm going to help Mum for an hour.

173
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,997
- You shouldn't walk that way.
- I'll walk wherever I want.

174
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,588
I'll be at your place in ten minutes.

175
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,955
You can either pay off
or shoot a witness.

176
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,997
This is the third time.
There's not going to be a fourth.

177
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,954
As soon as Kramer has been buried,
we're going to party.

178
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,509
Drinks are on me
and I'll take care of the music.

179
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,070
A party, goddamn.

180
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,593
- Just shoot them. All of them.
- Anything else?

181
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,196
That's what we all want.

182
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,117
- Is there any more soup left?
- We're out.

183
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,317
Finished.

184
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,470
Time to close.

185
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,631
Everybody go home.

186
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,595
You go home. To The Hague
or wherever you're from.

187
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,309
Or do you want to stay in Oss and join
Sergeant Kramer at the cemetery?

188
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,030
Enough, enough.

189
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,630
Their shift is over.
These gentlemen need to go to bed.

190
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,752
Tomorrow morning at nine
you're the first.

191
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,157
Tally it all up and I'll pay tomorrow.

192
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,910
Can you put this away?

193
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,952
Welcome back.

194
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,393
On Palm Sunday we're going
to shoot him, De Kuiper said.

195
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,237
First the procession and then dead.
Like Jesus. That's how it went, right?

196
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,517
- But he won't be resurrected.
- What if we help him along?

197
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,752
Van der Heijden, you're drunk.
Go home. Party's over.

198
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,792
It's not over by a long shot.
Get some beer, dammit.

199
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,513
- Where are you going?
- With them.

200
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,356
- Ties, don't.
- What?

201
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,511
We were going to start all over.

202
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,833
I can already hear him.

203
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,878
Go ahead and be resurrected.

204
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,350
Van der Heijden, take it easy
or you'll drop him again.

205
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,230
Stand him up. Stand him up.

206
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,713
Ties, baptise him.

207
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,877
- How is that again?
- Father, Son, Holy Ghost...

208
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,397
Now he's a Catholic.

209
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,954
Let's have another drink
at the Korenbeurs.

210
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,396
Don't lecture me.

211
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,079
I'll do as I please.

212
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm still my own master.

213
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,077
And yours.

214
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,598
Got it?

215
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,071
Stop it. That will never work.

216
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,668
- It will work.
- No, it won't.

217
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,953
- Just take out the window.
- Harry, don't be so stubborn, man.

218
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,951
Stubborn? It simply doesn't fit.

219
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,398
- He's the next one we're going to shoot.
- We?

220
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,516
He's afraid of his own wife.

221
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,035
You shoot one and get 15 in return.

222
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,913
- I warned you.
- Yes, yes.

223
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,310
- Bye.
- Wijnen.

224
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,596
Put it on my tab.

225
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,148
I didn't know you could write.

226
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,431
Jo Wijnen has a cane.
I put notches behind it.

227
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,679
- How do you know who drank what?
- I remember.

228
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,718
Jo Wijnen, gin. Gerrit van der
Heijden, beer. Coffee for you.

229
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,674
Gerrit van der Heijden, Wim de Kuiper.

230
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,478
Smart.

231
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,754
- What's my symbol?
- I'm not showing.

232
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,275
I'll teach you to read and write.

233
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,270
You're strange.

234
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,317
You want to teach me
how to read and write...

235
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,876
but you never paid me
to go upstairs with you.

236
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,877
Ain't I worth a few pennies?

237
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,830
I never felt that I could buy you.

238
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,393
Oh, Harry. That's the sweetest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

239
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,511
- Verstegen.
- I put 2.50 on Jan Greven.

240
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,631
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

241
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,720
The new commander.
He's not bad looking.

242
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,668
Yes, get close to him.
Then we can bury you next week.

243
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,069
Here's Jan the Champion.

244
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,794
Congratulations? Beer?

245
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,072
If they send 100 of them,
I'll blow them all to bits.

246
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,355
Really? Are you sure?

247
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,239
What?

248
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,515
- What?
- Do you know what I heard?

249
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,474
- What did you hear?
- You're putting down the MPs...

250
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,995
but when it mattered
you shat your trousers.

251
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,798
Tell me if I'm wrong.

252
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,953
Goddamn, Gerrit. How could you?
Your own cousin.

253
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,079
- I was dazed...
- Outside. Beat it.

254
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,636
Clean up. You lot keep your
mouths shut, understood?

255
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,872
Verhoef wants us to drink
to the victory.

256
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,672
He's buying.

257
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,395
Shouldn't you be partying?

258
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,394
The heart has friends,
the brain is alone.

259
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,357
It's not mine.

260
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,190
Ah, the police.

261
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,794
Do the MPs let you go out
on your own?

262
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,475
- I heard there was a fight.
- Not that I know of.

263
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,356
- So, what's that?
- Spilled some coffee. A shame, isn't it?

264
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,238
It was brand-new too.

265
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,070
Somebody reported a crime.

266
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,079
But of course such a report
could get lost.

267
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,117
A drink?

268
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,399
Your change.

269
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,071
I'll be back some other time.

270
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,278
Champion.

271
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,515
I heard the MPs
are investigating the mayor.

272
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,110
Fraud, taking bribes.

273
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,673
The Northerners are imagining things.
We don't have that in Oss.

274
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,232
I, uh...

275
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,472
I already paid Ties.

276
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,632
- Are you crying?
- It has nothing to do with you.

277
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,271
Come with me.

278
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,673
Away from here.

279
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,269
I'll be a pro in Italy.

280
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,271
Listen to him. He won one race.

281
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,198
You have to go or he'll think
you're staying too long.

282
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,229
Think about it.

283
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,508
I will.

284
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,590
At least two months.

285
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,271
- Is it...
- Yes.

286
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,235
Does Ties know?

287
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,680
You can't keep it hidden
for much longer.

288
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,311
Where were you?

289
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,150
I had two customers.
I sent them away.

290
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,874
You could have served them.

291
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,075
They weren't here for drinks.

292
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,951
You should be here, dammit.
Where were you?

293
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,473
At the doctor's.

294
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,676
Are you ill?

295
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,036
You're not pregnant, are you?

296
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,390
That's not a bad thing, is it?

297
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,391
For how long?

298
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,030
- How long?
- One month.

299
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,270
Perhaps five weeks.

300
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,077
- It can't be mine.
- It doesn't matter.

301
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,594
We can take care of it together.

302
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,391
You're going to get rid of it.

303
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,275
Can't you tell?

304
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,079
Who? Ties?

305
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,710
- I don't know who.
- Sounds familiar.

306
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,473
Did somebody hit you?

307
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,992
Duck sooner.

308
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,512
You're going to be an aunt.

309
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,829
- How long?
- About two months.

310
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,190
Does Ties know?

311
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,079
Two things have changed.

312
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
He drinks more and hits harder.

313
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,716
He's fighting with everybody.
Until he runs into the wrong guy.

314
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,791
He'll get shot dead.

315
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,039
That would be something.
Then I'm moving in with you.

316
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,153
You can stop working
and we can get married.

317
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,356
Don't you want that?

318
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,834
Are you here to drink or to fuck?

319
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,230
- Ties.
- What Ties?

320
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,476
Friday we're going to Geffen.

321
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,676
- Why?
- Why?

322
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,479
There's a woman who can help us.

323
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,079
No.

324
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,193
No? What do you mean no?

325
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,157
Maybe it's yours.

326
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,348
Ties, listen. I'm keeping it.
I'll take care of it on my own.

327
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,472
If you don't get rid of it,
then I'll kick it out.

328
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,757
Are you going to say
something about it?

329
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,831
Come on.

330
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,279
Cowards. They're the worst.

331
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,636
Where's your hero now, huh?
Where's your hero now?

332
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,998
Get out of here.

333
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,348
You got what you came for.

334
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,793
What?

335
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,118
I'm going to lie down.

336
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,271
I'm exhausted.

337
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,151
Are you okay? Come on. Come.

338
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,395
I won't let him kill my baby.

339
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,755
I'd rather kill him.

340
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,112
Don't do it yourself.

341
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,151
You lost some blood.

342
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,311
Nothing to worry about.

343
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,919
I'll give you something...

344
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,073
to stop the cramps.

345
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,999
But don't fall again, okay?

346
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,357
How did Ties take it?

347
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,195
- Fine. He's looking forward to it.
- Good.

348
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,952
Next.

349
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,835
I'll wait here.

350
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,831
I'm sorry that I...

351
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,958
Violence isn't my thing.

352
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,355
I don't have the stomach for it.

353
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,074
I'd never ask you.

354
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,708
But I can help you.

355
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,708
We can take out an insurance.

356
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,916
If it has to be done...

357
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,599
we can take out an insurance
on Ties' life.

358
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,831
That way you can pay
whoever does the job.

359
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,037
And you'll have a little something
for yourself.

360
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,517
It cuts both ways, so to speak.

361
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,352
I have to go back.

362
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,071
Think about it.

363
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,235
Wait a minute. Hurry up.
Verstraete is upstairs already.

364
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,478
You're not supposed to be here.
We keep business and pleasure apart.

365
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,231
I'm here for business.
A life insurance.

366
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,596
Is he home?

367
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,470
I'll get my coat.
Dora, I'm out for a while.

368
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,312
What are Ties's initials?

369
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,357
That's probably him.
We can go ahead and ask him.

370
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,233
Damn, Greef, it's you.
Our champion.

371
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,911
I heard that you and Johanna agreed
about Ties?

372
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,157
Tell him that you know a place
in the next village with a lot of money.

373
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,199
The brewery. That checks out
when he asks about it.

374
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,914
Johanna will take care of the gun.

375
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,992
You shoot him
when he's out on the heath.

376
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,032
You collect half
of the insurance money.

377
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,671
Don't stay at the brewery to drink,
mind you.

378
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,393
Come on.

379
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,514
- Are you cold, Greef?
- No. Yes.

380
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,392
No, yes.

381
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,599
Or are you scared?

382
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,592
I asked you if you're scared.

383
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,517
What are you doing, Greef?

384
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,636
Sergeant Roelofse,
divisional commander.

385
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,876
Can we talk quietly somewhere?

386
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,072
I have bad news.
Your husband has been shot.

387
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,193
Is he dead?

388
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,396
I'm sorry.

389
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,914
Did your husband have enemies?

390
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,590
- Can you give me names?
- It's faster to list his friends.

391
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,068
You celebrated after my predecessor's
death. Don't expect sympathy from us.

392
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,350
I'll talk to you later.

393
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,270
You didn't run your mouth?

394
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,197
It looks good on you.

395
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,997
What are you doing here?

396
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,193
- The MPs were quick.
- What did you do with the gun?

397
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,278
Damn you.

398
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,074
- He has to get out of here.
- He can't go out like that.

399
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,633
Upstairs.

400
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,392
Come.

401
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,633
Get in.

402
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,189
Go.

403
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,315
Nobody in Oss gets shot
without my permission.

404
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,676
Least of all my cousin.

405
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,476
My condolences.

406
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,115
A counsellor who doesn't talk
is of no use to me.

407
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,838
What have I done?

408
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,236
Come with me. You too.

409
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,597
Get out.

410
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,993
Turn around.

411
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,069
We all fuck around...

412
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,431
but going so far
as to shoot your own people...

413
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,837
- I didn't...
- Harry den Brock told me everything.

414
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,788
Should we take out an insurance
on you too and kill you?

415
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,109
The new commander doesn't beat up
people but has them investigated.

416
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,748
That's much more dangerous.

417
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,593
I said that nobody
was going to get killed anymore.

418
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,435
Just burglaries.
How could you be so stupid, man?

419
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,108
On your knees. On your knees.

420
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,916
What have you done?

421
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,076
What have you done?

422
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,720
I shot Ties.

423
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,638
It's just like church.
If you confess, we can forgive you.

424
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,836
Then we never talk about it again.
We keep our mouths shut.

425
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,435
He shat his trousers.

426
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,078
In the back of the car.

427
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,113
The enemy are the MP,
the Northerners.

428
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,272
We're fighting them.
Not each other.

429
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,432
Know your enemy.
Only then will you know your friends.

430
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,278
Dismissed.

431
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,918
Clean him up.

432
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,912
You're walking home, right?

433
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,875
And no contact with Johanna
or the MPs will figure it out in no time.

434
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,075
I don't know how,
but you're going to pay for this.

435
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,111
- I didn't...
- You had it done.

436
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,475
That's the same thing.

437
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,797
And I can even respect that.

438
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,349
I told him.

439
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,156
Abortion is a mortal sin.

440
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,839
Half of the insurance money is ours.
For keeping quiet.

441
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,473
Since you've lost your man,
I will protect you.

442
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,351
Here, for the funeral.

443
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,478
If you do as I say, you'll be fine.

444
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,948
Go.

445
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,276
Van Schijndel wants to talk to you.

446
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,192
I'll take care of it.

447
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,031
My condolences
on your cousin's death.

448
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,796
The municipal police will do what it
takes to solve this cowardly murder.

449
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,434
Harry, it'll be fine.

450
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,876
Why did you betray us?

451
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,998
- I didn't betray anybody.
- To Wim.

452
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,995
Wim's with us.

453
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,873
No need to worry about him.

454
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,590
Can I have some coffee?

455
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,116
I hold no secrets for you.

456
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,917
Everything is in here.

457
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,753
Transactions with the municipality,
church, insurance, burglaries, the works.

458
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,635
If the MPs get a hold of this,
all of Oss goes down. Including Wim.

459
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,316
What about the life insurance money?

460
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,472
The MP won't issue a statement
while the investigation is ongoing.

461
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,269
Without that the insurance company
won't pay. It will come.

462
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,072
Be patient.

463
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,035
What are you going to do with it?

464
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,911
I may go away from here.

465
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,718
Where to?

466
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,354
Do you hold secrets for me?

467
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,312
This is where I want to go.

468
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,715
America.

469
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,474
Nobody over there
knows the Van Heesch family.

470
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,676
It's a long way from here.

471
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,234
I can't stand being at home.

472
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,590
I can't stand being on my bike.

473
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,069
I need to know what I'm up against.

474
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,595
I'll be a pro in Italy. Come with me.

475
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,117
We can get married over there.

476
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,352
What makes you think
I want to marry you?

477
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,190
It's not yours.

478
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,953
There's a woman who says
she has an appointment.

479
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,833
Where's the mayor?
And Father Bakker?

480
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,678
And Hedeman?

481
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,310
You persecute people
who have nothing...

482
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,114
and protect those
who have everything.

483
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,111
We investigate everybody.

484
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,118
Me too?

485
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,793
What can I do for you?

486
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,351
I'm here to get a statement saying
I'm innocent of my husband's death.

487
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,994
Then the insurance company can pay.

488
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,749
- Your husband had a life insurance?
- Yes.

489
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,115
Who is your insurer?

490
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,873
For how long?

491
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,756
I don't know.
Ties took care of his own business.

492
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,354
- Do you know who's the agent?
- Harry den Brock.

493
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,910
He needs the statement.

494
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,750
Of course I want to be of service,
but I want something in return.

495
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,678
What can you tell us
about Wim de Kuiper?

496
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,920
We don't blow the gaff on each other.

497
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,471
Then you'll have to wait
until the investigation is closed.

498
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,192
Are you ill?

499
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,952
Move over.

500
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,236
Are you sad?

501
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,470
Soon I'll have money.
I'll take you with me to America.

502
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,390
Then we'll open a restaurant.
We'll succeed over there.

503
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,631
How's your English?

504
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,636
Van Schijndel.

505
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,274
The MPs have over 140 addresses.

506
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,399
- Something is going down.
- What do they want, dammit?

507
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,918
- Arrest all of Oss?
- Kramer was one of them.

508
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,469
They're not going to stand for that.

509
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,670
There are people in Oss
who are saying...

510
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,633
that they saw who shot Kramer.

511
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,872
Anyway,
people talk rubbish all the time.

512
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,072
Perhaps we should help the MP
along a bit?

513
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,674
We found a gun on the heath
where Ties van Heesch was killed.

514
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,879
We have the prints of three fingers
and a thumb.

515
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,674
- That's impossible.
- Wait and see.

516
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,149
I haven't slept for weeks.
I keep seeing him before me.

517
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,430
And I hear him say:

518
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,596
'What are you doing, Greef? '

519
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,517
I'm glad I confessed.

520
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,190
I'll do ten years
and then start all over again.

521
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,874
With a clean slate.

522
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,436
You confessed to the murder
of Ties van Heesch.

523
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,757
You're also charged
with the murder of Kramer.

524
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,836
Ties van Heesch and Kramer
were shot with the same gun.

525
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,473
A Webley.

526
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,511
Yes, but I didn't shoot him.

527
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,078
Not Kramer.

528
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,312
I didn't kill Kramer.

529
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,431
Then who did?

530
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,355
If you help us, you'll get a reduced
sentence for killing Van Heesch.

531
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,437
I'm not saying anything.

532
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,713
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

533
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,716
Jan Greven confessed
to killing your husband.

534
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,791
I assume you already knew that?

535
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,838
That he confessed
or that he did it?

536
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,470
If you confess now,
you may get a reduced sentence.

537
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,071
If you wait for the investigation,
you face the consequences.

538
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,673
Is that all?

539
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,719
Mrs Van Heesch,
we're going to clean up Oss...

540
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,474
and we won't stop
with the little guys.

541
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,996
Has Hedeman ever
approached you indecently?

542
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,839
No.

543
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,511
And has Father De Roos
ever engaged in particular acts?

544
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,159
What do you care
what the priest does?

545
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,716
You Protestants aren't going
to do the bishop's job, are you?

546
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:21,638
This girl is a minor. She works
at Hedeman's packaging department.

547
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,873
You worked there too.
Did you hear or see anything?

548
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,629
I wouldn't tell you.

549
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,597
I understand your position.

550
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,038
We don't like you Northerners.
Just accept that.

551
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,233
Piet van der Heijden got arrested,
Jo Manders. It's all coming down.

552
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,996
Can I put this upstairs at your place?
I don't want it at home now.

553
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,838
I have to get out of here.

554
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,909
- Are you coming with me?
- Where to?

555
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,596
You wanted to go to America.
I'll come with you.

556
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,191
The two of us? I'm pregnant.

557
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,154
I've always wanted a baby.

558
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,592
I don't care.

559
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,271
We need to get out of here.
I managed to free up some cash.

560
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,278
- Dora can have the house and the rest.
- Is that what you want?

561
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,788
You learn fast.

562
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,594
What if I left Oss?

563
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,152
Far away.

564
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,316
To America.

565
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,079
When everything is sorted out,
I'll send you money.

566
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,595
And you can come over too.

567
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,358
Where's Trees anyway?

568
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,632
Hedeman's driver
came to pick her up.

569
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,199
What did you say?

570
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,676
Hedeman's driver came.
We have to eat as well.

571
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,956
You only think of yourself.

572
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,350
And Trees didn't mind.

573
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,754
- This is private property. Get lost.
- I'm here to get Trees.

574
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,235
She's not here. Get lost.

575
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,234
Then tell Hedeman
I'm going straight to the MPs.

576
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,630
It was an accident.
You have to believe me. It was a game.

577
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,268
But suddenly she pulled away.

578
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,395
Easy, easy.

579
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,271
Good.

580
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,632
Good.

581
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,395
She has to go to hospital.
She might go into a coma.

582
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,030
No, out of the question.
That would raise too many questions.

583
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,316
She has to.

584
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,958
Put her in my car.
I'll take her to Den Bosch.

585
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,757
Where's Trees?

586
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,149
Now you listen to me.

587
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,113
Trees has had an accident.

588
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,595
- I'm going to the MPs.
- They can't do anything.

589
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,269
Hedeman and his associates
are powerful.

590
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,070
Why do you think
I never got arrested?

591
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,800
And you're not going
to ruin that for me.

592
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,828
The MPs won't be here much longer.
They have to leave Oss.

593
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,748
That's being arranged in The Hague.
By Hedeman.

594
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,595
The Minister of Justice
is a good Catholic.

595
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:21,316
Keep your mouth shut and Hedeman
will take care of you from now on.

596
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,117
This is your stop.

597
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,395
- I'm staying with her.
- One patient is enough.

598
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,597
- I'm going to the hospital.
- Get out. Come on.

599
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,718
Johanna,
we're losing precious time, okay?

600
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,314
I'll come as soon as I can.

601
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,112
Come on.

602
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,834
You see?
You can hardly stand up.

603
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,149
And keep your mouth shut,
understood?

604
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,830
May the mercy of the Lord
lighten your heart so you may repent...

605
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,151
and experience God's mercy.

606
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,920
I killed Ties.

607
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,389
And Jan is taking the blame.

608
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,755
That's my confession.

609
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,156
And what do you have to confess?

610
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,917
Johanna, we need to help each other.
The MPs are the enemy.

611
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,789
They're all fascists. They're all
following Rost van Tonningen...

612
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,115
and he hates Catholics.

613
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,231
We're your friends.

614
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:22,030
The thing with Trees was an accident.
I honestly confess.

615
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:26,199
- What use is that to Trees?
- Trees will be all right.

616
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,794
Our Lord will take care of that.

617
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,753
I abide by the secret of
the confessional. You do the same.

618
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,190
Our Lord doesn't punish people.
The justice department does.

619
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,079
I'm counting on your silence.

620
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:49,069
Silence.
That's what made Oss great, isn't it?

621
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,671
Goddamn.

622
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,672
I'm not leaving before I know
that Trees is fine.

623
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,030
They'll take good care of her
in hospital.

624
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,310
Take me to Den Bosch.

625
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,674
- It's not visiting hours yet.
- Please.

626
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,877
I just want to make sure she's okay.

627
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,157
- What was her name again?
- Trees Biemans.

628
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,828
She was admitted last night.

629
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,074
I have nobody here by that name.

630
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,871
Please check again.

631
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,434
Maybe he took her to another hospital.

632
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,677
Veghel, Nijmegen.

633
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,592
We need to find Wim.

634
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,197
My condolences.

635
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,112
I couldn't help it.

636
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,834
She jumped out of my car
when I had to stop.

637
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,956
You drowned her.

638
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,674
Watch what you're saying.

639
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,395
Talk to her, Harry.

640
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,909
- I did my best to find Trees.
- Well, she has been found.

641
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,157
Don't think the municipal police
is going to get you out of this one.

642
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,276
I'm going to see Roelofse.

643
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,034
- Like hell you are.
- Are you on his side?

644
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,757
Do you know what they did to Trees?

645
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,391
No, and I don't want to know.
It's not going to bring Trees back.

646
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,313
There's no point in stirring things up.

647
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,631
Let bygones be bygones.

648
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,274
Mayor Megens.

649
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,790
This is the Bishop of Den Bosch.

650
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,319
Shall we?

651
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:10,271
Holland America line. Tomorrow
evening at 7, Waalhaven Rotterdam.

652
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,479
- Can you get there on your own?
- I'll take the train.

653
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,995
I'll take a suitcase.

654
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,874
You can't walk on the street with it.

655
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,398
Here you have the main documents.
You need to keep them with you.

656
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,359
Those too.

657
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,670
Diocese of Den Bosch

658
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,353
For Trees.

659
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,997
Tomorrow we'll be sleeping
in a suite on a boat.

660
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,190
We'll have nothing to do
with Oss anymore.

661
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,151
Are you leaving?

662
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,078
- To the midwife.
- That can wait.

663
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,990
The kid isn't going to pop out like that.
First you're going to visit Jan Greven.

664
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,758
Why?

665
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:26,273
He needs to confess to killing Kramer.
He's going to hang anyway.

666
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,510
Why would he?

667
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:33,714
Tell him that I'll stab you if he doesn't.
Whether you're pregnant or not.

668
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,830
Oss' coat of arms, so they always
know where you're from.

669
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,389
Now De Greef will know
I mean business.

670
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,710
Are you coming, Johanna?

671
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,517
Come, come.

672
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,157
Here. Alum, that will stop the bleeding.

673
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,989
It's a keepsake
Wim de Kuiper gave me.

674
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,279
I'm here to tell you that you
shouldn't listen to anybody.

675
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,000
You need to think of yourself.

676
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:00,717
If you can get a reduced sentence
by talking, you should.

677
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,078
It's my fault. I put you here.

678
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,077
I pulled the trigger.

679
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,431
We're all responsible
for our own actions.

680
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,958
Without me you might have become
a famous racing cyclist.

681
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,478
What am I going to do in Italy?
I don't even like spaghetti.

682
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,039
You don't have to keep quiet
for my sake.

683
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,595
I'm leaving Oss tomorrow.

684
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,789
You're right to leave.

685
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,118
With Harry.

686
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,834
Don't wait for me.

687
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,117
By the time I get out,
you'll be an old hag.

688
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,840
Take care of our baby.

689
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,279
And?

690
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,076
- And?
- He got the message.

691
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,472
We look alike, don't you think?

692
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,832
I used to bang your mum all the time.

693
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,509
Now we look even more alike.

694
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,039
Turn left here.

695
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,279
Nobody will suspect me
if they find you dead.

696
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,830
- Anybody could have done it.
- Why would you?

697
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,072
- Haven't I been good to you?
- You killed Trees.

698
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,919
Even if that's true,
and I'm not saying it is...

699
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,110
you have no right to speak.

700
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,669
A life for a life, Johanna.

701
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,150
You killed Ties
and you're paying with Trees.

702
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,073
Get out.

703
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,438
Strip.

704
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,512
Strip.

705
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,391
Throw it on the back seat.

706
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,716
I let you live
and you leave me alone.

707
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,357
Deal?

708
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,957
You think you're quite something.

709
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,988
You don't have the nerve to shoot.

710
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,752
You're walking back, right?

711
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,358
The Holland America Line just called
about two tickets for New York.

712
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,638
- That's right.
- Why wasn't I told?

713
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,360
I don't want people in Oss
to know we're leaving.

714
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,357
That's why I didn't tell you.

715
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,956
So you wouldn't tell anybody.

716
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,959
- It had to be a secret.
- Even for Johanna van Heesch?

717
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:30,112
I called Sergeant Roelofse
and told him about your books.

718
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,512
If you cooperate, they will consider
reducing your sentence.

719
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:39,874
I don't know what you got yourself into,
but you need to straighten things out.

720
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,190
They're waiting in the room.

721
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,392
These documents will convict
all of Oss.

722
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,155
It contains everything.
About everybody.

723
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:38,831
Blue, Hedeman. Orange, the priests.
Yellow, De Kuiper.

724
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,878
In exchange you let me go.

725
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,870
We picked up 60 people yesterday.
Today there will be 40 more.

726
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,395
And we should let you go?

727
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,916
We're taking down Hedeman,
the priests, the mayor.

728
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,999
And thanks to your books
we'll get them convicted.

729
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,678
I didn't do anything.

730
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:05,796
Instigating burglary, arson, forgery.
I don't call that not doing anything.

731
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,113
I can't go to jail.

732
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,512
They'll think I betrayed them.

733
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,509
Can I grab some of my things?

734
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,711
I won't come looking for you.

735
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,075
You can come to me, damn you.

736
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,668
I did everything for you.

737
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,758
And what do I get in return?

738
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,673
You know what? I'll smoke you out.

739
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,271
The Attorney General has arrived.

740
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:34,193
I took care of you from the time
you were a little girl.

741
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,958
Who gave you the best present
for your Communion?

742
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:41,157
Do you remember? Goddamn.

743
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:47,116
And who paid for your wedding,
everything included?

744
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,871
Well?
You'd rather die than admit it, huh?

745
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,919
Goddamn. You're really one of mine.

746
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,435
Trees wasn't, but you definitely are.

747
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,389
A life for a life.

748
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,111
Wim...

749
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,075
Was he my father?

750
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,880
It had nothing to do with love. If was
'one good turn deserves another'.

751
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,510
And I certainly didn't hate him.

752
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,029
But the thing with Trees...

753
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,871
You need to leave Oss.

754
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,718
Just go.

755
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,710
Silence.

756
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:33,316
Member Rost van Tonningen
of the National Socialist Movement...

757
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,072
will now speak.

758
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:39,671
Oss is a crime-ridden
den of thieves.

759
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,755
The MPs are putting things in order
and suddenly they're dissolved...

760
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,077
by the Roman Catholic
Minister of Justice.

761
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,710
The MPs have exposed
atrocious vice crimes.

762
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:59,716
Crimes committed by Roman clergy
and Jewish businessmen.

763
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,190
The Roman clique
is covering for the Jews.

764
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,477
Oss is ruled by papists and yids.

765
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:11,310
Mr Rost van Tonningen, this is
inappropriate. You are closured.

766
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,230
Traitor to the country.

767
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:10,591
You should have arrested me in Oss,
to keep us from going to Rotterdam.

768
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,872
Harry den Bronk is dead.

769
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,151
He hanged himself.

770
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,678
- When?
- This morning.

771
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,670
A little over 40,000 guilders,
if I got it right.

772
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,038
The ministry closed the case today.

773
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,909
The MPs have left Oss.

774
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:18,676
If the mayor and the priests go free,
then so does Johanna van Heesch.

775
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,476
You'll miss the boat.

776
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,835
Harry's papers.
Everything is in them.

777
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,271
I'll make sure they get used well.

778
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,159
I don't want to keep quiet any longer.

779
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,480
This is your suitcase.

780
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,790
It was in Den Brock's car.

781
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,675
The case Oss
became a national scandal

782
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,718
the Catholic Minister of Justice
had to resign

783
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,388
this led to the fall
of the last pre-war cabinet

784
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,238
many military policemen
joined the National Socialist Movement

785
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:20,838
many gang members spent the war in
prison and became resistance heroes

786
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,473
the Capital kept growing

787
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,750
Oss's slaughterhouses grew
into multinationals

788
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,716
like Organon and Unilever

789
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,393
resistance also continued

790
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,232
a small municipal socialist party
from Oss evolved into a national party

791
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,311
against authority,
church and capital
