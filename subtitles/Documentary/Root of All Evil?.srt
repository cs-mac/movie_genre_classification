1
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:12,950
There are would-be murderers all round the world

2
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:16,744
who want to kill you and me and themselves,

3
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:23,945
because they are motivated by what
they think is the highest ideal.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,387
Of course politics are important,

5
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:31,105
lraq, Palestine, even social
deprivation in Bradford,

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,208
but as we wake up to this huge challenge
to our civilised values

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:42,012
don't lets forget the elephant in the room,
an elephant called religion.

8
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:50,893
The suicide bomber is convinced
that in killing for his God,

9
00:00:50,894 --> 00:00:51,894
he will be fast-tracked to
a special martyrs' heaven.

10
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:54,881
This isn't just a problem of lslam.

11
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,956
In this program I want
to examine that dangerous thing

12
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,059
that is common to Judaism
and Christianity as well

13
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:06,480
the process of nonthinking called faith.

14
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:14,713
I am a scientist, and I believe there is a profound
contradiction between science and religious belief.

15
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:18,106
There is no well-demonstrated reason
to believe in god

16
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:26,038
and I think that the idea of a divine creator
belittles the elegant reality of the universe.

17
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:36,255
The 21st century should be an age of reason, yet
irrational, militant faith is back on the march.

18
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,955
Religious extremism is implicated in the world's
most bitter and unending conflicts.

19
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,871
"We want the non-Muslims off the lands of
Mohammad. We want the kafir out of it."

20
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:50,767
America, too, has its own fundamentalists.

21
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:56,285
"The Issue for the next generation is
going to be the islamification of Europe."

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,234
And in Britain, even as we live
in the shadow of holy terror,

23
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,317
our government wants to restrict
our freedom to criticise religion.

24
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:11,346
Science, we are told, should not tread
on the toes of theology.

25
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:16,059
But why should scientists
tiptoe respectfully away?

26
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,717
The time has come for the people of reason
to say enough is enough.

27
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:28,080
Religious faith discourages independent thought,
it's divisive and it's dangerous.

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,845
Root of All Evil?

29
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:43,386
The God Delusion

30
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,420
lt looks lovely doesn't it?
Inoffensive and gentle.

31
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,990
But isn't this the beginning
of that slippery slope

32
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:57,974
that leads to young men with
rucksack bombs on the Tube?

33
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,671
If you want to experience
the mediaeval rituals of faith,

34
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:08,845
the candle light, incense, music,
important-sounding dead languages,

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,506
nobody does it better than the Catholics.

36
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:21,631
At Lourdes in southern France, the assault
on the senses appeals to us not to think,

37
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,352
not to doubt, not to probe.

38
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:33,926
And if we can retain our faith against the evidence,
in the teeth of reality, the more virtuous we are.

39
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:39,580
Pretty impressive sight isn't it? I could imagine
finding it very seductive,

40
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:45,940
partly because of the tremendous feeling of group
solidarity that there must be.

41
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,769
If you have the delusion
that you're Napoleon,

42
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:53,290
it must be fairly a lonely feeling
because nobody else agrees with you.

43
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:57,206
Your faith that you are Napoleon
needs a lot of shoring up.

44
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:03,806
But these people here, thousands of people all
have exactly the same delusion,

45
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:09,156
and that must give wonderful
reinforcement to their faith.

46
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:18,495
I used to think reason had
won the war against superstition

47
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,245
but it's quite shaking to witness the faithful
droves trooping through Lourdes.

48
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,760
This is a benign herd but it supports
a backward belief system

49
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,970
that I believe reason must challenge.

50
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,092
Daylight reveals more of this shrine,

51
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:57,008
where a myth is perpetuated that a virgin
who gave birth, Christ's mother Mary,

52
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:03,163
appeared here once to an impressionable,
and I do mean impressionable, young girl.

53
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:08,649
The faithful make the pilgrimage
here because they believe

54
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:14,620
that terrible afflictions can be cured by dragging
their poor bodies up to a pool of water

55
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:18,551
where the Virgin Mary made
her miraculous appearance.

56
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,032
In reality, they're probably more likely to catch
something from thousands of other pilgrims

57
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,694
who've wallowed in the same water.

58
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,413
Is it something that Catholics feel
they ought to do in their life,

59
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:43,801
rather like Muslims
going on the Hajj to Mecca?

60
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,712
Well no, but you don't have
to be a Catholic to do it you see,

61
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:52,613
I know a lot of people that are not
Catholics at all and they've been here.

62
00:05:57,873 --> 00:06:00,109
And what are you hoping to get out of it?

63
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:05,288
Well I've got a lot out of it: I've got faith,
I've got trust and a belief that

64
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:09,642
there is a person out there who is
stronger than any medical person.

65
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,265
Right. What about a cure though?

66
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:18,751
It may seem tough to question these poor
desperate peoples' faith,

67
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:25,048
but isn't bracing truth better than false hope?

68
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,969
What is the evidence for any miracles?

69
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:37,997
There are actually 66 declared miracles, there
are about 2000 unexplained cures here,

70
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:42,776
but then we would say there are millions of people
who have been healed in different ways.

71
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,862
healed in some sort of mental way?

72
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:50,289
Healed in spiritual ways where people who have
come to terms with their own particular situation,

73
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,792
people who have rediscovered
God in their lives again,

74
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:57,426
people who have received
a new grace here in Lourdes.

75
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,096
So you tend to get
about 80,000 people per year?

76
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:03,065
About 80,000 sick pilgrims
who come here every year.

77
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,211
That's been going for more than a century now?
About a century and half? - Yes.

78
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:13,673
So, 80,000 per year, and of those 66
have been cured. I just want to ...

79
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,305
...you see the way I'm thinking.
- Yep.

80
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,540
So the hard fact is that over the years,

81
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:24,348
with their millions of pilgrims,
there have been 66 supposed miracles.

82
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:35,987
I cant help remarking that nobody has ever had
a miraculous re-growing of a severed leg.

83
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,596
The cures are always things that might
have got better anyway.

84
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:43,659
People lean on their faith as a crutch,

85
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:47,809
but I fear that the comfort it
provides is a shallow pretence,

86
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:52,952
and I want to look at how the suspension
of disbelief inherent in faith

87
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:57,049
can lead to far more
dangerous ideas beyond.

88
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:19,296
People like to say that faith and science can live
together side by side, but I don't think they can.

89
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,450
They're deeply opposed.

90
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,637
Science is a discipline of investigation
and constructive doubt,

91
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:33,049
questing with logic, evidence
and reason to draw conclusions.

92
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:40,290
Faith, by stark contrast, demands a positive
suspension of critical faculties.

93
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:50,038
Science proceeds by setting up hypotheses, ideas
or models, and then attempts to disprove them.

94
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:54,525
So a scientist is constantly asking questions,
being sceptical.

95
00:08:56,234 --> 00:09:00,899
Religion is about turning untested
belief into unshakable truth,

96
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:05,872
through the power of institutions
and the passage of time.

97
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:15,886
Let me give you an example of this with
a story of the assumption of Mary.

98
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:23,093
Catholics believe that Jesus' mother Mary was so
important she didn't physically die.

99
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:29,679
lnstead, her body shot off into heaven when her life
came to a natural end.

100
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:36,721
Of course there is no evidence for this, even the
Bible says nothing about how Mary died.

101
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:43,224
The belief that her body was lifted into heaven
emerged about six centuries after Jesus' time.

102
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,898
Made up, like any tale,
and spread by word of mouth.

103
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:51,851
But it became established tradition.

104
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:55,062
lt was handed down over centuries.

105
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:57,966
And the odd thing about tradition
is that the longer it's been going,

106
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,519
the more people seem to take it seriously.

107
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:06,073
lt's as though sheer passage of time makes
something that was to begin with just made up,

108
00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:09,734
turns it into what people believe as a fact.

109
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:18,790
By 1950, the tradition was so strongly
established that it became official truth.

110
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:21,101
It became authority.

111
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,748
The Vatican decreed
that Roman Catholics must now believe

112
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:28,679
in the doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin.

113
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:33,801
Now if you had asked Pope Pious XII
how he knew it was the truth,

114
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,943
he would have said you had
to take his word for it

115
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:40,901
because it had been
''revealed to him'' by God.

116
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,548
He shut himself away and thought about it.

117
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,719
He just thought, private thoughts
inside his own head,

118
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:48,832
and convinced himself that,

119
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:53,433
no doubt on tortuous theological
grounds, that it just had to be so.

120
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:58,805
None of this is particularly harmful

121
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,859
when it is limited to the
Virgin Mary going to heaven.

122
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:06,122
But what about the Pope's personal
convictions when it comes to,

123
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:11,674
say, discouraging the use of
condoms in AIDS-ridden Africa?

124
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,077
Then, the power of the church
through tradition, authority

125
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:21,112
and revelation comes with
an appalling human cost.

126
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,177
It would be unfair to pick on the Catholics.

127
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,368
All religions are up to the same tricks.

128
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:33,581
It could be Muslim Imams issuing fatwahs,
it's the same principle.

129
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:39,078
It's issued by the authority, it then passes
down through the ranks to parents,

130
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:42,995
to children, and all
without a shred of evidence.

131
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:56,348
Unlike science, which sees it as a challenge,
religion thrives on unsolved mystery.

132
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,844
For early humanity, what was mysterious and
unexplained was so vast

133
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,398
that only an equally vast higher being,

134
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:07,613
an Alpha male in the sky,
could fill that gap.

135
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:13,474
How would our ancestors have
responded to the sunrise?

136
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:18,852
There must be a fiery charioteer, a Sun God, to
accept our sacrifices.

137
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:24,898
A supreme being who, on the first day
of creation, announced ''let there be light''.

138
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,621
But scientific investigation
has rolled back that mystery.

139
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,365
Today we know the sun
is a giant nuclear reactor.

140
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,284
One of billions of stars pumping out
electromagnetic radiation, heat and light.

141
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,141
How do scientists know
the things that they know

142
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,592
about the world and the universe?

143
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:55,926
How do we know, for instance,
that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old

144
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,514
and that it orbits the sun that nourishes it?

145
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,885
How do we know that these dinosaurs
are hundreds of millions of years old?

146
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,819
The answer is evidence.

147
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:15,355
Tons and tons
of mutually supporting evidence.

148
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:24,218
Science is about testing, comparing and
corroborating this mass of evidence,

149
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:29,550
and using it to update old theories
of how things work.

150
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,588
I do remember one formative influence
in my undergraduate life.

151
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:39,041
There was an elderly professor
in my department

152
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:44,316
who had been passionately keen on a particular
theory for a number of years.

153
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:47,468
And one day an American
visiting researcher came,

154
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:51,801
and he completely and utterly disproved
our old man's hypothesis.

155
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:55,984
The old man strode to the front,
shook his hand and said, ''My dear fellow,

156
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,719
I wish to thank you. I have
been wrong these 15 years.''

157
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:03,042
And we all clapped our hands raw.

158
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,906
That was the scientific ideal

159
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,548
of somebody who had a lot invested,

160
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,130
a lifetime almost invested in a theory,

161
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:13,757
and he was rejoicing that
he had been shown wrong,

162
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,209
and scientific truth had been advanced.

163
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:26,824
So what does the overwhelming evidence of
all these fossils tell sceptical science?

164
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:33,605
How did we and every creature get here,
in all our improbable diversity?

165
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:42,695
In past centuries, humanity had no choice
but to resort to a supernatural hypothesis.

166
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,396
Among the many creation
myths around the world,

167
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:49,083
the Book of Genesis imagined a designer God

168
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:54,342
who fashioned the world
and life in just six days.

169
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:04,111
Finally, in the 19th century, science pieced
together what had really happened.

170
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,969
Charles Darwin hit upon a truly brilliant idea

171
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:13,121
that elegantly explains all of life on earth,

172
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:19,210
without any need to invoke
the supernatural or the divine.

173
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,065
Here's a helpful way to look
at the problem Darwin faced.

174
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,889
Climbing a mountain.
Let's call it Mount Improbable.

175
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:43,559
Let's say at the bottom we have the simple
bacterial beginnings of lifeon earth.

176
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:50,987
At the top, man today,
or any complicated piece of biology.

177
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:53,859
So how did we get to the top?

178
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:58,549
If it had happened by blind
chance or by design,

179
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:05,220
lt would be equivalent to leaping up
a sheer cliff in a single bound.

180
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,855
Utterly out of the question.

181
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:13,560
If we come round the other
side of Mount Improbable,

182
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,848
we find something very different.

183
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,989
Here, there is no sudden precipitous cliff,

184
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:24,510
here there's a gentle slope,
a gradient of evolution.

185
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:30,900
All we have to do is put one foot in front
of the other and we'll get to the top.

186
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:36,329
Darwin's great insight was that
life evolved steadily and slowly,

187
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:40,796
inching its way gradually
over four billion years.

188
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:50,131
Natural selection, not a divine designer,
was the sculptor of life.

189
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:02,641
So evolution, driven by Darwin's
motor of natural selection,

190
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:06,033
gets us to the top of Mount Improbable.

191
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:11,305
From primeval simplicity
to ultimate complexity.

192
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,225
The design hypothesis couldn't
even begin to do that,

193
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,314
because it raises an even
bigger problem than it solves:

194
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,772
who made the designer?

195
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:28,349
The abundance and variety of life
on earth may seem improbable

196
00:17:28,384 --> 00:17:32,524
but it's self-evidently futile
to invent an improbable god

197
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,985
to explain that very improbability.

198
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,754
l thought that in my lifetime
evolution would be accepted

199
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,926
and taught around the world
as a scientific fact,

200
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:48,100
supported by overwhelming evidence.

201
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,345
But unfortunately, the whole point about faith

202
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,520
is that even massive and constantly
accumulating physical evidence cuts no ice.

203
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:02,660
Evolution today is under threat.

204
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:07,332
ln the Bible Belt of middle America,

205
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:12,102
evangelical Christians are
fighting back against science.

206
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,529
In the new world, religion is free enterprise.

207
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:27,410
Rival groups set up shop
on every street corner,

208
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:32,634
competing to save people's
souls and collect their money.

209
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:40,680
Fundamentalist Christianity is
on the rise among the electorate

210
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:42,930
of the world's only super power.

211
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,478
Right up to and including the President (Bush).

212
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:51,274
If you believe the surveys,
45% of Americans,

213
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,639
that's about 135 million people,

214
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:59,318
believe the universe is less
than 10,000 years old.

215
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:16,402
This is the New Life Church
in Colorado Springs.

216
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,464
Where conservative Christians have built

217
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:21,003
an 18 million dollar worship center

218
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,704
as their new Jerusalem, in the
foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

219
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:31,005
Evangelical churches like this
have become a powerful lobby,

220
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,571
exerting enormous influence
on everything in America

221
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:39,858
from the teaching of science
in schools, to foreign policy.

222
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,730
This place strains belief.

223
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:52,010
It isn't just a church but
a ready-made social network.

224
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:59,709
The 12,000 strong congregation can
also attend 1,300 organized programs

225
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,321
where they can meet
to exchange Christian tips

226
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:05,494
on everything from marriage
to dog walking.

227
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,174
It's all terribly exuberant and intense.

228
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,496
Much less tradition here than in Lourdes,

229
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:20,723
but plenty of swaggering authority.

230
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,113
The pastor is Ted Haggard.
A powerful man.

231
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,408
Chairman of the
National Association of Evangelicals

232
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,383
and the New Life is Ted's evangelical Vatican.

233
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:43,211
''Welcome to all of our friends!

234
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,511
Take a moment and say hello
to the people behind you,

235
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:48,659
in front of you, to your right,
to your left.''

236
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:53,124
''Hey we wanna welcome all of you
that are visiting here with us today,

237
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,586
if you are here for the very first time,''

238
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,429
''we have a packet of information
that we wanna give to you ...''

239
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:03,468
Sadly, the warmth of the
welcome would prove short-lived

240
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:08,603
when I started talking to Pastor Haggard
about the Bible and scientific fact.

241
00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:13,992
You will find yourself wrong on some things,
right on some other things.

242
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:17,507
But please, in the process of it.
Don´t be arogant.

243
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,118
We exalt
you here this morning, Lord God.

244
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:33,729
Everything that's within us wants
to give you praise and glory and honor,

245
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:36,021
'cos we are so grateful for ...

246
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,101
The New Life Church in Colorado Springs

247
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:41,505
is a bastion of American
religious conservatism.

248
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,293
''Thank you for transforming our lives.
Thank you, Lord God, for ...''

249
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:50,811
I've come to try to understand why
what I see as irrational faith is thriving.

250
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:53,672
And why it's attacking science.

251
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,566
'' ... and in Jesus' name we pray.
And everybody says Amen!''

252
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,618
''Amen!''

253
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:00,682
''Welcome to the United States!''
- Thank you very much.

254
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:05,630
Pastor Ted Haggard has a hotline
to God and to George Bush.

255
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:10,409
A staunch Republican, he claims he has
a weekly conference call with the President,

256
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:14,972
and has also rubbed shoulders
with Tony Blair and Ariel Sharon.

257
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,832
Well that was really quite
a show you gave us today.

258
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,891
A fair bit of money seems
to have been spent here.

259
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:24,405
Yes. I wanted people to be
able to worship and enjoy it,

260
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,850
and be in a setting where
the speaker is close to them,

261
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:31,014
that's why it's in the round,
and so they can be up close to me

262
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,150
and so l can look at them.

263
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,281
Well it's certainly very effective,
what you do,

264
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:37,368
I mean, it seemed to me
you have all the arts of ..

265
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:38,813
I mean, I was almost reminded me,

266
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,069
if you'll forgive me,
of a sort of Nuremberg rally. I mean ...

267
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:42,487
such incredibly ...

268
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:44,741
Doctor Goebbels would have
been proud.

269
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:47,288
Well I don't know anything
about the Nuremberg rallies,

270
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:50,472
but I know lots of Americans
think of it as a rock concert.

271
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:13,803
When I prepare a presentation,

272
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:17,183
I don't prepare  it to get
a group of lunatics to come in

273
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,825
and just say ''oh yes Pastor Ted,
you're just so wonderful,

274
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,287
I believe everything you say''.

275
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,882
I would be opposed to that.

276
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,513
Here the Bible says '...

277
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:29,103
who have been chosen according
to the foreknowledge of God, the Father,

278
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:33,263
this is talking about us,
we've been chosen for ...

279
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:35,038
what's that word there Betty?

280
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,818
''Obedience.''
- ''Say it out loud.''

281
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:39,165
''Obedience!''
- ''Okay, so we have been chosen ...''

282
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,391
Every person needs, at the center,
some sense of meaning about existence.

283
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:48,317
It is life and death to us.
It makes us who we are.

284
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:51,727
Yet most of us, as we grow up and become
responsible adults,

285
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:55,838
accept that life is complex, that we live
in a world of subtle shades,

286
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,060
not sharp black and white.

287
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:01,504
I worry that these born-agains

288
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,062
are being persuaded
to return to childish certainties.

289
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:08,586
The only truth they need is God,

290
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:12,252
God as interpreted
for them by their pastor.

291
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:14,662
You've been set free from sin!

292
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:15,519
Think about that!

293
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,324
Everybody knows that we believe the
Bible's the word of God.

294
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,817
And today I talked about love
your neighbor as yourself.

295
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:26,173
Now, I didn't have to produce evidence,

296
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,962
sociological evidence or
psychological evidence ...

297
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:29,684
But you have a book,

298
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,852
How can you say
they're asked to think for themselves...

299
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,569
...and they're told everything in this book is true?

300
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,025
Because they don't have to believe that.

301
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,856
The evidence that I presented
you can go and read.

302
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:38,921
This book, it says one thing,

303
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,283
that book says another,
that book says another,

304
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:41,700
that book contradicts the others ...

305
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:43,503
Well the evidence I can present
is we've got a book,

306
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:46,104
written over 1500 years
by 40 different authors,

307
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,973
on one subject,
and it doesn't contradict itself.

308
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:49,660
It doesn't?

309
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:51,398
Where you cant give me two,

310
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:56,012
two experts in certain areas
that are in the same generation,

311
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:58,819
in the same area of study,
that don't contradict themselves.

312
00:24:58,854 --> 00:24:59,778
That's the beauty of science.

313
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:03,098
We have lots of evidence,
and the evidence is all the time coming in,

314
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:05,202
constantly changing our minds.

315
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,646
Whereas you have one book which you say it
doesn't change ...

316
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,254
Exactly.

317
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,016
That's not getting them
to think for themselves!

318
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,206
... and we've all decided as a group, to go to the
holy place. True or false?

319
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:14,897
(Congregatlon) True!

320
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,603
True! Everybody say TRUE!

321
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:18,149
''TRUE!''

322
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,246
Alright then. That's the vote ...

323
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:23,499
But my biggest concern
is that evangelicals like Haggard

324
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,642
are foisting evident falsehoods on their flock.

325
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:29,188
... are so wonderful, and so necessary,
that I wanna ...

326
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,851
The evangelicals
are denying scientific evidence

327
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:35,062
just to support Bronze Age myths.

328
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:39,680
... alive in our lives. And then of course,
we need the power of the Holy Spirit.

329
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:43,371
We fully embrace the scientific method, as
American evangelicals.

330
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:48,269
And we think, as time goes along,
as we discover more and more facts

331
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:52,466
that we'll learn more and more about
how God created the heavens and the Earth.

332
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,057
The scientific method clearly demonstrates

333
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:57,208
that the world is 4.5 billion years old.
I mean, do you accept that?

334
00:25:57,243 --> 00:26:02,402
Yeah, you know what you're doing is you are
accepting some of the views

335
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:06,167
that are accepted in some portions
of the scientific community, as fact.

336
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:10,288
Where in fact, your grandchildren might listen

337
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,375
to the tape of you saying
that and laugh at you.

338
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,178
You want a bet?

339
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:18,115
Sometimes it's hard for human being to
study the ear or study the eye,

340
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,453
and think that
happened by accident.

341
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:23,071
I beg you pardon? Did you say by accident?

342
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:24,906
- Yeah.
What do you mean, by accident?

343
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:26,800
That the eye just formed itself somehow.

344
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,444
- And who says it did?
Well, some evolutionists say it did.

345
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,200
Not a single one that l've ever met.

346
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:32,546
Really?
- Really.

347
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,335
You obviously know nothing
about the subject of evolution.

348
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,440
Or maybe you haven't met the people I have.

349
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:42,701
But you see, you do understand,
you do understand that this issue right here

350
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:46,135
of intellectual arrogance is the reason

351
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,000
why people like you have a difficult
problem with people of faith.

352
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:55,788
I don't communicate an air
of superiority over the people

353
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,745
because I know so much more,

354
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,696
and if you only read the books I know,

355
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,861
and if you only knew the scientists I knew,

356
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:04,119
then you would be great like me.

357
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:08,441
Well, sir, there could be many
things that you know well.

358
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:10,680
There are other things
that you don't know well.

359
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:13,839
As you age, you'll find yourself
wrong on some things,

360
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:15,386
right on some other things.

361
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:19,357
But please, in the process,
of it don't be arrogant.

362
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,693
We just had a rather disconcerting experience.

363
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,781
We were just packing up
our stuff ready to go,

364
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,840
when he suddenly drove up in
his pick up truck and said,

365
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:38,826
"Get of my land immediatelly", "I´ll have you
thrown in jail" and "I´ll have seize your film".

366
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:40,620
And he then says a very curious thing,
he said,

367
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:42,910
"You called my children animals."

368
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:45,912
Afterwards we worked out,
that what he must have meant,

369
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,020
was that I talked about evolution.

370
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:51,209
He thought that I was saying,
that his flock were animals.

371
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:54,172
Which of course in some sense I was,
because all humans are all animals.

372
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:15,461
Haggard's approach is to say

373
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:18,528
let's teach evolution
as just another theory

374
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,140
alongside the Bible's creation story.

375
00:28:21,175 --> 00:28:26,336
Or so-called Intelligent Design, which claims
God helped evolution along.

376
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,208
It sounds so reasonable, doesn't it?

377
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,257
But of course it's nothing of the sort.

378
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,264
These are not equal theories.

379
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,382
Evolution by natural selection is supported
by mountains of evidence.

380
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,494
and is only backed by
some ancient scribblings.

381
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:55,070
With Haggard and his followers
on their doorstep,

382
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:58,440
the rational atheist minority
here feel so browbeaten,

383
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:02,137
that they've organized themselves into
what they call ''a freethinkers group'',

384
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:07,649
which meets furtively, perhaps
to fantasise about moving to Canada!

385
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:09,316
How nice to meet you!

386
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:12,489
Hey Richard! lt's wonderful! Welcome,
welcome, it's so good ...

387
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:15,355
Do freethinkers in America feel pretty
beleaguered at the moment?

388
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,001
I've had my fair share of vitriolic letters and
messages from parents

389
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:25,109
saying that I'm Satan's incarnate
for teaching evolution,

390
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:28,224
and there are ministries here
in Colorado Springs that indoctrinate

391
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,558
students in summer programs
to challenge biologists,

392
00:29:32,593 --> 00:29:35,805
biology teachers, in the classroom. And I've ...

393
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,989
So it's an organised campaign to
challenge biology teachers?

394
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:40,735
Oh they're organised campaigns, absolutely.
I do not tolerate it, because I ...

395
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,843
But they have this mindset that they are right.

396
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:45,776
If a person comes out
in this country as an atheist,

397
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:48,084
they're likely to suffer career damage,

398
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,679
they might lose a job,
they might not get a job,

399
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:53,209
they might lose an opportunity
for an apartment.

400
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:55,387
Waking up, as most Americans do,

401
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:58,915
very late on this,
coming to a realisation,

402
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,865
as we did during the McCarthy era,
and even during ...

403
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,252
It's very similar to the McCarthy era ...

404
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:09,978
Yes, it is. We do begin now to see the
dangers of this extremism.

405
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:11,513
Christian fascism isn't it?

406
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:15,488
Yeah. And whatever mantle you want to give
it, which I've heard lately

407
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:20,094
is ''domination theology'',
''dominion Christianity'' ...

408
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:32,798
(Christian radio advertisements)

409
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,976
Fundamentalist American
Christianity is attacking science.

410
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,141
But what is it offering instead?

411
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:44,636
A mirror-image of islamic extremism,
an American Taliban.

412
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,299
We live in a time of lethal polarisation.

413
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:56,620
When the great religions are pushing
their conflict to a point where

414
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,967
it is difficult to see how they
can ever been reconciled.

415
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:04,748
In New York, Madrid and London
we've witnessed the religious insanities

416
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:08,493
of the Middle East penetrate
the heart of the secular west.

417
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:13,739
(George W Bush voiceover)

418
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:17,102
To understand the likes of Osama Bin Laden,
you have to realise

419
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,916
that the religious terrorism they inspire

420
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:23,478
is the logical
outcome of deeply-held faith.

421
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,523
Even so-called moderate believers

422
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:27,969
are part of the
same religious fabric.

423
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:32,276
They encourage unreason as a positive virtue.

424
00:31:35,136 --> 00:31:37,955
What's really scary is that
religious warriors think

425
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,775
of what they are doing as the ultimate good.

426
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,336
Those of us brought up in Christianity
can soon get the message:

427
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:47,059
'Onward Christian soldiers',
'fight the good fight',

428
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:51,073
'stand up! stand up for Jesus,
ye soldiers of the cross!'

429
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:52,726
But as far as I'm concerned,

430
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:55,189
the war between good and evil,

431
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:58,921
is really just the war between two evils.

432
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,355
This is the holy land,

433
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:10,327
where the terrible certainties
of faith began and still rage.

434
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:15,857
I've come here because it's a microcosm
of the religious conflicts

435
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:20,406
which threaten rational values
and civilisation.

436
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:27,106
The dreadful combination of politics
and extreme faith has caused the

437
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:30,566
death of almost 4000 people here,
in shootings,

438
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:35,165
suicide bombings and reprisals
in the last five years.

439
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:49,850
Despite the troubles,

440
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,133
tourists still flock to Jerusalem,

441
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:57,156
to places that their particular brand of religion
taught them to revere as a child.

442
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:00,243
The Via Dolorosa, where Jesus
was allegedly whipped

443
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,203
and beaten during the last hours of his life.

444
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,535
Or the Muslim Dome of the Rock.

445
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,856
Or the Western Wall, Judaism's,
and the world's, most holy ruin.

446
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:39,307
On the surface, it looks like
a place of harmless myth.

447
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:41,832
Because here is the hill of Calvary,

448
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,952
where Jesus was crucified,
and the tomb of Jesus.

449
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:47,704
And here, what we are facing,

450
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,502
to the stone of anointment,
where the body of

451
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:53,327
Jesus was taken down from the cross,

452
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:57,292
so this is the slab where Christ's
body was anointed with oil.

453
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,687
How do we know that?
Is there any evidence that it was here?

454
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,458
You see, this is by telling
from person to person.

455
00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:04,470
It's tradition.

456
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:06,667
Traditional, from generation to the next.

457
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:12,050
We can see the hole where
the cross was stood,

458
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,761
Where they put(ing)
the cross inside the hole,

459
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:18,641
and this is the place where,
the place of the crucifixion,

460
00:34:18,676 --> 00:34:20,953
where Jesus died on the cross.

461
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:23,139
You don't really believe that, do you?

462
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,331
Ah, this is the Christians, as I explained to
you that they believe,

463
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:27,987
this is the place where the
crucifixion took place.

464
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:31,609
lf we come in closer
to my side please, thank you.

465
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:36,955
[The] guard of the tomb is a Greek priest.
Guarding of tomb of Jesus.

466
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,060
This is left from big part of the
stone which closed the tomb,

467
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:44,603
What we call the rolling of angels.

468
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:49,259
Watch your head please,
thank you very much.

469
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:54,277
This is where he stayed,
and rose from death,

470
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:57,573
we call it Sepulchre, is empty tomb.

471
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,491
God bless you, you can touch[ing] the tomb,

472
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,387
you can make your prayer.

473
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:08,109
I get four days off! You come here tomorrow...

474
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:14,853
This holy city has to be one of the least
enlightened places in the world.

475
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:19,993
And it is also a place of barely
suppressed religious hatreds.

476
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:22,222
There will come the day and that day is now.

477
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:24,917
When you are on our lands,
spreading these ideas,

478
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:27,872
that the soldiers of Allah
will not put up with this.

479
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:45,509
We live at a time
when religious belief is fighting back

480
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,526
against reason and scientific truth.

481
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:50,598
This is a problem for all of us,

482
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:54,449
because religion's irrational
roots nourish intolerance

483
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:57,264
to the point of murder.

484
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,808
I'm in Jerusalem's old city,

485
00:35:59,843 --> 00:36:05,501
trying to understand the role deeply-held
faith plays in the bitter conflict here.

486
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:11,417
One of the first things you notice
is the edgy watchfulness,

487
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:15,174
the different ethnic and religious
communities live cheek-by-jowl,

488
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:18,506
but there are security checkpoints
throughout the old city,

489
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:22,653
and one section above all
is under heavy guard.

490
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:27,624
For the Muslims, the compound enclosing
the Dome of the Rock and

491
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:34,172
Al-Aqsa mosque is, after Mecca and Medina,
the third holiest site in lslam.

492
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,760
It was from here, they believe,

493
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:38,726
that the prophet
Mohammad flew up to heaven.

494
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:44,943
As bad luck would have it,
the Jews believe the same place

495
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:48,829
is the site of the long-destroyed first
and second temples,

496
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:51,413
the holiest shrine in Judaism.

497
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:11,446
Jews are not allowed to
worship inside the compound,

498
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,828
their prayers are restricted
to the ruined western, or wailing, wall.

499
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:19,508
''When Jesus came here
to overturn the tables,

500
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:21,394
there was no mosque in view.''

501
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,735
''When the Arabs conquered
this part of the world,

502
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,982
they established the Al-Aqsa mosque.''

503
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:32,954
And then they put over where
we think is the main temple compound,

504
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,696
where the altar was, where the
holy of holy was,

505
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,218
they put another building
called the Dome of the Rock,

506
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:44,075
it was not properly a mosque,
and we at the present moment are

507
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:50,354
simply not allowed in there, inside the compound,
identifiably as Jews.

508
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:54,664
The Muslims reject these Jewish claims.

509
00:37:55,755 --> 00:38:00,259
And when Ariel Sharon entered the Temple Mount
area in the Year 2000:

510
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:04,049
''I came here with a message of peace.''

511
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:08,537
His visit sparked the second,
or Al-Aqsa Intifada,

512
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:13,710
a Palestinian uprising that
has cost 4000 lives so far.

513
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,286
And if the Jews sincerely want
peace with the Arabs and Muslims,

514
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:35,067
then they should stand away,
keep away from the Al-Aqsa mosque.

515
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:41,218
''In the Muslim religion, there is no possibility
anyway of sharing the territory.''

516
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:45,678
If l come in there, in some far corner,
far away from a mosque,

517
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:49,881
in an open area, under a tree
somewhere, if a Muslim will catch me

518
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:52,121
murmuring psalms or some other prayer,

519
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:56,710
he will call the police
to have me 'egressed', shall I say.

520
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:59,480
As far as  the Al-Aqsa mosque is considered,

521
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:03,730
there are no negotiations,
absolutely no negotiations about it.

522
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:18,004
Because no Muslim has the right, worldwide,
to negotiate over the Al-Aqsa mosque.

523
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:30,405
Again and again my conversations come
back to the solid walls

524
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,122
that religion puts up. Back to
implacable faiths.

525
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:38,278
''My holy book is true" ,
" I am right" ," He is wrong''.

526
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:42,370
So I went to meet someone
who, in my naivete,

527
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:46,341
I thought might be able to see
both sides of the story.

528
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:50,882
Yusuf Al-Khattab used
to be called Joseph Coen,

529
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:54,325
born and brought up as
a secular Jew in New York.

530
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,488
In 1998 he moved to Gaza as a Jewish settler,

531
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:04,077
but there he discovered a different God, Allah.

532
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:14,610
What I notice coming to this
centre of world religions,

533
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,065
is what a lot hatred religion fosters.

534
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,145
I mean, I'm an atheist, and I am rather gentle,
I don't hate people.

535
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,759
But it seems to me that I'm
hearing hate on all sides,

536
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,773
and it seems to me is all to do with religion.

537
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:29,940
I hate atheists because atheists don't care

538
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,054
if somebody fornicates
in the middle of the street,

539
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:35,841
they don't care if their women
go bouncing around on TV topless,

540
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,641
it makes no difference, they don't
believe in anything.

541
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,405
If you don't believe in a set rule,

542
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,753
and you believe
that a constitution can change,

543
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:43,935
and you can amend
the rules as they go along,

544
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,394
and if you don't believe in God's rule,

545
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:48,730
then what law do you have?
You just have man-made laws.

546
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:50,777
I realized I was in the company of someone

547
00:40:50,812 --> 00:40:54,228
who has willingly bought into
fundamentalist dogma.

548
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:59,403
What do you think about the
September 11 attacks on New York,

549
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:02,949
and the July 7 attacks in London?

550
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:06,201
Okay, since you like to speak about evolution,
I'd like to start before

551
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:08,134
- what do you think about
the Jews that have

552
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:12,125
destroyed over 417 Arab villages,
including all mosques and majids,

553
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,107
which wouldn't affect you,
'cause you're an atheist.

554
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:17,206
So what are are you saying?
That we should sit back...

555
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,395
Not at all.

556
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,662
...and say 'oh, you know what?
Let us progress and

557
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:21,857
let us sit down and drink tea,
and talk about what to do.

558
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:23,844
I think that's the most ridiculous thing.

559
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:27,927
All I could say is if there was
noquote-unquote "state of Israel",

560
00:41:27,962 --> 00:41:29,912
there would have been no September 11 .

561
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,844
But if we've all got to live together,

562
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:36,341
it's not going to be helped if there
are people of very, very strong faith

563
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:38,287
who simply ''know'' they're right,

564
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,689
and are not amenable to
argument because ...

565
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:44,412
There's somebody out there
who's just as faithful as you,

566
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:48,254
and has his faith just as strong as yours,
which is opposite to yours.

567
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,710
You see the problem is, Richard,
I think that you have fear.

568
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:54,832
You know that this party
of occupying Muslim lands,

569
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:58,387
and polluting society with these
evil ideas that are around,

570
00:41:58,422 --> 00:42:01,666
it's not gonna last forever. There
will always be the soldiers of Allah

571
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:05,210
there to give the response to this.

572
00:42:05,245 --> 00:42:06,882
So we also want the same thing.

573
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:11,363
All we want is ...
we want the non-Muslims at this point

574
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:12,927
off the lands of Mohammad,

575
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,312
sal-allahu-alleihi-wasallam.

576
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:17,096
All the lands of Mohammad,
We want the kaffir out of it.

577
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:19,281
Dawkins: Do you want Islam to
take over rest of the world?

578
00:42:19,316 --> 00:42:21,219
- Of course I want it to, and it will.

579
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:24,032
So my advice is
to clean up your show at home,

580
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:27,794
take your forces off our lands,
correct yourselves,

581
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:31,150
fix your society, alright?
Fix your women ...

582
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:33,094
Fix your women?
That's not my business,

583
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:35,312
that my women's business.
They're not my women...

584
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,059
No, it is your business.
It is your business.

585
00:42:37,094 --> 00:42:39,745
When you take the women and
dress them like whores on the street ...

586
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,788
I don't dress women,
they dress themselves!

587
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:45,811
But you allow it as a norm, to let the women
go on the street dressed like this.

588
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,098
What's goin' on with
your society?

589
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,707
But I'm interested in religion and the effect
that it has on peoples' minds,

590
00:42:51,742 --> 00:42:52,964
and I'm worried about it.

591
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:54,868
And we're very worried about you.

592
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,275
I mean, what's goin' on with the stealing?

593
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,352
With the theft? It's out of control...

594
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,101
Clearly, historic injustice
towards the Palestinians

595
00:43:04,136 --> 00:43:06,515
breeds hatred and anger.

596
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:11,586
But we must face up to the fact
that in creating the death cults of

597
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,835
suicide bombers, it's unshakable,

598
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:19,212
unreasonable conviction in your
own righteous faith that is the key.

599
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:22,028
If preachers then tell the faithful

600
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:24,941
that Paradise after
martyrdom is better

601
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:28,487
than existence here in the real world,
it's hardly surprising that some

602
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,357
crazed followers will actually swallow it,

603
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:37,274
leading to a terrible cycle of vendetta,
war and suffering.

604
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,273
I'm here on the Mount of Olives,

605
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:56,662
looking out over
this beautiful old city.

606
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:59,650
We've heard some pretty
extreme statements,

607
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,214
some hatred, some bigotry,

608
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:04,811
such as I haven't really heard before.

609
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:09,196
I don't see what future the world has,

610
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,478
as long as
people think like that,

611
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:14,680
and people are going to go on thinking
like that, as long as they're

612
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:19,222
brought up from childhood,
from the cradle,

613
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,950
to think that there's
something good about faith.

614
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:24,774
To think that there's something good

615
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:28,762
about believing
because you've been told to believe,

616
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:32,875
rather than believing because you've
looked at the evidence.

617
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:41,615
I want to say that killing for God
is not only hideous murder,

618
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,188
it is also utterly ridiculous.

619
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:51,481
Unlike religion, science doesn't
pretend to know everything.

620
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:54,999
There are still deep questions about
the origins of the universe

621
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:57,812
that have yet to be explained.

622
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:02,135
But just because science can't
answer them right now,

623
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:09,401
doesn't mean faith, tradition, revelation
or an ancient holy text, can.

624
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:13,553
Science can't disprove the existence of God,

625
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:15,846
but that does not mean that God exists.

626
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:19,878
There are a million things we can't disprove!

627
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:25,568
The philosopher Bertrand Russell had an analogy:

628
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:30,379
Imagine there's a china tea pot,
in orbit around the Sun.

629
00:45:30,414 --> 00:45:34,662
You cannot disprove the existence
of the tea pot, because it's too small

630
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:37,283
to be spotted by our telescopes.

631
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:40,049
Nobody but a lunatic would say 'well,

632
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:44,110
I'm prepared to believe in the tea pot
because I can't disprove it'.

633
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:47,535
Maybe we have to be technically
and strictly agnostic,

634
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,912
but in practice we are all tea pot atheists.

635
00:45:53,743 --> 00:45:57,103
But now, suppose that everybody
in the society, the teachers,

636
00:45:57,138 --> 00:46:01,703
the tribal elders, all had faith in the tea pot.

637
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:05,014
Stories of the tea pot had been
handed down for generations,

638
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:07,048
it's part of the tradition of the society,

639
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,432
there are holy
books about the tea pot.

640
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:13,731
Then, somebody who said they did
not believe in the tea pot, might be

641
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:18,211
regarded as eccentric or even mad.

642
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:25,117
There's an infinite number of things like celestial
tea pots that we can't disprove.

643
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:30,219
There are fairies, there
are unicorns, hobgoblins.

644
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,364
We can't disprove any of those.

645
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:34,920
But we don't believe in them anymore than
nowadays we believe

646
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:42,268
in Thor, Amen-Rah, or
Aphrodite.

647
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:48,630
We are all atheists about most of the gods that
societies have ever believed in.

648
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:52,526
Some of us just go one god further.

649
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,720
In the next program, how faith acts like
a virus that strikes the young,

650
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:12,570
and how the good book, which people
follow for moral instruction,

651
00:47:12,605 --> 00:47:14,118
actually reveals a god

652
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:19,141
who is surely  the most vindictive
character in all fiction.

653
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,501
How do we explain the mysteries of life?

654
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:06,503
Science has steadily overturned

655
00:48:06,503 --> 00:48:10,505
old religious myths about
how all this came to be.

656
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:16,508
Yet those who adhere to
Judaism, Christianity or islam

657
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:18,509
still prefer to ignore reason,

658
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:23,511
and have faith in their forever
unprovable, omniscient creator.

659
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,520
I had thought science was
rolling back religious belief,

660
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,521
but I was wrong.

661
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,522
Far from being beaten,
militant faith is on the march

662
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:53,524
all across the world,
with terrifying consequences.

663
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:01,527
As a scientist, I am increasingly worried

664
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:04,528
about how faith is undermining science.

665
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:07,529
It's something we must resist,

666
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,531
because irrational faith is feeding

667
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:12,532
murderous intolerance
throughout the world.

668
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:15,533
In this programme, I want to examine

669
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:17,534
two further problems with religion.

670
00:49:18,534 --> 00:49:21,536
I believe it can lead to a
warped and inflexible morality

671
00:49:21,536 --> 00:49:27,538
and I'm very concerned about the
religious indoctrination of children.

672
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:32,540
I want to show how Faith acts like a
virus that attacks the young

673
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,541
and infects generation after generation.

674
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,544
I believe in a law-giver;
a god right there

675
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:42,545
actually not behind it, right
imminent here; right now.

676
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:45,546
I want to ask whether ancient mythology

677
00:49:45,546 --> 00:49:48,547
should be taught as truth in schools.

678
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:52,549
Professor Dawkins, I'm very impressed
that you're the new messiah, and I

679
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:56,550
appreciate your desire to
redeem the world, but-

680
00:49:57,551 --> 00:50:00,552
It's time to question the
abuse of childhood innocence

681
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:03,553
with superstitious ideas
of hellfire and damnation.

682
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:07,556
I would rather for them to understand

683
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:10,557
that hell is a place that they
absolutely do not wanna go.

684
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:18,560
And I want to show how
the scriptural roots

685
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,561
of the Judeo-Christian moral edifice

686
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:24,562
are cruel and brutish.

687
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,618
"...thou shalt save alive
nothing that breatheth:

688
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:29,206
But thou shalt utterly destroy them..."

689
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,400
"DESTROY"

690
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,566
What in the 21st century are we doing

691
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:36,568
venerating a book that
contains such stuff?

692
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,570
Science weighs up evidence and advances.

693
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:45,572
Religion is high-bound belief for belief's sake.

694
00:50:45,572 --> 00:50:48,573
It's bad for our children,
and it's bad for you.

695
00:50:49,472 --> 00:50:53,866
"Root of All Evil?"

696
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:00,577
There is something exceedingly odd

697
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:03,580
about the idea of sectarian religious schools.

698
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,581
If we hadn't got used to it over the centuries,

699
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:11,583
we'd find it downright bizarre.

700
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:15,359
"The Virus of Faith"

701
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:24,588
Sectarian education has proved
to be deeply damaging.

702
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:27,589
It has left a terrible legacy.

703
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:35,593
When you think about it, isn't it weird
the way we automatically

704
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:39,595
label a tiny child with its parents' religion?

705
00:51:44,597 --> 00:51:46,597
These are Jewish children.

706
00:51:46,597 --> 00:51:50,599
In another part of Jerusalem,
we've seen Moslem children.

707
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,601
In Northern Ireland we have Catholic children
and Protestant children

708
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:57,602
all going to separate schools.

709
00:51:58,602 --> 00:52:01,604
But what's so special about religion
that it is allowed

710
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:05,606
to label small children 'Catholic' or
'Protestant'; 'Jewish' or 'Moslem'?

711
00:52:08,607 --> 00:52:11,608
Nobody would categorise children
by the political party their

712
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:14,609
parents support; call them 'Tory'
or 'Labour' children.

713
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,611
We agree they're too young
to know where they stand

714
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:19,611
on questions of politics.

715
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:22,613
So why is not the same for where
they stand on the cosmos,

716
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:24,613
and humanity's place in it?

717
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:28,616
In genetic evolution,
a species divides into two,

718
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:31,617
initially geographically. There's
some initial separation

719
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:34,618
between the two sub-species,

720
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,620
and they divide away from
each other genetically.

721
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,621
There's no longer gene
flow between them,

722
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,622
and so they can become separate species.

723
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,623
It's a divisive force.

724
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:49,624
Sectarian education acts in a similar way.

725
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,625
Children are initially isolated from each other

726
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,626
because of their parents' Faith.

727
00:52:56,628 --> 00:52:59,629
Then their differences are
constantly drilled into them

728
00:52:59,629 --> 00:53:02,630
and they embark on opposing life trajectories.

729
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:08,633
Such divisions are encouraged,
not just in faraway Israel

730
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:11,634
but right on our doorstep, in
Northern Ireland for instance

731
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,635
or in London.

732
00:53:13,635 --> 00:53:16,636
In north London, the
Hasidic Jewish community

733
00:53:16,636 --> 00:53:18,637
is the largest after
Israel and New York.

734
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:22,638
Here, religious division is taken to its extreme.

735
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,642
These ultra-orthodox Jews
only marry within their sect.

736
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:31,643
Television is frowned upon,
and of course

737
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,644
children attend exclusive
religious schools,

738
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,645
cloistered away from external influences

739
00:53:36,645 --> 00:53:38,645
which just might persuade them

740
00:53:38,645 --> 00:53:41,647
to look outside their community.

741
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:48,649
I want to find out why these children
are being segregated,

742
00:53:48,649 --> 00:53:52,651
and whether their culture allows them
to open their minds to reality.

743
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:54,653
Hello?

744
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:57,654
- Hello.
- Rabbi Gluck. Nice to meet you.

745
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:58,654
- Richard Dawkins.
- I'm Richard Dawkins. How do you do?

746
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:02,656
Thanks for coming, nice to meet you.
Please come in.

747
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,656
Thank you very much.

748
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:05,657
Rabbi Gluck is London born and bred,

749
00:54:05,657 --> 00:54:08,658
but you wouldn't
necessarily know it.

750
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:12,660
His accent is a testament to the
isolation of this religious sect.

751
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,661
Why should children be victims of the

752
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,662
particular tradition in which they
happen to have been born,

753
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:20,663
rather than choosing for themselves

754
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:24,665
by being shown all the
evidence that's available?

755
00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:30,668
We are all to a certain extent
affected by our surroundings.

756
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,670
There's no such thing as a
person living in a vacuum.

757
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,670
No, indeed.

758
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,671
We're all affected by our parents, by our families

759
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:42,673
but at the same time we have a choice
to stay or otherwise.

760
00:54:43,673 --> 00:54:45,674
I think it's important for

761
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:49,675
a minority to be able to have a space

762
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:52,677
where it can express itself; where it can
learn about itself.

763
00:54:53,678 --> 00:54:57,679
Well couldn't you preserve the customs,
the traditions, the history

764
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,681
without somehow imposing upon the children

765
00:55:02,681 --> 00:55:05,683
views about the universe which modern
science would say are simply false?

766
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:08,684
I would say impose upon a Jew anything,

767
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,685
I would say that's something
which is impossible,

768
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:13,686
I think it's scientifically impossible.

769
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:16,687
We believe that God created
the world in six days,

770
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:20,689
we know about evolution - every single
Jewish kid knows about evolution

771
00:55:20,689 --> 00:55:23,691
and has thought about it and has studied it,

772
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:27,692
and has looked at it, and has
thought, "What's going on here?"

773
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:30,693
How many of the children who come up
through your system, your school system

774
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:34,695
end up believing in evolution?

775
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:42,698
I'd- I think that- that- that the- the majority
don't believe in evolution, they...

776
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,701
but at the same time it isn't they don't
believe because they don't know about it.

777
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:51,703
You realise they're being taught
that the entire world

778
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:57,705
began after what archaeologists would
recognise as the agricultural revolution?

779
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:02,707
I mean, these children are being brought up
in a very distorted world indeed,

780
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,708
and I worry about children being victims

781
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:10,710
of this kind of what I can only
describe as mis-education.

782
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:16,713
I find the terms 'distorted' and
'mis-education' rather disturbing.

783
00:56:17,714 --> 00:56:19,715
Judaism has its tradition.

784
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:23,716
I think there are various er, scientists
who have their tradition.

785
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:26,717
This so-called 'the theory of evolution'-

786
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,718
Well it's called that, but that's
in a very technical sense.

787
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,719
But still, but still it's called that,

788
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,720
and it's not called the 'law' of evolution.

789
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,721
Well I will call it the 'fact' of evolution, and-

790
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,722
Then you're- you're a
fundamentalist believer in it.

791
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:39,722
No, no, I'm not a
fundamentalist believer.

792
00:56:39,722 --> 00:56:42,724
The age of the earth: 5,000 years?
I mean that is-

793
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,725
I'm sorry, Rabbi, that is ridiculous!

794
00:56:46,726 --> 00:56:48,727
Of course, Rabbi Gluck is
right that it's important

795
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:51,728
for us to learn about
our own background,

796
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:54,729
but what upsets me is
that in pursuit of that,

797
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:58,731
these innocent children are being
saddled with demonstrable falsehoods.

798
00:57:00,732 --> 00:57:03,733
And this is not just a
problem of the Jewish minority.

799
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:07,734
There's pressure from
an increasing number

800
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:09,735
of Faith schools of other religions

801
00:57:09,735 --> 00:57:13,738
to put scientific fact on a par
with primitive creation myths.

802
00:57:14,738 --> 00:57:17,739
In science classes, why can't they
simply teach science?

803
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,741
- You said this is truth 'cos it's based on evidence.
- Well no, you don't exactly say that,

804
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:24,742
you say, "We're struggling
towards the truth," and

805
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:27,743
as new evidence comes in,
we refine it.

806
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:31,745
And in the middle of that, Jesus
says, "I am truth."

807
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:47,252
We live in the shadow of
a religiously inspired terror

808
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:50,253
in an era when science
has plainly shown

809
00:57:50,253 --> 00:57:53,254
religious supersitions to be false.

810
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:03,258
And yet it's a strange anomaly that
Faith schools are increasing

811
00:58:03,258 --> 00:58:06,259
in number and influence in
our education system,

812
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:10,262
with active encouragement from
Tony Blair's government.

813
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:14,263
There are already 7,000 Faith
schools in Britain,

814
00:58:14,263 --> 00:58:18,265
but the government's Trust Reforms
are encouraging many more.

815
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:21,266
Over half the new City Academies
are expected to be sponsored

816
00:58:21,266 --> 00:58:23,267
by religious organisations.

817
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:44,276
The most worrying development is
a new wave of private evangelical schools

818
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:48,278
that have adopted the American
Baptist A.C.E. curriculum:

819
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,279
'Accelerated Christian Education'.

820
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:53,280
Have you been to one of
these schools before?

821
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,280
- No, I never have.
- No. Okay.

822
00:58:55,281 --> 00:59:01,283
Accelerated Christian Education slips
religious superstitions back into science.

823
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:05,284
If you want to be rude, you'd say
it's "programmed learning",

824
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:09,287
If you want to be polite,
it's "individualised instruction".

825
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:12,288
- Okay.
- So really, each one is teaching themselves.

826
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:16,290
To a certain extent, of course. That
has to be modified

827
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,290
with adult supervision and so on.

828
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:33,296
I had a look at the curriculum
booklet that you use for science,

829
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:39,300
and it was very noticeable that God or
Jesus did come on just about every page.

830
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,301
Yes, yes. We don't have anything like
religious instruction in the school

831
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:44,302
- because it is part of the-
- I can see you wouldn't need it.

832
00:59:44,302 --> 00:59:45,302
No, of course not. Absolutely.

833
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,304
In one section of this thing, I
suddenly - I was sort of taken aback,

834
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:52,305
because I suddenly started reading
about Noah's Ark.

835
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:54,306
I mean, what's that got to do
with a science lesson?

836
00:59:54,306 --> 00:59:59,308
Well I suppose that depends on your
opinion. It could have a lot.

837
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:02,310
If you believe in the story, it could
have a lot to do with science.

838
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:04,311
But I mean the stuff that I was taught
when I was a kid at school in science

839
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:08,312
now you would laught at
and say it was a myth,

840
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:10,313
- But that's what I was taught-
- But what were you taught?

841
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:13,314
When I was taught at- one of the
things that they told me at school

842
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:18,316
that I've always remembered was that the
moon came from the ocean here on earth.

843
01:00:18,316 --> 01:00:20,317
and was flung into space, and
that's where it came from.

844
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,318
Well what you should have been taught,
I suppose, is that there is

845
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:27,320
a strong current theory that
that's what happened.

846
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,320
So what you're really
trying to ask me is,

847
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,323
"Do you think the Genesis story
was true, and that

848
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:36,324
God created the world in seven days?"
That's what you'd really like to ask me, right?

849
01:00:36,324 --> 01:00:38,325
My answer to that is, "I don't know."

850
01:00:39,325 --> 01:00:44,327
Having said that, do I think that if God
wanted to do it in seven days he could?

851
01:00:44,327 --> 01:00:47,329
- Yeah, I think he could.
- He can do anything.

852
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:48,329
- Yeah.
- Yes.

853
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:50,330
So it's sort of an academic question,

854
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:54,331
which actually I don't care about
the answer very much really.

855
01:00:54,331 --> 01:00:56,332
Does that make sense?

856
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:58,333
Kind of, yes. It does make sense.
It doesn't make sense to me

857
01:00:58,333 --> 01:00:59,334
because I do care about the answer.

858
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:01,335
Why?

859
01:01:01,335 --> 01:01:02,836
Because I care about what's true, and I-

860
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,336
- I care about what's true.
- Yes.

861
01:01:05,337 --> 01:01:09,338
Well I find Christianity encompasses
everything about life.

862
01:01:09,338 --> 01:01:12,339
Christianity is life, so it's about
everything. It touches

863
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:16,341
education, politics, care, social
services, everything.

864
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,342
Let me ask about another thing
in the booklet, which was

865
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,343
about AIDS and HIV. I think
somewhere it talks about

866
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:25,344
AIDS being the wages of sin.

867
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:30,347
Is that mixing health education
with moralistic preaching?

868
01:01:30,347 --> 01:01:34,349
I suppose the flip side of that is that if
there is no God and there is no law-giver,

869
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:42,352
why does it matter what I do? Why is
rape wrong? Why is paedophilia wrong?

870
01:01:42,352 --> 01:01:46,354
Why are any of these things wrong
if there is no law-giver?

871
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:49,355
You've just said a very revealing thing. Are
you telling me that the only reason

872
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:55,357
why you don't steal and rape and murder is
that you're frightened of God?

873
01:01:55,357 --> 01:01:59,360
I think that all people, if they think they can
get away with something,

874
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,361
and it is- there is no consequences, we
actually tend to do that.

875
01:02:03,361 --> 01:02:06,363
I think that is the reality. Look at the
world in which we live.

876
01:02:06,363 --> 01:02:07,363
That is the reality.

877
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:09,364
- Okay, well I think better leave it at that.
- Okay.

878
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:13,365
Adrian Hawkes, I'm sure, is
a well-meaning man.

879
01:02:13,365 --> 01:02:17,367
But why should he impose his personal
version of reality on children?

880
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,368
Not only are they encouraged to
consider  the weird claims of

881
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:25,371
the bible alongside scientific fact,
they are also being indoctrinated

882
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,373
into what an objective observer
might see as a warped morality.

883
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:40,377
Let me explain why, when it comes to children,
I think of religion as a dangerous virus.

884
01:02:42,378 --> 01:02:45,379
It is a virus which is transmitted
partly through teachers and clergy

885
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:50,381
but also down the generations,
from parent to child to grandchild.

886
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:58,385
Children are especially vulnerable to
infection by the virus of religion.

887
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:02,386
A child is genetically pre-programmed
to accumulate knowledge

888
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:04,387
from figures of authority.

889
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:22,395
The child brain, for very good Darwinian
reasons, has to be set up

890
01:03:22,395 --> 01:03:26,397
in such a way that it believes
what it's told by its elders,

891
01:03:28,398 --> 01:03:33,400
because there just isn't time for
the child to experiment with warnings

892
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,402
like: "Don't go too near the cliff edge," or
"Don't swim in the river; there are crocodiles."

893
01:03:39,402 --> 01:03:46,405
Any child who applied a scientific, sceptical,
questioning attitude to that would be dead.

894
01:03:48,406 --> 01:03:55,409
No wonder the Jesuit said, "Give me the child for
his first seven years and I'll give you the man."

895
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:03,412
The child brain will automatically
believe what it's told, even if

896
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,413
what it's told is nonsense.

897
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:10,415
And then, when the child grows up,
it will tend to pass on

898
01:04:10,415 --> 01:04:14,417
that same nonsense to its children.

899
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,421
And so religion goes on, from
generation to generation.

900
01:04:31,424 --> 01:04:35,426
For many people, part of growing up
is killing off the virus of Faith

901
01:04:35,426 --> 01:04:38,427
with a good strong dose
of rational thinking.

902
01:04:39,428 --> 01:04:41,428
But if an individual doesn't
succeed in shaking it off,

903
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:45,430
his mind is stuck in a
permanent state of infancy,

904
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:49,432
and there is a real danger that he
will infect the next generation.

905
01:04:54,434 --> 01:04:58,436
I'm going to meet someone who has
experienced religion as child abuse first-hand.

906
01:04:59,436 --> 01:05:00,437
- Jill Mytton.
- Oh, hello.

907
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:03,438
- I'm Richard Dawkins, how do you do?
- Hello, Richard.

908
01:05:03,438 --> 01:05:06,439
Jill Mytton was brought up in a
strict Christian sect.

909
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:09,440
Today she's a psychologist who
rehabilitates young adults

910
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,842
similarly scarred by their
narrow religious upbringing.

911
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,444
They need to be allowed to hear
different perspectives on things.

912
01:05:17,444 --> 01:05:20,446
They need to be allowed to investigate.
They need to be allowed to

913
01:05:20,446 --> 01:05:26,448
develop their critical faculties, so that they
can take a number of different viewpoints.

914
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:29,449
and weigh them up, and decide
which one is for them.

915
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:35,451
They need to find their own pathways; not to
be forced into a particular mould as a child.

916
01:05:37,452 --> 01:05:43,456
If I think back to my childhood, it's one
that's kind of dominated by fear.

917
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:50,458
And it was a fear of disapproval while in the
present, but also of eternal damnation.

918
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:53,460
Do they get taught about hell
fire and things like that?

919
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,462
Absolutely. And to a child, images of hell
fire and gnashing of teeth

920
01:05:58,462 --> 01:06:01,463
are actually very real; they're not
metaphorical at all.

921
01:06:01,463 --> 01:06:03,463
- Of course not.
- No.

922
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:06,465
If you bring a child up and discourage
it from thinking freely and making

923
01:06:06,465 --> 01:06:15,469
choices freely, then that's still- to me that is a
form of mental abuse or psychological abuse.

924
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:19,471
Or if you tell a child that when it dies
it's going to roast forever in hell.

925
01:06:19,471 --> 01:06:20,471
In hell. That is abusive, yes.

926
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:26,474
What did they tell you about it?
I mean, what happens in hell?

927
01:06:29,475 --> 01:06:33,476
It's strange, isn't it. After all this
time, it still has the power to

928
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:36,477
affect me when you asked me that question.

929
01:06:37,478 --> 01:06:42,481
Hell is a fearful place. It's
complete rejection by God.

930
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:44,482
It's complete judgement.

931
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:47,483
There is real fire.

932
01:06:48,483 --> 01:06:50,484
There is real torment; real torture,

933
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:55,486
and it goes on forever, so there
is no respite from it.

934
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:21,497
It's deeply disturbing to think that
there are believers out there

935
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:26,499
who actively use the idea of hell
for moral policing.

936
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:38,505
In the United States, Christian obsession
with sin has spawned a national craze

937
01:07:38,505 --> 01:07:43,507
for 'hell houses' - morality
plays-cum-Halloween freak-shows,

938
01:07:43,507 --> 01:07:48,509
in which the evangelical hobby-horses of
abortion and homosexuality

939
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:51,510
are literally demonised.

940
01:07:59,513 --> 01:08:04,515
Pastor Keenan Roberts is rehearsing a new
production of his Colorado-based hell-house,

941
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,517
which he's written and staged for
almost fifteen years.

942
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:13,519
He fervently believes that you have
to scare people into being good.

943
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:20,522
The call upon my life as a pastor, as a
minister, is to tell people what the book says,

944
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:24,524
and what I, and we in our church,
and hundreds of churches

945
01:08:24,524 --> 01:08:28,525
across this country and around the world
are doing is, we have found

946
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:35,529
a very creative, effective tool that is
getting people's attention

947
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,530
- to consider the message.
- I believe it. I believe it.

948
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:54,537
We want to leave an indelible impression
upon their life that sin destroys.

949
01:08:56,537 --> 01:09:02,541
Every scene preaches the truth that
either sin destroys or Jesus saves.

950
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:27,551
If this is a rehearsal, think how
horrific the full production must be.

951
01:09:27,551 --> 01:09:32,553
I presume you have a cut-off age for the tour,
I mean no children below an age of-

952
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:34,554
What is your cut-off age?

953
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:39,556
Well over the years of having
audiences and people go through this,

954
01:09:39,556 --> 01:09:47,559
we have come to the decision that the best
age for young people is really at twelve.

955
01:09:53,562 --> 01:09:57,563
Would it worry you if a child of twelve
coming to see your performance

956
01:09:57,563 --> 01:10:01,566
had nightmares afterwards?
Or would you like that?

957
01:10:01,566 --> 01:10:06,568
I would like them... I would like
for their life to be changed.

958
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:07,568
No matter what.

959
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:13,571
I would rather for them to understand
that hell is a place that they

960
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:18,573
absolutely do not wanna go. I would rather
reach them with that message at twelve,

961
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:22,574
than to not reach them with that
message, and have them live a life

962
01:10:22,574 --> 01:10:24,575
of sin and to never find the lord Jesus Christ.

963
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,582
In the case of homosexual marriage,
what harm does that do?

964
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:42,583
Why would you be so
passionately against that?

965
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,583
They're living in sin.

966
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:46,585
That's your opinion. But it's nothing to
do with you, is it. It's their decision.

967
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:49,586
It's not my opinion. I'm
telling you what the bible says.

968
01:10:49,586 --> 01:10:52,587
It's the bible's opinion. But these are two
people who want to live together.

969
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:56,589
Isn't it their own business? What
right have you to interfere?

970
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,601
I want them to know
homosexuality is sin.

971
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:29,603
But you believe it presumably on the
basis of scriptural authority.

972
01:11:28,603 --> 01:11:29,603
- Absolutely.
- Yeah. Um...

973
01:11:30,604 --> 01:11:33,605
- Unapologetically.
- Yes, unapologetically. But why are you

974
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:37,607
so sure that's right? I mean if you think
about where the scriptures come from,

975
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:39,607
I mean, who wrote them, and when?

976
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:41,608
What makes you so confident
they're right?

977
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:43,609
- It's what I believe.
- I know you believe it, but why?

978
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:47,610
It is a Faith issue with me.
Why do you not believe it?

979
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,611
Uh... because of evidence.

980
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:57,615
Hell House is the brash end of a much bigger
problem with the way religious belief works.

981
01:11:57,615 --> 01:12:01,617
Taken to its extremes, as by
American evangelists, the bible

982
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:07,619
is scanned for passages to justify right-
wing views on abortion and 'family values'.

983
01:12:11,621 --> 01:12:14,622
I'm about to meet a believer
who uses the word of God

984
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,623
to fight against centuries of human progress.

985
01:12:19,624 --> 01:12:23,627
I think execution for adultery is not rejected.

986
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:24,627
Not rejected by who? By you?

987
01:12:25,627 --> 01:12:27,628
- No. By the New Testament.
- What about you? Do you

988
01:12:26,628 --> 01:12:28,629
favour execution in adultery?

989
01:12:29,629 --> 01:12:34,631
I think that's fair to say; that that's
still a proper punishment that

990
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:36,632
the State ought to prosecute.

991
01:12:49,538 --> 01:12:52,539
It's not so bad, surely,
to believe in moral codes

992
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:55,540
handed down to us from the good book.

993
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,541
Doesn't the bible give us a
moral framework in which to live?

994
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:04,544
Well no. The holy texts are of
dubious origin and veracity,

995
01:13:04,544 --> 01:13:06,544
and they're internally contradictory.

996
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:10,343
And when we look closely,
we find a system of morals

997
01:13:10,378 --> 01:13:16,807
which any civilised person today
should surely find poisonous.

998
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:22,552
The Old Testament is in every church and
synagogue throughout the world,

999
01:13:22,552 --> 01:13:26,553
and is the root of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.

1000
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:37,670
If your brother, the son of your father
or of your mother, or your son or daughter,

1001
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:42,546
or the spouse whom you embrace
tries to secretly seduce you,

1002
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:46,884
saying, "Let us go and serve other gods"...

1003
01:13:47,562 --> 01:13:51,564
This is God's advice on what to do
to a friend or family member

1004
01:13:51,564 --> 01:13:54,204
who suggests you believe in another deity:

1005
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:59,907
...you must kill him, your hand must strike
the first blow in putting him to death...

1006
01:13:59,942 --> 01:14:01,871
...and the hands of the rest of the people following.

1007
01:14:01,906 --> 01:14:11,198
You must stone him to death, since he
has tried to divert you from Yahweh your God...

1008
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:16,575
The god of the Old Testament has got to be
the most unpleasant character in all fiction.

1009
01:14:17,575 --> 01:14:22,577
Jealous and proud of it. Petty. Vindictive.
Unjust. Unforgiving. Racist.

1010
01:14:22,577 --> 01:14:28,580
An ethnic cleanser, urging his
people on to acts of genocide.

1011
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,582
If God doesn't set a good
moral example, who does?

1012
01:14:33,582 --> 01:14:38,583
Abraham, the founding father of
all three great monotheistic religions?

1013
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:42,586
The man who would willingly make a
burnt offering of his son Isaac?

1014
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:44,587
Maybe not.

1015
01:14:45,587 --> 01:14:50,589
How about Moses, he of the tablets
which said, "Thou shalt not kill"?

1016
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:54,591
Well the same man, it says in the book of
Numbers, was incensed by the Israelites'

1017
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:58,592
merciful retraint towards the
conquered Midianite people.

1018
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:03,594
He gave orders to kill all male
prisoners and older women.

1019
01:15:03,595 --> 01:15:07,959
But all the women children, that have
not known a man by lying with him,

1020
01:15:07,994 --> 01:15:10,644
keep alive for yourselves.

1021
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:14,600
How is this story of Moses
morally distinguishable

1022
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,601
from Hitler's rape of Poland,
or Saddam Hussein's massacre

1023
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:22,603
of the Kurds and the Marsh Arabs?

1024
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,604
So let's leave Moses out of it.

1025
01:15:26,604 --> 01:15:31,606
But there are lesser characters facing
somewhat more everyday moral dilemmas.

1026
01:15:31,606 --> 01:15:34,607
Maybe they provide a better role model.

1027
01:15:34,607 --> 01:15:39,610
In the book of Judges, a priest was
traveling with his wife in Gibiah.

1028
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:42,612
They spent the night in
the house of an old man.

1029
01:15:42,612 --> 01:15:44,612
But during supper,
a mob came to demand

1030
01:15:44,613 --> 01:15:47,614
that the host hand over his male guest.

1031
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:50,774
"so that we may know him..."

1032
01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:53,616
Yes, in the biblical sense.

1033
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:55,617
Well, the old man replied:

1034
01:15:57,617 --> 01:16:00,619
Nay, my brethren. Nay, I pray you.
Do not so wickedly.

1035
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:06,666
Behold, here is my daughter a maiden,
and his concubine;

1036
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:15,041
them I will bring out now, and humble ye them,
and do with them what seemeth good unto you;

1037
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:20,228
but unto this man do not so vile a thing.

1038
01:16:21,628 --> 01:16:24,629
So enjoy yourselves by raping
and humiliating my daughter,

1039
01:16:24,629 --> 01:16:28,631
but show a proper respect for my
guest who is, after all, male.

1040
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:32,632
Whatever else this
strange story might mean,

1041
01:16:32,632 --> 01:16:35,634
it surely tells us something
about the status of women

1042
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:37,635
in this religious society.

1043
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:44,638
Now of course, nice Christians will
be protesting, "Everyone knows the

1044
01:16:44,638 --> 01:16:46,639
the Old Testament is
deeply unpleasant."

1045
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:52,641
The New Testament of Jesus, they claim,
undoes the damage and makes it alright.

1046
01:16:53,641 --> 01:16:56,643
Yes, there's no doubt that,
from a moral point of view,

1047
01:16:56,643 --> 01:17:02,645
Jesus is a huge improvement, because Jesus
- or whoever wrote his lines - was not content

1048
01:17:02,645 --> 01:17:06,648
to derive his ethics from the scriptures
with which he'd been brought up.

1049
01:17:07,648 --> 01:17:09,649
But then it all goes wrong.

1050
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:16,651
The heart of New Testament theology
- invented after Jesus's death - is

1051
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:21,653
St Paul's nasty sadomasochistic
doctrine of atonement for original sin.

1052
01:17:25,655 --> 01:17:29,657
The idea is that God had himself
incarnated as a man - Jesus -

1053
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:32,659
in order that he should
be hideously tortured

1054
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:35,660
and executed to redeem all our sins.

1055
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,662
Not just the original sin of Adam
and Eve; future sins as well,

1056
01:17:40,662 --> 01:17:43,663
whether we decide to
commit them or not.

1057
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:53,667
If God wanted to forgive our sins,
why not just forgive them?

1058
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:54,667
Who's God trying to impress?

1059
01:17:54,667 --> 01:18:00,670
Presumably himself, since he's judge and
jury - as well as execution victim.

1060
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:05,673
To cap it all, according to scientific
views of prehistory,

1061
01:18:05,673 --> 01:18:08,674
Adam - the supposed perpetrator of
the original sin -

1062
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:13,676
never existed in the first place; an
awkward fact which undermines

1063
01:18:13,676 --> 01:18:17,677
the premise of Paul's whole
tortuously nasty theory.

1064
01:18:17,677 --> 01:18:21,679
Oh but of course the story of Adam and
Eve was only ever symbolic, wasn't it.

1065
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:22,679
Symbolic?!

1066
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,681
So Jesus had himself tortured
and executed for a symbolic sin

1067
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:28,682
by a non-existent individual?

1068
01:18:30,684 --> 01:18:32,684
Nobody not brought up in the Faith

1069
01:18:32,684 --> 01:18:36,686
could reach any verdict
other than 'barking mad'.

1070
01:18:41,688 --> 01:18:44,689
The strange theology and questionable
texts wouldn't matter,

1071
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:47,690
but for the unfortunate fact
that there are people out there

1072
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:52,692
who really believe this stuff is
the word of God, and act on it;

1073
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:56,694
challenging progressive values
- and the rule of law.

1074
01:18:58,696 --> 01:19:02,697
If you take the 'good book' to its
literal extreme - and some people do -

1075
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,698
you can justify murder.

1076
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:09,700
In 1994, the reverend Paul Hill
shot and killed Dr John Britton

1077
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,701
outside his abortion clinic in Florida.

1078
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:16,703
In 2003, Hill was executed for murder.

1079
01:19:16,703 --> 01:19:20,704
But he went to his death claiming his
actions were backed by holy scripture.

1080
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:29,709
I'm going to meet the Paul Hill's friend
and defender, the reverend Michael Bray.

1081
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:32,710
- Mr Bray?
- Yes, sir.

1082
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

1083
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:37,712
- I'm Richard Dawkins.
- It's good to meet you, sir. Michael Bray.

1084
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:42,714
On what moral basis can he, as a Christian,
defend a self-professed, cold-blooded killer?

1085
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:47,716
Your friend Paul Hill, who was convicted
of murdering a doctor,

1086
01:19:48,716 --> 01:19:50,717
he took the law into his
own hands, didn't he.

1087
01:19:51,717 --> 01:19:52,718
No.

1088
01:19:53,718 --> 01:19:57,721
Paul Hill, by his own testimony,
acted defensively,

1089
01:19:58,721 --> 01:20:00,722
not in retribution.

1090
01:20:00,722 --> 01:20:02,723
That's the job of the law.

1091
01:20:02,723 --> 01:20:04,723
- The job of the law is to punish.
- No.

1092
01:20:05,724 --> 01:20:11,726
The job of citizens is to - is indeed, out
of love - to protect one another.

1093
01:20:12,727 --> 01:20:15,728
Does it ever occur to you that that
doctor had a wife to grieve for him?

1094
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,228
Paul Hill killed him!

1095
01:20:17,728 --> 01:20:20,730
Now the embryos that Paul
Hill was 'defending',

1096
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:25,733
they were tiny little things without any
knowledge, without any memory,

1097
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:31,735
without any fears, without all the things
that a full-grown adult doctor had.

1098
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:34,736
Doesn't that give your conscience
a little bit of a twinge?

1099
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:39,738
Well I don't think we measure the value
of someone by their cognizance of their

1100
01:20:39,738 --> 01:20:42,739
surroundings or their- or even of
their relationships.

1101
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,741
The value that we give human beings
historically - and thankfully

1102
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:52,744
from the scriptures - is that they are created
in God's image, and they are-

1103
01:20:52,744 --> 01:20:56,746
they have a certain sanctity
because of that.

1104
01:20:56,746 --> 01:20:57,746
So whether they be imbeciles or...

1105
01:20:58,747 --> 01:21:02,748
To most sensible people, Bray's
fellow clergyman Paul Hill

1106
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:06,750
looks like a dangerous psychopath,
righting what he perceived as wrong

1107
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,751
by committing another,
more terrible wrong.

1108
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:13,752
Yet people like Hill and Bray
don't see the world that way.

1109
01:21:15,753 --> 01:21:18,754
They declare that their justification
is in the bible,

1110
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:22,757
and by re-declaring the bible
as the absolute word of God

1111
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:24,758
they give their actions validity.

1112
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:30,760
Many of us who don't subscribe
to any particular holy book

1113
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,762
worry about suffering. We actually
worry about whether the victim

1114
01:21:34,762 --> 01:21:37,763
of a murder, whether it's the murder
of a - in your terms - of

1115
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:42,765
an embryo, or of an adult doctor.
I mean, can you not see

1116
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:46,766
that there's a big imbalance there
between those two deaths.

1117
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:51,769
Well I couldn't take into account
- because I'm not omniscient -

1118
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:54,771
to know all the sufferings that
various people suffer.

1119
01:21:54,771 --> 01:21:56,771
Where do you think he is? Paul Hill.

1120
01:21:57,772 --> 01:22:01,773
Oh, I have high hopes that he's doing well.

1121
01:22:02,774 --> 01:22:03,774
-You think he's in heaven.
-Yes.

1122
01:22:03,774 --> 01:22:05,775
You think Jesus approves of
murdering doctors.

1123
01:22:05,775 --> 01:22:08,776
I think that, uh... he said that, uh...

1124
01:22:11,777 --> 01:22:15,779
he said that we're to love the children
just as we love others.

1125
01:22:15,779 --> 01:22:17,781
Suffer the little children
to come to me.

1126
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:21,782
I reckon I have a fairly strong moral
conviction as well, but I'm not that confident.

1127
01:22:21,782 --> 01:22:24,783
I wouldn't like to
go and kill somebody

1128
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:25,784
for the sake of my morality.

1129
01:22:25,784 --> 01:22:27,784
How can you be that confident?

1130
01:22:29,785 --> 01:22:34,787
I think, uh... my own confidence,
I guess, has come with time.

1131
01:22:34,787 --> 01:22:42,790
The more I- I think the scriptures- the more
I live, the more satisfied I am intellectually

1132
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:43,791
that they interpret reality for me.

1133
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:49,794
It was curious. I quite liked him.
I thought he was sincere.

1134
01:22:49,794 --> 01:22:54,796
I thought he wasn't
really an evil person.

1135
01:22:55,796 --> 01:23:00,798
And I was reminded of a quotation
by the famous American physicist

1136
01:23:00,798 --> 01:23:03,800
Stephen Weinberg - the Nobel prize-
winning theoretical physicist -

1137
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,802
Weinberg said, "Religion is
an insult to human dignity.

1138
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:12,803
Without it, you'd have good people
doing good things

1139
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:15,805
and evil people doing evil things,

1140
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:19,807
but for good people to do evil things,
it takes religion."

1141
01:23:22,808 --> 01:23:26,810
People like Michael Bray are a
big problem for Christian morality.

1142
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:30,811
Not all Christians are as rooted
in the spoil of scripture,

1143
01:23:30,811 --> 01:23:34,813
but they do all take inspiration
from the same holy text.

1144
01:23:37,814 --> 01:23:38,814
But who is right?

1145
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:43,817
The established Church of England
is being painfully torn apart

1146
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:46,818
by these differences of
opinion over the scriptures.

1147
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:52,821
The battleground is not so much abortion,
but homosexuality and gay clergy.

1148
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:56,822
On one side are vociferous
scriptural purists;

1149
01:23:56,822 --> 01:24:01,824
on the other: more moderate believers
who interpret the bible selectively.

1150
01:24:04,826 --> 01:24:08,827
You're on the liberal wing
of the Anglican church.

1151
01:24:08,827 --> 01:24:12,830
Maybe the other side are the ones who
are being true to their scriptures

1152
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:16,831
in a way that you're not. I mean you, who
are liberal and much closer to what

1153
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:22,834
I would think, are the one who's departing
from the- certainly from the scriptural,

1154
01:24:22,834 --> 01:24:25,835
and perhaps from the fundamentals.

1155
01:24:26,835 --> 01:24:29,836
Um, well if you take the issue of
homosexuality there's no doubt about it,

1156
01:24:29,836 --> 01:24:33,838
there are a number of texts - not as many as
people think, but a few texts - which

1157
01:24:33,838 --> 01:24:37,840
clearly regard homosexuality as wrong, both

1158
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,842
in the Old Testament very strongly,
but they're also there

1159
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:45,844
in the New Testament. But of course it's
a question of how you interpret the bible;

1160
01:24:45,844 --> 01:24:51,846
whether it's really right to just
simply extract a few isolated texts

1161
01:24:52,846 --> 01:24:56,848
rather than seeing the whole message of
the bible; the whole message of Jesus.

1162
01:24:56,848 --> 01:24:59,849
But I think there's another, perhaps even
more fundamental one which links in

1163
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:04,851
to your fundamental interest in evolution. Our
understanding of what it is to be a gay or

1164
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:10,854
lesbian now is very very different from what
it was, let us say in the Roman world,

1165
01:25:10,854 --> 01:25:11,855
when the New Testament was written.

1166
01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:12,855
Therefore it's purely
a matter of choice.

1167
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:17,857
We now actually know that a significant
percentage of people

1168
01:25:17,857 --> 01:25:20,858
are predominantly attracted
to members of their own sex.

1169
01:25:20,858 --> 01:25:25,860
So it's a question of the changing facts, as
well as a changing understanding of how

1170
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,861
the bible should be interpreted.

1171
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:31,863
This of course is all music to my ears,
but I'm kind of left wondering

1172
01:25:31,863 --> 01:25:34,865
why you stick with Christianity
at all therefore.

1173
01:25:35,865 --> 01:25:39,867
And maybe some of the fundamentalists
might say just that to you.

1174
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:43,868
I think that moderates need to be passionate,
both about their religious beliefs, and

1175
01:25:43,868 --> 01:25:48,870
about rationality, and it's possible to be a
passionate moderate. It's much more difficult...

1176
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:53,872
Some say that while religious fundamentalists
betray reason, moderate believers

1177
01:25:53,872 --> 01:25:56,873
betray reason and Faith equally.

1178
01:25:57,874 --> 01:25:59,875
The moderates' position seems
to me to be fence-sitting.

1179
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:05,878
They half-believe in the bible. But how do
they decide which parts to believe literally

1180
01:26:05,878 --> 01:26:07,879
and which parts are just allegorical?

1181
01:26:07,879 --> 01:26:11,880
I take it that as an Anglican
bishop you wouldn't deny miracles,

1182
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,882
and I think you ought to, to be consistent
with what you've just been saying.

1183
01:26:15,882 --> 01:26:19,884
I think if God was doing miracles the
whole time, then we would live in

1184
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:21,884
an Alice in Wonderland-type world.

1185
01:26:21,884 --> 01:26:23,885
- Yeah.
- It would be unpredictable.

1186
01:26:23,885 --> 01:26:25,886
And you and I wouldn't be able
to have a rational conversation.

1187
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:27,887
It's almost as though you think there's
a kind of 'ration' of miracles,

1188
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:30,888
which mustn't be exceeded, or we
get into 'Looking Glass' territory.

1189
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:34,890
We can't say what that 'ration' is. If
miracles were happening all the time,

1190
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:39,892
whenever we wanted them to happen, then
human life as we know it couldn't exist.

1191
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:42,894
And what about the sort of really
big miracles, like the virgin birth?

1192
01:26:42,894 --> 01:26:43,894
What do you think about that?

1193
01:26:44,894 --> 01:26:47,896
I don't think that it's on a par
with the resurrection, for example.

1194
01:26:47,896 --> 01:26:51,897
I mean, I actually do believe that the
resurrection of Jesus from the dead

1195
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:54,898
is absolutely fundamental to Christianity,

1196
01:26:54,898 --> 01:26:57,899
in a way that I don't
believe the virgin birth is.

1197
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:02,902
It seems to me an odd proposition
that we should adhere to some parts

1198
01:27:02,902 --> 01:27:06,904
of the bible story but not to others.
After all, when it comes to

1199
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:10,906
important moral questions, by what
standards do we cherry-pick the bible?

1200
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:16,908
Why bother with the bible at all, if we have
the ability to pick and choose from it

1201
01:27:16,908 --> 01:27:19,909
what is right and what is
wrong for today's society?

1202
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:28,914
I suspect that religion is simply a parasite
on a much older moral sense.

1203
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:35,916
I want to examine how science reveals
the true roots of human morality.

1204
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:40,918
Morality stems not from some fictional
deity and his texts,

1205
01:27:40,968 --> 01:27:46,921
but from altruistic genes that have been
naturally selected in our evolutionary past.

1206
01:27:47,921 --> 01:27:51,923
Humans have much more sophisticated
versions of the kinds of social

1207
01:27:51,923 --> 01:27:53,923
instincts you see in chimps
and other creatures.

1208
01:27:53,923 --> 01:27:58,426
But really there's no great leap. It's just...
If you can think of chimps as MS-DOS,

1209
01:27:58,427 --> 01:27:59,927
and humans as Windows 2000.

1210
01:28:12,332 --> 01:28:16,333
Religious believers like to claim that
their god and ancient texts

1211
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:21,335
provide them with an inside track to
defining what is good and what is bad.

1212
01:28:22,836 --> 01:28:27,339
But it is surely far more moral to do
good things for their own sake,

1213
01:28:27,339 --> 01:28:30,340
rather than as a way of sucking up to God.

1214
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:35,342
Our true sense of right and wrong
has nothing to do with religion.

1215
01:28:35,342 --> 01:28:40,344
I believe there is kindness, charity and
generosity in human nature.

1216
01:28:41,344 --> 01:28:45,346
And I think there is a Darwinian
explanation for this.

1217
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:54,350
Through much of our prehistory, humans lived
under conditions that favoured altruistic genes.

1218
01:28:54,851 --> 01:28:58,353
Gene survival depended on
nurturing our family

1219
01:28:58,354 --> 01:29:00,354
and on doing deals with our peers.

1220
01:29:01,356 --> 01:29:04,357
The 'I'll scratch your back if
you scratch mine' principle.

1221
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:09,360
I don't think we need
religion to explain morality.

1222
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:11,362
And if anything, it just gets in the way.

1223
01:29:11,363 --> 01:29:16,365
Morality is a lot older than religion.
Humans have an innate moral sense,

1224
01:29:17,366 --> 01:29:19,367
or a range of moral senses that
you could think of as

1225
01:29:19,368 --> 01:29:22,370
sophisticated versions of the
kind of social instincts you see

1226
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:24,372
in chimps and other social species.

1227
01:29:25,373 --> 01:29:29,375
What sort of morality or proto-
morality would you expect

1228
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:32,377
to find in a chimpanzee troupe?

1229
01:29:32,378 --> 01:29:36,380
We find that they live in family groups,
the mothers look after their kids,

1230
01:29:36,381 --> 01:29:40,382
they work in teams, and also
chimps are particularly good at

1231
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:44,385
competing for status through
what's been called public service.

1232
01:29:44,386 --> 01:29:47,387
So they compete for status not
just through brute force, but

1233
01:29:47,388 --> 01:29:52,391
by being good leaders, by
intervening to settle disputes...

1234
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:57,394
What are the main evolutionary reasons
for cooperating and being altruistic?

1235
01:29:57,395 --> 01:30:02,397
Working together often produces mutual
benefits for those that are involved, so

1236
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:07,400
you can often just do better by working in a
team than you can by working by yourself.

1237
01:30:12,403 --> 01:30:16,404
Perhaps it is our genetic inheritance
that explains why those of us with

1238
01:30:16,405 --> 01:30:20,408
no allegiance to a holy book or a pope or
an ayatollah to tell us what is good

1239
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:27,412
still manage to ground ourselves in a moral
consensus which is surprisingly widely agreed.

1240
01:30:32,415 --> 01:30:37,417
As social animals, we've worked out
that we wouldn't want to live in a society

1241
01:30:37,418 --> 01:30:41,419
where it was acceptable to rape,
murder or steal.

1242
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:44,421
We have a moral conscience
and a mutual empathy,

1243
01:30:45,423 --> 01:30:47,424
and it is constantly evolving.

1244
01:30:51,427 --> 01:30:54,428
Religious or not, we have changed in unison,

1245
01:30:54,429 --> 01:30:59,431
and continue to change in our attitude
to what is right and what is wrong.

1246
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:05,435
Fifty years ago, just about everybody
in Britain was somewhat racist.

1247
01:31:05,436 --> 01:31:07,436
Now only a few people are.

1248
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:13,440
Fifty years ago, it was impossible for
gay people to walk along the street

1249
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:16,443
hand in hand. Now it's easy.

1250
01:31:19,445 --> 01:31:22,446
Some of us lag behind the
advancing wave of moral standards,

1251
01:31:23,448 --> 01:31:25,448
and some of us are ahead.

1252
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:30,451
But all of us in the 21st century are ahead
of our counterparts from the time of

1253
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:33,453
Abraham, Mohammed or St Paul.

1254
01:31:38,456 --> 01:31:41,458
But progressive shift often emerges
in opposition to religion.

1255
01:31:42,459 --> 01:31:46,462
It's driven by improved education, and then
expressed by newspaper editorials,

1256
01:31:48,463 --> 01:31:49,464
television soap operas,

1257
01:31:50,465 --> 01:31:51,466
parliamentary speeches,

1258
01:31:52,467 --> 01:31:53,467
judicial rulings

1259
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:55,869
and novels.

1260
01:31:57,871 --> 01:32:01,873
I guess my starting point would be: The
brain is responsible for consciousness,

1261
01:32:01,874 --> 01:32:05,875
and we could be reasonably sure that
when that brain ceases to be,

1262
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:09,878
when it falls apart and decomposes,
that'll be the end of us.

1263
01:32:09,879 --> 01:32:13,881
From that, quite a lot of things
follow, I think especially morally.

1264
01:32:13,882 --> 01:32:19,885
We are the very priveleged owners of
a brief spark of consciousness,

1265
01:32:19,886 --> 01:32:21,886
and we therefore have to
take responsibility for it.

1266
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:27,890
You cannot rely - as Christians or
Moslems do - on a world elsewhere;

1267
01:32:27,891 --> 01:32:31,892
a paradise to which one can work towards and
maybe make sacrifices - and crucially,

1268
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:34,494
make sacrifices of other people.

1269
01:32:34,495 --> 01:32:39,497
We have a marvellous gift - and you see it
develop in children - this ability to

1270
01:32:39,498 --> 01:32:43,501
become aware that other people
have minds just like your own.

1271
01:32:43,502 --> 01:32:46,503
and feelings that are just as
important as your own.

1272
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:51,506
And this gift of empathy seems to me to be
the building block of our moral system.

1273
01:32:51,807 --> 01:32:55,509
I profoundly agree with you, and I've
always felt that one of the things

1274
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:59,511
that's wrong with religion is
that it teaches us to be satisfied

1275
01:32:59,512 --> 01:33:03,514
with answers which are
not really answers at all.

1276
01:33:03,515 --> 01:33:07,516
And if you have a sacred text that
tells you how the world began,

1277
01:33:07,517 --> 01:33:11,520
or what the relationship is
between this sky-god and you,

1278
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:17,323
it does curtail your curiosity.
It cuts off a source of wonder.

1279
01:33:17,324 --> 01:33:21,526
The loveliness of the world
in its wondrousness is not apparent

1280
01:33:21,527 --> 01:33:26,529
to me in Islam or Christianity and
all the other major religions.

1281
01:33:30,531 --> 01:33:35,033
To an atheist like Ian McEwan,
there is no all-seeing, all-loving God

1282
01:33:35,034 --> 01:33:36,535
who keeps us free from harm.

1283
01:33:37,537 --> 01:33:42,539
But atheism is not a recipe for despair.
I think the opposite.

1284
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:47,542
By disclaiming the idea of a next life, we
can take more excitement in this one.

1285
01:33:47,543 --> 01:33:50,544
The here and now is not
something to be endured

1286
01:33:50,545 --> 01:33:52,546
before eternal bliss or damnation.

1287
01:33:53,547 --> 01:33:57,549
The here and now is all we have; an
inspiration to make the most of it.

1288
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:03,552
So atheism is life-affirming, in a
way religion can never be.

1289
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:12,558
Look around you. Nature demands our
attention; begs us to explore; to question.

1290
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,562
Religion can provide only facile,
ultimately unsatisfying answers.

1291
01:34:20,563 --> 01:34:24,565
Science, in constantly
seeking real explanations,

1292
01:34:24,566 --> 01:34:28,567
reveals the true majesty of our
world in all its complexity.

1293
01:34:31,569 --> 01:34:37,573
People sometimes say, "There must be more
than just this world; than just this life."

1294
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:40,575
But how much more do you want?

1295
01:34:41,576 --> 01:34:45,578
We are going to die, and
that makes us the lucky ones.

1296
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:49,580
Most people are never going to die
because they're never going to be born.

1297
01:34:51,582 --> 01:34:55,584
The number of people who
could be here in my place

1298
01:34:56,585 --> 01:34:59,586
outnumber the sand grains of Sahara.

1299
01:34:59,587 --> 01:35:02,590
If you think about all the different ways
in which our genes could be permuted,

1300
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:08,593
you and I are quite grotesquely
lucky to be here.

1301
01:35:08,594 --> 01:35:11,595
The number of events that had to
happen in order for you to exist;

1302
01:35:11,596 --> 01:35:14,597
in order for me to exist.

1303
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:16,599
We are priveleged to be alive,

1304
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,602
and we should make the most
of our time on this world.
