1
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:43,449
Get up, get up!

2
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,803
Mixed up in that beating on 12th Street?

3
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,120
No, plain drunkenness.

4
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:52,811
It says he was picked up there.

5
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,247
They had him on the carpet
down at headquarters.

6
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,363
He's clear. Plain drunkenness.

7
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:58,527
All right.

8
00:01:59,012 --> 00:01:59,922
Fill it up.

9
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:01,206
Can I keep it?

10
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,804
Okay. You want to lean him
against something?

11
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:07,482
- Stand him over there.
- Come on.

12
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:25,807
Judy?

13
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,845
We're ready for you now.

14
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,365
He must hate me.

15
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:47,527
What?

16
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,284
He hates me.

17
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,045
What makes you think so?

18
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,402
I don't think. I know.

19
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,605
He looks at me like...

20
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,640
...I was the ugliest thing in the world.

21
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,364
He doesn't like my friends.

22
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:08,767
He doesn't like one thing about me.

23
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,249
And he called me...

24
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,881
He called me a dirty tramp!

25
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,843
My own father!

26
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:22,324
Do you think he really means that?

27
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:23,925
Yes!

28
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,400
No!

29
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,730
I don't know.

30
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,562
I mean, maybe he doesn't mean it...

31
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,922
...but he acts like he does.

32
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:39,804
We were all together.

33
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:42,846
And we were going to celebrate Easter.

34
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,360
And we were going to catch a double bill.

35
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:49,406
Big deal!

36
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,602
So I put on my new dress...

37
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:55,484
...and I came out...

38
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,363
...and he grabbed my face...

39
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:02,249
...and he started rubbing off all the lipstick.

40
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,802
I thought he'd rub off my lips.

41
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,002
And I ran out of that house.

42
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,732
Is that why you were
wandering around at 1:00 a. m?

43
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:18,651
Not looking for company?

44
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:23,005
I don't even know why I do it.

45
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,562
Maybe you get back at your dad that way.

46
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:28,450
If you're not as close to him
as you'd like to be...

47
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,924
...maybe this is one way
of making him pay attention.

48
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,360
Did you think of that?

49
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:37,445
I'll never get close to anybody.

50
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:40,363
Would you go home if we can arrange it?

51
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,684
What's your number, Judy?

52
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:50,441
We'll ask your dad
to come and pick you up.

53
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:53,047
Unless you really don't want to go home.

54
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,124
Would you rather stay here?

55
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,847
Lexington 0-5-5-4-9.

56
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,168
That's enough static out of you!

57
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:34,288
Cut it out now. I'm warning you!

58
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,924
You're shivering, John. Are you cold?

59
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,525
Want my jacket?

60
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,205
Want my jacket?

61
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:57,885
It's warm.

62
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,410
Your mother will pick you up.

63
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:15,488
What?

64
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,962
Your mother will be down to pick you up.

65
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,440
My mother!

66
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:21,324
She's being called for.

67
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,762
You said you'd call my father!

68
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,608
Goodbye, Judy. And take it easy.

69
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,360
Oh, sure!

70
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:42,882
John Crawford?

71
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:43,927
Yes, sir?

72
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:45,725
Come with me, John.

73
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,167
Jim!

74
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,445
Happy Easter.

75
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,645
Happy Easter.

76
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,690
Where were you tonight?

77
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:12,247
They called us,
and I got the fright of my life!

78
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,288
Where were you tonight, Jimbo?

79
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:25,643
Well, then, there now.

80
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:28,768
Were you having a ball, Dad?

81
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,401
Well, everybody's been having a ball.

82
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:39,528
You're the king of the ball, Dad.

83
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,964
You think I'm funny?

84
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,168
Why didn't you take my jacket?

85
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,046
Jim Stark?

86
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:17,647
John.

87
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,687
John!

88
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,485
Do you have any idea
why you shot those puppies?

89
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:30,691
Is that what they call you,
or do you have a nickname?

90
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:32,448
Plato.

91
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,529
He was a Greek philosopher.

92
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:39,247
You talk nice to the man now, hear?
He's going to help you.

93
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,325
Nobody can help me.

94
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,921
Can you tell me why
you killed those puppies?

95
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:47,601
No, sir.

96
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,603
Where'd you get the gun?

97
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:54,286
My mother's drawer.

98
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,043
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?

99
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:58,688
She's away.

100
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:01,048
She's always going away somewhere.

101
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:04,449
She's got a sister in Chicago,
and she's there for the holiday.

102
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,041
Where's your father?

103
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,804
They're not together, sir.

104
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,680
We haven't seen him now in a long time.

105
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,251
Do you ever hear from him?

106
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,808
I don't think it's right for a mother
to go and leave her child.

107
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:18,889
It's his birthday today, sir.

108
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,167
Did the boy ever talk to a psychiatrist?

109
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,411
You mean a head shrinker?

110
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,720
Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them, sir.

111
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,369
Maybe she'd better start.

112
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:34,648
Sit over there for just a minute, please.

113
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:43,808
I don't see what's so bad
about taking a little drink.

114
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,405
You don't?

115
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,687
He's a minor...

116
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,525
...and it looks like he had more
than a "little drink."

117
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,725
Don't hum, dear.

118
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,891
I cut loose pretty good in my day too.

119
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,127
Really, Frank?

120
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:57,527
When was that?

121
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,568
Can't you wait till we get home?

122
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:00,761
How about you?

123
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,809
Got anything to say for yourself?

124
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,366
Not interested?

125
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,484
Can't you answer?

126
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,045
What's the matter with you?

127
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,724
He's just loaded, honey.

128
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:12,968
I was talking to Jim!

129
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:17,006
Well, I'd like to just explain.
You see, we just moved here...

130
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,772
...and the kid hasn't got any friends.

131
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:21,405
Tell him why we moved here.

132
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:22,800
Will you hold it?

133
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,445
Tell the man why we moved.

134
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,682
- Will you hold it!
- You can't protect me.

135
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:31,244
Do you mind if I try? Do you
have to slam the door in my face?

136
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:34,764
I try to get to him. What happens?

137
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:37,964
I buy you everything you want.
A bicycle? You get it!

138
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,208
- A car...
- You buy me many things.

139
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,448
Not just buying!

140
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,643
We give you love and affection, don't we?

141
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:46,006
Then what is it?

142
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,089
Was it because we went to that party?

143
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:52,126
You know what kind of drunken brawls
those kind of parties turn into.

144
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,681
It's no place for kids!

145
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:56,366
A minute ago,
you said you didn't care if he drinks.

146
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,369
He said a "little" drink.

147
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,570
You're tearing me apart!

148
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,846
You say one thing, he says another,
and everybody changes back again!

149
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,011
That's a fine way to behave!

150
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,481
Well, you know who he takes after.

151
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:18,965
Inside, Jim.

152
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:21,442
Come on.

153
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:22,847
Inside.

154
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,288
- Excuse us a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

155
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,005
Somebody ought to put poison
in her Epsom salts.

156
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:36,607
Grandma?

157
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,846
Get lost.

158
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,721
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.

159
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,442
Why don't you wash up and go home?

160
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,445
This is cute.

161
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,323
Big, tough character!

162
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,729
You don't kid me, pal.

163
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,408
How come you're not wearing your boots?

164
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,611
Well, that's cute.

165
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,161
That's cute.

166
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,003
It's too bad you didn't connect.

167
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,688
You could have gone to juvenile hall.

168
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,724
That's what you want, isn't it?

169
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,446
Sure, it is.

170
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:34,046
You want to bug us
till we have to lock you up.

171
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,522
Why?

172
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,290
- Leave me alone.
- No.

173
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:40,401
I don't know why.

174
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,130
Go on, don't give me that!

175
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,366
Please, lock me up. I'll hit somebody.
I'll do something, and I don't...

176
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,921
Try the desk.

177
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:54,847
Go ahead.

178
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,725
Is that why you moved?
You were in trouble?

179
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:36,525
No, they think...

180
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:41,563
...that they can protect me
by moving around all the time.

181
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:45,687
You had a good start in the wrong
direction. Why'd you do it?

182
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,441
What do you mean?

183
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,891
Mess a kid up?

184
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,246
He called me chicken.

185
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,370
Your folks didn't understand?

186
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:03,845
They never do.

187
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:11,001
They think that I can make friends...

188
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,087
...if we move.

189
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:20,643
Just move. Everything
will be roses and sunshine.

190
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:23,322
But you don't think
that's the right solution?

191
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,372
She eats him alive and he takes it.

192
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:31,643
Things pretty rough for you at home?

193
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,367
That's a zoo!

194
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:35,807
What?

195
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:38,691
That's a zoo!

196
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,686
I mean, he always wants to be my pal,
you know?

197
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,171
But how can I give him anything if he's...

198
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:54,487
I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.

199
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,090
I don't want to hurt him.

200
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,002
But then I don't know what to do anymore.

201
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,407
Except maybe die.

202
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,287
If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...

203
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,649
...then maybe she'd be happy
and she'd stop picking on him.

204
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,721
Because they make mush out of him!

205
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,245
You know, just mush!

206
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:24,768
I'll tell you one thing,
I don't ever want to be like him.

207
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,448
Chicken?

208
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:29,761
I'll bet you see right through me,
don't you?

209
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,925
How can a guy grow up
in a circus like that?

210
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:38,685
Beats me, Jim.

211
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,166
But they do.

212
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,760
Want some water?

213
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:51,162
If I had one day...

214
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:58,600
...when I didn't have to be all confused...

215
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:03,842
...and I didn't have to feel
that I was ashamed of everything...

216
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,922
If I felt that I belonged someplace...

217
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,884
You know? Then...

218
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:16,443
Will you do something for me?

219
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:23,284
If the pot starts boiling again,
will you see me before you get in a jam?

220
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:27,284
If you want to talk,
come in and shoot the breeze.

221
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,520
It's easier sometimes
than talking to your folks.

222
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,003
Anytime, night or day.

223
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:47,886
You calmed down enough
to go back in there now?

224
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:51,970
Are you serious?

225
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:00,766
Mother, I'm sorry.

226
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,729
It's all right, darling.

227
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,286
Mister Officer...

228
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:06,528
...this was all very unfortunate.

229
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,367
He made a mistake, and he's sorry,
so we won't have any more trouble.

230
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,962
He was always a lovely boy.

231
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:16,608
Grandmother, you tell one more lie
and you'll turn to stone.

232
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,007
Look, Jim...

233
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,361
...don't forget.

234
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,202
Have some cigars?

235
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,405
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

236
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:28,965
Give them to your friends.

237
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,371
No, thanks, Mr. Stark.

238
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:32,443
Frank, he doesn't want any.

239
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,891
Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.

240
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:47,890
Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.

241
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:49,727
Beau!

242
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,405
Come here, Beau!

243
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,491
Beau, come on!

244
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:02,482
I don't think I want anything.

245
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:04,847
I'm nervous.

246
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,731
My first day of school,
Mother made me eat so much...

247
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:09,650
...I couldn't swallow until recess.

248
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:11,605
Did you fix any sandwiches?

249
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,043
There's meatloaf and peanut butter...

250
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,642
What did I tell you? Peanut butter.

251
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,849
There's a thermos of orange juice...

252
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,122
...and some applesauce cake to go with it.

253
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:27,606
And I baked it.

254
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:34,521
Goodbye, Mom.

255
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:38,407
Young fellow, you knock them dead
like your old man used to.

256
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,245
You know what I think?

257
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,886
I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.

258
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:47,171
Listen, watch out
about choosing your pals.

259
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,771
Don't let them choose you.

260
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:04,607
Wait a minute.

261
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,046
I've seen you before.

262
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,011
- Stop the world!
- You don't have to be unfriendly.

263
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,764
Well, now that's true.

264
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,248
But life is crushing in on me.

265
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,602
Life can be beautiful.

266
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:31,685
- I know where it was.
- Where what was?

267
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,770
Where I first saw you.

268
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,323
Everything going okay now?

269
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,645
You live here, don't you?

270
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:43,720
Who lives?

271
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:46,170
Hey, where's Dawson High?

272
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:48,169
At University and Tenth.

273
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:49,688
Thanks.

274
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,124
You want to carry my books?

275
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:56,566
I got my car. You want to go with me?

276
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,490
I go with the kids.

277
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,362
I'll bet.

278
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,367
All right.

279
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:15,122
You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.

280
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,444
I love you too.

281
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:29,521
What's that?

282
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,251
- That's a new disease.
- Friend of yours?

283
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,568
- Glad they let you out.
- Nobody chickened.

284
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:40,846
- You're lucky he lived.
- They always live.

285
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,804
Man, I'm living!

286
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:48,328
Hey, which way to University and Tenth?

287
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:51,171
Which way is it to University and Tenth?

288
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:53,727
- It's that way!
- No, it's that way!

289
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:53,241
Hey, watch it!

290
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,849
Where do you think you're going?

291
00:21:57,252 --> 00:22:00,528
You stepped on the school insignia.
Nobody does that, ever!

292
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,563
I'm sorry. It's my first day here...

293
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,608
...and nobody told me about it.

294
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,530
- I'm very sorry.
- It's okay.

295
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:07,926
Know where to report?

296
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,567
Mr. Bassett.

297
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:13,606
Room 208. He'll show you where to go.

298
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:15,131
I'm sorry about that.

299
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:17,084
Just watch it next time.

300
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:35,322
...and immensity of our universe.

301
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,960
For many days
before the end of our Earth...

302
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:41,449
...people will look
into the night sky and notice a star...

303
00:23:41,652 --> 00:23:44,485
...increasingly bright and increasingly near.

304
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,444
As this star approaches us...

305
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,441
Jim Stark.

306
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,250
I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

307
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:55,290
As this star approaches us,
the weather will change.

308
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:59,685
The great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide.

309
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:02,201
And the seas will turn warmer.

310
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,644
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed.

311
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,207
For the stars will still be there...

312
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:10,767
...moving through their ancient rhythms.

313
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,965
The familiar constellations
that illuminate our night...

314
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,122
...will seem as they have always seemed:

315
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:19,090
Eternal, unchanged and little moved...

316
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:22,523
...by the shortness of time
between our planet's birth and demise.

317
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:25,804
Orion, the hunter.

318
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,570
One of Ptolemy's constellations...

319
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,882
...and the most brilliant in the heavens.

320
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:30,848
Boy!

321
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:34,207
What?

322
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:37,285
I was just thinking that...

323
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:40,245
...once you've been up there
you know you been some place.

324
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:45,365
<i>Gesundheit!</i>

325
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:48,249
They're almost equal in brilliancy.

326
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,564
Cancer, the crab...

327
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:56,050
...containing a large, loose cluster of stars,
called Praesepe or the Beehive.

328
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,811
I'm a crab!

329
00:25:01,052 --> 00:25:03,612
The sun can be vertically overhead.

330
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,403
Taurus, the bull.

331
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:19,045
That's real funny.

332
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:22,446
A comedian, Buzz.

333
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,247
He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.

334
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:27,490
I bet he fights cows.

335
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:36,729
You shouldn't monkey with him.

336
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,649
- He's a wheel.
- Who?

337
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:40,921
Buzz.

338
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,851
So is she.

339
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,201
It's hard to make friends with these guys.

340
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:50,130
I don't want to make friends.

341
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:53,484
And while the flash of our beginning...

342
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:56,644
...has not yet traveled
the light years into distance...

343
00:25:56,852 --> 00:26:00,606
...has not yet been seen by planets
deep within the other galaxies...

344
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:04,481
...we will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we came...

345
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:09,004
...destroyed as we began,
in a burst of gas and fire.

346
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,683
The heavens are still and cold once more.

347
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:35,445
In all the immensity of our universe
and the galaxies beyond...

348
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:37,643
...the Earth will not be missed.

349
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:39,928
Through the infinite reaches of space...

350
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,482
...the problems of man seem
trivial and naive indeed.

351
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:46,965
And man, existing alone...

352
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,970
...seems himself an episode
of little consequence.

353
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:51,760
That's all.

354
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,248
Thank you for your attention.

355
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,124
Thank you very much.

356
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,809
May I have your attention?
May I please have your attention?

357
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:06,846
Classes will meet at the busses outside.
May I have your attention?

358
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:09,088
May I have your attention?

359
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:10,845
Oh, what the heck!

360
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,044
It's all over. The world ended.

361
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:31,368
What does he know about man alone?

362
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,163
Certainly is a lot of switches.

363
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:52,084
Yeah, quite intricate.

364
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:55,724
- Hey, what's for kicks?
- What do you say, Buzz?

365
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:57,490
Well, what do you want to do?

366
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,407
- How about Moo?
- You mean the guy in there?

367
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,364
- The comedian.
- What do you say?

368
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,042
All right! What do you want to do?

369
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,890
Let's bring him down.

370
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:08,845
He'd make a good pigeon.

371
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,927
- What's the funny guy doing?
- The guy in back of us, Buzz.

372
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:15,407
He ought to have his wardrobe
cleaned and burned.

373
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:17,608
- All right, Moo.
- All right.

374
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:20,922
- What will we do with him?
- Don't worry.

375
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,646
I'll figure out what we'll do with him.

376
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:26,363
Relax. He'll figure it out.

377
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:06,971
What are you looking at?

378
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,881
Nothing.

379
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:23,842
I told you not to fool with those guys.
Now they're laying for you.

380
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,571
If you don't want trouble,
I know where we can go.

381
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:27,921
It's a big mansion.

382
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:35,560
There it is.

383
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,322
We could sneak around
and they wouldn't know.

384
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:41,085
- Who lives there?
- Nobody lives there.

385
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:42,965
Come on, let's go!

386
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:45,648
There he is.

387
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:57,642
That's his car.

388
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:44,280
Relax, man.

389
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,445
- You know something?
- No, what?

390
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,443
You read too many comic books.

391
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:52,921
Well, he's real abstract! He's different.

392
00:31:53,092 --> 00:31:54,411
That's right.

393
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,730
I'm cute too.

394
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,525
Is that meaning me?

395
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:05,405
- Is that meaning me?
- What?

396
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:06,806
Chicken!

397
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:08,328
Yes.

398
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,531
You shouldn't call me that.

399
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,245
How about you?

400
00:32:24,172 --> 00:32:26,128
Are you always at ringside?

401
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:29,561
What are you hanging around
such rank company for?

402
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,162
What?

403
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,685
I don't want any trouble.

404
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,524
The blade game, Buzz?

405
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:48,202
I thought only punks fought with knives.

406
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,045
Who's fighting?

407
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:52,686
No fighting. It's examination time, man.

408
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:54,962
It's a crazy game.

409
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,646
Get him a knife.

410
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,486
Give it to him.

411
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:05,125
Come on, give him a knife.

412
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:07,283
- Pick it up!
- I don't want any trouble.

413
00:33:07,972 --> 00:33:08,848
Pick it up!

414
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:15,961
Pick it up!

415
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:24,884
Now, you understand the action?

416
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:27,049
There's no sticking.

417
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,360
Crunch?

418
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,168
Just...

419
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:37,041
...a little jabbing. That's all.

420
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:40,203
What's the matter?

421
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:43,331
What's the matter?

422
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:47,047
What're you waiting on, toreador?
I thought you wanted a little action.

423
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:52,730
- Are you crumb chicken or...
- Don't call me that!

424
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:56,887
<i>Toro!</i>

425
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,041
Cut off a button and
you get to join the club.

426
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:39,446
Oh, that's close!

427
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,404
Look out, Buzz! He's got a chain!

428
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,647
Dr. Minton!

429
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:08,611
All right, you asked for it, you've got it.

430
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,324
- What is it?
- Trouble.

431
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,568
Are you satisfied or
do you want some more?

432
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,005
There's your audience.

433
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:23,486
I don't think so.

434
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,002
Let's split, Buzz.

435
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,606
Split for what?
A couple of old poopheads?

436
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:34,688
Now, you say the word and you're dead.

437
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,401
You're cold.

438
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:39,206
I'll meet you someplace,
but not with those things.

439
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:41,450
That's trouble.

440
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:46,930
How then? You know the Millertown bluff?

441
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,640
The bluff?
Hey, Buzz, that's dangerous up there.

442
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:54,890
Cookie, get some cars, and we'll have
some kicks tonight about 8:00.

443
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:56,810
- All right.
- We'll have a chickie-run.

444
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,041
Sounds good. Fine.

445
00:35:58,252 --> 00:36:00,004
You ever been in a chickie-run?

446
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,525
That's all I ever do.

447
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:05,607
Come on, all of you. Start moving!

448
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:06,927
Come on, get going.

449
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:09,082
Oh, you don't mean little old us?

450
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,561
What's the matter with the nice man?

451
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,809
We were just cutting out!

452
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:16,721
Eight o'clock?

453
00:36:17,132 --> 00:36:18,531
Yeah.

454
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,001
Okay.

455
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:33,561
Plato, what is a chickie-run?

456
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:05,561
Mom?

457
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:10,971
Hi, Jimbo. You thought I was Mom?

458
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:14,648
Yeah.

459
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,322
Well, the girl's out.
I was getting Mom some supper.

460
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,648
She doesn't feel too well.

461
00:37:22,692 --> 00:37:24,125
What'd you do, drop it?

462
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:25,727
You dropped it?

463
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:34,291
- That's funny.
- I know it.

464
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:37,967
- I'll clean up before she sees it.
- Let her see it.

465
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,567
Let her see it!

466
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:44,444
What can happen? She's...

467
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:50,207
Dad?

468
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:05,564
Stand. Don't...

469
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:08,043
I mean, you shouldn't...

470
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:19,801
Beau?

471
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,881
Daddy?

472
00:38:27,212 --> 00:38:28,884
Haven't you forgotten something?

473
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:33,571
What's the matter with you?

474
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,566
You're too old for that stuff.
I thought you'd stopped that long ago.

475
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:41,371
I didn't want to stop.

476
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:44,646
- Didn't want to stop what?
- Nothing, nothing.

477
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:46,401
I was talking to Dad.

478
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:49,086
I didn't kiss her, so it's a big thing.

479
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,803
Bertha, you may serve the soufflé.

480
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,331
It's fish soufflé.

481
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,727
You don't have to stand, darling.
Sit down and have your tomato juice.

482
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,366
I guess I just don't understand anything.

483
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:05,571
I'm tired. I'd like to change the subject.

484
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:07,281
Why?

485
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,244
I'd just like to, that's all!

486
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:12,842
Girls your age don't do things like that!
You need an explanation?

487
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:14,891
Hi, rascal!

488
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:17,770
Girls don't love their father?

489
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,486
Since when?

490
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:21,644
Since I got to be 1<i>6</i>?

491
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:24,609
Stop that! Sit down!

492
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,483
May I please be excused?

493
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:36,611
Hey, glamour puss!

494
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:39,725
I'm sorry. We'll break the date.
We'll stay home.

495
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:41,811
This isn't my home!

496
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:51,805
I don't know what to do.

497
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,327
All of a sudden she's a problem.

498
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,929
She'll outgrow it, dear. It's just the age.

499
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,645
The atomic age!

500
00:40:05,692 --> 00:40:08,365
It's just the age when nothing fits.

501
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:22,681
Hey, Jimbo?

502
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:26,926
- You awake?
- Dad?

503
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,285
Can I ask you something?

504
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:30,971
Sure.

505
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:34,762
Shoot.

506
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,369
Suppose you had to do something.

507
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,045
You had to go someplace...

508
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,088
...and do this thing that was...

509
00:40:45,732 --> 00:40:47,768
...you know, it was very dangerous.

510
00:40:48,892 --> 00:40:50,962
But it was a matter of honor.

511
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:54,924
And you had to prove it.

512
00:40:55,612 --> 00:40:56,761
What would you do?

513
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:00,929
Well, is there some kind of trick answer?

514
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:03,443
No, what would you do?

515
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:07,005
Well, I wouldn't make a hasty decision.

516
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:08,600
Tell you what, Jimbo.

517
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:11,645
Let's get a little light on the subject.

518
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:20,961
Blood.

519
00:41:23,652 --> 00:41:25,085
Jim, what happened?

520
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,720
What kind of trouble are you in?

521
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:33,490
The kind I was telling you about.
Now can you answer me?

522
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:37,402
Nobody can make a snap decision.

523
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:39,927
It's one of those things that you...
You can't.

524
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:41,690
That's all there is to it.

525
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:44,921
It's something that you... You just don't.

526
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,289
We've got to consider
all the pros and cons.

527
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:54,045
I don't have time.

528
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,440
We'll make time.

529
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:57,563
I'll get paper and we'll make a list.

530
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,529
And then if we're still stuck...

531
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:02,128
...we'll get some advice.

532
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:09,327
What can you do
when you have to be a man?

533
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:10,807
Well...

534
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:13,483
No, you give me a direct answer!

535
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,808
Are you going to keep me from going?

536
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:18,328
Did I ever stop you from anything?

537
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:20,445
You're at a wonderful age.

538
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:23,444
In ten years, you'll look back
on this and wish...

539
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:25,051
Ten years?

540
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:29,000
I want an answer now. I need one.

541
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:34,204
Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying
to show you how foolish you are.

542
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:37,324
When you're older,
you'll look back at this...

543
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:39,488
...and you'll laugh at yourself...

544
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:42,689
...for thinking that this is so important.

545
00:42:43,332 --> 00:42:45,243
It's not as if you were alone.

546
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:48,046
This has happened to every boy.

547
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,645
It happened to me when I was your age,
maybe a year older.

548
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,200
What's all the excitement?

549
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:00,886
I've been working hard
getting this house in order...

550
00:43:00,972 --> 00:43:02,371
Jim had blood on him.

551
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:05,370
- He just ran out.
- And you didn't stop him?

552
00:43:54,372 --> 00:43:55,930
Hey, Chicken Little!

553
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:58,202
Where's toreador? He beg off?

554
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,408
He's not scared of you.

555
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:06,247
- There he is.
- Over there, man.

556
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:13,600
- How did you get here?
- I hitched.

557
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:17,525
I bet you'd go to a hanging, wouldn't you?

558
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:20,200
I guess it's just my morbid personality.

559
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:23,041
Should I leave?

560
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:24,406
No, it's okay.

561
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:42,162
Come on. Let's go see what we're driving.

562
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:53,730
No, just him.

563
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,729
It's okay. Stay here.

564
00:44:58,452 --> 00:45:00,329
What did you say your name was?

565
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:02,731
Jim Stark.

566
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:05,287
Yeah, I'm Buzz Gunderson.

567
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:09,884
I got some goodies for you.

568
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:11,644
You got a flashlight?

569
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,804
Is he a friend of yours?

570
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,083
Yeah, he's my best friend.

571
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:26,851
What's he like?

572
00:45:29,892 --> 00:45:31,405
I don't know.

573
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:33,570
You have to get to know him.

574
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,885
He doesn't say much.

575
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:38,208
But when he does, you know he means it.

576
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:39,891
He's sincere.

577
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,604
Well, that's the main thing.

578
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:45,082
- You want to flip?
- Yeah, go ahead.

579
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:49,207
Heads.

580
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:55,566
Maybe next summer, he'll take me
hunting with him. And fishing.

581
00:45:56,372 --> 00:46:00,047
I want him to teach me because
I know he won't get mad if I goof.

582
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,366
His name's Jim.

583
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:05,644
It's really James, but he likes Jim more.

584
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:10,243
And people he really likes,
he lets them call him Jamie.

585
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:12,081
Jamie?

586
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:14,765
Try the doors.

587
00:46:18,052 --> 00:46:19,804
Hey, try it with the jump.

588
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:47,450
That's the edge.

589
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:49,881
That's the end.

590
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:55,325
Certainly is.

591
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:00,405
You know something?

592
00:47:02,892 --> 00:47:04,371
I like you.

593
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:07,051
You know that?

594
00:47:08,812 --> 00:47:10,211
Why do we do this?

595
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,448
You got to do something...

596
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:14,125
...now, don't you?

597
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,489
Take them up all the way to the end.

598
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,045
Get all the girls!

599
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:54,564
Bring it up to the left side.

600
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:00,803
Crunch, line them up!

601
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:04,130
Go to the end and
bring your cars up on the right.

602
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:06,442
Put your car on the left-hand side.

603
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:08,847
Turn your lights in toward the center.

604
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,371
Let's line them up!

605
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:11,965
Moose, come here.

606
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:15,329
Straighten them out.
Tell them when to turn on their lights.

607
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,891
Johnny!

608
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:19,526
Follow that dark roadster over there.

609
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,328
You're okay?

610
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,766
Give me some dirt.

611
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,605
Hey, toreador!

612
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:46,041
She signals...

613
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:48,043
...we head for the edge.

614
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:50,688
And the first man who jumps is a chicken.

615
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:52,446
All right?

616
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:14,960
Me too.

617
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,767
May I have some dirt, please?

618
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,289
Hit your lights!

619
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:32,042
Where's Buzz?

620
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,565
Down there.

621
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:40,931
Let's get out of here!

622
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:49,041
Down there.

623
00:51:49,252 --> 00:51:51,049
Down there is Buzz!

624
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,005
This is fine.

625
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,291
You'll be all right?

626
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:22,330
You want to see a monkey?

627
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,244
Want to come home with me?
There's nobody at my house.

628
00:53:58,452 --> 00:54:00,522
Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

629
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:03,007
I don't have too many people I can talk to.

630
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:04,565
Who has?

631
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:06,969
If you want to come, we could talk...

632
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,811
...then we could have breakfast,
like my dad used to.

633
00:54:09,892 --> 00:54:11,644
If only you could've been my dad...

634
00:54:11,732 --> 00:54:13,085
You flipped or something?

635
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,361
Look.

636
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:18,601
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

637
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:21,526
I've got to pick up my scooter anyway,
you know.

638
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:22,926
I know.

639
00:54:28,052 --> 00:54:29,405
See you tomorrow.

640
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:58,562
Hello, little cute sister.

641
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:03,646
Hello, darling, baby-pie,
glamour puss, sweetie.

642
00:55:08,612 --> 00:55:10,204
You belong in bed.

643
00:56:50,692 --> 00:56:52,125
He's home!

644
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:53,891
You're home!

645
00:57:00,412 --> 00:57:01,401
You're home.

646
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:03,210
Are you all right?

647
00:57:03,412 --> 00:57:05,289
Where were you? We were so worried.

648
00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:09,247
I wouldn't take a sleeping pill
till you were home.

649
00:57:09,332 --> 00:57:12,130
Can I talk to you guys?
I have to talk to somebody.

650
00:57:17,412 --> 00:57:19,801
You better give me an answer this time.

651
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:21,405
Go ahead.

652
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:23,569
A direct answer.

653
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,204
I'm in trouble.

654
00:57:26,452 --> 00:57:29,046
You know that big,
high bluff near Millertown?

655
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:31,049
Yes, there was a bad accident there.

656
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:34,289
They showed the pictures on television.

657
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:36,127
I was in it.

658
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,167
How can you...

659
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,840
It doesn't matter how.
I was driving a stolen car.

660
00:57:39,932 --> 00:57:43,720
That's a fine thing! Do you enjoy
doing this to me, or what?

661
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,730
- You wanted him to make a list!
- Let him tell it!

662
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:48,411
She doesn't care!

663
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:51,809
You remember how I almost died
giving birth to him?

664
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:55,084
- And then you say I don't care!
- Please relax, relax!

665
00:58:00,132 --> 00:58:01,167
Dad...

666
00:58:02,132 --> 00:58:04,930
...I said it was a matter of honor.

667
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:06,447
Remember?

668
00:58:09,412 --> 00:58:11,164
They called me chicken.

669
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:15,161
You know? Chicken?

670
00:58:19,492 --> 00:58:20,971
I had to go.

671
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:33,403
If I didn't, I'd never be able
to face those kids again.

672
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:40,328
I got in one of those cars...

673
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,929
...and Buzz, one of those kids,
he got in the other car...

674
00:58:44,132 --> 00:58:46,362
...and we had to drive fast...

675
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:49,331
...and then jump before the car
came to the edge.

676
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,966
And I got out okay and Buzz didn't.

677
00:58:54,772 --> 00:58:56,444
And it killed him.

678
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:58,523
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

679
00:58:58,692 --> 00:59:00,489
You just get it off your chest.

680
00:59:00,692 --> 00:59:03,206
That is not what I mean!

681
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:07,400
I have never done anything right.

682
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:10,843
I've been going around with
my head in a sling for years.

683
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:14,723
I don't want to drag you into this,
but I can't help it.

684
00:59:14,932 --> 00:59:16,365
You see, I think...

685
00:59:17,572 --> 00:59:22,202
...you can't just go around proving
things and pretending like you're tough.

686
00:59:22,412 --> 00:59:23,367
That's right.

687
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:26,530
And even though you got to
look a certain way...

688
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:29,246
- You're absolutely right!
- You look, you feel...

689
00:59:29,452 --> 00:59:31,647
You're not listening to me!

690
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:34,771
You're involved in this, just like I am!

691
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:39,004
I'm going to the police
and telling them I'm involved.

692
00:59:39,172 --> 00:59:40,321
Did anyone see you?

693
00:59:40,532 --> 00:59:43,285
- Did anyone see your license plate?
- I don't know!

694
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,528
Will the others go to the police?

695
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:47,643
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

696
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:50,764
- Why be the only one involved?
- Far be it from me...

697
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:53,532
Do we have to listen to a sermon now?

698
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:55,529
I'm telling him what you mean.

699
00:59:55,732 --> 00:59:59,088
You can't be idealistic all your life.
Nobody thanks you for...

700
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:02,204
- Except to yourself!
- Wait a minute!

701
01:00:02,372 --> 01:00:03,964
Except yourself.

702
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:06,846
You don't want me to go?

703
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:10,207
No, I don't want you to go to the police.

704
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,761
Why should you be the only one involved?

705
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:16,647
But I am involved! We are all involved!

706
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:21,409
A boy, a kid was killed tonight!

707
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:24,811
I can't get out of it and
pretend it didn't happen!

708
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:27,970
Well, you know
that you did the wrong thing.

709
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:30,487
- That's the main thing.
- That's nothing.

710
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:33,331
That is absolutely nothing. Dad, you said...

711
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:36,683
...you want me to tell the truth.
Didn't you say that?

712
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:42,331
You can't turn it off.

713
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:46,161
He's not saying that.
He's saying just don't volunteer!

714
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:48,604
Just tell a little white lie.

715
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:51,605
You'll learn! When you're older, Jim.

716
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:55,449
Well, I don't think
that I want to learn that way.

717
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,291
It doesn't matter anyway,
because we're moving!

718
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:00,285
Don't tear me loose again.

719
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:03,012
- Just why are we moving?
- Must I spell it out?

720
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:05,811
- You won't use me as an excuse again!
- I don't!

721
01:01:06,012 --> 01:01:08,128
When you can't face yourself
you blame me!

722
01:01:08,292 --> 01:01:09,691
That is not true!

723
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,926
You say it's because of me
or the neighborhood!

724
01:01:13,092 --> 01:01:15,686
You use every other phony excuse!

725
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:19,443
Mom, I just...
Once, I want to do something right!

726
01:01:19,652 --> 01:01:22,485
And I don't want you
to run away from me again!

727
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:29,167
- This is all going too fast.
- You better give me something.

728
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:31,442
You better give me something fast.

729
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:33,210
Jimmy, you're very young.

730
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,972
A foolish decision now
could wreck your whole life!

731
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:39,323
- In ten years you won't know it happened.
- Dad, answer her.

732
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:42,246
Tell her.

733
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:45,405
Ten years.

734
01:01:47,612 --> 01:01:49,762
Dad, let me hear you answer her.

735
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,123
Dad, stand up for me.

736
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:17,085
Stand up!

737
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:20,127
You'll kill him!

738
01:02:22,852 --> 01:02:24,046
You're killing him!

739
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:26,210
You want to kill your own father?

740
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:05,884
- See how they brought us in like that?
- Let go of me!

741
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,162
You want a good crack in the mouth?

742
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,567
Take it easy, Ed. The boy's on edge.

743
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:13,201
- Come on.
- He shouldn't talk to me that way.

744
01:03:13,412 --> 01:03:15,368
After all, I am his father.

745
01:03:15,932 --> 01:03:18,287
This place appeal to you or something?

746
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:28,362
- What's he going to pull?
- Nothing, Crunch.

747
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:31,769
- Did you see any cops with him?
- He was pulled in like us.

748
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,323
Hey, excuse me.
Can you tell me where I can find...

749
01:03:36,332 --> 01:03:38,721
I forgot his name.
He works in the juvenile...

750
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:40,126
Can't you see I'm writing?

751
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,306
He's going to tell, man. I know.

752
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:46,902
Nobody arrested him.

753
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,829
I think I better go home.

754
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,588
Hey, wait, man.

755
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,108
We'll have some kicks, huh?

756
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,623
- Crunch, my father...
- We'll bring him down.

757
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,149
What do you say?

758
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,742
You're going to clobber him?

759
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,905
What, are you out of your mind? Come on.

760
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,062
- What I could write about you...
- I remember his name.

761
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,982
- What's the charge?
- Assault.

762
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,506
- His name is Ray. I'd like to see him.
- He's not here.

763
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,143
He's not in Juvenile Hall.

764
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,308
I don't know where he is.
He'll be out all night.

765
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,505
How old are you?

766
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,703
My parents know I'm here.
They know I'm out here.

767
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,660
Come back in the morning, will you?

768
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,383
Well, can I wait?

769
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,107
Have you ever been booked before?

770
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,069
Solid.

771
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,625
Hello?

772
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,378
Who wants her?

773
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:11,105
Who?

774
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,149
Jim who?

775
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,223
I never heard of you!

776
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,265
He didn't have to hang up on him.

777
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,263
Hello, Jamie.

778
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:55,625
Jamie?

779
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,222
Where'd you get that?

780
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,461
How long have you known Plato?

781
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:19,065
About...

782
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,025
<i>- Coming up, another request.</i>
...this morning.

783
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:26,267
<i>This time, from the boys</i>
<i>at Anna's Pizza Paradise.</i>

784
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:29,308
<i>A new arrangement</i>
<i>of an oldie in rhythm and blues.</i>

785
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,700
<i>Jim, this is dedicated to you...</i>

786
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,424
<i>... from Buzz.</i>

787
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,422
They'll be looking for you.

788
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,625
I didn't chicken. You saw where I jumped.

789
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,781
What do I have to do, kill myself?

790
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,025
It doesn't matter to them.

791
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:07,223
Well, I guess you're still pretty upset, huh?

792
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,788
I'm just numb.

793
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,789
You know something?

794
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,340
I woke up this morning, you know?

795
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:28,347
And the sun was shining...

796
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,622
...and it was nice...

797
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,981
...and all that type of stuff.

798
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,303
And the first thing, I saw you.

799
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,499
And I said:

800
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:44,465
"This will be one terrific day,
so you better live it up...

801
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:47,980
"...because tomorrow you'll be nothing."

802
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,503
See? And I almost was.

803
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,749
I'm sorry.

804
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,790
I'm sorry that I treated you mean today.

805
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:02,426
Don't believe what I say
when I'm with the rest of the kids.

806
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:06,069
Nobody acts sincere.

807
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,029
Why did you do that?

808
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,782
I felt like it.

809
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,988
Your lips are soft.

810
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,465
Where are you going?

811
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,903
I don't know.

812
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,828
We can't stay here.

813
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,748
I know one thing.

814
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,946
- I'm not going back in that zoo.
- I'm never going back!

815
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,264
Listen...

816
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:16,103
I know a place. Plato told me before.

817
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,187
It's an old, deserted mansion...

818
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,342
...up by the planetarium.

819
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,382
Want to go up there with me?

820
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,463
You can trust me, Judy.

821
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,061
Okay.

822
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,341
- What do you want?
- Your friend!

823
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,700
Yeah, we got eyes for him. You know it?

824
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,662
- Where does he live?
- You guys better beat it!

825
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,383
Where does he live?

826
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:08,943
Tell us! Tell us!

827
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,300
- Leave me alone!
- Where does he live?

828
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:13,858
Get him! Come on!

829
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,344
We want your friend!

830
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,220
I got it! I got his address book!

831
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,909
Your friend talked!

832
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,145
Now you talk!

833
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,942
Talk! Talk!

834
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,582
What are you doing to him?

835
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,540
Let's get out of here!

836
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:37,461
- Did you get the book?
- Got it!

837
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:03,181
Why you want to mix up with
bad boys like that?

838
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,109
Why you want to get into trouble
all the time?

839
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,428
What you doing with that?
You put that down!

840
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:12,945
Put it down before you hurt yourself!

841
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,469
I have to warn him!

842
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,307
You stay home, John!

843
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,702
Bill Sibley.

844
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,868
Sam Stuart.

845
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,347
Stark. Jim Stark. Here it is.

846
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:33,622
1<i>7</i>53 Angelo. Well, well!

847
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:42,023
Frank, I'm frightened!

848
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,505
- What's that pounding?
- I don't know.

849
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,503
At first I thought it was Jim...
He's not home yet.

850
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,224
He's home, dear. I heard his car.

851
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:54,464
- Well, are you going down there?
- Look, will you please relax?

852
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,824
Now, you see?

853
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,578
It stopped.

854
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,740
I still think you ought to go down there.

855
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:19,183
Who's there?

856
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,262
Anybody there?

857
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,305
Open it.

858
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,468
Who's out there?

859
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:42,588
- Where's your son?
- Where's your baby boy gone to?

860
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,310
- We want to talk to him.
- He's not here.

861
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,223
Look in his room!

862
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,545
Son?

863
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,100
Is he there?

864
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,221
No, honey, he's not here.

865
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,898
- What are you doing?
- Do you know where Jim is?

866
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,782
No, I don't know.

867
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,708
Do you know where he is?

868
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,544
I think...

869
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,662
I'm sorry I bothered you.

870
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,383
Hey, come back here!

871
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,778
Who are you?

872
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,023
Careful, Jim.

873
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,101
Those noisy neighbors.

874
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,505
Come on!

875
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,585
Jim, it's me.

876
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,782
They're looking for you.

877
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:00,740
Everybody.
Crunch and Goon and everybody!

878
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:01,939
We know.

879
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,025
They think you told the police on them.

880
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:06,584
They're going to...

881
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,024
Who's in there?

882
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,624
Nobody. Just us chickens.

883
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,345
Who's in there?

884
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,506
Judy. Judy's up there.

885
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,500
- Let me in?
- Yeah. All right.

886
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,581
But your house is a mess.

887
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:31,864
Watch out.

888
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,299
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

889
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:50,662
Well, we're safe here.

890
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,339
I hope.

891
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:59,147
What do you think of my castle?

892
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,863
Well, now, there, then...

893
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:08,300
I think we'll take it for the summer.

894
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,103
Right this way.

895
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,948
Would you like to rent it?

896
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,267
Or are you more in the mood to buy, dear?

897
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:20,941
You decide, darling.

898
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,143
- Remember our budget.
- Don't give it a thought.

899
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:27,069
It's only $3,000,000 a month.

900
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,424
We can manage that.

901
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,786
I'll scrimp and save
and work my fingers to the bone.

902
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,981
You see, we're newlyweds.

903
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,542
Oh, there's just one thing.

904
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,024
What about?

905
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,584
Children?

906
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:45,947
Right this way.

907
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:47,705
Yes.

908
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,420
We really don't encourage them.

909
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,706
They're so noisy and troublesome.

910
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,343
Don't you agree?

911
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:56,622
And so annoying when they cry.

912
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,822
I don't know what to do when they cry.
Do you, dear?

913
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,622
Drown them like puppies!

914
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:05,308
The nursery's far away
from the rest of the house.

915
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,823
Forgot to wind your sundial.

916
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,869
If you have children,
you'll find this is a wonderful arrangement.

917
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:14,226
They can carry on and you won't notice.

918
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,102
A sunken nursery!

919
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:20,469
In fact, if you lock them in,
you'll never have to see them again.

920
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,661
- Much less, talk to them.
- Talk to them?

921
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:26,067
- Nobody talks to children.
- No, they just tell them.

922
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,309
What time is it?

923
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,027
Hang loose. We've got all night.

924
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:36,979
I wonder if the maid could tell
who we were if she saw us again.

925
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,344
Sure she could.

926
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,059
I know she could.

927
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:42,147
You still want to go home, Moose?

928
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,428
Then shut your mouth...

929
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:47,547
...before your guts run out.

930
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,702
Quick, fill the pool!

931
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,946
Let's see how long we can stay under.

932
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:02,786
You can't talk underwater.

933
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,467
I never saw you having so much fun.

934
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:29,662
I came here a lot of times before,
but I never had fun.

935
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,144
Why not?

936
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,263
Because I was alone.

937
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,462
All right!

938
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:43,028
What'd you come back here for?

939
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:46,063
Because I'd run away.
I used to run away a lot...

940
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,862
...but they always took me back.

941
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:48,905
Who?

942
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,663
Mom and Dad.

943
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:54,225
Now that I don't have them I wish...

944
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,662
...I never had run away.

945
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,026
I used to lie in my crib at night...

946
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,382
...and I'd listen to them fight.

947
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,981
Can you remember back that far?

948
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,781
I can't even remember
what happened yesterday.

949
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,669
I can't.

950
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:14,506
How do you do it?

951
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:17,309
I went to a head shrinker.
He made me remember.

952
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:18,306
Did he?

953
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:22,549
Then my mother said it cost too much,
so she went to Hawaii instead.

954
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,508
Well, what's your problem?

955
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,343
I don't know...

956
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,983
...but I'm happy now.

957
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,745
Here.

958
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,620
I wish we could stay here.

959
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,302
Where's your father now?

960
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,864
He's dead.

961
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,225
He was a hero in the China Sea.

962
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:52,825
You told me he was
a big wheel in New York.

963
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,778
I did?

964
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,861
What's the difference?

965
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,461
He might as well be dead anyway.

966
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,468
It's all right.

967
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:10,183
Sure. Sure.

968
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:22,626
I wonder how many rooms in this place?

969
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:26,070
I don't know. A lot, probably.

970
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:27,869
Probably.

971
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,262
Do you want to explore?

972
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,700
Must have been a nervous day.

973
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,220
He must have started out nervous.

974
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,706
I've done that, though. Haven't you?

975
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,306
That looks like our boy's car, huh?

976
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,467
Well, what do you know?

977
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,704
Is this what it's like to love somebody?

978
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:22,389
I don't know.

979
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:27,148
What kind of a person
do you think a girl wants?

980
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:30,580
A man.

981
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,986
But a man who can be gentle and sweet.

982
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,269
Like you are.

983
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:45,782
And someone who doesn't
run away when you want them.

984
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:50,061
Like being Plato's friend
when nobody else liked him.

985
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:53,146
That's being strong.

986
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:06,259
We're not going to be lonely anymore.

987
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,942
Ever, ever.

988
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,587
Not you or me.

989
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,220
I love somebody.

990
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,822
All the time I've been...

991
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,340
...looking for someone to love me.

992
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,381
And now I love somebody.

993
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:26,781
And it's so easy.

994
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,348
Why is it easy now?

995
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,509
I don't know.

996
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,142
It is for me too.

997
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:40,582
I love you, Jim.

998
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,261
I really mean it.

999
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,341
Well, I'm glad.

1000
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,339
Good morning.

1001
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,344
Let's take him!

1002
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:48,300
That's it.

1003
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:50,548
This is unit 1<i>7.</i>

1004
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:54,899
We just zeroed gray Ford coupe, 194<i>6.</i>

1005
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:59,422
Observatory Drive and Crest Place.
Looks like housebreaking.

1006
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:02,739
Alert Juvenile and stand by to send help.

1007
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:28,828
Save me!

1008
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,824
Save me!

1009
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,342
Plato, what's with?

1010
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,985
Why did you run out on me?
Why did you leave me alone?

1011
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,663
What's the matter with you?

1012
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,427
I thought you were someone else!

1013
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:08,182
Who? Plato, it's me! Look at me.

1014
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,499
What's the matter?

1015
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,945
Let me go! You're not my father!

1016
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:13,942
You're not my father!

1017
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:23,464
Halt!

1018
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,138
Halt!

1019
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:28,743
Come here, son.

1020
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,505
Come here.

1021
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,219
Walk over quietly. There won't be trouble.

1022
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:47,708
Cover the house. I'll get him.

1023
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:05,465
Halt!

1024
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:37,749
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

1025
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,627
- Let's go back!
- I'm going after him.

1026
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:42,902
- After he tried to shoot you?
- Stay down.

1027
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:46,022
He didn't mean it.
We shouldn't have left him.

1028
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:47,420
He needs us.

1029
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:50,582
He needed you maybe, but so do I.

1030
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,388
He needs you too.

1031
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:01,339
You okay?

1032
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,944
Come on.

1033
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,700
You should have heard him tonight.

1034
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,618
He was talking about you...

1035
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:20,978
...like you were the hero in the China Sea.

1036
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:26,503
You know what he wanted?

1037
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:29,946
He tried to make us his family.

1038
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,866
I guess he just wanted us to be like...

1039
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:38,387
...his...

1040
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:47,979
Halt!

1041
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:53,061
Jim, they're killing him!

1042
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:27,263
Come out of there!

1043
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:30,104
You're making it tough on yourself, kid.

1044
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:33,143
Come quietly now.
You didn't kill anybody yet.

1045
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,258
Need a little help here.

1046
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,102
We heard firing. He hit anybody?

1047
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:08,509
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

1048
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:11,708
We got a kook inside with a gun.
He wounded some kid.

1049
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:13,025
How'd he get in?

1050
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,702
Smashed the front door.

1051
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,464
- Is there another entrance?
- Down in back.

1052
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,863
Seal him off.

1053
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,506
I don't understand. I don't understand.

1054
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,581
You pray for your children.

1055
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:34,584
You read about things like this
happening to other families...

1056
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,379
...but never dream it
could happen to yours.

1057
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:40,619
The Observatory?

1058
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:43,062
Five housebreaking in area.

1059
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,420
Right. We'll proceed. Over.

1060
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,546
There are some other kids in trouble.

1061
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,463
You'll have to go with me.

1062
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:52,984
Sure, sure. That's all right.

1063
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:59,982
Lieutenant says seal them off.

1064
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:19,389
Hello, Ray.

1065
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,229
You know anything about this?

1066
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,504
No more than you do.

1067
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,342
A kid's in there with a gun.

1068
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:27,627
He wounded another kid
and shot at an officer.

1069
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,069
- You got a speaker?
- Yeah, help yourself.

1070
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:37,228
- What's going on?
- Some kid's in trouble. Stay back.

1071
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:40,502
I got to know! My boy ran off
and he got a gun too.

1072
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,428
All right. Lieutenant!

1073
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,425
<i>I'm addressing the boy in the planetarium.</i>

1074
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,382
<i>I'm speaking to the boy inside.</i>

1075
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:50,869
<i>This is Ray Frameck</i>
<i>from the Juvenile Division.</i>

1076
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:53,586
<i>Armed police are outside.</i>

1077
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:57,705
<i>Whoever you are,</i>
<i>drop your weapon and come out.</i>

1078
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,823
<i>Come outside!</i>

1079
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:05,628
<i>Clasp your hands over your head</i>
<i>and come outside quietly.</i>

1080
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:09,105
Mr. Stark!

1081
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:10,823
Frank!

1082
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:15,463
That's my son.

1083
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:19,579
Hold your fire!

1084
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:24,704
Are you sure?

1085
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:26,662
I think I know my son.

1086
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:34,623
<i>Officers, another boy and girl</i>
<i>just ran into the planetarium.</i>

1087
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:36,548
<i>We don't know if they're armed.</i>

1088
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,742
<i>Hold your positions</i>
<i>until further instructions.</i>

1089
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:43,581
<i>Another boy and girl just ran</i>
<i>into the planetarium.</i>

1090
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,701
<i>We don't know if they're armed.</i>

1091
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:49,181
<i>Hold your positions</i>
<i>until further instructions.</i>

1092
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,098
You in there?

1093
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:55,225
You're my friend, Plato.

1094
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,062
That means a lot to me.

1095
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:01,389
Hey! I'm going to open the door now.

1096
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:13,987
You can shoot me if you want to.

1097
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:24,224
Boy, I'm blind as a bat.

1098
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,949
You got a match?

1099
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:30,708
I'll break my neck in here.

1100
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:32,189
Where are you?

1101
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:34,983
I've got a gun.

1102
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,269
Yeah, I know.

1103
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:45,298
- Light a match, will you?
- No.

1104
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,698
How are you?

1105
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:52,423
I'm fine.

1106
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:54,109
That's fine.

1107
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:06,585
Do you think the end of the world
will come at nighttime?

1108
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,869
At dawn.

1109
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:16,822
Come on, now.

1110
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:20,669
Where are you?

1111
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,063
What are you hiding for?

1112
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,703
Just stand up.

1113
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:34,110
How can I talk to you if I can't see you?

1114
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,620
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

1115
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,308
Come on, stand up.

1116
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:44,062
You've seen this show before. Come on.

1117
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:47,747
Do you see that star up there?

1118
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,989
Stand up. Look at it.

1119
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,265
I can't talk to you if I can't see you.

1120
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:56,903
That's all there is to it.

1121
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:10,429
I'm not going to hurt you
or anything like that.

1122
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:19,706
Why did you run out on me?

1123
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,462
We didn't run out on you.

1124
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,301
We were coming right back, I told you.

1125
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:27,909
You sure?

1126
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:30,702
Sure, I'm sure.

1127
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:33,903
Judy's here.

1128
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:36,746
She's waiting. Come on.

1129
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,900
Come on.

1130
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:44,101
No? Not ready to come out yet?

1131
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:54,580
Promise you, nothing will happen.

1132
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,223
Are you cold?

1133
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:01,025
Here.

1134
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,022
It's warm. Here.

1135
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:08,787
My jacket. It's warm.

1136
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:12,143
Can I keep it?

1137
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:13,942
Well, what do you think?

1138
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:21,464
Hey, now can I have the gun, Plato?

1139
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:23,222
You want to give it to me?

1140
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,300
- My gun?
- Yeah. In your pocket.

1141
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,784
Give it to me.

1142
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:40,022
No, I need it.

1143
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,941
Don't you trust me, Plato?

1144
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:49,788
Just give it to me for a second.

1145
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:01,265
Been carrying this around all day?

1146
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:10,549
Now there's a...

1147
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:14,267
...lot of people out front.

1148
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:18,547
You promised to give it back.

1149
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:22,580
Friends always keep their promises.

1150
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:28,583
These people...

1151
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:34,229
You know, every one
of them want to see that you're safe.

1152
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,148
You understand that?

1153
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:38,388
They want you to be safe.

1154
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,228
And... Oh, here.

1155
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:44,626
They said I could come in here...

1156
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:46,707
...and I could bring you out, and...

1157
01:39:46,910 --> 01:39:47,945
Why?

1158
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,705
Why?

1159
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:53,223
Because they like you.

1160
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:58,425
Come on.

1161
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,303
It's too bright.

1162
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:23,829
I'll fix it.

1163
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:39,379
Is Ray Frameck still out there?

1164
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,859
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

1165
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,466
Hey, turn out those lights!

1166
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:47,702
If you do, we'll come out!

1167
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:50,263
<i>Turn your lights out.</i>

1168
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:00,022
See? Come on.

1169
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:11,980
Who's that?

1170
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:15,346
- Just a guy.
- I shot at one of them.

1171
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:17,586
It's all right. You didn't hurt him.

1172
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:19,621
Those are not my friends!

1173
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:22,102
Make them go away.

1174
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:28,628
You want me to make them go away?
You want me to fix it? Okay.

1175
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,418
Ray, can you make those guys get back?

1176
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:39,303
You don't have to worry
about anything. Here.

1177
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,068
Keep the guys back.

1178
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:44,181
That other kid still has a gun.

1179
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:50,260
Don't turn on the lights! It's too bright.

1180
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:52,944
Plato doesn't... Turn out the lights!

1181
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,347
I got the bullets!

1182
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,469
Look!

1183
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:14,819
Let him alone!

1184
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:17,225
Who are you? What do you want?

1185
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:19,785
All right, fellas. All right, Lieutenant.

1186
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,983
Get the stretcher in here.

1187
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:25,789
For a minute there, I...

1188
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,506
When I saw that red jacket, I...

1189
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:29,904
I thought...

1190
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,502
Hey, jerkpot...

1191
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,748
...what'd you do that for?

1192
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:54,268
You can't help it, son.

1193
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:57,025
You did everything a man could.

1194
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:22,268
Help me.

1195
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:27,461
You can depend on me.

1196
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:29,183
Trust me.

1197
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:33,547
Whatever comes, we'll face it together.

1198
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:35,303
I swear it.

1199
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:38,699
Now, Jim...

1200
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:40,344
...stand up.

1201
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,702
I'll stand up with you.

1202
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:47,859
I'll try and be as strong
as you want me to be. Come on.

1203
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:22,303
This poor baby got nobody. Just nobody!

1204
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,461
He was always cold.

1205
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:11,623
This is Judy.

1206
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:13,305
She's my friend.

1207
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:33,864
He's...

1208
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:20,702
