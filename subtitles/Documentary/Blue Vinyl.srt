1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:02,864
 We cut Deadwood.

2
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:05,166
Then we got money to
bring in new acts...

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:07,052
Guys, I'm trying to bring
this into the future.

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:08,470
Well, I'm here in the
present trying to keep

5
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:09,537
the fucking lights on.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,106
Get the band ready.

7
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,275
Set up a showcase sometime next week.

8
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,260
What the fuck happened
to the band I heard?

9
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:17,946
Hey!

10
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:19,881
Play the Tubes song.

11
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:26,121
Tell 'em we're signing them.

12
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,025
Did you or did you not sell the company?

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,459
It's gonna be fine.
Nothing's gonna change.

14
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,261
Jackie just signed Dusty Springfield.

15
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:33,979
Oh!

16
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:34,930
Watch your step Jackie.

17
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,299
Hannibal wants to have
lunch with me Richie.

18
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,685
Gloria wants a check for
10,000 for the fundraiser.

19
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,221
Deb, I told you. It's a
temporary belt tightening?

20
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:44,990
"Nothing's gonna change Deb."

21
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,375
This is what you threw me, like a child.

22
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:48,910
You still playing guitar?

23
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,145
 Manage a few bands?

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,397
- Well, maybe you and I should...
- Why did you come here Richie?

25
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:53,565
I'm offering you an opportunity.

26
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,617
I lost my voice because of you.

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,669
- Fuck!

28
00:00:58,355 --> 00:00:59,354
 They found him.

29
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:03,792
 Relax! He'll be fine.

Francis Rogers,

54
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,204
loving son to Natalie and Boris.

55
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,756
Buck to his many friends.

56
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,458
Cultural figure.

57
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,010
Generously supported the Federation,

58
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:07,680
the Sisterhood lunch,

59
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,266
the renovation of the
Bessie Weinbaum memorial...

60
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,302
Excuse me, are you Richard Finestra?

61
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,604
No. He couldn't make it.

62
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,556
Just... he wanted to be here.

63
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:20,059
Owner of six stations on radio.

64
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:23,312
Music, sporting events, traffic.

65
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,532
WBSO especially good for the traffic.

66
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:40,713
Okay, now say it.

67
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,918
Selling the company
really fucked with me

68
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,670
in ways I didn't anticipate.

69
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,755
I didn't get how much

70
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:52,258
it brought up shit about
my father and everything.

71
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,094
And Buck's funeral today.

72
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,763
They're putting the man in the
ground, I'm not even there, okay?

73
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,265
Which shows you how committed I am...

74
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,101
He refers to Buck Rogers
as that psychotic dipwad.

75
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,186
Don't roll your eyes.
Put it into the couch.

76
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,241
There we go.

77
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,528
Put it into the couch,
not your marriage.

78
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,283
How does that feel?

79
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,506
Better, actually.

80
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,841
I don't want to take it out on her.

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,793
- On you.
- Who?

82
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,012
- Devon.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,964
Say it to her.

84
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,633
- I don't want to take it out...
- I got it, thank you.

85
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,553
Good. Why don't you give it a try?

86
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,639
Whacking the couch? I'm okay.

87
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:42,441
If you were okay, you wouldn't be here.

88
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,310
The racket's not gonna help.

89
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,778
I think it helped Richie.

90
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,646
We got him to talk about
what's happening with him

91
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,481
without attacking your relationship.

92
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:52,534
Both of you need to identify who
you are outside of the marriage.

93
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,119
That's important for you, too,

94
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:57,156
particularly now that Richie
is looking at his own shit.

95
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,208
Mm, so now Little Richie
is feeling better.

96
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,626
I fucking hate it when
she calls me that.

97
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,877
I don't want him to feel better.

98
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,212
I want him to feel worse.

99
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:05,047
- You see this shit?
- Devon.

100
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,666
Our marriage is based on an
agreement that nobody does drugs.

101
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,969
Ah, that's how this goes. Nobody
but me ever did anything.

102
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:13,589
Because when we do, people end up in
the hospital on life support or dead.

103
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,809
Mea culpa, okay? Nobody
got hurt this time.

104
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,072
You have two healthy children.
What do you want me to say?

105
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,203
Not that you feel better!

106
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:22,598
Devon, I
hear how angry you are.

107
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,516
You have every right to be.

108
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:27,186
I want you to pick up the racket
and let the couch absorb...

109
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,573
He's ruining my life! I'm not hitting
the fucking couch with a tennis racket!

110
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,777
♪ Oh, Candida ♪

111
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,530
♪ We could make it together... ♪

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,200

113
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,535
Leo, the station.

114
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,038
Come on.

115
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:49,675
Well, at least we don't have to worry
about him boycotting us anymore.

116
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,845
Buck.

117
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,213
The man was murdered.

118
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,349
I'm just saying.

119
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,600
Silver lining.

120
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,054
That guy talking to me at the service,

121
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,140
brown suit, thought I was Richie.

122
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,227
You would dress better.

123
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,863
- You know, if you were Richie.
- Yeah, I followed you.

124
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:14,450
Probably a bill collector. Schulman says
there's some fishy shit in the books.

125
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,952
- Who's Schulman?
- Forensic accountant. Did he call you?

126
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,571
He had some questions I tried to answer.

127
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,408
Didn't add up. Somebody's
playing shell games.

128
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,460
No, no, if Richie drained
the goddamn company,

129
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,045
why didn't he unload it
when he had the chance?

130
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,830
'Cause he's a coke fiend back on coke.

131
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,748
- You're looking for logic?
- He's under a lot of pressure.

132
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,551
- A lot of pressure.
- Oh, really? Whose fault is that?

133
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,586
Yeah, he's got all of A&R
shitting their pants.

134
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,672
I mean, he's really gonna fire them
if they don't sign an act in a week.

135
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,091
Yeah, why the fuck not?
You should find an act.

136
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,260
It ain't rocket science. You
throw a brick in this town,

137
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,062
you hit somebody singing a song.

138
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:45,898
Bette fucking Midler got discovered
in a feygeleh bathhouse.

139
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:49,101
I have a girlfriend. I don't
hang out at feygeleh bathhouses.

140
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,270
Hey, Zak, I got Richie.

141
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,322
- Give me him. Give it to me.
- Give it.

142
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,574
- Give me the phone.
- Give him more cord.

143
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,026
- Hand me the phone!
- You're gonna break it.

144
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:00,612
- You're holding it.
- I got it. Leave it alone.

145
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:02,664
- It's stuck.
- Fuck.

146
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,502
Hey, I thought you were gonna be there.

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,787
Had to meet somebody. How was it?

148
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,924
Fucking freak show. Couldn't call me
and let me know you're not coming?

149
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,959
Hey, you didn't think
I wanted to be there?

150
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:17,629
I wouldn't miss a goddamn funeral
unless there was a significant thing.

151
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,516
Well, I would have
appreciated a warning.

152
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,134
I got to tell everybody you're late.

153
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,186
Then there's this other
guy coming around.

154
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,271
- And I don't know who he is.
- Yeah, yeah, listen to me.

155
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:30,142
Okay? I got Hannibal coming in today to
get fluffed before we re-up his contract.

156
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,694
How about you and the guys grab
lunch before you come home?

157
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,229
You know, so he doesn't feel swamped.

158
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,981
Don't we want him to feel swamped?

159
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:39,151
Fuck! Well, Skip won't shut
up about the royalty rate,

160
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:42,955
and Julie gave him all that shit about
the fucking synth on the last album.

161
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,625
No, Julie's in the studio today
and Skip's making sales calls,

162
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,294
so I can ditch Scott.

163
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,829
Are we arguing about lunch?

164
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,965
Get a drink. What's the problem?

165
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,300
Yeah, fine, okay. Whatever.

166
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,002
Fuck.

167
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,313
I just had this pressed.

168
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:06,002
I'm calling Joe Smith
at Warners today.

169
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,646
Beg for a fucking job.

170
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,731
You're gonna walk away from
a 22% stake in the company?

171
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,184
My stake in the company. My
stake is now worth zero.

172
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,186
- Just fucking relax.
- You fucking relax.

173
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,855
- I lost everything.
- We all lost everything.

174
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:20,192
Nobody hires you right now. You tanked
the buyout. You smell like a turd.

175
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,529
Get out of the fucking limo
if it's such a hardship.

176
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,448
What, you were really gonna
retire after that buyout?

177
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,917
And do what? Paint Moira's toenails?

178
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,704
And you, you think you'll ever get
pussy again you're not a record man?

179
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,374
Bunch of whiners. Enough already!

180
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,379
Watch your leg. This is my side
of the car, that's your side.

181
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,931
- What, are you six years old?
- Yeah, maybe I am.

182
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,850
Shut up.

183
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,768
Shut the fuck up.

184
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,058
You're recording today?

185
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,060
Goulet, the Christmas album.

186
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,395
Oh, yeah, my mom loves him.

187
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,863
Do me a favor, look out the window.

188
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,731
Play the license plate game, all right?

189
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,817

Look at that. We got a butterfly.

204
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,116
What's your name, butterfly?

205
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,619
- Cece.
- Cece.

206
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,121
Hal has the big room all set up.

207
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,757
- Can I walk you in?
- We got ribs, brisket.

208
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:01,460
- Do you remember that place...
- We're vegetarian now.

209
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,845
Get this shit out of here.
Move. All of it.

210
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,548
You don't got no Danish
at 11:00 in the morning?

211
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,934
Of course we do, sweetheart.
Jamie, go down to Goldie's.

212
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,971
25 Danish, no poppy. It sticks
in the teeth. Am I right?

213
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,643
Where is he? Hannibal!

214
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,479
Unh! Somebody get me a marker

215
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:22,147
so this man can sign my chest.

216
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,899
Hairy motherfucker. How
I'm gonna sign that?

217
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,034
Come on, give it to me.

218
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,452
I see you, Starr.

219
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,821
I see you like a goddamn poem.

220
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:30,956
So fucking beautiful.

221
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,991
I love you, baby.

222
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:34,876
Me, too. Mwah.

223
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,879
Somebody get the queen
some champagne, please.

224
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,831
Uh-huh.

225
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,416
You got your own poem.

226
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,252
Oh, yeah, huh? I guess I'm
not as dumb as I look.

227
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,221
You're gonna have a
drink with me, right?

228
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,840
Penny, Jamie hook you up?

229
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,476
Yup. How's everybody doing?

230
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,396
- Oh, yes.
- My favorite white girl.

231
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,847
Hannibal.

232
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,349
We're not talking deal points, Harvey.

233
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,768
We're just two big boys
having a drink, am I right?

234
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,853
- No numbers, okay?
- We good, bro.

235
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,772
Get some fruit. He got to reduce.

236
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,666
Fucking fat ass.

237
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,966
I got something
that's waiting for you.

238
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,446
Five cheese, five apricot.

239
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:14,866
No, no poppy. I'll be right down.

240
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,002
- You meet him?
- No, you?

241
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:18,587
I will.

242
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,540
I just found these two guys who
sound exactly like Humble Pie.

243
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,009
Do you really need me to
break this down for you?

244
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,845
Find somebody who sounds exactly
like nobody you've ever heard.

245
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,296
Oh, now she's the Dalai Lama.

246
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,881
Look, the Nasty Bits suck my balls.

247
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,600
I don't want to get into this with you.

248
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,552
Oh, okay, then they're geniuses
and I just don't get it?

249
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,554
You're right, you just don't get it.

250
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,390
You think I could fire her, huh?

251
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,892
You haven't found anybody, huh?

252
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,222
How's Starr treating you?

253
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,973
Starr want me dead.

254
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,725
That's why I can't go
nowhere without her.

255
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,695
- Can't give her no time to plan.
- Here you go.

256
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,202
So, Harvey walk you through the changes?

257
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,121
We weren't going to talk business.

258
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,572
I'm not negotiating, brother.

259
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:19,791
I just hope that he told
you that we rolled over

260
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,409
on basically everything.

261
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,995
I'm a dog laying on the
floor showing you my belly.

262
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,500
Jackie Jervis sent me a case of Dom.

263
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:33,255
Jackie Jervis is a twat.

264
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,674
He suck you off, too?

265
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,894
He didn't have to. All the Dom
I drank, I got too tired.

266
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,063
You know how many funk acts they
have over there at Koronet Records?

267
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,850
- Not gonna remember your name.
- He said my name a lot.

268
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,569
- He got it down.
- Oh, yeah?

269
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,856
Can I interest you in this?

270
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:55,026
Or do you want to run
home to Jackie's Dom?

271
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,581
- Give me that.
- Line it up.

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,867
I want to throw something
on the pick for you.

273
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,372
I want you to listen to this horn.

274
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,008
This is the cat who played with
Les McCann on "Compared to What."

275
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:12,260
- That's a hot track.
- No shit.

276
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:16,097
Listen to this.

277
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,608
Hey. Hey, me, too, motherfucker.

278
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,728
You off the wagon? Shit.

279
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,197
Listen, listen.

280
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,901
Ooh! That's a mean horn.

281
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:38,537
I'm putting him on your next album.

282
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,492
My ma coming to the show tonight.
Front row.

283
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,045
Esther? She's a fucking pistol.

284
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,130
Rein it in with the chicken.
Last time she saw you,

285
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,299
she started bringing
over trays of that shit.

286
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,469
"You give this to Richie. His
folks both in the ground now.

287
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,005
- Somebody got to take care of him."
- Well, she's fucking right.

288
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,757
How come you didn't bring
the motherfucking chicken?

289
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:01,142
I ate it. Man, Starr only
cook vegetarian now.

290
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,303
Fucking nasty shit.

291
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,454
We're running the world,
we can't get a bite to eat.

292
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:08,650
You better not run this world
into the ground, Mack.

293
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,319
Selling your label, not
selling your label.

294
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,021
I heard Dusty Springfield bailed.

295
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,156
Dusty Springfield's a fucking loon.

296
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,742
Have a little faith, how about?

297
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,161
Do I not take care of you?

298
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,949
Have I not always taken
care of Hannibal?

299
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,619
Found a couple of your
fucking groupies downstairs.

300
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,504
Oh, my goodness. Hi.

301
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,706
Cece brought out
the new Bobby Womack.

302
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,758
Playing it for Starr right now.

303
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,964
All right, sugar.

304
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,800
You better pinch me, make sure I'm real.

305
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,520
Sorry. I need to get out. Thanks.

306
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,642
- Hey.
- Shall we?

307
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:52,477
Uh...

308
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,982
Let me just see what's
going on back here.

309
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,572
- I need to see Richie.
- Do you have an appointment?

310
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,241
Tell him Lester Grimes is here.

311
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,515
Does that mean you
have an appointment?

312
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,268
Yeah.

313
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,003
Trying to sign with him?

314
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,471
I can slip him your tape.

315
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,173
Oh, yeah? You an
American Century artist?

316
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,642
I'm here to sign.

317
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,477
Sorry, just a few more minutes.

318
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,180
- You want a drink?
- We want to sign the bloody contract.

319
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,653
Lester?

320
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:36,688
What the fuck?

321
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,657
Welcome to American Century.

322
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,992
Get ready to take it up the ass.

323
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,163
The news
watch never stops.

324
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,950
You really think Richie's skimming?

325
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:51,870
Probably. Selfish piece of shit.

326
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:54,039
I bought my in-laws a condo in Boca.

327
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,508
- You get a deal?
- No, I didn't. I didn't.

328
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:59,627
They were gonna move in with us.
I was saving my life.

329
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,347
I thought I was about to make
millions from the sale of a company.

330
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,100
Eight years cleaning up after him

331
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,686
like the asshole behind the elephant.

332
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,106
What's with you? You don't seem to
give a shit that the sale tanked.

333
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,607
I give a big shit.

334
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,478
I was gonna stay with them, PolyGram.

335
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,697
- Maybe work at the headquarters.
- Germany?

336
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:21,566
Fucking kike. What, are you
gonna pass as an Italian?

337
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,118
Oh, stop. It's different now.

338
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,403
West Berlin is...

339
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,655
it's a happening place.

340
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,742
- Culturally.
- Well, you're not going.

341
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,912
Did you ever meet him before... Hannibal?

342
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,880
Once, twice.

343
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,999
The big acts, Richie doesn't
want you to come around

344
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,751
because you'll steal his thunder.

345
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,804
I can't come home with a napkin
that he signed? That's all.

346
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:47,392
You know, I listened to Hannibal
when he was still called Lyle Hanny.

347
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:51,179
I brought an act in once.
A girl with a guitar.

348
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,848
So sweet, you just...
you want to die.

349
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,986
Irish. Not that Celtic crap.

350
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,239
She wrote a song about a boat.

351
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,077
He says, "You don't got an ear, Zak.

352
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:10,865
Yeah, but that's okay 'cause
you got a nose for promos."

353
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,751
That's his rhyming couplet.

354
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:16,788
This autistic visionary that we're
following off a fucking cliff.

355
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,506
Hey, listen to me, Zak,
you got a great ear.

356
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,759
I do or I don't, who gives a shit?

357
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,044
I got relationships with every
DJ in the United States.

358
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,181
- Yeah.
- Mobile, Alabama, has got two broads

359
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,099
playing the tin cups, I know about it.

360
00:19:28,185 --> 00:19:31,136
And if Mobile loves them,
I take them national.

361
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,104
That's how we got Wilson and Chick.

362
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,722
- And the...
- Penny.

363
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,142
The Penny Fliers.

364
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm a relationship person.

365
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:44,115
Richie Finestra, he's got a
relationship with himself.

366
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,533
This is bloody.

367
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,785
I can't eat this.

368
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,319
- Ma'am.
- Medium well.

369
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,628
Thank you.

370
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,000

Pink Floyd. Capitol. Just released.

382
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,887
How come I never walk in here
and find you playing my shit?

383
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:58,223
I got a Puerto Rican chick
for questions like that.

384
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,275
But she's got tits like helium balloons,

385
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,060
so from her I'm willing to take it.

386
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,396
I need you to hold off on the
extracurricular Donny Osmond run.

387
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:06,898
- The fugazis?
- Yeah.

388
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,900
I pressed them Friday.
We're very efficient.

389
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,152
Well, sit on them a couple of weeks.

390
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,071
The trucks went out this morning.

391
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:14,656
It's already at the Goody stores.

392
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,241
What the fuck?

393
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,742
I ask you to run something, I
normally got to stand here

394
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:20,245
and threaten to piss in your
face before it gets done.

395
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,664
I quit drinking. I had a heart scan.

396
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,082
Three nights in the hospital.

397
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,583
Turns out I can get a lot done in a day.

398
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,086
Mario, do you have any fucking
idea what you just did?

399
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,888
I am feeling better,
thank you very much.

400
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,556
They're auditing my company.

401
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:34,926
I can't have 10,000 fake Donny
Osmond returns showing up, right?

402
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:36,761
It'll be more than we
pressed in the first place.

403
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:39,264
So next time, do the math before
you order an illegal run.

404
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,766
Hey, I paid for that
run, I can't sell it.

405
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:43,768
I feel terrible for you.

406
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:46,020
Now don't give me that look.

407
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,273
Don't give me that look!

408
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:50,742
You made this bed, not me.

409
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:51,993
You're a moaning asshole.

410
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:56,080
My blood pressure was 180 over 90!

411
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,784
Man, fuck the coat. I'm gonna
get you an actual leopard.

412
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,452
Like a baby one?

413
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,671
Yeah, you can't get them old
or they'll eat your face off.

414
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,957
Cece, I want to take this kid
out after his show tonight,

415
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,375
so book a table for everybody, okay?

416
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,627
We're gonna have a
goddamn vegetarian orgy.

417
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,296
Rice. Whatever you want.

calling for you.

Richard, I need to speak with you.

426
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,115
Hey! Do you know Hannibal?

427
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,484
Hannibal, this is Robert Goulet.

428
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,153
You think you got to tell me that?

429
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,572
He's fucking Lancelot.
Man, you the whole salami.

430
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,123
Oh, look at that, you're the salami.

431
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,625
Shouldn't you be in the studio?

432
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,744
Bob, can you have a seat
in my office, please?

433
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:46,381
No, I have one original song on
this album of warmed-over slop.

434
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,249
If we start on the original material...

435
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:50,835
It's about the day after Christmas.
It's an untouched market.

436
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,504
You'll want to stick your head
in the oven, you hear this song.

437
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,974
There he is! Zak is back.

438
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,842
Take your time, honey.

439
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,510
Been at lunch since breakfast.

440
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,312
Would you offer Bob a drink, please?

441
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:02,730
I'll be in in a minute, okay?

442
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,516
Hannibal, I fucking love you.

443
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:07,652

Hey.

452
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,872
This how he treats all his bands?

453
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,208
I'm so sorry. It's crazy here today.

454

No.

456
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,214
There's a diner called
Munson's up the block.

457
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,520
We ain't signed. We ain't got no money.

458
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,982
- What'd you think was gonna happen?
- I don't...

459
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,568
Even if you managed to sell this
sorry shit as an album, what then?

460
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,704
The fucking "Mike Douglas
Show" like this?

461
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:01,989
Am I a sideshow monkey, man?
Put me in a little vest?

462
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:02,784
Shut the fuck up.

463
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,933
You got a guilty conscience
and this is your solution?

464
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:06,577
10 years and this is
what you come up with?

465
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,830
Yeah, man, that's it! That's all I got!

466
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,965
You don't like it, get the fuck out!

467
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,886
Oh, fuck.

468
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,063
I listened to that shit.

469
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,315
That's my fault.

470
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,234
It's been years since I
heard what I used to...

471
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,773
Why didn't you just fucking hit
me with a bat like Galasso did?

472
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,493
- Ain't no difference.
- Lester, if I thought for one second

473
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,529
that this was gonna hurt...

474
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,916
Look, I swear to God, man, I just
thought that if we took those tracks...

475
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:47,335
what are you doing? What are you doing?

476
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:49,537
That's great. Very nice.

477
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:52,707
Oh, come on, man. Yeah,
that's really great.

478
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,760
Thanks. Cece, get me some water, please.

479
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,630
- Cece, get me some water!
- Holy shit!

480
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,516
Cece, get me a fire extinguisher!

481
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,768
 What's happening in there?

482
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,803
- Back, now.
- Are we getting water?

483
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,439
- Cece, anybody, get me some water!
- I sent someone, Richie.

484
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,608
Hurry up!

485
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,143
Agh!

486
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:13,644
Go away! Get out!

487
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,030
- What the fuck?!
- Holy shit.

488
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,449
Fucking kidding me?

489
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,538

- This was when?
- A couple weeks ago.

500
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,447
You, too, or just the den?

501
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,865
Excuse me?

502
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,617
Any physical abuse in the marriage?

503
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,620
Oh, no, no. Not in... no.

504
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:19,343
No, you don't need to write that down.
It was an accident.

505
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,598
Is that what women say?

506
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,266
I get a lot of clumsy women.

507
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,051
That's not what this was.
It was a car accident.

508
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:29,303
As much my fault as Richie's.
So you can cross that out.

509
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,138
How about I do my part, you do yours?

510
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,857
I don't want you
suggesting in your records

511
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,392
that I have an abusive husband.

512
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,943
He abuses drugs.

513
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,029
That's different. I want
it to be about what it is.

514
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:39,981
- Drug abuse.
- And alcohol.

515
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,135
Which for an addict with a history of...

516
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,008
Accidents.

517
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,820
Is this supposed to feel
like a cross-examination?

518
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,655
It's not supposed to feel very nice.

519
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,291
And if someone told you it
would, they misled you.

520
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:54,378
You expect sole custody of the children?

521
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:56,998
No.

522
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,667
He's a good father. He's
never exposed the kids to...

523
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,637
I thought your son found
him drunk on the couch

524
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,755
with the rectangular guitar.

525
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,340
Shared custody.

526
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,676
- Because he's a good father?
- Yes.

527
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,012
Sylvia!

528
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,399
- Invoice the hour.
- You want the questionnaire?

529
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:17,268
Sure, what the hell?

530
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:22,690
You bring a checkbook with you, Mrs.
Finestra?

531
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,192
- Yes.
- Great.

532
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:26,944
There's a 150 charge for this meeting

533
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,996
and Sylvia will give
you a questionnaire.

534
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,115
You can fill it out at home.

535
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,833
Your secretary said on the phone

536
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:35,753
that there would be no charge
for the initial consultation.

537
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:39,123
- Well, she was mistaken.
- What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?

538
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,208
Lucky for me you did.

539
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:43,427
If you think this somehow
makes me more comfortable

540
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:44,845
with the idea of you
handling my divorce...

541
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,764
You're not getting divorced, Mrs.
Finestra.

542
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:49,800
You just wasted an hour of
my time generating a card

543
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,136
to play in the next fight
you have with your husband.

544
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:54,021
That is the most
condescending thing anyone...

545
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,690
You love your husband, sweetheart.

546
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,942
I wish you didn't. He
sounds like a real asshole.

547
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,728
If I'm wrong, fill out the questionnaire

548
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,980
and we'll discuss it
the next time we meet.

549
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:05,616
$150. My last name is Gross.

550
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:08,653
Spelled like "Wow, that
was really gross."

551
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,574
♪ One, two, three, now ♪

552
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,218

553
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,921

place that they want to be ♪

554
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,307

555
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:31,642
♪ Politicians in my eyes... ♪

556
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,521
You get an idea,
you can't shake it.

557
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:46,023
Hum along with it when
you're on the train.

558
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,192
You like it for a minute,
but then you hate it.

559
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:50,361
It ain't good enough, but
you write it down anyway

560
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,196
just to get it out of your head.

561
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,031
Then you pull out your guitar,

562
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,750
see if it might stand up.

563
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,954
Your mouth, your thought, your hand.

564
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,373
Put a microphone in your
face, somebody hits record.

565
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,924
Hmm.

566
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,712
Now you sign a deal with a label,

567
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,214
paid you a big chunk of
change to cut an album,

568
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,465
so you're feeling like the man,

569
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,934
but they gonna hit that pile of cash,

570
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,803
pull out a stack to pay for the studio,

571
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,055
the guy pushing the
button and the cover art

572
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:20,474
and the poster and the launch party.

573
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,476
That's called recoupment.

574
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:26,030
Cut the record, it sells
in stores, shop gets half.

575
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,232
Take out a buck for the manufacturing.

576
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:30,618
Buck and a half for the distribution.

577
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,236
A buck for marketing.

578
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:34,071
Not a whole lot left for you.

579
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:36,624
But even if there is,

580
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:38,743
you don't get to see a dime of it

581
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:41,412
till they pay off your production costs.

582
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,881
Probably need to sell
100,000 records to do that.

583
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:47,334
100,000 is more people than
you'll ever meet in your life.

584
00:29:49,172 --> 00:29:51,422
You know the difference
between mechanical royalties,

585
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,758
performance royalties, artist royalties,

586
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,010
songwriting royalties?

587
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,729
All that shit's gonna show
up on a stack of paper,

588
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:00,898
your name at the bottom
under a dotted line

589
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,566
like it's already done.

590
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:06,654
And Richie Finestra's gonna
hand you a drink and a pen.

591
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:08,572
He knows that every single
one of those things

592
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:11,992
is negotiable down to a
hundredth of a percent.

593
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,944
I know.

594
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,698
Only ones that don't know is you.

595
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:20,835
And you're the ones holding the pen.

596
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,625
Hannibal said he'd put me on
the list for the show tonight.

597
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,010
- Good for you.
- You're going, too, right?

598
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,129
What do you want, a ride in the limo?

599
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,516
Are you gonna change before the show?

600
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:38,269
I take off the jacket,
it's a whole nother story.

601
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,223
All right.

602
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,478
Goulet wants to record an original
song, I think we should let him do it.

603
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:48,288
Throw him a bone.

604
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,338
You're the one who thinks
we're getting evicted,

605
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,949
so if you want to do it...

606
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,151
You're the one who wants
new material, okay?

607
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,570
He's got a fresh idea.
It's worth trying.

608
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:59,657
Got him in here anyhow. Not like
we got to hire an orchestra.

609
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,292
You know, while we're here arguing

610
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:03,494
and they're sitting in the
studio burning up the hour...

611
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,079
I said yes.

612
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,997
What, you want it in a telex?

613
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,171
Richie, you're signing the Nasty Bits.

614
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:17,508
- You can do it in Julie's office.
- Can't I get one minute?

615
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,927
No. They've been sitting here
for the entire afternoon.

616
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,147
- Try and look excited, okay?
- Shut the fuck up.

617
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:27,101
Hey, there they are. The Bits.

618
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,186
We were listening to your
demo this afternoon.

619
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:32,022
- It was so hot, set my office on fire.
- Shit.

620
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,741
Cece's gonna open a bottle of champagne

621
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,276
so we can all get shit-faced, okay,

622
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,444
before you throw your chop on the line.
Come on.

623
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,415
Get in there, you nasty Nasty Bits.

624
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:43,033
Hey, coffee.

625
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:45,536
We want to go over a couple
of deal points first, yeah?

626
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,338
Yeah, okay. Sure.

627
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,040
Our manager's gonna join. He
just went to take a leak.

628
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:53,460
You got a manager? Good, one
less thing to figure out.

00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:56,180
- Yeah, there he is.
- Great.

630
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,015
You two go back, right?

631
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,718
I don't need to do no introductions.

632
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,868
Fuck.

633
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:20,120
Piece of sh...

634
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,500
Hey, you got to buy that, man.

635
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:36,670
What the hell are you doing?

636
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,055
You can't touch that.

637
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,925
I'm gonna have to call my manager.

638
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,094
You take this off the
platter, I'll get you fired.

639
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,680
Okay, sunflower?

640
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,267
Hey, why is my Donny
Osmond display shoved

641
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,436
in the back of the window behind
the dueling fucking banjos?

642
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:54,939
People love those banjos.
That fucking retarded kid.

643
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,273
But I paid you for the front row.

644
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,658
I want to see Donny Osmond's face.

645
00:32:57,777 --> 00:32:58,859
He's got half a nose out there.

646
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:01,445
Okay, okay. I'll fix it.

647
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:04,582
Okay, Mario just sent you
an overrun of the Osmond.

648
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,450
I want you to hold off
on it for a while.

649
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,035
- You kidding me?
- No.

650
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,954
Put the whole operation on
ice for a couple of months.

651
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,257
Fuck that. I got two dozen
copies of that fucking record.

652
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,009
I want my return money.

653
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:18,045
No, you can return what you'd
have normally. No extras, okay?

654
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,381
'Cause I got accountants crawling
up every orifice this week.

655
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,050
- That's your problem, man.
- Oh, you want to blow the whole gig?

656
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,218
You don't need the extra cash?

657
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,970
They pay you so much as a manager

658
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:28,138
of shoving paper clips up his ass,
you don't want a cut anymore?

659
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:29,640
Why can't Mario take them back?

660
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,141
Because Mario's a fucking asshole.

661
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:32,443
Like you're a fucking asshole.

662
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,194
He gets a cut, you get a cut.

663
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,363
- I'm the only one taking risks.
- Oh, you don't get a cut?

664
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:39,650
You bought that shit-brown Camaro on
what you won betting on the Mets?

665
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:42,786
I take plenty of risk. Howard's been
sniffing around here all the time

666
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:44,371
now that his wife left him.

667
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,156
And I'll tell you what
risk I'm not gonna take.

668
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,909
I'm not storing 50 boxes of
illegal Donny Osmond albums.

669
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,377
I'm gonna lose my job.

670
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,829
I just bought a bumper pool table.

671
00:33:51,914 --> 00:33:53,464
I can't be out of work right now.

672
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:02,172
You destroyed my office!

673

That's 10 grand worth

Let me ask you something.

679
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,187
In what universe do you
think these shit palms

680

681

Richie, we got to swing.
Show's gonna start.

682

Yeah, I'll meet you there.

683
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,413
Uh, should I take the limo?

684
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:29,783
How about you take a cab? Is
that too much of a hardship?

685
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,587
30 grand advance.

686
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:36,173

Get the fuck out of my office.

00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,512
They have a right to
preserve their sound.

690

You don't give a crap about their sound.

691
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,549
You tripped over them in my lobby.

692
00:34:45,634 --> 00:34:47,601
They have a raw energy.
I want to protect that.

opener, motherfucker.

789
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:29,833
I'm here to see you.

790
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:31,468
I don't care whose label you're on.

791
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:33,337
I'm a fan of your music, man.

792
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:35,889
He's smooth.

793
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,091
Hey, you better play "Up
the Kleedle" tonight.

794
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:39,760
- It's my favorite song.
- Gogo!

795
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:43,180
We got "Up the Kleedle" on
the list tonight? Put it on.

Richie, Cece's on the phone.

840
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,400
She says Jackie Jervis is at the
show and he's all over Hannibal.

841
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,935
Are you fucking kidding me?

842
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,903
- Do you want to talk to her?
- No.

843
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:39,439
No, just tell her to keep
him away from Jervis.

844
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:41,158
Offer to blow him in the corner.

845
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:42,993
Some fucking thing. I'll
be there in 10 minutes.

846
00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:45,028
Hannibal or Jervis?

847
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,248
What?

848
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,534
Should she offer to blow?

849
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,170
It's an expression.

850
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:56,423
Hannibal should the opportunity arise.

851
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:59,509
Tell Leo to bring the car around. Fuck.

852
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:06,633
What are you doing?

853
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,553
Those two guys right there
want to talk to you.

854
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:12,022
They're detectives.

855
00:43:12,107 --> 00:43:14,107
Why'd you let them back here?

856
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:15,725
Well, nobody's out front.

857
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:17,894
I'm covering Cece's desk
so you're not alone.

858
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,830
Should I...

859
00:43:18,855 --> 00:43:21,255
Well, I think at this point,
you got to let them in.

860
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,035
Hey, guys. What's up?

861
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:28,822
What happened here?

863
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:31,958
Oh, sprinklers.

864
00:43:32,077 --> 00:43:33,827
- Wow.
- Yeah.

865
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,079
It's not really a good time.

866
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:37,881
Besides, I already talked to Voehel.

867
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:40,834
Somebody's got your hoe in the same row.

868
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:41,918
Voehel?

869
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:43,970
Yeah, Detective Voehel.

870
00:43:45,507 --> 00:43:48,258
I hate to eavesdrop, but did
I hear one of the gals say

871
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:50,093
Robert Goulet was here today?

872
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:51,895
- Yeah.
- Is he making a record?

873
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,480
- Yep.
- I knew it.

874
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,149
That's terrific. When
can I purchase a copy?

875
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:58,818
Christmas. It's a Christmas album.

876
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh, what you gonna call it?

877
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,322
I don't...
I don't know.

878
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,824
Something like "Robert
Goulet's Christmas Album."

879
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,493
Oh.

880
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,778
How about something in a neighborhood
of "Christmas With Bob"?

881
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:11,164
- Hmm? Does he go by Bob?
- Yeah, he does.

882
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:12,866
Guys, how can I help?

883
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,368
Is it standards or new material?

884
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:19,589
Mostly standards.

885
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:22,375
Hmm.

886
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:23,793
You weren't at Buck Rogers' funeral.

887
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,596
We thought we'd catch you there.

888
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:29,382
Yeah, I wanted to come. Got detained.

889
00:44:29,468 --> 00:44:30,967
Oh, with what?

890
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:33,019
Something happen at the funeral?

891
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,305
The mother was really...

892
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,390
...undone.

893
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:39,276
Did you know her?

894
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,727
No.

895
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,646
No, we were business acquaintances.

896
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,197
No social interaction at all?

897
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:47,484
No. I mean, look, I'm in a business

898
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:50,070
where professional interaction
has a social component.

899
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,905
Did you two chat on the phone a lot?

900
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,240
- We spoke.
- Yeah, we saw that.

901
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,159
Saw what?

902
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,995

00:48:44,105 --> 00:48:45,355
I'll try you in the morning.

951
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,621
You good. Thank you.

952
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:18,341
Enjoy your drink and
we're gonna do the same.

953
00:51:49,124 --> 00:51:51,074
You still dry?

954
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,160
No.

955
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,663
Pour him a drink.

956
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:03,836
He's got a fat wallet, so...

957
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:05,972
pour everybody a drink.

958
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,566
What do you want?

959
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:21,270
Maybe I just...
I wanted to see you.

960
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:24,857
Hey, Papa.

961
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,911
I've come home, Papa.

962
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:30,696
Hold me, Papa.

963
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:33,699
Fuck you.

964
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,379
I need an alibi.
