1
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,890
- Thanks for taking us to the movies.
- You're welcome, Donna.

2
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,253
See you at school tomorrow.

3
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,089
I'll wait for you at cheerleading tryouts.

4
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,361
Yeah, I think I'm gonna skip it this year.

5
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,959
Why?

6
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,535
Well, my mom doesn't think
it's such a good idea, you know,

7
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,267
- with all that's happened.
- She's probably right.

8
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,777
There's only one spot left on the team,
and one of us has to get it

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,676
so that Crissy doesn't.

10
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,010
What did that poor girl do to you two
to make you hate her so?

11
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,380
Where do you want me to start?

12
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,380
See you tomorrow. Bye.

13
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,511
Bye.

14
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,398
<i>They had an 8 and 2 record in 1941,</i>
<i>when they won the Rose Bowl at Duke.</i>

15
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,029
I'm home.

16
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,465
Dad?

17
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,793
Joey?

18
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,103
I almost killed myself on this!

19
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,901
Joey?

20
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,536
Did you hear me, butthole?

21
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,439
Hey!

22
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,040
Turn the TV down.

23
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,979
Where is she?

24
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,887
Where is she?

25
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,521
She's not here!

26
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,093
I swear to God!

27
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,237
Oh, help me, somebody!

28
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,802
Please, don't.

29
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,070
She belongs to me.

30
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,912
Where is she?

31
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,442
- I know you know, you're her mother.
- No!

32
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,317
Tell me where she is!

33
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,584
She's at a sleepover.

34
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,124
Please, don't.

35
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,995
Help me! Help me! Please, stop! Stop!

36
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,054
Help me!

37
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,961
I did it for us.

38
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,739
No!

39
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,740
And then what happens?

40
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,570
And then I wake up, just like I always did.

41
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,812
Well, like I told you before,

42
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,685
the nightmare is an associate form
of reliving the real experience.

43
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,348
It's to be expected.

44
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,618
I know.

45
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,656
I just...
They went away for such a long time.

46
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,092
I can't believe they're back.

47
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,791
Donna, it's going to take
more than three years.

48
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,099
You're doing amazingly well.

49
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,735
Think of him only as a phantom to you now.

50
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,637
He was caught and put away forever

51
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,239
2,300 miles away.

52
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,750
The only place that he can hurt you
is in your dreams.

53
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,947
I just thought they stopped.

54
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,591
Psychological trauma often heightens
during times of transition.

55
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,127
And you don't need me to tell you
that your life is in transition.

56
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,463
High school is coming to an end,
college in the fall.

57
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,595
The uncertainty
that comes with being an adult.

58
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,835
The memories of that night
will come and go and fade with time,

59
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,107
but you will never forget it.

60
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,107
Just like you'll never forget tomorrow night.

61
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:36,588
But hopefully that will be a memory
that you'll always want to remember.

62
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,524
So, tell me,

63
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,219
what color is your dress?

64
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,896
It's a champagne color
with pink and gold beads and it's corseted,

65
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,060
so it's a little sexy.

66
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,934
Oh, it sounds pretty.

67
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,131
If you want to talk about sexy,

68
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,768
you should see Lisa's dress
with that plunging neckline.

69
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,675
Ronnie's gonna love you in it.

70
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,680
Yeah, he's gonna love me
even more out of it.

71
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,748
I made sure Ronnie got
the biggest limousine he could find.

72
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,790
I can't actually believe
that Michael is helping spring for the limo

73
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,883
and a two bedroom suite
with Ronnie and Bobby.

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,088
It's prom night.
That boy's planning on getting laid.

75
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,994
Yeah. In his dreams maybe.

76
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,625
All right, Donna. Have a look.

77
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,734
Oh, it looks good. I like it.

78
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,646
- Donna?
- What?

79
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,012
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

80
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,608
What time did Bobby say
to be ready for the limo?

81
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,921
- 7:00.
- Oh, I'm so excited.

82
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,526
- He's going to be here soon, Donna!
- Okay, Aunt Karen!

83
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,865
She's come so far.

84
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,507
Going to her senior prom.

85
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,065
Oh, I'm sorry.

86
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,196
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

87
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,101
Sorry.

88
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,040
No, no, it's okay.

89
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,872
Have you stopped taking your pills?

90
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,218
Yeah, for like a week now.

91
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,285
You know what Dr. Crowe said.

92
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,989
I know, I just...

93
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,628
I don't want to be numb tonight.

94
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,033
I wanna remember everything.
Everything that happens.

95
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,969
Besides, you know, it's my prom.
I'm supposed to be really anxious, right?

96
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,738
Of course you are.

97
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,673
Gosh, you look so beautiful.

98
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,810
Thanks.

99
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,785
You are gonna have so much fun.
This is gonna be a great night.

100
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,189
Oh, my God! He's here.

101
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,124
Don't worry.

102
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,554
Here.

103
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,337
I know she would want you
to wear it tonight.

104
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,874
No, no. What if I get something on it?

105
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,709
She would be so proud of you.

106
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,017
Come here.

107
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,420
Thank you.

108
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm gonna go downstairs
and tell Bobby that you're almost ready.

109
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,020
Okay.

110
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,192
Thanks.

111
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,076
I wouldn't be getting
a scholarship or anything, not my first year.

112
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,081
But I think if I work really, really hard...

113
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,884
You look beautiful.

114
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,420
Thanks.

115
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,902
You look so good. You clean up very well.

116
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,742
Thank you.

117
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,746
It's so pretty.

118
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,251
Yeah. Four hours with the flower lady.

119
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,015
- Did you pick it out yourself?
- Kind of.

120
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,616
Did not!

121
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,521
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

122
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,296
- Thank you.
- Here, I can do this.

123
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,460
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Oh, my God!

124
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,399
You totally scared me.

125
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,939
- Perfect.
- Photo op.

126
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,375
Okay, ready?

127
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,274
- So cheesy.
- Okay. One, two, three, four, five.

128
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:30,906
There we go.

129
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,779
We're trusting you.

130
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,452
- I went to prom once...
- Honey, honey. It's okay.

131
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,728
I know, sir.
You have nothing to worry about.

132
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,999
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

133
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,535
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.
- Come here.

134
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,506
- I love you guys.
- Have a great time, all right?

135
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,508
- Thank you.
- Good night.

136
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,340
I cannot wait to get there.

137
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,444
You look awesome!

138
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,581
Let's get to the goddamn prom.

139
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,591
You guys look so pretty!

140
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,753
Well, not the guys,
the guys look very handsome.

141
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,948
Wait, now guys get in.

142
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,146
You know Crissy is going
all Hollywood with her theme this year

143
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,281
since she's the president
of the prom committee.

144
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:50,727
I heard that she spent $100,000 over budget
and her dad had to write a check.

145
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,855
- Stop it!
- He's totally pissed!

146
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,923
I wish that was my daddy.

147
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,264
Rich bitch, one word.

148
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,133
- Oh, hyphen.
- $100,000?

149
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,605
Come on, more pictures! Pictures!

150
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,828
Next?

151
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,071
Great. Perfect.

152
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,406
- Hey, Winn.
- Yeah, that's Detective Winn to you, kid.

153
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,509
This just came in for you.

154
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,114
What?

155
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,190
<i>- Biller here.</i>
- This is Detective Winn from Bridgeport PD.

156
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,198
I'm calling about a fax
concerning the escape of Richard Fenton.

157
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,029
What the hell is going on?

158
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,197
<i>We just received word from the hospital</i>
<i>of Fenton's escape on Wednesday evening.</i>

159
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,399
Why'd it take three goddamn days
to notify us?

160
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,408
<i>Sorry, sir. I needed to notify the court.</i>

161
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,878
- Damn it, I don't believe this.
- What is it?

162
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,438
This is a case I had three years ago.
Hey, Jones, get me a car?

163
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,778
Come on.

164
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,654
High school teacher, he got crazy obsessed
with a young female student.

165
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,314
They fired him. That didn't stop it.

166
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,293
Then the family got a restraining order
against him and he went psycho.

167
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,389
She got home from the movies,
he didn't know she was there.

168
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,365
She hid under the bed
and had to watch him kill her mother.

169
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,696
Oh, my God.

170
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,794
We arrested that son-of-a-bitch at his house.

171
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,074
<i>We found journals of this guy</i>
<i>having fantasies about this girl.</i>

172
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,939
<i>He had pictures of her everywhere.</i>

173
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,610
That was pretty hard for her, too,
she had to ID him.

174
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,344
<i>You got something to say, Mr. Fenton?</i>

175
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,478
Nothing can keep us apart.

176
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,746
- That's him.
<i>- She needs me now more than ever.</i>

177
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,386
She has no family.

178
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,950
- I see what you're trying to do.
- All she has is me.

179
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,724
- Hey, listen to me.
- You know we love one another?

180
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,025
- Ask Donna.
- Can we go now, please?

181
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,128
Are we almost done here?

182
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,639
Donna makes me feel,
and when I touch her...

183
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,472
That's enough!
Don't look over there, look at me!

184
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,205
- Can we go now, please?
<i>- We'll be together forever.</i>

185
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,803
You're gonna be in jail!

186
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,542
We'll be together forever.
That's my promise.

187
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,843
That's enough. We're going.

188
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,316
All right, you're going to jail.

189
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,446
<i>I'll see you soon, Donna.</i>

190
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,089
<i>We matched DNA,</i>
<i>his prints were everywhere,</i>

191
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,491
<i>so her IDing him sealed the deal.</i>

192
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,054
As far as we were concerned,
he was going to die. Definitely.

193
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,566
The jury didn't think so.
No, they came back with insanity.

194
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,868
He's been in a maximum security prison
for the criminally insane

195
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,965
<i>up until three days ago.</i>

196
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,475
What happened to the girl?

197
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,480
Well, she's got an aunt and uncle
that live here. They took her in.

198
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,374
After the trial,
things settled down a little bit,

199
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,682
- until she started getting the letters.
- Letters?

200
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,486
Yeah, and some sick shit, too.
Hang tight, kid.

201
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,994
I'm gonna go tell the aunt and uncle.
This is gonna rock their world.

202
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,196
- Oh, we're turning in! We're here!
- Are we here? Yeah!

203
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,400
Holy crap!

204
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,513
We're here!

205
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,947
Talk about Hollywood.

206
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,394
You look lovely.

207
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,037
Nice try, Mr. Nichols. Bad boy.

208
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,365
Oh, God!

209
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,635
May I help you, sir?

210
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,709
Donna Keppel, you look incredible.

211
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,577
And Claire, you, too.

212
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,272
And Lisa, wow!

213
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,042
That dress, it's so...

214
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,610
Inappropriate?

215
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,921
Crissy! Wow, your dress...

216
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,818
It's so simple.

217
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,188
It's so you.

218
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,522
Girls.

219
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,721
Gentlemen?

220
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,701
Crissy, come on, this is prom.

221
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,603
Okay, let's just all be nice,
and just forget about the past.

222
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,076
As fellow prom queen nominee,
I want to wish you luck tonight.

223
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,547
You're gonna need all you can get.

224
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,577
Oh, you think you got it all wrapped up,
do you?

225
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,918
Well, they're certainly not propped up
and on parade like yours are,

226
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,582
that's for sure.

227
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,825
- You know what, I'm so sick...
- Baby, baby, she's not even worth it.

228
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,427
Look, you're gonna be queen,
I'm gonna be your king, all right?

229
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,194
Look, I'm gonna go get the keys right quick.
I'll be back.

230
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,601
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

231
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,831
Lisa, you really do look beautiful.
I just know you're gonna win.

232
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,434
Well, thanks, Ms. Waters.

233
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,571
- Have fun.
- Bye.

234
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,673
I know who she voted for.

235
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,379
- She is so in love with you.
- Shut up.

236
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,182
<i>Bridgeport High, huh?</i>

237
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,352
<i>Come on, now. What's up, everybody,</i>
<i>and welcome to the prom of all proms!</i>

238
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,555
- Oh, my God! Look at this place!
- Hey, look at me on the big screen.

239
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,655
<i>Bridgeport High, make some noise!</i>

240
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,660
<i>Yeah!</i>

241
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,935
<i>My name is DJ Tyler.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be hosting the events tonight.</i>

242
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,469
<i>This has to be the greatest prom on Earth.</i>

243
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,773
<i>Brought to you also by Crissy Lynn.</i>
<i>I see you over there, girl. Yeah!</i>

244
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,682
<i>Congratulations, Bridgeport High,</i>
<i>to all 206 of you graduates.</i>

245
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,447
<i>It's time to get the party started!</i>
<i>Get out there and get your party pumping!</i>

246
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,850
<i>Now, it's time for a little Consequence.</i>

247
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,255
I mean, you gotta hand it to Crissy, though.
This is amazing!

248
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,762
Wait, does this mean
we can't make fun of her anymore?

249
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,185
Nah!

250
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,917
And just so you know,
our fitness center will be closed

251
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,082
because of the renovations being done
on the mezzanine level.

252
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,422
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey.
If I can just get your autograph.

253
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,430
Can I get three keys to suite 312?
I have it reserved under Ronnie Heflin.

254
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,997
One moment.

255
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,501
All right. There you are, Mr. Heflin.

256
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,937
Thank you.

257
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,239
Do you have a preference
as to which floor, Mr. Ramsey?

258
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,438
Third floor would be great.

259
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,309
You really outdid yourself, Crissy.
I mean, we really appreciate it.

260
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,651
Thanks. I wanted it to look
just like an L.A. Club.

261
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,518
I mean, nobody can believe it, right?

262
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,092
- One for you.
- Thank you.

263
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,600
One for you.

264
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,902
- And one for...
- We're going up to the room to freshen up.

265
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,531
Why, baby? You look great.

266
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,441
That's correct!
You're doing very well tonight.

267
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,378
But I'll look even better when I get back.

268
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,610
Well, let's go get a table,
before they're all gone.

269
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,115
Oh, hold that door.

270
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,156
Thank you.

271
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,328
Oh, man.

272
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,194
So...

273
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,867
Which one of you beautiful young women
is my date tonight?

274
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,606
So, we're gonna take this party upstairs,
ladies. Room 604.

275
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,444
Yeah, we'll... Be right up.

276
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,949
Lisa!

277
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,452
- 604.
- Right. Got it.

278
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,818
Come on.

279
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,725
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- Sixth floor.

280
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,064
Excuse me. What's his problem?

281
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,264
Oh, my God.

282
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,804
The one on the end looked like my dad.
I swear.

283
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,396
Kind of, yeah!

284
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,673
That one guy was kind of cute.

285
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,513
- No!
- No!

286
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,446
Oh, my God!

287
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,313
Oh, my God, you guys!

288
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,751
Come here, come here, come here!

289
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,567
Excuse me?

290
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,732
My card, it doesn't seem to work.
Can you help?

291
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,954
Here's your problem, it's got a scratch.

292
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,162
Call the front desk, and someone
will bring you a replacement card.

293
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,968
Thank you very much.

294
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,167
One more thing.

295
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,007
Can I have some extra towels?

296
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
Sure.

297
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,421
Jack?

298
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,752
Detective Winn.

299
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,260
- Is she here?
- No, no, she's not.

300
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:00,853
- She's at her senior prom, why?
- Jack, I gotta talk to you.

301
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,365
Come outside.

302
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,202
What's going on?

303
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:12,369
Jack, it's Richard Fenton.
He escaped from jail three days ago.

304
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,604
He's at large.

305
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,612
How could it take so long
for us to be notified?

306
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,349
Jack, I think we should bring Donna home,
just to be safe.

307
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,981
I can't take a chance. I gotta put
a unit on your house, you know that.

308
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,455
All right?
And I'm gonna put backup on the hotel.

309
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,127
No.

310
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,982
Thank you.

311
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,391
For what?

312
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,161
For tonight.

313
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,922
For everything.

314
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,197
Well, you're welcome.

315
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,832
I am pretty awesome.

316
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,531
- At prom, you're gonna talk about this?
- I don't understand...

317
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,577
Hey, what's going on
with Claire and Michael?

318
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,269
Oh, same ol', same ol'.

319
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,040
He's freaking out because
she's going away to college. You know.

320
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,186
Babe, they'll be fine.

321
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,718
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

322
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,054
- What's going on?
- Michael. He's making me so damn mad.

323
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,928
And on top of that, I have killer cramps.

324
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,337
Don't let a stupid argument
ruin your prom night, okay?

325
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,168
And I have Midol up in my purse.
I'll go get it for you.

326
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,605
Thank you.

327
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,510
Is everything okay?

328
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,342
Yeah, I need the key to the suite.
I gotta go get something for Claire.

329
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,474
- I'll just go with you.
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.

330
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,322
Thank you.

331
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,613
Patrol car just pulled up.

332
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:21,421
I don't understand how you could not bring
her home with that maniac on the loose.

333
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,565
And Detective Winn, he said he wanted
to bring her home, you said that...

334
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,366
I know, I know, I know.

335
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,803
But he also said that there's no reason
to believe that Fenton's headed this way.

336
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:36,040
And, honey, if we show up at her prom,
in front of all her friends,

337
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:42,509
what's that gonna do to all the progress
that she's made over the past three years?

338
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,957
Do you remember how many nights
she woke up screaming?

339
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,424
I just don't ever want that little girl
to go through that again, do you?

340
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,395
No, of course I don't.

341
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,123
- But I'm so scared.
- I know, I know.

342
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,781
Hello?

343
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,683
Is anybody here?

344
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,233
Claire?

345
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,673
Bobby?

346
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,243
Is that you?

347
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,852
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

348
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,386
You scared the hell out of me!

349
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,150
Are you okay?

350
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,388
No.

351
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,621
What happened?

352
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,724
Michael thinks I'm going away to school
just so I can date other guys.

353
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:14,295
He just went ballistic because
he saw me talking to Rick. He's impossible.

354
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,401
I'm sorry.
Here, take these, it'll make you feel better.

355
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,043
Thanks.

356
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,714
Do you want me to hang out with you,
until you want to go back downstairs?

357
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,810
No. I'm just gonna fix my face,
then I'll come back down. Thanks.

358
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,818
How are you doing?

359
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,454
I'm good.

360
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,624
- You look beautiful.
- You look beautiful.

361
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:43,498
Okay, I'll go request some J.T.,
we'll dance, we'll have fun.

362
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,331
See you down there.

363
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,841
Donna?

364
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,385
Michael?

365
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,019
Michael? What are you doing?

366
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:24,790
Mr. Fenton?

367
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,023
- Nash.
- I'm at Pacific Grand.

368
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,491
Our girl's got the senior prom tonight.

369
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,825
I want you to get Hicks, Stryker, Ansen,
and Grant, get them in plain clothes,

370
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,125
<i>get them over here ASAP.</i>

371
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,927
Why, is something wrong?

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,127
<i>No, and that's exactly how I want to keep it.</i>

373
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:02,366
By some chance this bastard decides
to come here, we're gonna be ready for him.

374
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,839
You got it.

375
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,610
Hey. Detective Winn, Bridgeport PD.
How are you?

376
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,411
Doing fine, thanks.

377
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,213
Have you seen this man tonight?

378
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,882
No. Who is this guy, anyway?

379
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,584
Oh, he's just someone I'm looking for.

380
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,159
He dangerous?

381
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,795
Do me a favor, why don't you make
copies of that, give it to your staff.

382
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,697
- Let me know if anyone sees him.
- Will do.

383
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,938
You got exits here.
How many exits you got?

384
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:42,110
- Two outside fire stairwells.
- Let me see that. Yep.

385
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,512
There's the loading dock in the back.

386
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,641
Stairwell from the basement.

387
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,416
Three fire exits lit up on the ground floor,
in the main entrance.

388
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,991
- Can I keep this?
- It's all yours.

389
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,458
Okay, great. Thank you very much.

390
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,594
Should I be concerned?

391
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,789
No.

392
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,472
<i>All right, folks.</i>
<i>You looking real good out there tonight.</i>

393
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,036
<i>But what I'm gonna do is,</i>
<i>I'm gonna slow it down just a little bit,</i>

394
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,276
<i>because I don't want you</i>
<i>to sweat out your good clothes.</i>

395
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,114
<i>On your way to the dance floor, though,</i>
<i>fellas, grab your girl</i>

396
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,778
<i>and thank your man Ronnie out there.</i>

397
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,621
<i>Ronnie Heflin is sending this song</i>
<i>out to his girl, Lisa Hines.</i>

398
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,219
<i>So, we gonna get that busy right now.</i>
<i>Here you go, folks.</i>

399
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,447
You wanna dance?

400
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,418
What's going on?

401
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,832
I'm thinking about going to State
with you next year.

402
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,093
Why?

403
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,929
I don't know.

404
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:20,134
I guess I just don't think I'm ready
to be so far away from home.

405
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:25,107
If we were at State together,
then we'd get to see each other all the time.

406
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,441
I mean, if you wanted to.

407
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,618
No, I would love that.

408
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,589
I mean, I would. I mean, you know I would.
It would be amazing.

409
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,887
But?

410
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,186
But nothing, Donna.

411
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,388
You got into Brown with a full scholarship.

412
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,424
I mean, you don't just throw that away
for anything, or anybody.

413
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,937
It's not that I don't want
to be near you next year.

414
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,036
It's just that...

415
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,070
That would be really selfish of me.

416
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,547
And I'd always know in the back of my head
that I was the reason

417
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,916
that you didn't get a big-time
lvy League shot at the world, you know?

418
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,513
But what if this long distance thing
doesn't work out?

419
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,223
I mean, look what's happening
with Michael and Claire.

420
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,956
And Claire's gonna be only a two hour drive
away from him next year.

421
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,590
Claire and Michael are not you and me.

422
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,458
Not even close.

423
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,463
Right?

424
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,337
What is it?

425
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,034
I'm scared.

426
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,307
It just feels like

427
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,907
everything's falling apart.

428
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,945
And I'm scared of losing you.

429
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,318
I'm scared that somebody else
is gonna come along

430
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,913
and find out how amazing you are.

431
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,152
If this is real, it'll last.

432
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:48,390
I think we've been through some
pretty rough times already, don't you think?

433
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,097
- Yeah.
- Donna, you gotta stop being scared, okay?

434
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,796
Because there's nothing left to be scared of.

435
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,539
I promise.

436
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,079
Hey, you guys seen Claire lately?

437
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,308
Yeah. She's up in the suite.

438
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,017
What the hell is she doing up there?

439
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,543
You pissed her off, Michael.
She's been crying her eyes out.

440
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,149
You can't keep doing this to her.
You're gonna lose her.

441
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,123
Yeah, I doubt that.

442
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,067
Claire and Michael, exhibit A.
Nothing like us.

443
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,330
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

444
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,100
Claire?

445
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,109
Claire?

446
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,875
Are you here?

447
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,959
Are you in there?

448
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,167
Come on, babe.
Look, I don't want to fight anymore, okay?

449
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:35,228
Honestly, I promise. I'm gonna stop
bugging you about going away and all.

450
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,304
I'm just gonna deal with it, okay?
I swear to God.

451
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,079
Claire, please, don't do this.

452
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,215
All right. Fine.

453
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:57,957
I'm just gonna sit out here.
I'm just gonna wait for you to come out.

454
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,998
I don't care how long it takes.
I got all damn night.

455
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,855
All right.

456
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,452
Claire,

457
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,820
what do you want me to say?

458
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,968
You want me to say that I'm sorry?

459
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,506
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

460
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,075
Claire, look, I really am sorry, Claire.

461
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,740
Look, don't let my being an idiot
ruin our prom, okay?

462
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,616
Okay? Claire?

463
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,487
All right, where'd you go?

464
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,032
Claire?

465
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,774
Gotcha!

466
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:29,848
But I already said I was sorry.
What else do you want me to say, huh?

467
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,726
This is getting silly. Enough already.

468
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,641
Claire?

469
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,147
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

470
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,710
<i>I did not know you partied like that</i>
<i>here at Bridgeport!</i>

471
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,279
<i>Man, you done wore me out up here!</i>

472
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,619
<i>I tell you what though, I'm gonna take me</i>
<i>a little 15-minute break.</i>

473
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,956
<i>But while I'm gone,</i>

474
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,658
<i>the AV department put together</i>
<i>a nice little yearbook for you, so enjoy that.</i>

475
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:53,260
<i>And when I come back, this year's</i>
<i>prom king and prom queen, all right?</i>

476
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,066
<i>See you in a minute.</i>

477
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,918
Hey, let's go upstairs.

478
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,549
They're gonna announce king and queen.

479
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,524
DJ's taking a break, and then he's gonna
come back and play a couple other songs.

480
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,959
You don't care about this at all, do you?

481
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,825
What's to care about?

482
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,928
What if Ronnie wins king instead of you?

483
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,228
What if he does?

484
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:29,238
He's her boyfriend.
I have to be crowned with her boyfriend?

485
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:32,833
Look, Ronnie's the starting quarterback.
All-city two years in a row.

486
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,606
Yeah, Crissy, you could do a lot worse.

487
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,678
Besides, maybe you won't even win.

488
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,615
All right, look, I'm gonna go upstairs,
just call me when it's time, okay?

489
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,897
If he were any dumber I'd have to water him.

490
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,601
I wanna make a toast

491
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,969
to my little queen.

492
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,743
No matter what happens.

493
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,003
Cheers.

494
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,151
If that bitch wins, I swear

495
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,386
I'll hurl.

496
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:24,088
Okay, I'm sorry, but just explain to me
why do you care so much?

497
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,320
Because what do you get?

498
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,331
You get like a bouquet of roses and
a tacky tiara you can only wear at proms.

499
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:34,497
It's not about what you get.
It's, like, about the honor, you know?

500
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,301
It's about the respect of my peers.

501
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,368
- What?
- Your peers?

502
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,212
- That's the geekiest thing you've ever said.
- Okay, I guess it was a little geeky.

503
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:50,617
But seriously, I just want Crissy to know
that she can't buy everything.

504
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,282
And think about the reunions to come.

505
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,418
If I win, it'll eat away at her
till the day she dies.

506
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,122
That's awful.

507
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,256
You're so sexy
when you're mean and vindictive.

508
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,423
All right.

509
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,365
How's it going?

510
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,311
Yeah, well, so far so good.
Anything your end?

511
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,404
No.

512
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,714
Which one is she?

513
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,411
She's the blonde, at the back table.

514
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,544
She's pretty.

515
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,155
And alive. And I want her to stay that way.

516
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,929
Guys.

517
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,534
This is it.

518
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,974
This is all ending, this time of our lives.

519
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,668
You know, everyone always says that
prom is supposed to be this amazing time

520
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,943
that everyone looks forward to
since the beginning of freshman year.

521
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,245
But no one ever tells you

522
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,843
it's really sad, you know?

523
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,289
Because some of us are never
gonna see each other again.

524
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,622
- Except for us!
- Oh, thank you.

525
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,184
We'll see each other all the time.

526
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,231
Well, I don't know about any of them, but...

527
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,691
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.

528
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,432
Ronnie, I'm gonna be 100 miles away.
I'm not going too far.

529
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,964
And I'll be home on the holidays.

530
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,874
And Claire's only gonna be two hours away.

531
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,571
- Where is Claire?
- Oh, yeah.

532
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,946
- Where's Michael?
- Maybe they're still in the suite.

533
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,345
Where we should be.

534
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,046
All right, stop.

535
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,549
You know what,
we're gonna give you guys some space.

536
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,683
- Yeah, we'll be right back.
- I think that's a good idea.

537
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,659
Come on, Maria. Where are you? Maria?

538
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,720
<i>Are you there?</i>

539
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,928
<i>Hello?</i>

540
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,468
Hey, Simms, come here.

541
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,505
Have you seen Maria?
412 needs a turn down

542
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,510
and I'm trying to get her on her walkie,
but she doesn't answer.

543
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,513
I've got this for 304.
I'll check and see if she's there.

544
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,276
All right, thanks.

545
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,242
- Great, thanks.
- Thank you.

546
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,953
Evening, sir.

547
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,336
Maria?

548
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,405
Excuse me, sir?

549
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,374
Yes.

550
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,510
Did you happen to see
the housekeeper up here?

551
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,687
She's right here in my room.

552
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,627
Turning down the bed.

553
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,568
Thank you.

554
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,602
Maria?

555
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,025
Hey, yo, Bobby, let me talk to you for a sec.

556
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,795
Me and Lisa are gonna head up to the suite,

557
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,961
see what's taking
Michael and Claire so long. All right?

558
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,699
Right. Just make it quick, all right?

559
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,400
Five minutes, max.

560
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,006
Is that all?

561
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,566
Very funny.

562
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,106
If you do see Michael and Claire,
tell them to get their butts down here.

563
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,671
Will do. Bye.

564
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,848
Where are they going?

565
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,080
Upstairs to the suite for a little alone time.

566
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,419
I'm not sleeping in that bed.

567
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,473
- I'm having a great time.
- Me, too.

568
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,615
I'm sorry.

569
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,247
Gotcha.

570
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,618
Look, come on, baby.

571
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,558
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

572
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,989
That guy, he looks so familiar.

573
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,493
His eyes.

574
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,692
Baby, your eyes are so...

575
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,517
- Where is it?
- The very back of the hotel's parking lot.

576
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,357
Come on, we ain't got a lot of time.

577
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,328
I swear that I know
that guy from somewhere.

578
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,488
Look, know him or want to get to know him?

579
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,124
Don't be stupid.

580
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,967
Did you see how he looked at me?
I mean, his eyes were so...

581
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,934
God, I swear I've seen him
some place before.

582
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,671
Why don't you stop
thinking about him, right?

583
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,775
Think about me, okay?

584
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,452
<i>There you go, Bridgeport.</i>
<i>That's how you do a prom, everybody.</i>

585
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:09,190
<i>You need to come to the parking lot.</i>
<i>I think we got something.</i>

586
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,195
<i>All right, I'm gonna have to ask you</i>
<i>to move on out the way.</i>

587
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,296
<i>Clear the dance floor, because</i>
<i>this is the end of my time right now.</i>

588
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,364
<i>It's time for me to bring to the stage,</i>

589
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,969
<i>the prettiest P.E. Teacher</i>
<i>I've ever met in my whole life.</i>

590
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,481
<i>Ms. Waters, everybody,</i>
<i>because she's about to announce</i>

591
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:29,481
<i>this year's prom king and prom queen.</i>
<i>Here we go!</i>

592
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,916
<i>Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry.</i>

593
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:36,550
<i>Let's give it up for DJ Tyler</i>
<i>for giving us an awesome prom.</i>

594
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,565
<i>All righty.</i>
<i>Now, I have in my hot little hand here</i>

595
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,726
<i>Bridgeport High School's</i>
<i>prom king and prom queen.</i>

596
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,366
<i>Will the nominees please</i>
<i>join me here up on stage?</i>

597
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,773
<i>For prom queen I have,</i>
<i>Crissy Lynn, Lisa Hines...</i>

598
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,471
- They gotta get down here.
- I know, I know.

599
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,570
<i>... Michelle Evaretti, and Katie Higgins.</i>

600
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,308
<i>Come on up, girls!</i>

601
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,153
<i>- What's goin' on? You've reached Ronnie.</i>
- Straight to voicemail.

602
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,315
Try him on the house phone.

603
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,395
<i>All righty, and prom king is Rick Leland,</i>

604
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,092
<i>Ronnie Heflin, Michael Kelley,</i>
<i>and Dennis Long.</i>

605
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,667
A woman over in Woodburn
filed a missing persons on her husband.

606
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,435
She said that he would take the train
to work every day in Portland,

607
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,875
but he would always
leave his car at the station.

608
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,775
But he didn't come home last night.

609
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,947
Open it up.

610
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,120
No wallet, no ID, no credit card, no money.

611
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:43,455
And the car was registered to
a Howard K. Ramsey, our missing person.

612
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:49,657
<i>What about these decorations, everybody?</i>
<i>The prom committee, sensational job.</i>

613
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,637
You're so beautiful.

614
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,453
Jesus Christ!

615
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,046
- Of course! It's him, it's him!
- Look, enough already.

616
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:17,116
No, I gotta get to Donna!

617
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,562
I don't believe this.

618
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,869
Come on!

619
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,336
Damn it!

620
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,026
- Why the rush?
- Oh, God!

621
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,969
It must be off the hook.
They're not answering the room either.

622
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,703
Well, you better go up and try to find them.
I'm sorry. Be fast!

623
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,738
Oh, my God!

624
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,047
Lisa?

625
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,358
Lisa?

626
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:50,127
<i>- Ronnie Heflin, Lisa Hines.</i>
- Oh, here's Ronnie! Here's Ronnie.

627
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:51,537
Hey, where's Lisa?

628
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,473
I don't know. She said she came down
here to tell you that...

629
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,137
Oh, maybe she's in the bathroom.
Okay, you get up on stage. Go, go.

630
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,976
<i>- Ronnie, please.</i>
- Sorry. I'm right here.

631
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,278
Give me the key to the suite.
I'm gonna go try to find her in the bathroom.

632
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,683
If she's not there, I'll go check upstairs.

633
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,885
Where the hell is she?

634
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,712
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

635
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,059
<i>Has anyone seen Lisa Hines?</i>

636
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:58,131
Excuse me, sir. Howard K. Ramsey,
is he registered here? Ramsey.

637
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:02,175
Yes, sir. Room 309.

638
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,574
Okay, here's what we're doing.
You stay here by the front door.

639
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,115
You tell the guys at the exits
what's happening,

640
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,481
- and get me some backup, okay?
- You got it.

641
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,577
Give me a room key to room 309.

642
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,325
Mr. Ramsey.

643
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,938
Ah, damn it.

644
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,588
No. No, he's here. He's killed a maid.

645
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:23,649
<i>Cover all the doors.</i>
<i>I'm gonna pull the alarm.</i>

646
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:27,184
I want the entire place cleared immediately!
We'll flush him out.

647
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,926
Find Donna Keppel and put her
in protective custody now! Nash, now!

648
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,094
All right. You got it. Stryker, watch the door.

649
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,871
<i>All right, we're gonna</i>
<i>have to start without her.</i>

650
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:44,141
<i>Bridgeport High's</i>
<i>prom king and prom queen are...</i>

651
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,887
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.</i>
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

652
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,193
<i>- Please stay calm. Quiet, please.</i>
- Everyone, please, quiet down!

653
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,524
I'm Detective Nash
with the Bridgeport Police Department.

654
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,659
I am going to need you
to exit the hotel through the lobby.

655
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,772
Now, there's no reason to panic.
The Fire Department will be here shortly.

656
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,340
They were just about to
crown king and queen!

657
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,572
People! I'm not kidding, here!
Please, let's move, now!

658
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,138
This will have to wait, all right?

659
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,047
- The hell it will!
- Crissy!

660
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,514
Shit!

661
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,391
Oh, my God! You have to be kidding me!

662
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,473
Lisa?

663
01:00:56,052 --> 01:01:00,421
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.</i>
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

664
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,394
Keep it moving, people.

665
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,591
Crissy, what's going on?
Where's everyone going?

666
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,996
- Hey, Rick? What's going on?
- I don't know, but we gotta go outside.

667
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,673
I forgot my mom's shawl upstairs.

668
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,801
If you see Bobby can you tell him
I'll meet him outside?

669
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:22,936
Thanks.

670

<i>Alert! Please exit the building.</i>
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

672
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,823
<i>will you please come</i>
<i>to the front of the stage?</i>

673
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:44,094
Excuse me. Why are you looking for Donna?

674
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,532
Why? Do you know where she is?

675
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,432
- She went looking for my girl.
- Where?

676
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,130
Women's restroom
and then up to the third floor.

677
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,194
Why?

678
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,034
Hey, what's the problem?

679
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:58,308
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>Keep this area clear for emergency vehicles.</i>

680
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,610
<i>Stay on the sidewalk.</i>

681
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:18,395
<i>Alert! Please exit the building.</i>
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

682
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,808
Lisa?

683
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,940
Claire?

684
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,812
Hello?

685
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,695
Oh, I've missed you.

686
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,129
There isn't a moment where
I haven't thought about you, Donna.

687
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,106
Please, don't do this.

688
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,203
Don't be afraid.

689
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,938
Donna!

690
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,413
Get out!

691
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:41,705
No!

692
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,517
No!

693
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,169
Donna, open up.

694
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,808
Open up!

695
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,544
Donna!

696
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,213
No!

697
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,611
No!

698
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,096
Leave me alone!

699
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:40,728
Ansen, Grant, I need these people back!
Push them 50 yards back!

700
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:42,896
Get them back here, put it right there.
Come on! Let's go!

701
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,906
You gotta be all the way back
to the sidewalk, all right?

702
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,771
- Winn.
- Where is she?

703
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,332
I don't know. They got separated.

704
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,845
- He said she went to go look for her friend.
- What the hell is going on?

705
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,540
Why won't anybody
tell me why you're looking for Donna?

706
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,640
Hey, man. She went back up
to your suite to get something.

707
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,551
Move, move, move!

708
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,146
She told me to tell you just to wait here.
She'd come back down.

709
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,487
You couldn't tell me sooner, Rick?

710
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,186
Did you see Lisa?

711
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,753
No.

712
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,230
Donna?

713
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,738
Donna, stop!

714
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,402
He's in there, he's in there,
he's in there, he's in there!

715
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,381
Claire's under the bed and she's dead!
She's dead!

716
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,714
- Get her out of here, Nash.
- You have to help me, please.

717
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,916
Hey! Donna! Donna!

718
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,851
Bobby. Bobby. Oh, my God! Bobby!

719
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:50,221
- Yeah, come on. Here. You okay?
- Donna, get in the car. Please.

720
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,658
- I'm going with her.
- Okay, get in the car.

721
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,423
Can he come with me?

722
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,660
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
- I won't. I'm coming, I'm coming, baby.

723
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,826
- Look, what's happening?
- Hold on.

724
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,927
I talked to your aunt and uncle.
They know what's going on, okay?

725
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,131
- I'm gonna take you home, all right?
- Look, did you see Lisa?

726
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,537
Claire's dead.

727
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,834
What'd you say?

728
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,247
Bobby! Wait!

729
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,739
Wait!

730
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,443
Clear a lane here, please!

731
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,179
Yeah.

732
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,589
He's somewhere in this hotel,
because all the exit points are covered.

733
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,921
We're gonna tear this place apart,

734
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,087
room by room, floor by floor,
until we get him.

735
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,187
How's the girl doing?

736
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,630
Yeah, she's safe.
And her boyfriend's with us, too.

737
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,894
Keep that house completely covered
until I find this guy.

738
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,629
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

739
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,242
My girlfriend is missing, and I need to know
what the hell is going on!

740
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,838
I'm sure she's out here somewhere,
all right? Just take a look for her.

741
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,177
Okay, let's go!

742
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:55,417
We'll find her.

743
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:59,552
Here it is. We have three dead.
One maid, two kids, okay?

744
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:03,257
We've had all the exits covered all night,
so there's no way he got out.

745
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,665
I want to start on the ground floor,
and work our way up.

746
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:10,603
The hotel already knows what's going on,
so let's get to work. Come on, let's go!

747
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:14,541
Hey, Hicks, do me a favor,
get all those people to go home. Everybody.

748
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,271
Consider it done.

749
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,476
Hey, is everybody out?

750
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,414
- Yes, sir.
- I think so.

751
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,046
Lisa?

752
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,658
Donna!

753
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:41,495
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God you're safe!

754
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,865
- It's all happening again.
- It's okay.

755
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,203
- Bobby, you okay?
- Yes, sir, I am.

756
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,539
I called my parents
and I told them what was happening.

757
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,239
- I'd like to stay with Donna tonight.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

758
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,678
Come on inside.

759
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,181
Mr. Turner, please.

760
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,144
- I'm Detective Nash.
- Hey, how are you?

761
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,911
How many entrances are on the house?

762
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:03,084
There's the front and the back, what?

763
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:05,726
Tell me you've caught this animal.

764
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,631
- I can't find Lisa!
- We are looking for her.

765
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:20,607
I've got some missing students inside.
I want to know what you're doing about it.

766
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,166
We are doing the best we can.
Please, be patient.

767
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,388
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We're finishing fourth floor, north exposure.</i>

768
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:39,987
Someone said that Claire was murdered,
and Michael and Lisa are missing.

769
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,927
- We all clear?
- We're all clear.

770
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,131
Let's close it up.

771
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,373
Over here.

772
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,412
Jesus.

773
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:14,056
<i>... faculty, staff, and guests,</i>
<i>to evacuate onto the streets.</i>

774

01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,406
<i>a night that was supposed to be</i>
<i>one of the greatest nights in a student's life</i>

777
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,103
<i>may have ended tragically</i>
<i>in the historic Pacific Grand Hotel.</i>

778
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,678
What's going on, Detective?

779
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,874
This is an active crime scene investigation.

780
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,474
If we have any more information to share,
you will be the first to know.

781
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,019
Is it true that a student was murdered?

782
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,487
And that other students
at the prom are missing?

783
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,387
- Can you give us anything?
- Detective?

784
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:47,425
<i>The SWAT teams are engaged at the hotel.</i>
<i>Guests were evacuated and cleared.</i>

785
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,119
Look, we're just down the hall
if you need anything.

786
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,962
What are you doing?

787
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:29,401
Checking to see if there's
any news on what happened.

788
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:35,272
<i>Three students may have been</i>
<i>injured or killed in this historic hotel.</i>

789
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,069
They're dead.

790
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,013
They're dead, Bobby. They're dead.

791
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:45,315
- No, you still don't know that.
- Michael, Lisa and Claire, they're all dead.

792
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,945
He killed them.

793
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,384
They're dead because
he was trying to get to me.

794
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,225
No, Donna. This is not your fault, okay?

795
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:58,089
This is not you, okay? This is him.

796
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,963
This is him, and they're gonna catch him,
okay? I promise.

797
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,231
How?

798
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,905
How can you promise me that?

799
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,047
I'm sorry.

800
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,777
Okay. Okay, come on.

801
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:25,320
Listen to me, I'm gonna be here, okay?

802
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:28,927
I'm gonna be here watching over you, okay?

803
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,479
Sorry, two, sir, is right here. Girl.

804
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,216
We got a positive ID from Ronnie Heflin.

805
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,554
His girlfriend was the female victim
we found up on the construction level.

806
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:06,100
- How's the kid doing?
- Not so good.

807
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,331
That's it. We turned the place upside down,
no sign of him anywhere.

808
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:13,568
What do you wanna do about the press?
They're getting kind of antsy.

809
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:15,866
I don't know.

810
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,447
I don't know.

811
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,343
What is that?

812
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,923
What the hell is that?

813
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,293
Get me a ladder. Get me a ladder!

814
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,429
Let's move this bed.

815
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,815
Come on, come on, put it right here.
Who's got a flashlight?

816
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,008
Jesus!

817
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,103
- Oh, my God.
- It's Simms!

818
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,240
- Hey, is everybody out?
- I think so.

819
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,613
Damn it. He walked right by me.
Move, move!

820
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:39,291
- Hey, has anybody talked to Nash?
- 10 minutes ago. Everything was cool.

821
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,507
- Nash.
- Hey, Fenton's out. He's not at the hotel.

822
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,274
Copy that. We're on it.

823
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,115
<i>What's the status with the family?</i>

824
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:07,053
They all went upstairs
about an hour and a half ago.

825
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,113
There's a light on in Donna's bedroom.

826
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,422
All right. I'm gonna call
and let them know what's happening.

827
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,826
<i>- Copy?</i>
- Yeah, you got it.

828
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:26,073
<i>She's not supposed to be with somebody</i>
<i>else, she's supposed to be with me.</i>

829
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,632
<i>There was even the song on the radio.</i>

830
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,775
- Donna?
- Oh, my gosh!

831
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:31,936
You scared me.

832
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,948
- You okay?
- Yeah.

833
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,145
- I thought you were sleeping.
- No.

834
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,687
No, I was just resting my eyes.

835
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:44,186
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

836
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,658
<i>It's not like you hear the song</i> Mandy
<i>on the radio every day.</i>

837
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,787
<i>I haven't heard that song in like ten years.</i>

838
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,278
What?

839
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:57,121
<i>The number you have reached is not</i>
<i>in service at this time. This is a recording.</i>

840
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:59,296
Were you sleeping?

841
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,961
No. I was just resting my eyes, okay?

842
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,534
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

843
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,442
<i>It's not like you hear the song</i> Mandy
<i>on the radio every day.</i>

844
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,916
<i>I haven't heard that song in like ten years.</i>

845
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,703
<i>The number you have reached is not</i>
<i>in service at this time. This is a recording.</i>

846
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,002
No, it can't be. It can't be.

847
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:02,359
I can't get through.
Something weird's going on with the phone.

848
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,022
Get in there and check it out!

849
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,500
- Everything is secure, sir.
<i>- Get in there and check it out right now!</i>

850
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,799
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

851
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:41,224
Nash!
I told you to get up in there and call me!

852
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,525
Nash?

853
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,939
Thank you for staying.

854
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:59,377
Bobby?

855
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,447
Hey. Hey.

856
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:56,731
Donna?

857
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:06,206
Be quiet, or they'll find us.

858
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:24,789
Oh, my God!

859
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,802
One of your guys is down in the backyard.

860
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:35,206
It's okay. It's okay.

861
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,340
Are you ready to go with me?

862
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,351
No!

863
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:07,933
Help!

864
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,101
Call me an ambulance.

865
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,475
I've got officers down,
I need backup, now, now!

866
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,570
Where is she?

867
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:16,716
- Let me go!
- Stop! Stop!

868
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,514
- Get off me!
- Donna!

869
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,353
No!

870
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,020
Bobby?

871
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,125
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

872
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,298
I'm sorry.

873
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:10,132
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay.

874
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:15,907
It's over.

875
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:26,876
It's over, it's over. Okay?
