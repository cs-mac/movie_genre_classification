1
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,437
<i>When the court
officer smiled at me</i>

2
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,740
<i>on the morning of trial,
I knew I was fucked.</i>

3
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,576
<i>They weren't taking
bets on this one.</i>

4
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,211
<i>Mike had killed his father,</i>

5
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,112
<i>Boone Lassiter,</i>

6
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:34,581
<i>left his handprint on the knife,</i>

7
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,949
<i>confessed.</i>

8
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,476
<i>Half my cases had
evidence this bad.</i>

9
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,777
<i>I just pled them out,</i>

10
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,112
<i>got manslaughter and moved on,</i>

11
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,882
<i>but this was Mike, and I'd
known him all his life.</i>

12
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:13,017
<i>He was going to college
and probably law school,</i>

13
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,119
<i>and I doubted his mother
could survive him</i>

14
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,889
<i>going to the penitentiary.</i>

15
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,969
<i>But I knew Boone, I had that,</i>

16
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,171
<i>and I knew enough about
the Lassiter household</i>

17
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,839
<i>to know that Mike had a defense,</i>

18
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,342
<i>if he would just talk to me.</i>

19
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,802
- Jim.
- Morning.

20
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:18,704
Flyin' solo on this one?

21
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,158
<i> Section 34 of the
judicial district court</i>

22
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,693
<i>of the state of Louisiana</i>

23
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:43,694
<i>in and for the parish
of St. Bernard</i>

24
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:45,363
<i>is now in session.</i>

25
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,732
<i>The honorable judge
Robichaux is presiding.</i>

26
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,700
<i>Order and silence are commanded.</i>

27
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:52,802
God save the state of
Louisiana and this court.

28
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,404
All rise

29
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,640
<i>for the honorable
Edouard Robichaux.</i>

30
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,850
Bring 'em in.

31
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,325
<i>Good morning, jury.</i>

32
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,663
Please be seated.

33
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,831
<i>The court
will come to order</i>

34
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,934
<i>in the matter of the state of
Louisiana versus Michael Lassiter,</i>

35
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,936
<i>on the charge
of first-degree murder.</i>

36
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,672
Jury, you should
know the defendant

37
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,072
is still a minor...

38
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,708
<i>Six weeks shy
of his 17th birthday.</i>

39
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,010
<i>But due to the seriousness
of the charges,</i>

40
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:37,879
<i>the case was transferred
to this court,</i>

41
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:40,815
where he is being
tried as an adult.

42
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:42,183
<i>Counselors.</i>

43
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:50,424
Gentlemen, you both have
toiled in my courtroom before,

44
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:52,893
so you know how I
appreciate a swift trial.

45
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,061
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,901
<i>Good morning.</i>

47
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,770
Thank you for your service.

48
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:07,107
The case before you today
is a simple one,

49
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,476
a simple case of patricide.

50
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:12,111
Now, that's the killing
of one's father.

51
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,980
The defendant is the young
man that you see over there,

52
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:18,217
<i>Mike Lassiter.</i>

53
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:19,719
<i>He's a senior at Newman.</i>

54
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:21,320
He's a good student,

55
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:24,457
co-captain of
the debate team.

56
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,992
This past February, however,

57
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,394
on a Tuesday afternoon,

58
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,495
Mike took a knife,

59
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:33,264
and he stabbed his
father, Boone Lassiter,

60
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,866
right here.

61
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,370
Not by accident,

62
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:42,340
not in
self-defense.

63
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,509
He did it out of anger.

64
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:48,313
<i>With premeditation
and malicious intent,</i>

65
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:51,115
<i>he murdered his father.</i>

66
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:55,352
<i>We'll prove this beyond
a reasonable doubt.</i>

67
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:58,288
<i>Now, you may hear,
from the other side,</i>

68
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,425
<i>that the victim, Mike's dad,</i>

69
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,427
<i>wasn't such a good guy,</i>

70
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:05,529
that he was tough on his son,

71
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,298
that he bullied him.

72
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,033
But Boone Lassiter
isn't on trial here

73
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,969
for father of the year.

74
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,173
<i>He may not have
been the best dad,</i>

75
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:20,042
<i>but the evidence will show
he wasn't the worst.</i>

76
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:22,478
You want me to put you down?

77
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,815
<i>Plenty of people grow up
without the best dads.</i>

78
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,350
- There!
- Aah!

79
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:30,318
<i>It doesn't give anyone
the right to murder.</i>

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,921
Aah!

81
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,223
<i>Therefore, at the
conclusion of this case,</i>

82
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,324
<i>I'll ask you</i>

83
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:40,195
to return a verdict of guilty

84
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:42,197
of murder in the first degree.

85
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,300
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- If you don't talk to me,

86
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,836
I have to waive my opening.

87
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,338
<i>Counselor?</i>

88
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,075
Your honor,

89
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,077
the defense reserves its right

90
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,846
to an opening statement

91
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:02,116
until after the prosecution
presents its case.

92
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:05,085
Well, we are speeding along.

93
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:07,454
Your first witness ready?

94
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,026
Can you see if Angela
Morley's out there?

95
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,869
<i> Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,</i>

96
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,537
<i>and nothing but the truth,
so help you god?</i>

97
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,306
<i>I do.</i>

98
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:27,373
<i>Your name, please.</i>

99
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,441
Angela Morley.

100
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,277
- <i>And your occupation?</i>
- Flight attendant for deluxe charter.

101
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,013
- And deluxe is?
- A private airline.

102
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,617
People buy timeshares and we
fly them all over the world.

103
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,353
- <i>Affluent people?</i>
- Yes, very.

104
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,388
<i>The victim, the deceased,</i>

105
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,958
<i>Mr. Boone Lassiter,
he was one of these people.</i>

106
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,359
<i> Yes.</i>

107
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,627
<i>And were you always
on his flights?</i>

108
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,263
Most of them.
He'd request me.

109
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,532
And when did he
last fly with you?

110
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,134
The last week of January,

111
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,203
to la and back
with his son Mike,

112
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,138
and then round trip to Dallas.

113
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
<i>And what was the
purpose of these trips,</i>

114
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,009
<i>if you remember?</i>

115
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,278
The second, Dallas,
was business.

116
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,480
The first was to
take Mike, his son,

117
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,148
to look at colleges...

118
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,284
<i>UCLA and Stanford.</i>

119
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,120
<i>We were supposed to go up
to Oregon to see, I think,</i>

120
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,556
<i>Reed, but they decided
to come home instead.</i>

121
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,591
Listen.

122
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,493
It's your call,

123
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,996
but Stanford is one of the
top schools in the country

124
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,131
and you got in early.

125
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,399
I mean, look, I'm
happy to go to Reed,

126
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,167
check it out, but...

127
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,403
<i>It's weird.</i>

128
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,172
<i>Maybe we should just declare
victory and head home early, huh?</i>

129
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,042
Surprise your mom?

130
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,577
<i>And how
would you characterize</i>

131
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,913
<i>the relationship
between father and son,</i>

132
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,382
<i>between Boone and Mike?</i>

133
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:49,317
The trip home got kind of tense.

134
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:51,352
Mike seemed like
a typical teenager,

135
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:54,489
sullen with a little attitude.

136
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,324
Listen, we're gonna skip
Portland and head back.

137
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,926
- Tell the guys for me, will you?
- Okay.

138
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,200
You think you're old enough to
handle a piece of ass like that?

139
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:12,139
<i>You don't
know why Mike was sullen.</i>

140
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:13,607
No.

141
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:15,175
Thank you.

142
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,545
<i>Ms. Morley.</i>

143
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:21,581
I've never been
on a private plane.

144
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,250
Help me out here.

145
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:26,353
The customer can bring
whoever he wants with him.

146
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:28,221
Yes.

147
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,222
Mr. Lassiter would
do that sometimes.

148
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:31,991
Of course.

149
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,093
- <i>Men and women.</i>
- Sure.

150
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,594
Other lawyers, mostly.

151
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,630
And on the trip to Los Angeles,

152
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,366
he brought his son.

153
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:41,968
<i> Yes.</i>

154
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,437
Yours is a service
industry, right?

155
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,638
Yes.

156
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,039
And it's competitive.

157
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,607
Very.

158
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:51,509
<i>So you have to provide
good service.</i>

159
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,511
Naturally.

160
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:56,114
Did you like servicing
Mr. Lassiter?

161
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:58,149
Pardon me?

162
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:00,352
<i>I'm asking if
he was a good client.</i>

163
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,322
Yes.

164
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:07,058
He was professional, but fun,

165
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,293
pleasant to be around.

166
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,194
<i>Ms. Morley,</i>

167
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,529
<i>when Mr. Lassiter
brought a woman,</i>

168
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:17,134
or women with him on the plane,

169
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:20,137
did you ever leave their
names off the manifest?

170
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,172
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

171
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,708
<i>Women on the manifest?
How is this relevant?</i>

172
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,276
Your honor.

173
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:31,247
<i> Do you have a proffer of
evidence on this, Mr. Ramsey?</i>

174
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,416
- <i>Your honor...</i>
- Do you or do you not

175
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,684
have evidence for this court?

176
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,419
Not at this time.

177
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,555
<i>You're fishing.
I'll allow it.</i>

178
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,093
<i>Now, step back.</i>

179
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,695
You may answer the question.

180
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,732
It would be against the law

181
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:54,169
to omit passengers
from the manifest, so, no,

182
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,138
of course they never did that.

183
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,211
No further questions.

184
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,480
<i>You picked up Mr.
Lassiter and his son</i>

185
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:06,681
<i>at the lakefront airport.</i>

186
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,183
That's correct,
around 4:00.

187
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,154
<i>And the next
morning, 7:00 A.M.,</i>

188
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:14,488
<i>you drove
Mr. Lassiter again.</i>

189
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,190
That's correct,
straight to the airport.

190
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:17,725
Was there anything unusual?

191
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,727
No, nothing at all.

192
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,598
<i>When he
returned, two days later,</i>

193
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
on the evening of the murder,

194
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:28,302
you again dropped
him at his home.

195
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:31,404
<i>That's correct.</i>

196
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,274
<i>Did you
notice anything unusual?</i>

197
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:36,209
No, nothing.

198
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:38,745
<i>Anything or anyone
out of the ordinary?</i>

199
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,313
No one.

200
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,183
Thank you.

201
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:44,517
Nothing further, your honor.

202
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,324
Did you ever pick up women for Mr.
Lassiter...

203
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:54,126
Objection, your honor.

204
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,494
Withdrawn.

205
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,396
Sit down,
Mr. Ramsey.

206
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:01,767
<i>You're excused.</i>

207
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,437
This is what losing looks like,

208
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,339
but it's the best I can do
until you start talking to me.

209
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,114
<i>Boone fucked
everything that walked.</i>

210
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:19,250
<i>It didn't relate to the case,
but it made Boone look bad.</i>

211
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,787
<i>I figured Loretta knew and didn't
care as long as it helped Mike.</i>

212
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,255
<i>Mr. Ramsey,
I'm Janelle Brady.</i>

213
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:25,490
You're too late.

214
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:27,258
No, I'm not.
I wasn't...

215
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,126
Just as we feared.
Juror number three.

216
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:30,660
Gave you the stink eye
after you crossed?

217
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:32,896
Yeah, I caught it.

218
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,531
Janelle Brady, Jack Legrand.

219
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,666
Janelle is
Walter Brady's daughter.

220
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:39,769
I asked him to sit second chair
for me, but he couldn't.

221
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,905
He recommended Janelle.

222
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,341
Her dad is also famous
for being late,

223
00:13:44,343 --> 00:13:46,810
but never to court.

224
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:47,811
Are you kidding me?

225
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:48,811
Concerned women for America?

226
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:50,646
Don't even ask.

227
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,214
<i>I was sitting in
the back the whole time.</i>

228
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,816
You missed jury selection.

229
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,819
I know, I'm sorry.
I tried calling.

230
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,855
I'm on trial. I don't answer
my phone when I'm on trial.

231
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:02,291
Well...

232
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:06,195
We still got two blacks, two single
moms, and an unemployed white kid.

233
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:08,196
Shit.
That ain't no guarantee.

234
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,198
- <i>Call you this afternoon.</i>
- Keep on it.

235
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,503
You want a job or not?

236
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,808
Ramsey.

237
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:23,945
Five minutes.

238
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,246
Okay.

239
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,782
Legrand's your jury consultant?

240
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,553
Ran out of challenges,

241
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:35,255
and got stuck with
juror number three...

242
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:37,891
Heiress to oil money
with nothing to do

243
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,894
but worry about people
stealing from her.

244
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,829
She's the kind that thinks

245
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:47,334
the death penalty
isn't severe enough.

246
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,602
<i>So besides being
Walter Brady's daughter,</i>

247
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,404
tell me who you are.

248
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,542
I graduated Vanderbilt '07,

249
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:58,344
Columbia for law.

250
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,745
Won all my mock trials,

251
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:02,415
then came back home
to work at Morris and Duprey,

252
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,219
but the corporate grind wasn't
my thing, so I took a year off.

253
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,587
To do what?

254
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,624
Regroup.

255
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:15,493
In river oaks?

256
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:16,761
Thanks, dad.

257
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:18,330
They put you on meds?

258
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,667
No shame in it.

259
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,770
I spent 18 months on antidepressants.
You still on 'em?

260
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:27,771
A low dosage.

261
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,241
<i>'Cause once
I introduce you in court,</i>

262
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:32,243
you can't decide halfway through

263
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,412
that it's not your thing.

264
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:38,249
I'll be there.

265
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,552
Your dad says you've got a
world-class bullshit detector.

266
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,753
Who lied this morning?

267
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,822
On the stand, you mean?

268
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,523
They don't teach
this in law school.

269
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:48,725
Yes, all witnesses lie.

270
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,927
About what?

271
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,796
Keeping their jobs,

272
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:56,966
winning the case, money...

273
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,402
Most people skim... morality.

274
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:02,739
<i>We all want to be good
little girls and boys.</i>

275
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:04,907
Sex... just assume everyone's
screwing everyone else

276
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:06,542
unless proven otherwise.

277
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:11,380
<i>And the big one,
avoiding humiliation.</i>

278
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:14,416
You'd think folks would be scared
of prison or lethal injection.

279
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,985
Nope.

280
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:19,655
It's loss of face.

281
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:22,458
And this morning,
the flight attendant...

282
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,062
Angela Morley?

283
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:28,297
She seemed evasive

284
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,999
when you asked about
passenger manifests,

285
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:34,303
looked at her hands
after she answered.

286
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:37,506
I guess Lassiter
took women on his flights.

287
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:41,443
And she didn't want to lose her
next job admitting as much.

288
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,544
Next?

289
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,881
The limo driver...

290
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:49,583
Went out of his way to say he
drove straight to the airport.

291
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:52,520
So maybe they stopped
to pick up a woman?

292
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:55,456
And me?

293
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,091
What did I lie about?

294
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,462
You've been on a private plane?

295
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,598
And since we walked
in this room?

296
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,801
You've never taken an
antidepressant in your life.

297
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:11,071
Not unless bourbon counts.

298
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,039
<i>As you heard,</i>

299
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,342
<i>my client isn't
speaking to anyone,</i>

300
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:17,510
including me,

301
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:20,613
which means I have to defend him
without knowing all the facts,

302
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:23,616
which means I'm finding
out the facts on the fly.

303
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:27,453
So if your bullshit detector
goes off, you tell me.

304
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:31,423
Other than that,
you're window dressing.

305
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,560
A mixed-race woman at the table who
thinks your client is innocent.

306
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:37,096
That's the deal.

307
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,031
Your honor.

308
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,532
I wish to introduce my associate

309
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,368
Janelle Brady to the court.

310
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,436
Relation to Walter Brady?

311
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,039
<i>Yes, your
honor, his daughter.</i>

312
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,606
Fine lawyer.

313
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,583
I got a call at 4:42 P.M.

314
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:01,386
Domestic violence, possible 187.

315
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,588
And 187 is?

316
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,056
Homicide.

317
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,791
And this is late afternoon
on February 4th.

318
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:09,025
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

319
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,527
<i>And you responded?</i>

320
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,162
I was the closest car.

321
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,098
<i>I didn't know whether</i>

322
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,167
<i>I should wait
for backup or go in,</i>

323
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,703
but I was told the situation
was under control,

324
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:21,805
<i>so I went in.</i>

325
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:33,015
Please hurry.
It's my husband.

326
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,030
Who is that?

327
00:18:49,032 --> 00:18:51,599
Michael, our son.

328
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,834
<i>What did you do first?</i>

329
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:55,970
I made sure the victim was dead.

330
00:18:58,007 --> 00:18:59,174
<i>He was.</i>

331
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,910
<i>Hello? Loretta?</i>

332
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,512
I called our lawyer.
I'll go.

333
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,784
I should've done this
a long time ago.

334
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,856
<i>What, if
anything, did Mike say?</i>

335
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,461
"I should've done it
a long time ago."

336
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,962
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

337
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:23,597
This is inconsistent

338
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,865
with the officer's
prior sworn statement.

339
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,834
Judge, I'm simply clarifying...

340
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:30,603
Officer steed's
police report states...

341
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:33,239
"Should've done this
a long time ago,"

342
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,741
not "I should've."

343
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,877
Without a pronoun, my
client might have meant,

344
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,046
"someone should've done
this a long time ago,"

345
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:43,649
suggesting that
someone else did.

346
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:44,884
Continue.

347
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,686
Well, which was it?

348
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:48,587
Hang on a second.

349
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,959
Yes, I'm sure.

350
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:57,629
He said, "I should've done it
a long time ago.

351
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,098
I should've done this
a long time ago.

352
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,915
<i> How long did it take
the other officers to arrive?</i>

353
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,184
Only a few minutes.

354
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,520
I told the lawyer, mister, um...

355
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,921
<i>Mr. Ramsey.</i>

356
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,923
Yes, sir, I told him,

357
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,891
I need the boy to step
away from the body.

358
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,896
Mike.

359
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,297
He needs to step back.

360
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,669
Honey?

361
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,237
We need to leave the room now

362
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,606
so the police can do
their work, okay?

363
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:52,981
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
both to stay nearby.

364
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:55,951
<i>Thank you.</i>

365
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:58,320
No further questions,
your honor.

366
00:20:58,322 --> 00:20:59,955
Mr. Ramsey?

367
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,792
<i>You're excused.</i>

368
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,829
We're in recess until
9:00 A.M. in the morning.

369
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:12,266
You see, Mike? You see how
it sounds in open court?

370
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,101
"I should've done this
a long time ago."

371
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,137
To a cop? Really?

372
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,573
Unless you start talking
to me, we're going down.

373
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,007
<i>All rise.</i>

374
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:29,215
Why won't he talk to you?

375
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:32,586
That's the problem with
people who refuse to speak.

376
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:33,728
They never say why.

377
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,327
You're cocky for a kid
going to prison for life.

378
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:42,596
- Did he say anything to you?
- Loretta Lassiter,

379
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:43,997
Janelle Brady.

380
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:45,632
- Hi.
- Hi.

381
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:47,733
Is he talking?

382
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:50,736
- Loretta...
- Ramsey, I'm terrified!

383
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:52,338
You can't let him go to prison.

384
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,273
Relax, Loretta.
It's the first day.

385
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,874
He's a boy.

386
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:58,110
The papers make him
look like some monster.

387
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,278
I know.
I know that.

388
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,013
The way it sounds in there...

389
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,781
It always sounds bad
in the beginning.

390
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,817
I want to see him.
Can I see him?

391
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:05,918
Yeah, if you can get down there

392
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,385
before they put him in the Van.

393
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:17,295
What a horrible position
for her to be in.

394
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:21,332
Yeah, mother of the
accused is never easy.

395
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,368
Loretta's, actually,
compared to some...

396
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,670
She's pretty calm.

397
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:29,640
- Where's your car?
- Oh, around the corner.

398
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,408
They sent you to c lot?

399
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,015
Room 254 at the Marina hotel.

400
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,918
Our war room.

401
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,954
You don't have an office?

402
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:45,288
Yeah.

403
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,356
People there who expect me
to return phone calls

404
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:51,060
and answer emails
and god knows what.

405
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:53,896
Everything we need
is in room 254.

406
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:56,666
Witness statements, police
reports, coroner's report.

407
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,335
Are you coming?

408
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:03,005
Got it all up here, I hope.

409
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,107
Tomorrow, 9:00, okay?

410
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:14,349
<i>I doubted miss
Ivy league corporate law</i>

411
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:18,219
<i>would come back when she saw
what she was getting into.</i>

412
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:19,821
<i>But just sitting
there beside Mike,</i>

413
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:21,289
<i>she would help him look</i>

414
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,958
<i>less like a spoiled rich kid
or a sociopath,</i>

415
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,727
<i>maybe even get him to talk.</i>

416
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,164
<i>Funny thing
was, I second-seated</i>

417
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,166
<i>my first murder trial
with Boone.</i>

418
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:11,436
<i>It was a case where a teenage
mother suffocated her own infant,</i>

419
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:15,173
<i>put him in a garbage bag,
and threw him in the bayou.</i>

420
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:19,144
<i>The pictures alone
convicted her.</i>

421
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,879
<i>But Boone kept saying,</i>

422
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,316
<i>"if you can stand her,
so can the jury."</i>

423
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:26,884
<i>He had me talk to her,
put my hand on hers.</i>

424
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:29,186
<i>Every day I told her
she looked pretty.</i>

425
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:31,355
<i>Those little things counted.</i>

426
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:33,524
<i> Please, tell us,
how did you know the deceased?</i>

427
00:24:33,526 --> 00:24:36,894
He was my neighbor
for the last 15 years.

428
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:38,295
<i>Your next-door neighbor?</i>

429
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:39,296
Yes.

430
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,031
And were you friends?

431
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:43,067
I liked Boone.

432
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:45,302
My wife found him entertaining.

433
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,870
Do you do that down thing?

434
00:24:46,872 --> 00:24:48,304
The down thing?

435
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:49,906
<i>Our son Alexander</i>

436
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:52,976
<i>was a classmate with Mike
at Newman,</i>

437
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:54,778
so we took down the fence
between the yards

438
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,312
so that the boys
could play together.

439
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,782
How would you describe
the relationship

440
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,517
between Boone and Mike?

441
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,419
Very close.

442
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:05,789
<i>Loretta was sort of
the odd woman out.</i>

443
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:12,227
<i>Mike wanted to be
a lawyer like his dad.</i>

444
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:14,196
See the lawyer?

445
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,799
Dressed too fancy.
Jury's not gonna like him.

446
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,801
<i>Mike was a very quick study.</i>

447
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,203
He became kind of
a legal junkie.

448
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:23,338
He was a very, very bright kid.

449
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,208
When Mike was 12, he wanted
to go to forensic camp.

450
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,811
I'm sorry.
Forensic camp?

451
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:31,813
Well, it's like "CSI," you know?

452
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,948
You learn how to
break down a crime scene.

453
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,584
<i>Anyway, when he got back...</i>

454
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:39,954
Well, there was something
going on on our block.

455
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,424
Someone had poisoned
a neighbor's cat.

456
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:47,394
And Mike, I don't know how...

457
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,364
<i>But he figured out who did it.</i>

458
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,867
Yeah, got his picture
in the paper.

459
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:55,368
<i>Now, this closeness,</i>

460
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,972
<i>the bond between father and son,</i>

461
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,542
did that continue until
the death of the victim?

462
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:04,344
No, no.

463
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,911
Something happened.
I mean, I don't know,

464
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:08,280
it might've been, you know,

465
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:12,551
adolescent rebellion,
but it came out...

466
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:16,989
Well, I guess it was about eight
months before Boone died.

467
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,958
<i>Well, I don't
want to give offense</i>

468
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,527
<i>to any of you candy-ass
liberals here,</i>

469
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,063
<i>well, maybe, if you get...</i>

470
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,197
Well, look.
I'm not stupid, okay?

471
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,867
I'm gonna vote
for my own self-interest.

472
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,369
Of course.

473
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:34,305
Everyone should
vote their own interest.

474
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:37,876
That's how democracy's
supposed to work.

475
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:39,344
<i>Is that so?</i>

476
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:43,114
Well, sure.
I mean...

477
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,149
I was just agreeing with you.

478
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,921
I was agreeing with you.

479
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,157
You were?

480
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,364
"Of course."

481
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,635
You said
"of course."

482
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:09,138
As if I said something obvious.

483
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,407
Come on, Boone.

484
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:13,442
Maybe you're a
little drunk, huh?

485
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:15,311
I am drunk.

486
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:17,313
And tomorrow,

487
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:20,116
I'm gonna wake up
with a big hangover.

488
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,118
And you...

489
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,687
<i>You're still gonna be stupid.</i>

490
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:30,158
Now listen, nobody gives
a fuck what you think.

491
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,526
Don't you know that by now?

492
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:34,963
<i>You went to typing school.</i>

493
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,936
<i> You should be like Trixie over
here, she takes care of herself.</i>

494
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:43,605
She's smart. She's got a
degree in dental hygiene...

495
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:45,140
Stop it!

496
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,951
- So you spoke up.
- Yes.

497
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:59,353
- You tried to stop him.
- I did.

498
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,322
<i>Then what happened?</i>

499
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,394
Hey.

500
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:11,064
Boone.

501
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,032
Come on.
Let's just...

502
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:16,235
I got this. I got this, dude.
I'm okay.

503
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:24,477
First, come here.

504
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,145
<i>No one spoke
to Boone that way.</i>

505
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:28,513
<i>No one.</i>

506
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,120
<i>Well, I couldn't...
I couldn't hear</i>

507
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:37,589
<i>what Boone said to him,</i>

508
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:41,026
<i>but I could see the
effect it had on Mike.</i>

509
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,329
Look at me.

510
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,668
<i>And after they'd
finished their conversation,</i>

511
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,473
Boone walked over to me.

512
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:59,010
You got something to say?

513
00:28:59,012 --> 00:29:00,778
It's none of your business.

514
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,548
<i>You know...</i>

515
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,450
You look at me like that
again and I'm gonna kick

516
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:10,387
your little ass back to that
shitty little house of yours.

517
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:14,157
There's nothing I'd enjoy more.

518
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:19,662
There's dessert if
anybody's still hungry.

519
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:24,267
So as you can imagine, that was
the end of our friendship.

520
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,703
I didn't want Alex
going over there.

521
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:31,173
I didn't want him to have anything
to do with that type of behavior.

522
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:34,076
Thank you. No further
questions, your honor.

523
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:36,545
Mr. Ramsey?

524
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:40,382
Nothing from me, your honor.

525
00:29:40,384 --> 00:29:42,785
<i>You may step down.</i>

526
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:46,521
Want me to work harder?
Start talking.

527
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,361
<i>So, what's
our defense here?</i>

528
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:57,765
You mean are we screwed?
Don't know.

529
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:01,202
Unless Mike talks to me, all we've
got is "defense of others."

530
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:04,172
Like someone who shoots
first to prevent a murder?

531
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:05,539
Right.

532
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,244
I gotta tell you, it's
pretty brutal in there.

533
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:15,215
It's not all bad.

534
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:17,517
How do you mean?

535
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,253
How much do you know
about Muhammad Ali?

536
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:22,622
I know he didn't go
to law school.

537
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,091
Better than that.

538
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:27,159
In 1974, he took on
George foreman,

539
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,228
who was seven years younger,

540
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,497
and had knocked out
every man he'd fought.

541
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:33,499
<i>Foreman was at his peak.</i>

542
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,101
And Ali, round after round,

543
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:36,669
just stood there
getting pounded.

544
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:38,370
He wouldn't or
couldn't fight back.

545
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:39,638
No one knew which.

546
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,542
- You mean the rope-a-dope?
- Yeah.

547
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:46,644
And finally,
in the eighth round,

548
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,380
foreman got tired,

549
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,617
tired of punching,
exhausted himself.

550
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,121
Suddenly, Ali came to life.

551
00:30:56,123 --> 00:31:00,325
In one round, foreman was on
the canvas like an old man.

552
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:02,827
What are you saying?

553
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,829
For the rest
of the day, we lose.

554
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,268
And in this kind of
situation, detective,

555
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,803
apparently a family dispute,

556
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:15,772
- is there a normal...
- The spouse.

557
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:17,541
Excuse me?

558
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,810
Anyone who's married, the
spouse is the first suspect.

559
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:23,547
But you moved off this
hypothesis pretty quickly.

560
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,348
<i>Yeah.</i>

561
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,749
<i>Well, I first spoke
with the officer on the scene.</i>

562
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,484
Anything unusual?

563
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,653
The kid said, "should've
done this a long time ago."

564
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,155
<i>She told me what the boy said.</i>

565
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,422
And that knife from the wall.

566
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,528
<i>And I took a look at the knife.</i>

567
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,831
<i>And it was the print,</i>

568
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,233
or the size of the palm print
that changed your focus.

569
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:47,369
Yes.

570
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:49,704
But to be safe, we took the boy and
his mother down for questioning.

571
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:51,940
- Where were you...
<i>- And how did that go with Mike?</i>

572
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:55,377
At the time of the incident?
You need to answer...

573
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,612
He's not talking at all.

574
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:02,918
First of all, I want to say...

575
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,252
<i>And his mother?</i>

576
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:08,556
<i>Mother didn't
have anything to say,</i>

577
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:10,558
<i>on advice of counsel.</i>

578
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:14,428
Thank you, detective.
No further.

579
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:23,437
<i> You were the lead detective
on this case, is that right?</i>

580
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,338
Yes, sir.

581
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,407
And you said that from the
start you didn't pursue

582
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,876
any suspects other
than the defendant.

583
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,611
That's correct.

584
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:34,247
Why was that?

585
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:36,516
You want me to answer that?

586
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:37,884
Yes.

587
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,324
<i>Because...</i>

588
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:50,262
In my professional opinion,

589
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:53,232
it was open and shut.

590
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,466
That boy did it.

591
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:05,243
No further questions,
your honor.

592
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:07,378
<i>Mike was a fucking vault.</i>

593
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,381
<i>I decided to let him
think I'd given up,</i>

594
00:33:10,383 --> 00:33:15,253
<i>let the evidence roll in,
invite it.</i>

595
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,587
<i>Hopefully, the jury would think</i>

596
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,289
<i>it was going too well</i>

597
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,259
<i>and start rooting
for the underdog</i>

598
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,627
<i>without even knowing it.</i>

599
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,797
And this is from the New Orleans
crime lab and evidence division?

600
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,833
Yes, sir.

601
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,641
Sir, what was
the cause of death?

602
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,010
Knife entered the box...

603
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:41,678
Central area of the chest.

604
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,280
- Just one stab.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

605
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:48,284
It severed the aorta, resulting in a
sudden and massive loss of blood.

606
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,953
<i>Victim lost consciousness
in a matter of seconds.</i>

607
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,692
<i>Died in under a minute.</i>

608
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:58,060
Thank you.

609
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:02,298
So the victim had
no scratches on him,

610
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,466
no defensive marks,
no skin under his nails.

611
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,302
<i> Which led me to
believe he knew his assailant</i>

612
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,837
and was taken by surprise.

613
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,940
You were in the room at
the time of the murder?

614
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:16,811
No, sir.

615
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,514
Any hairs on the
victim's clothing?

616
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,884
From the defendant,
and his mother.

617
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:25,319
Plus some other people who had
entered the scene post mortem.

618
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,020
And the rest of the house,

619
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,790
the hall, bathroom, stairs?

620
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,591
Your staff did
a sweep of that, too?

621
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:34,861
Yes, and found no
material evidence.

622
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:36,897
<i>Nothing? A stray hair?</i>

623
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,032
<i>A drop of blood?
Nothing at all?</i>

624
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>Look at this.</i>

625
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:42,836
The mom said she was

626
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:46,372
in the shower when it
happened, washing her hair,

627
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:49,709
but they found all these
hairs in the sink drain

628
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,077
and only this one in the shower.

629
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,846
So she mixed up
where she washed her hair.

630
00:34:57,117 --> 00:35:00,619
Scott, that is the exact kind
of detail to confuse a jury.

631
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:01,821
Uh-huh.

632
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:06,024
No other evidence.

633
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:07,692
<i> Sir, you're telling
me there was nothing at all</i>

634
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:10,128
which might directly
or indirectly

635
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,964
point to a suspect
other than the defendant?

636
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,767
That's correct.

637
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:18,770
Which makes this a perfect case.

638
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:22,440
Is that a question?

639
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:26,377
No, sir.

640
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:28,746
<i>No further questions.</i>

641
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:31,382
<i>You may be excused, Mr.
Doucette.</i>

642
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:36,754
<i>And you live
next door to the Lassiters?</i>

643
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:37,921
Yes, sir.

644
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:39,556
<i>Since you were how old?</i>

645
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:40,958
Two.

646
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,060
<i>And you and Mike were friends.</i>

647
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:46,062
Mostly when we were kids.

648
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,698
<i>But your families were friendly.</i>

649
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,766
Uh-huh.

650
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Alexander.

651
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,849
Uh, yes, I guess
we were all friends.

652
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:10,452
The defendant, Mike.

653
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:13,088
Your father testified
that he and his dad,

654
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,157
<i>that their relationship
went downhill.</i>

655
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,726
- Yes.
- <i>And you saw that.</i>

656
00:36:17,728 --> 00:36:19,094
Yes, I did.

657
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,630
<i>Now tell us, please,
what you saw.</i>

658
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,069
To be honest,
I was kind of jealous.

659
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,704
They seemed so close.

660
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:33,674
- But that changed.
- <i>That's right.</i>

661
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,743
Why?

662
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,446
It had something do to with...

663
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:42,583
<i>Mike wouldn't say,
but I could tell</i>

664
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:45,018
it had something
to do with his mom.

665
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,719
<i>Why do you think it had
something to do with her?</i>

666
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:50,056
Was it something that he said?

667
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:52,459
Something she said?

668
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,028
No, she never said anything...

669
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,630
<i>No!</i>

670
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:07,206
Oh, ow! Come on.
You're hurting me.

671
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,075
Ow. Baby!

672
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,944
<i>And did you
witness the backyard incident</i>

673
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,645
<i>between Mike and his father?</i>

674
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,181
Yes.

675
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,750
Well, no, no.
I did not witness

676
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:20,953
what my dad called
"the backyard incident".

677
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:23,621
But it was after this that
the change came over Mike.

678
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:26,090
No, before.

679
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:27,625
At least six months.

680
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:30,027
<i>For Mike to say that to his dad,</i>

681
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,864
he must've stewed
about it for a while.

682
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:41,839
<i>A blind man could see
he had a thing for Loretta.</i>

683
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:43,940
<i>I just tried to keep him
talking long enough</i>

684
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,042
<i>for the jury to catch on.</i>

685
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,947
Alexander,
did you ever see Boone

686
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,149
being unpleasant to his wife?

687
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:55,218
Um, yes.

688
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,654
- Rude?
- Yes.

689
00:37:57,656 --> 00:37:59,055
Abusive?

690
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,024
<i>- Come here!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

691
00:38:04,795 --> 00:38:06,862
<i>Come here.
Come here, god damn it.</i>

692
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,197
<i> No!</i>

693
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,600
Maybe.

694
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:13,002
It's not your family.

695
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,764
You can never tell what
they consider normal.

696
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:21,544
Did you ever see him
behave brutally toward her?

697
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:24,279
Let me hear it!

698
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:27,081
<i>- Come on.</i>
<i>- No, Boone!</i>

699
00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:32,720
Brutally?
I don't know.

700
00:38:32,722 --> 00:38:36,558
Fine.
You never saw that.

701
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,894
But was there something
about their relationship,

702
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:42,063
their marriage,

703
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:44,631
that made you uncomfortable?

704
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:49,937
She was kind of...

705
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,943
She was fading away, day by day.

706
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:59,246
He was so mean to her.

707
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,151
It was like she didn't
want to live anymore.

708
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,603
No redirect, your honor.

709
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,705
Loretta. Loretta.

710
00:39:30,276 --> 00:39:34,379
They're gonna call you tomorrow.
Are you ready?

711
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:36,281
You're sure I can't refuse?

712
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,850
You can, yeah, but you'll
go to jail for contempt.

713
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:40,952
I can't help you with that one.

714
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:42,953
A wife doesn't have to
testify against her husband,

715
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:46,090
but a mother does
against her child?

716
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,759
Like the bond is somehow
less or something?

717
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,961
Loretta, we've gone over this.

718
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:52,663
It's part of our strategy.

719
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:54,098
If they don't call you, I will,

720
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,166
and it's better if they do

721
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:59,069
so, we stick to
the strategy, yes?

722
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:05,375
Bad of you to smoke.

723
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:09,145
I know. Keeps me from
eating everything.

724
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:11,414
- Hey Mike.
- Oh, hey.

725
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:17,120
- How is he?
- He's okay, I guess.

726
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:18,855
He really wants to go to Reed,

727
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,890
but Boone keeps pushing
him toward Stanford

728
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:23,258
'cause it's more prestigious.

729
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,960
I can't really say anything

730
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:26,161
'cause I didn't even
go to college, so...

731
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:28,997
Hey!

732
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,699
<i>How about some drinks over here?</i>

733
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:31,967
Well, he's a smart kid.

734
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:34,336
He'll do fine wherever he is.

735
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:37,105
I just wish
I knew how to help him.

736
00:40:40,677 --> 00:40:42,044
I just read something.

737
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:47,415
If someone says
vicious things to you,

738
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:51,686
it's the same
to your brain waves

739
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:53,421
reacting or something...

740
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:59,694
It's exactly the same
as being hit.

741
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:03,096
Hey, my father hit me
sometimes when he was drunk.

742
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,464
I'm all right.

743
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:09,335
Well, I hate myself
for not protecting Mike.

744
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,107
I mentioned divorce
once to Boone.

745
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:16,176
He said he'd kill me.

746
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:18,778
"Oh, I'd find you. With my
money, you could count on it."

747
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,082
- Loretta... - then he'd
laugh, like it's a joke.

748
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,183
Wasn't a joke.

749
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,258
<i>Okay, the lies?</i>

750
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,928
Putting aside the
weirdness with Alex?

751
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:42,367
What was up with detective
graves not pursuing other leads,

752
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,068
gathering forensic evidence?

753
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,104
He had a confession.

754
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:48,940
Didn't think he needed to.

755
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:51,142
Well, why didn't you go
after him on the stand?

756
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:54,445
<i>Never humiliate a cop in front
of a jury unless you have to.</i>

757
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:58,216
Besides, we're still
doing the rope-a-dope.

758
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,158
I don't know,
it all feels so one-sided.

759
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,262
Okay, I got two hours before I have
to prep Loretta for her testimony.

760
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,904
But first, I need to
eat some real food.

761
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,442
What landed you at river oaks?

762
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:31,046
Oh, that.

763
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,049
Um...

764
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,219
Kind of embarrassing.

765
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,221
A guy.

766
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:44,926
At the firm.
A partner.

767
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,129
He was married.

768
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:51,166
- An affair.
- Mm.

769
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:57,172
Well, it...

770
00:42:57,174 --> 00:43:00,475
Sort of became an obsession.

771
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,944
Clinically, that is.

772
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:07,214
What? Did you stalk him?

773
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,485
Called him, texted him,

774
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,922
10 times a day or more.

775
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:17,958
Followed him, parked
outside his house.

776
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:26,065
His wife figured it out
and called the firm.

777
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:30,503
They fired you.

778
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:32,071
Yep.

779
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:38,177
River oaks seemed like the best
available option at that point.

780
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:43,248
So, you crazy?

781
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,284
Was.

782
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:56,361
Well, I gotta go prep
Loretta for testimony.

783
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,341
<i>Walt had
neglected to tell me</i>

784
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:13,143
<i>the actual circumstances
of her commitment,</i>

785
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:16,013
<i>implied it was voluntary,</i>

786
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:19,984
<i>which was bullshit.</i>

787
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:22,085
<i>He was a good dad.</i>

788
00:44:22,087 --> 00:44:23,987
I do.

789
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,433
Please state your name
for the record.

790
00:44:37,435 --> 00:44:39,502
Loretta Lassiter.

791
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:44,306
<i>And you were married
to the victim.</i>

792
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,175
- Yes.
- <i>And you are the mother of the defendant.</i>

793
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:49,478
That's correct.

794
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,079
Describe for me, please,

795
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:53,548
the afternoon of
your husband's murder.

796
00:44:55,585 --> 00:44:57,986
Uh...

797
00:44:57,988 --> 00:45:02,590
It was a normal afternoon.

798
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:05,393
It had rained earlier.

799
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:07,328
Mike was at soccer practice,

800
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,563
<i>or so I thought.</i>

801
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:12,500
<i>So I worked out in our gym</i>

802
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,535
<i>from 3:00 to 4:00.</i>

803
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,071
<i>Were you
expecting your husband home?</i>

804
00:45:17,073 --> 00:45:20,942
<i>Yes, but I
didn't know what time.</i>

805
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:22,642
<i>He always texted when he landed,</i>

806
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:26,479
but I didn't hear it come in
when I was working out.

807
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:29,416
<i>And where were you
when he did come home?</i>

808
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:32,452
I was getting in the shower.

809
00:45:39,327 --> 00:45:41,294
And then?

810
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:47,066
We exchanged a few words,

811
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:49,101
and then I took my shower.

812
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:51,270
A few words?

813
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:53,339
What were they,
Mrs. Lassiter?

814
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:58,978
I'd rather not say.

815
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,746
You're under oath, ma'am.

816
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:11,622
Mrs. Lassiter.

817
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:18,396
He said some...

818
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:21,165
Very vile things,

819
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:24,768
and I'd rather leave it at that.

820
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:34,378
What vile things did your
husband say, Mrs. Lassiter?

821
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:38,515
<i>Mrs. Lassiter.</i>

822
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:40,450
No.

823
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:46,655
No. He was my husband.

824
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:50,426
<i>I'm sure you got the picture
from Mr. Weston's testimony.</i>

825
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:56,532
My husband could be
exceptionally cruel.

826
00:46:56,534 --> 00:47:01,203
You can cite me
for contempt if you like,

827
00:47:01,205 --> 00:47:04,305
but I'm not gonna repeat
what he said.

828
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:09,711
Mr. Leblanc,
I'm willing to cite her.

829
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:12,380
How do you wish to proceed?

830
00:47:12,382 --> 00:47:14,315
Let's see how it goes,
your honor.

831
00:47:14,317 --> 00:47:16,117
All right,
Mrs. Lassiter,

832
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,687
after your husband said
these vile things to you,

833
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:20,689
then what happened?

834
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:29,129
Like I said, I, um...
I took my shower.

835
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:31,398
And...

836
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,069
When I came out...

837
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:43,376
Mike was in the doorway and...

838
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:45,645
Is he dead?

839
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:49,615
<i>He asked if
his father was dead.</i>

840
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:55,655
I checked, and he was.

841
00:47:55,657 --> 00:47:58,224
And then Mike said...

842
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:09,469
<i>What did Mike say, Mrs.
Lassiter?</i>

843
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,557
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

844
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,260
You need to answer
that question aloud.

845
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,175
He said, "I did it."

846
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:58,315
He said...

847
00:48:59,784 --> 00:49:01,351
I did it.

848
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:05,822
I did it.

849
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:53,401
Mrs. Lassiter,

850
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:57,405
these vile things that
your husband said to you,

851
00:49:57,407 --> 00:49:58,706
did that happen often?

852
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:02,742
I'm sorry. What?

853
00:50:02,744 --> 00:50:05,812
Did he verbally
abuse you frequently?

854
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:10,250
Yes, it was frequent.

855
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:12,519
<i>And was Mike
ever a witness to it?</i>

856
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:15,655
Your honor, who's on trial here?

857
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:17,757
Continue.

858
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:21,260
We all lived under
the same roof.

859
00:50:21,262 --> 00:50:24,863
I'm sure he heard more
than I wish he had.

860
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:27,700
<i>And was the abuse your
husband inflicted on you,</i>

861
00:50:27,702 --> 00:50:31,303
was it always only verbal?

862
00:50:31,305 --> 00:50:33,505
How do you mean?

863
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:36,942
<i>Did Mike only hear vile
things your husband said,</i>

864
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:41,846
or did he also see and hear
your husband hit you?

865
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,948
Yes.

866
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,384
- <i>Many times.</i>
- Yes.

867
00:50:46,386 --> 00:50:48,920
<i>And when was the last time?</i>

868
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:50,588
The day he died.

869
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,757
I'm sorry, judge.
This is absurd.

870
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,692
I just asked the witness
about that day in question

871
00:50:54,694 --> 00:50:56,761
and she made no mention of it.

872
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,796
Now, this testimony
has clearly been arranged

873
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:00,598
and rehearsed by
defense counsel.

874
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,399
Clearly? Even the part
where the witness said

875
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,835
my client confessed to murder?

876
00:51:04,837 --> 00:51:07,871
Do you really want to impugn
this testimony, Mr. Leblanc?

877
00:51:07,873 --> 00:51:09,840
Okay, Mr. Ramsey,
but if there was abuse,

878
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:11,441
where's the evidence, sir?

879
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,844
A police report?
Anything, your honor?

880
00:51:13,846 --> 00:51:17,848
I have marked exhibits a
and b for identification.

881
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,816
Photographs of injuries

882
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,820
to Mrs. Lassiter
on February 5th.

883
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:28,891
As a courtesy, I am providing
a copy to the prosecution.

884
00:51:31,628 --> 00:51:34,063
<i>- May I approach the witness?</i>
<i>- Approach.</i>

885
00:51:36,633 --> 00:51:38,634
Mrs. Lassiter,

886
00:51:38,636 --> 00:51:40,503
<i>do you recognize
these documents?</i>

887
00:51:40,505 --> 00:51:41,836
Yes, I do.

888
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:44,906
Do you recognize
the photographs?

889
00:51:44,908 --> 00:51:46,808
Yes.

890
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,911
Were they taken the day
after your husband's death?

891
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:51,579
Yes, they were.

892
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:53,682
<i>Do the photographs
fairly and accurately</i>

893
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:56,551
<i>depict the injuries inflicted
upon you by your husband</i>

894
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:59,721
- <i>prior to his death?</i>
- Yes, they do.

895
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,358
<i>For the record,</i>

896
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,062
<i>the defense's exhibit a and b,</i>

897
00:52:08,064 --> 00:52:10,931
<i>I hereby admit into evidence.</i>

898
00:52:10,933 --> 00:52:12,333
<i>Loretta would
have said anything</i>

899
00:52:12,335 --> 00:52:13,801
<i>to get Mike acquitted,</i>

900
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:16,704
<i>but the idea was
to keep her on track,</i>

901
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:18,672
<i>get her to say things
that proved</i>

902
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:20,506
<i>Mike had witnessed Boone's abuse</i>

903
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:22,408
<i>and was defending her from it.</i>

904
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:28,514
<i>And she did it, in spades.</i>

905
00:52:36,357 --> 00:52:38,124
Those photos...

906
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:40,525
Why were you holding out on me?

907
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,928
I saw 'em for the first
time last night.

908
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,663
They're keeping us alive.

909
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:48,100
<i>Now what?</i>

910
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:50,435
I'm thinking of resting.

911
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:51,937
What?

912
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:55,374
Thanks. Shit.

913
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:08,152
No way am I putting
you up there.

914
00:53:08,154 --> 00:53:09,987
Never put a witness on the stand

915
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,956
unless you know what
they're going to say.

916
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,524
You know that.

917
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,595
That's not happening.

918
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:33,076
This right? You're not
his lawyer anymore?

919
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:38,114
Give us one second, okay?

920
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:48,924
Mike, we have half a
chance of winning here.

921
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:51,760
Why would you
blow it now? Huh?

922
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,865
<i>This was a fucking disaster.</i>

923
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,101
<i>I had no way of knowing
what Mike would say,</i>

924
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,202
<i>no way to prepare,
and he knew it.</i>

925
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,171
<i>Normally if a client
refused to speak to me,</i>

926
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,873
<i>I'd order a psychiatric
evaluation.</i>

927
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,543
<i>But Mike wasn't crazy.</i>

928
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,113
<i>He just didn't trust anyone,
including me.</i>

929
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,751
It's not true, is it?

930
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,886
You're putting him on?

931
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,620
But that's crazy.

932
00:54:20,622 --> 00:54:21,955
Ramsey, you promised me.

933
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:23,824
You think I don't know?
You think I like it?

934
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:25,959
And if we don't put him on,
he's gonna fire Ramsey.

935
00:54:25,961 --> 00:54:27,928
Why are you talking?

936
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,697
This is between me
and my lawyer.

937
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:35,635
- Ramsey.
- Listen to me.

938
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,639
I can't keep him
from testifying.

939
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,475
It's his constitutional right,

940
00:54:42,477 --> 00:54:45,711
and he knows that.

941
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:48,881
He knows that, okay?

942
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:56,055
<i>The only time I'd
used "defense of others"</i>

943
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:58,791
<i>was a barroom brawl
where my client intervened</i>

944
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:02,026
<i>between two guys fighting
and shot one in the head.</i>

945
00:55:03,662 --> 00:55:05,029
<i>I lost.</i>

946
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:13,805
<i>It's hard for
a jury to understand</i>

947
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:15,206
<i>how the intent to kill</i>

948
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:18,510
<i>can be formed
on behalf of another.</i>

949
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:21,745
<i>They always see it
as two against one.</i>

950
00:55:30,221 --> 00:55:32,523
<i>Mr. Ramsey,</i>

951
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:34,791
<i>you declined your opening
statement at the start of trial.</i>

952
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:37,694
You have another
opportunity now.

953
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:39,096
May I, your honor?

954
00:55:44,968 --> 00:55:46,536
Your honor, my client insists

955
00:55:46,538 --> 00:55:48,671
on taking the stand
against my wishes.

956
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:50,306
Since I have no idea
what he's going to say,

957
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:52,008
I have to waive
my opening again.

958
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,977
My sympathies.

959
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,681
Deputies.

960
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:12,093
<i>Mr. Ramsey, a question?</i>

961
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,573
Please state your
name for the record.

962
00:56:25,575 --> 00:56:27,875
I'm Michael Lassiter.

963
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:30,678
Michael, is it true
you haven't spoken

964
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,346
since the day of
your father's death?

965
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,181
Yes.

966
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:36,116
Why is that?

967
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:37,217
I don't know.

968
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,153
You have no idea at all?

969
00:56:39,155 --> 00:56:40,153
<i> None.</i>

970
00:56:40,155 --> 00:56:41,621
But my father did teach me

971
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:44,591
that I have the right
to remain silent.

972
00:56:44,593 --> 00:56:47,327
So, why are you speaking now?

973
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:50,163
To tell the truth
about who he was.

974
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:52,632
<i>There's been
some testimony about</i>

975
00:56:52,634 --> 00:56:56,836
your father's treatment
of your mother.

976
00:56:56,838 --> 00:56:58,938
Is that testimony accurate?

977
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,206
Yeah, I'm afraid so, yes.

978
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,307
You witnessed it?

979
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:07,212
Not all of it, obviously.

980
00:57:07,214 --> 00:57:10,649
He was cruel to my mom
in ways that were horrifying.

981
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,218
<i>And he'd call her stupid,</i>

982
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,654
call her ugly.

983
00:57:15,656 --> 00:57:18,323
What about physical abuse?

984
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:19,890
Did you see that?

985
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,394
No.

986
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:25,329
No, but I did...
I heard noises.

987
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:28,366
Your honor, noises...

988
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:30,034
<i>Continue.</i>

989
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:35,172
I heard things, and I saw them.

990
00:57:35,174 --> 00:57:37,642
What I heard was, you know,

991
00:57:37,644 --> 00:57:40,243
the sound of a hand
hitting flesh,

992
00:57:40,245 --> 00:57:43,279
and then I'd hear
my mom cry out.

993
00:57:43,281 --> 00:57:47,083
And the next day she'd
be wearing a turtleneck

994
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:48,952
even though it was
the middle of July,

995
00:57:48,954 --> 00:57:52,088
or she wouldn't even come
out of her room at all.

996
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,158
The day your father died...

997
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,194
<i>You got home early</i>

998
00:57:58,196 --> 00:58:02,097
<i>because soccer
practice was canceled.</i>

999
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:03,098
<i>Yeah, that's correct.</i>

1000
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,767
Mom?

1001
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:08,070
<i>Came home, heard them
in their bedroom.</i>

1002
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:10,305
<i>- When you...</i>
- That's not why I did it.

1003
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:19,447
Tell the jury why, Mike.

1004
00:58:24,788 --> 00:58:26,421
It was the trip.

1005
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:28,790
Something happened on the trip?

1006
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:32,393
<i>What happened, Mike?</i>

1007
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:35,396
<i>Michael?</i>

1008
00:58:41,335 --> 00:58:43,804
I'm really just really stupid.

1009
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:45,405
I thought it'd stopped.

1010
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:48,108
What?
What had stopped?

1011
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,810
There was a door.

1012
00:58:49,812 --> 00:58:51,344
There was a privacy
door on the plane,

1013
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:55,182
and my dad pulled it.

1014
00:58:55,184 --> 00:58:57,851
We had privacy, if you
want to call it that.

1015
00:58:59,486 --> 00:59:01,420
He knew.

1016
00:59:01,422 --> 00:59:04,857
He knew once I
went off to college,

1017
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,325
he wouldn't be able
to do it anymore.

1018
00:59:06,327 --> 00:59:08,894
Do what, Mike?

1019
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,265
Rape me?

1020
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:16,435
I'm sorry?

1021
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:22,173
He wouldn't be able
to rape me anymore.

1022
00:59:36,288 --> 00:59:39,823
<i>You know, I loved my dad once.</i>

1023
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,326
I loved him.

1024
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,130
I would've done anything,
anything to win his approval.

1025
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:53,871
When...

1026
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:56,306
<i>When did this start, Mike?</i>

1027
00:59:58,476 --> 01:00:00,777
When I was 12.

1028
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:02,779
<i>It started when I was 12.</i>

1029
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:08,918
Where was the flight
attendant during all this?

1030
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,354
I don't remember.
I don't know.

1031
01:00:11,356 --> 01:00:15,358
Mike, this...

1032
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,928
This abuse,

1033
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,863
did you ever tell
anyone about it?

1034
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:27,335
No.

1035
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:29,304
No, I was ashamed.

1036
01:00:51,092 --> 01:00:53,260
Mike, when you got home
on the day of the murder,

1037
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:55,362
and you went into
your parents' bedroom,

1038
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,031
what was your father doing?

1039
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:00,200
I guess he was about to unpack.

1040
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:02,936
<i>So, there was no immediate
threat from him to you?</i>

1041
01:01:02,938 --> 01:01:05,471
He told me to be ready.

1042
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:07,540
On the plane, he said that
when we got back to the house,

1043
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,509
that he'd do it again
before I went off to college.

1044
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:12,011
Okay, but was he threatening you

1045
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:14,581
with abuse at that moment?

1046
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,416
He was always threatening me.

1047
01:01:16,418 --> 01:01:18,951
It was what he did.
It was who he was.

1048
01:01:18,953 --> 01:01:21,920
Michael, were you in
imminent danger right then?

1049
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:23,555
Yes, at that very moment.

1050
01:01:23,557 --> 01:01:24,890
Yes, he was threatening me.

1051
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:26,158
He was always threatening me.

1052
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,162
- Yes or no, son?
- Yes.

1053
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:31,530
Yes.

1054
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:47,011
No further questions.

1055
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,990
Leblanc is gonna
recall Angela Morley.

1056
01:01:59,992 --> 01:02:02,325
He's having deluxe reroute
her here tomorrow morning.

1057
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,560
- Shit.
- Yeah.

1058
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:05,896
But you got bigger problems.

1059
01:02:05,898 --> 01:02:08,331
You were hard on that flight
attendant first time out.

1060
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,034
You lay into her
again like that?

1061
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:15,205
- But you do got one option.
- What's that?

1062
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:18,041
Let her do it.

1063
01:02:18,043 --> 01:02:21,176
That's true.

1064
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:24,914
<i>I felt bad for giving
the kid such a hard time.</i>

1065
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:28,050
<i>If he'd told me about his
father's abuse before the trial,</i>

1066
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:30,319
<i>I would've built
the whole case on it</i>

1067
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:33,355
<i>and Leblanc would've
torn it apart.</i>

1068
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:35,257
<i>So he held back.</i>

1069
01:02:37,294 --> 01:02:38,626
<i>It would come down
to Mike's word</i>

1070
01:02:38,628 --> 01:02:41,229
<i>against Angela Morley's,</i>

1071
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:44,666
<i>which must've been
his plan all along.</i>

1072
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:47,502
<i>So, you'd either be
there or with the passengers.</i>

1073
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:49,070
<i> Yes.</i>

1074
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:51,372
<i>And does your
alcove have a door?</i>

1075
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:55,209
Yes, there's a door I can
close for privacy on request.

1076
01:02:55,211 --> 01:02:57,378
Was it closed at all during
this flight?

1077
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,379
No.

1078
01:02:59,381 --> 01:03:02,482
<i>So you could see
Mike and Boone Lassiter</i>

1079
01:03:02,484 --> 01:03:03,984
<i>for the whole six hours?</i>

1080
01:03:03,986 --> 01:03:06,520
Yes. Of course.

1081
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:13,627
Miss Morley, did Boone Lassiter
sexually molest his son

1082
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:15,696
at any point during that flight?

1083
01:03:15,698 --> 01:03:17,364
Certainly not.

1084
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:20,266
Did he touch him
inappropriately?

1085
01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:21,467
Did he do anything worse?

1086
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:23,069
No.

1087
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:24,370
You would've noticed that.

1088
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:25,571
I would've done
more than noticed,

1089
01:03:25,573 --> 01:03:27,306
I would've stopped him.

1090
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:30,676
No, Mr. Lassiter never
did anything like that.

1091
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:39,551
- Thank you.
- Ask about Ginsburg.

1092
01:03:39,553 --> 01:03:41,252
<i>Your witness.</i>

1093
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:59,603
Miss Morley, how many
flights a week do you work?

1094
01:03:59,605 --> 01:04:04,308
It varies. Sometimes one
or two, sometimes a dozen.

1095
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:07,144
That week in late January,

1096
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:10,180
do you remember
how many you flew?

1097
01:04:10,182 --> 01:04:12,583
It was busy.
I remember that much.

1098
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:19,455
So, you were flying a lot.

1099
01:04:19,457 --> 01:04:22,425
That must be tiring.

1100
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:24,494
Do you have a question,
miss Brady?

1101
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,103
Do you ever doze off
on a flight?

1102
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:37,373
I pride myself on staying awake.
That's my job.

1103
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,175
I carry Adderall and
Provigil just in case.

1104
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,310
I have them right here.

1105
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,090
Tell me, miss Morley,

1106
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,459
who were the pilots
on that flight from la?

1107
01:04:57,461 --> 01:05:00,428
Captain green
and copilot Ginsburg.

1108
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:05,766
Did you spend time
in the cockpit with them?

1109
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:09,537
Maybe.
Maybe a minute or so.

1110
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,206
<i>Do you fly with them a lot,</i>

1111
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,341
<i>green and Ginsburg?</i>

1112
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,511
Yes.
We're kind of a crew team.

1113
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,547
So, if you stay
overnight somewhere,

1114
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,649
the company puts y'all up
in the same hotel?

1115
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,419
Yes.

1116
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:32,859
Do you socialize
on these layovers?

1117
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:35,795
How do you mean?

1118
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:38,464
<i>Are you friends with the pilots?</i>

1119
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:40,732
Sure. We're friendly.

1120
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:47,506
Isn't it true you're in a personal
relationship with copilot Ginsburg?

1121
01:05:47,508 --> 01:05:49,341
<i>Objection, your honor.</i>

1122
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:51,276
Where's defense counsel
headed with this?

1123
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:54,146
Miss Brady, I don't follow
this line of questioning.

1124
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:58,749
Judge, if she has a personal
relationship with copilot Ginsburg,

1125
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:04,555
it may be worth calling him
to hear his recollections,

1126
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:06,824
<i>what was discussed,</i>

1127
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:09,494
what they talked about.

1128
01:06:09,496 --> 01:06:11,462
<i>I'll allow it.</i>

1129
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,569
I don't know.

1130
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:23,673
I don't know how much
time I was up there.

1131
01:06:25,576 --> 01:06:27,410
<i>Thinking back on it,
that flight,</i>

1132
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:32,849
it could've been as much as...

1133
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:33,851
10 minutes.

1134
01:06:36,454 --> 01:06:39,555
Only 10 minutes?

1135
01:06:39,557 --> 01:06:40,656
Or longer?

1136
01:06:47,197 --> 01:06:49,198
It could've been longer.
I'm not sure.

1137
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,202
More than once
during the flight?

1138
01:06:56,706 --> 01:06:58,740
Possibly.

1139
01:06:58,742 --> 01:07:02,510
Thank you, miss Morley.

1140
01:07:11,353 --> 01:07:13,354
<i>You're excused.</i>

1141
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:21,395
Here, give me that, sugar.
I'll run it down for you.

1142
01:07:21,397 --> 01:07:22,963
When'd you send her
to poker school?

1143
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:24,898
- Wasn't so bad.
- No, it was not.

1144
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,967
Did you see her spot that
wedding ring?

1145
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:29,503
You wouldn't have spotted
that wedding ring, Richie.

1146
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:32,706
I told you there's a reason
why we have women lawyers.

1147
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,474
I'll catch y'all tomorrow.

1148
01:07:37,412 --> 01:07:38,878
What's the matter?

1149
01:07:42,883 --> 01:07:45,751
What if she's not lying?

1150
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:49,455
Don't get carried away
with yourself.

1151
01:07:49,457 --> 01:07:52,258
You said everybody lies, right?

1152
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,393
Doesn't everybody include Mike?

1153
01:07:54,395 --> 01:07:57,696
He testified.
That's our defense, okay?

1154
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:01,900
I'm going to the hotel,
work on my closing.

1155
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:03,635
I'll see you tomorrow.

1156
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:07,539
Nice job.

1157
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:33,664
Can I bum one of those?

1158
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:44,974
Nice job in there.

1159
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:46,409
Thanks.

1160
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:52,282
That must've been
really hard to hear.

1161
01:08:57,854 --> 01:09:01,890
Did you have any idea
what Mike was gonna say?

1162
01:09:01,892 --> 01:09:04,359
Of course I didn't know.

1163
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:06,428
I stayed up all night thinking,

1164
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,430
"how could I not see it?"

1165
01:09:11,034 --> 01:09:15,003
Is it possible he's...

1166
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:17,039
Not saying what really happened?

1167
01:09:18,507 --> 01:09:20,574
Why would he do that?

1168
01:09:22,377 --> 01:09:25,746
It was a terrible
situation you were in,

1169
01:09:25,748 --> 01:09:28,015
both of you.

1170
01:09:28,017 --> 01:09:31,419
<i>No one would blame
either of you.</i>

1171
01:09:33,555 --> 01:09:38,725
I think maybe
Mike wanted to protect you.

1172
01:09:43,564 --> 01:09:46,933
I did it.
I did it.

1173
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:48,468
No, no, Mikey.

1174
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,602
- Mom, listen to me.
- No, Mikey, honey.

1175
01:09:49,604 --> 01:09:51,004
Mom, listen to me, please.

1176
01:09:51,006 --> 01:09:52,872
- This is the only way.
- This is my mistake.

1177
01:09:52,874 --> 01:09:54,507
- Mom, I did it. Mom!
- I did it. No, Mikey, no!

1178
01:09:54,509 --> 01:09:59,511
Well, I don't know
what you think you know,

1179
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:01,814
but your theory's wrong.

1180
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:06,518
Wait.

1181
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,790
Your job is to represent my son.

1182
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:43,587
Did she phone you?

1183
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:51,895
Ramsey, did Loretta call?

1184
01:10:51,897 --> 01:10:53,397
Yeah.

1185
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,702
Did she tell you what I said?

1186
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:01,771
Yeah.

1187
01:11:01,773 --> 01:11:05,174
She wants me to fire you.

1188
01:11:05,176 --> 01:11:07,009
I told her no way,

1189
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:09,678
not after what you did in court.

1190
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,417
It's just normal craziness
at the end of a trial.

1191
01:11:15,886 --> 01:11:17,185
Don't worry about it.

1192
01:11:17,187 --> 01:11:18,586
I accused her
of killing her husband,

1193
01:11:18,588 --> 01:11:20,922
did she mention that?

1194
01:11:20,924 --> 01:11:23,057
Yes, she did.

1195
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:30,832
What if Mike
didn't stab his father

1196
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:32,133
and our defense is a lie, too?

1197
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:35,570
He wasn't molested.

1198
01:11:35,572 --> 01:11:38,005
Yeah.

1199
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,440
Yeah?

1200
01:11:41,476 --> 01:11:44,978
Yeah.
That might be true.

1201
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:48,582
I don't know, or care.

1202
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:53,454
All I know is I have a chance
to get this boy acquitted.

1203
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,167
It's like you're protecting her.

1204
01:12:10,037 --> 01:12:15,641
I have to work on
my closing argument now.

1205
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,610
Did you know?

1206
01:12:18,612 --> 01:12:20,512
'Cause if you knew
and you're protecting her...

1207
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:22,914
Wait, back up, okay?

1208
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:25,650
I asked for your help in keeping
this boy out of prison.

1209
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,888
Are you going to do
what you promised me,

1210
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,824
represent our client, Mike?

1211
01:12:32,826 --> 01:12:34,960
He shouldn't even be on trial.

1212
01:12:34,962 --> 01:12:38,662
You don't know that
'cause you weren't there.

1213
01:12:38,664 --> 01:12:41,966
Who are you representing
here, Mike or Loretta?

1214
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:44,935
Okay, now you're scaring me.

1215
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:46,804
This is not about Loretta.

1216
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:49,540
- This is about you.
- What?

1217
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:51,509
Is Loretta a trigger for you?

1218
01:12:53,044 --> 01:12:55,179
Is this what got you fired
from your firm?

1219
01:13:00,784 --> 01:13:02,919
- What are you doing?
- Good luck, Ramsey.

1220
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:04,287
Where are you going?

1221
01:13:06,957 --> 01:13:11,060
You're leaving?
Now, you promised me.

1222
01:13:11,062 --> 01:13:13,796
What about the jury?
What about Mike?

1223
01:13:13,798 --> 01:13:15,064
<i>The impact on the jury</i>

1224
01:13:15,066 --> 01:13:16,732
<i>of seeing someone they trust</i>

1225
01:13:16,734 --> 01:13:18,534
<i>leave the defense table
cannot be measured.</i>

1226
01:13:18,536 --> 01:13:20,168
You're a lawyer, Janelle!

1227
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,838
<i>I just hoped Walter Brady's
brilliant daughter</i>

1228
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,706
<i>could get her mind around that.</i>

1229
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:34,850
<i>At some point, every defense
lawyer has to choose</i>

1230
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:36,317
<i>between his own need
to know the truth</i>

1231
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:38,920
<i>and the best interests
of his client.</i>

1232
01:13:45,894 --> 01:13:47,295
<i>But I was more worried
about Janelle</i>

1233
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,330
<i>than I needed to be.</i>

1234
01:14:05,246 --> 01:14:06,746
<i>All rise.</i>

1235
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,022
<i>Sometimes things erupt.</i>

1236
01:14:16,024 --> 01:14:18,891
It's called a trigger,

1237
01:14:18,893 --> 01:14:21,093
a trigger to violence.

1238
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,269
Mike Lassiter was sulking
on the plane home,

1239
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,206
and two days later, he erupted.

1240
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,307
That is what happened here.

1241
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:38,776
It wasn't abuse.

1242
01:14:38,778 --> 01:14:40,678
You heard the flight attendant.

1243
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,714
Nothing happened on that plane,

1244
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:44,215
and if nothing happened then,

1245
01:14:44,217 --> 01:14:47,051
how do we know
any of it happened?

1246
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,787
Where's the evidence?

1247
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:52,924
The defendant is supposed
to be a legal prodigy,

1248
01:14:52,926 --> 01:14:56,059
yet there's no evidence,
nothing.

1249
01:14:56,061 --> 01:15:00,364
No physical evidence
to support his defense.

1250
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:03,100
There is nothing.

1251
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:19,915
Michael Lassiter
acted with malice,

1252
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:22,985
deliberate premeditation,

1253
01:15:22,987 --> 01:15:25,354
and an intent to kill.

1254
01:15:29,393 --> 01:15:33,129
Do your duty. Guilty.

1255
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:37,065
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.

1256
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,978
Thank you.

1257
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,849
<i>Yes, Michael
Lassiter killed his father.</i>

1258
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:58,919
That is not a fact in dispute.

1259
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:04,425
All that remains
for you to decide is why.

1260
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:09,863
<i>You heard Michael say</i>

1261
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,133
that he would do anything,

1262
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,102
anything to win the
approval of his father.

1263
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:20,339
<i>So why?</i>

1264
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:24,143
I asked Michael
if it was the abuse

1265
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:28,147
inflicted on his mother
by his father,

1266
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:31,017
and Michael said no.

1267
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,986
<i>No.</i>

1268
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:39,291
Then Michael told,
for the first time,

1269
01:16:39,293 --> 01:16:42,260
something he had never
uttered in his life.

1270
01:16:46,299 --> 01:16:48,266
That his father abused him...

1271
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,406
<i>violated him repeatedly.</i>

1272
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:59,176
<i>And that when his father</i>

1273
01:16:59,178 --> 01:17:02,446
<i>had threatened him on the plane</i>

1274
01:17:02,448 --> 01:17:08,052
<i>to do this again
before he went to college,</i>

1275
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:14,058
something in Michael said no.

1276
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,459
No more.

1277
01:17:18,395 --> 01:17:24,067
I ask you to do the
just and right thing.

1278
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:28,905
Send this boy back
home with his mother.

1279
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:32,375
<i>Find the defendant not guilty...</i>

1280
01:17:34,812 --> 01:17:37,179
and release him
from this nightmare.

1281
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:58,065
<i>I think it
hurt Boone's feelings</i>

1282
01:17:58,067 --> 01:17:59,867
<i>when I stayed in
criminal defense</i>

1283
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:03,337
<i>instead of moving into
personal injury with him,</i>

1284
01:18:03,339 --> 01:18:05,239
<i>but he never said so,</i>

1285
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:07,208
<i>claimed it was good
to have someone to call</i>

1286
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,043
<i>if he ever got a DUI.</i>

1287
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:14,081
<i>He bought me my first nice suit,</i>

1288
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:18,218
<i>reminded me to shower every
day and get a haircut.</i>

1289
01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:22,923
<i>He knew where I came from.</i>

1290
01:18:24,859 --> 01:18:26,226
Jury's in.

1291
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:41,073
Michael.

1292
01:18:41,075 --> 01:18:43,175
Whatever happens here,

1293
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,412
there's still things
we can do, okay?

1294
01:18:46,414 --> 01:18:49,014
What, like appeal?

1295
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,317
Thanks a lot.

1296
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:13,938
One question.

1297
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,206
Did dad really hit you?

1298
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:20,544
Of course he did, Mikey.

1299
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:29,586
<i>All rise.</i>

1300
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:39,963
Bring 'em in.

1301
01:19:56,446 --> 01:19:59,615
<i>Jury, have you
reached a verdict?</i>

1302
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:01,217
<i>We have.</i>

1303
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:03,419
Bailiff.

1304
01:20:06,523 --> 01:20:07,657
<i>Thank you.</i>

1305
01:20:12,496 --> 01:20:15,964
<i>- Is it unanimous?</i>
<i>- It is.</i>

1306
01:20:15,966 --> 01:20:18,600
<i>- I did it.</i>
<i>- No, no, honey...</i>

1307
01:20:18,602 --> 01:20:20,101
<i>Mom,
listen to me, please.</i>

1308
01:20:20,103 --> 01:20:21,503
- This is the only way.
- This is my mistake.

1309
01:20:21,505 --> 01:20:23,004
- I did it.
- Mom, I did it.

1310
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:26,107
No, Mikey, no.
No, I won't let you!

1311
01:20:29,512 --> 01:20:31,947
Please hurry.
It's my husband.

1312
01:20:46,561 --> 01:20:49,396
<i>Jury, what say you?</i>

1313
01:20:49,398 --> 01:20:52,533
<i>On the charge
of first degree murder,</i>

1314
01:20:52,535 --> 01:20:55,568
<i>we find the defendant...</i>

1315
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:59,005
<i>- Not guilty.</i>

1316
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:00,273
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1317
01:21:00,275 --> 01:21:02,275
<i>this concludes the trial.</i>

1318
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:05,411
<i>I'd like to thank you
for your service.</i>

1319
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:06,679
<i>The jury is dismissed.</i>

1320
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,124
Meet me after court.

1321
01:21:21,394 --> 01:21:23,295
Come on,
let's go get your things.

1322
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:37,641
Thank you.

1323
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:48,386
Will Mike come out here?

1324
01:21:48,388 --> 01:21:50,388
I think he wants
to talk to me first.

1325
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,756
Okay.

1326
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,393
<i>The jury believed Mike,</i>

1327
01:21:56,395 --> 01:22:00,397
<i>ignored the facts and the law,</i>

1328
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:02,298
<i>did what they knew was right.</i>

1329
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:05,335
How does it feel?

1330
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:12,776
What's this?

1331
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:15,144
It's your watch.

1332
01:22:15,146 --> 01:22:17,579
It's on the rug.

1333
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:22,317
You were there in their bedroom
before my dad came home.

1334
01:22:24,287 --> 01:22:26,755
Honey...

1335
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:40,802
You were there,
and you killed him.

1336
01:22:42,338 --> 01:22:45,206
Just tell me
you killed my father.

1337
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:49,343
Mike, you know
I'd never do that.

1338
01:22:49,345 --> 01:22:51,345
Never kill him
or never admit it?

1339
01:22:54,615 --> 01:22:56,650
I'm gonna tell
the da everything.

1340
01:22:56,652 --> 01:22:58,118
Tell him what, Mike?

1341
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,220
That you saw a watch?

1342
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:03,356
There's no evidence.

1343
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:07,794
They can't prosecute
anyone else,

1344
01:23:07,796 --> 01:23:09,229
and they all pointed to you.

1345
01:23:09,231 --> 01:23:13,834
Graves, the coroner,
they swore under oath.

1346
01:23:13,836 --> 01:23:16,268
You swore under oath.

1347
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,837
I didn't trash Boone's memory

1348
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,306
and brand myself a killer
raped by his father...

1349
01:23:20,308 --> 01:23:21,440
I didn't do that to save you!

1350
01:23:21,442 --> 01:23:24,243
- Answer me!
- No!

1351
01:23:29,216 --> 01:23:31,383
You won't let me go to prison?

1352
01:23:31,385 --> 01:23:32,818
You're not going
to prison, Mike.

1353
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,420
It's all over.
You're free.

1354
01:23:35,422 --> 01:23:37,288
Now what?

1355
01:23:43,429 --> 01:23:46,297
He was destroying her...

1356
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,534
and you know it.

1357
01:23:52,605 --> 01:23:55,272
Even Alex knew.

1358
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,352
Your mom's out there.

1359
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:12,723
She's waiting for you.

1360
01:24:50,226 --> 01:24:51,226
Can I?

1361
01:25:17,918 --> 01:25:18,918
Thank you.

1362
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:23,656
I'll see you.

1363
01:25:49,482 --> 01:25:52,317
Hey.

1364
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:54,385
What are you doing here?

1365
01:26:06,665 --> 01:26:08,799
My wife is having an affair.

1366
01:26:10,702 --> 01:26:12,803
Boone.

1367
01:26:12,805 --> 01:26:14,938
Please.

1368
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,039
Seriously?

1369
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:20,377
So what do I do?

1370
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,849
I don't know.

1371
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:27,317
Divorce her, I guess.

1372
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:31,521
Come on, Ramsey.

1373
01:26:31,523 --> 01:26:34,423
You know I can't do that.

1374
01:26:34,425 --> 01:26:36,558
You know Loretta.

1375
01:26:38,895 --> 01:26:41,030
She won't live without me.

1376
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:49,571
"Oh, I'd find you. With my
money, you could count on it."

1377
01:26:49,573 --> 01:26:52,675
And then he'd laugh
like it was a joke.

1378
01:26:52,677 --> 01:26:54,375
Wasn't a joke.

1379
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,062
He's here.

1380
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:58,670
<i>Touch the knife.</i>

1381
01:27:58,672 --> 01:28:03,375
Put your hands on it,
for god's sake.

1382
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:04,876
<i> Mom?</i>
