Nail Shop Paris 

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,830
You decide...

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,560
who you're going to believe.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,240
Me or him?

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,730
I... I...

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,360
<i>I love you.</i>

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,520
Run!

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,290
What did you do?
You didn't have to do that!

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you still trust him?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
What he said to you was all lies.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,800
How do you know?

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,570
All of your friends that got killed and the
other Gumiho! What else do I need for proof?

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,780
Stop there.

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,640
If you come any closer, I'm going
to shoot your heart this time.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,780
Do whatever you want.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,650
If this heart couldn't earn the trust of
the woman I love

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,090
it doesn't even deserve to beat.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,120
No!

19
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,990
The show is over now.

20
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,730
Wait.

21
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,100
Are you going to let Alex
get killed like that?

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,300
Wasn't he the main character?

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,020
He was.

24
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,170
Yeo Joo, did something
happen to you and Alex?

25
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,330
Did you really kiss him?

26
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,810
Did you really?

27
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,870
I don't know why I did that either.

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,370
I must be crazy.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,830
How did he respond?

30
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,140
He must think I'm some kind of freak.

31
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,870
Yesterday...

32
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,340
I need to know how to do that for my
skill test but I'm not good at it yet.

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,530
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I have to do something now.

34
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,260
Jin, if you aren't busy,
can you finish her nails?

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,360
I didn't know he would act like that.
He's such a coward.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,260
In his position, he got kissed by a guy.

37
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm just glad he didn't spread a rumor
that I'm gay and kick me out.

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't bother.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,390
At least you know how he feels about you.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,850
Does your stomach hurt again?

41
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,550
Yeah. It's been hurting since yesterday.

42
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,730
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,820
It's okay. I'll just take digestives
and go to sleep.

44
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to bed.

45
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,080
- Hey, Beanie.
- Kay.

46
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,050
Can we talk?

47
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,430
Jin! Hi.

48
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,240
What is it?

49
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,040
What's this?

50
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,260
Now put this ring on my finger.

51
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,150
Kay...

52
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:26,480
There. Now nobody can get in the way
of our relationship. Okay?

53
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,660
I'm not going to let anybody
take you from me. Never.

54
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,220
- Kay...
- Hey...

55
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,620
What are you guys doing
so early in the morning?

56
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,630
What's this?

57
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,990
Is this a couple ring?

58
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,910
That guy is so anxious about you.

59
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,610
What are you talking about?

60
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,220
You had feelings for Alex so Kay gave you
this ring so you can't go anywhere.

61
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,030
So be good to him. I've never
seen Kay do something like that.

62
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,020
Let's go.
The boss wants to see all of us.

63
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,490
I gathered all of you because I want to tell
you that Alex will be on vacation for a week.

64
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,660
It might be hard for you
to cover Alex's work.

65
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,560
But please understand.
And Bunny, you should help out a lot.

66
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,830
Okay.

67
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,620
Then get back to work.
And Alex, I'll see you after a week.

68
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,610
What is it, Alex? Is everything okay?

69
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,280
No. I just want a break.

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm sorry, guys.

71
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,330
Good luck on studying for the exam.

72
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,980
Bye, guys.

73
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,520
He's acting so weird.

74
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,860
- You're all set.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,690
Yeah.

76
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,970
- A vacation?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,640
All of a sudden without notice?

78
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,340
I think he's doing that because of me.

79
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,100
Because he doesn't even want to see me.

80
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,000
No way.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,590
I must've been crazy.
Why did I do that to him?

82
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,860
Don't stress out so much. It might be good
for you, if he's not around.

83
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,000
<i>Just focus on Kay.</i>

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,760
I heard from Jin that Kay
really worries about you.

85
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,090
Okay.
I'll see you at home.

86
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,370
Bye.

87
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,240
You're a makeup artist, right?

88
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,840
Our makeup artist hasn't come in yet.
Can you put makeup on someone?

89
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,300
He just needs a touch-up.

90
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,330
- Sure.
- This way.

91
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,750
Come have a seat here.

92
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,710
- Are you here for a talk show?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,940
My adviser academic...

94
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,450
I mean my academic adviser was supposed to
do this but something urgent came up.

95
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,120
- You look so nervous.
- Yes. This is my first time.

96
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,790
Then try to sing a song.
It will make you less nervous.

97
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,470
Sing?

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,280
Should I dance too?

99
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,860
- Why?
- Nothing.

100
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,060
Don't you feel better now?

101
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,240
- I think so...
- Keep going.

102
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,700
How's your leg?

103
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,970
I'm doing remedial exercises.

104
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,920
The doctor said by fall, I might have
to walk on crutches but I can stand up.

105
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,190
- That's great.
- So you can stop coming here.

106
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:30,980
Come to think of it, it was my fault that
I asked you to treat me at the hospital.

107
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,210
But as a doctor, I was the
one who made the decision.

108
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:43,090
I think after that accident, not just me, but
you also lost something that meant a lot.

109
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,600
Like passion, spirit, ambition...
something like that.

110
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,980
Am I wrong?

111
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,210
Life is like fishing.

112
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,480
Unless you try to throw a fishing
rod to catch something

113
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,360
all the precious things will be missed.

114
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
Isn't that a waste?

115
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,290
- I have to go now.
- Oh, sure.

116
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,180
When we meet again,
I hope we're both a little different.

117
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,500
Jin won't be mad because only you and
I are having lunch together, right?

118
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,990
Who cares if that guy gets mad or not?

119
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,280
But still...

120
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,170
There's ice cream!

121
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,090
Can we buy some for Jin?

122
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:02,270
It's ridiculous. How did I think
that you were a guy?

123
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,510
What?

124
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,380
You're crazy! People might see us.

125
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
What's wrong with you?

126
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,200
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?

127
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,560
I'm okay.

128
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,910
I'm sorry. If you start feeling sick or
something, please call this number.

129
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,160
Okay?

130
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,490
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,660
Come in.

132
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,620
Here it is.

133
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,480
What took you so long to
just run an errand?

134
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,100
Bring some tea.

135
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,910
Never mind. Tell Ms. Seo to bring the tea.

136
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,720
Yes, sir.

137
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,980
Why can't she bring the tea?

138
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,440
I don't want to see that ugly face
while drinking tea.

139
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,920
You're right about that.

140
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,960
You know how it is...

141
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,420
- Excuse me...
- What?

142
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,740
The boss wants you to bring
some tea for him.

143
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Come on...

144
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
Can't you do it?

145
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,860
He told me to ask you to do it.

146
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,670
You are so useless.

147
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,350
Must be nice.

148
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,630
Nobody asks you to do
anything or comes on to you.

149
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,590
You're studying so hard.

150
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,320
Lasers might come out from your eyes.

151
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,860
The exam is coming up.

152
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,230
Let me see.

153
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,680
- This part is contorted a bit.
- That's...

154
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,690
If it's dried, its shape keeps changing.

155
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,820
Gel polish usually shrinks.

156
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,410
Try this.

157
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,360
The color comes out nicer

158
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,290
and it doesn't shrink. It'll work better.

159
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,680
I just gave you very important information.
Don't I get anything for that?

160
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
What?

161
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,360
What if somebody sees us?

162
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,060
Why do I love you hugging you so much?

163
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,790
Do you not like it?

164
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,360
Well... it's not that I don't like it...

165
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,270
What are you doing?
Put me down!

166
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,650
You hugged me like this too.

167
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,610
Beanie, did you gain weight?
You're heavy.

168
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,150
Go away. I'm gonna fail the exam like this.

169
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,950
You're so cold. Fine, I'll leave.

170
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,330
Don't get lost on your way home.

171
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,620
Wanna die?

172
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,900
Isn't this delicious?

173
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,730
I was so worried that you lost your appetite.

174
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,020
Let's fry some rice after this.

175
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,570
Yeah.

176
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,730
Here.

177
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,580
Ji Soo, should we get couple rings too?

178
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,220
What?

179
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,570
Come to think of it, there's nothing
that I bought for you while dating.

180
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,790
It's okay.

181
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,940
What the? What was that response?

182
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,960
Are you worried that I'll never let you go?

183
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,090
- No, it's not that.
- Then why don't you want couple rings?

184
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,780
I want get couple rings with
someone I like...

185
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,850
One second...

186
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,190
What happened?

187
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,290
I don't know. We were just having
some stir-fried chicken then suddenly...

188
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,270
Stir-fried chicken?

189
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,950
I won't be sure until she gets checked up.
But I think she has Crohn's disease.

190
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,190
Crohn's disease?

191
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,530
It means she has an infection
on her digestive organs.

192
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,140
Lately, a lot of people in their 20s
have gotten that disease.

193
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,920
She needs to stay at the
hospital and get treated.

194
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,460
Doctor Jo, help her go through
the admission process.

195
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,930
You're Mr. Nobody.

196
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,290
Don't you think so Bunny? That intern guy
looks like a player. Very suspicious.

197
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,410
You saw him touching Ji Soo's hand
when taking her pulse, right?

198
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,590
He's not a real doctor.
He's just an intern.

199
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,180
Bunny, say something.

200
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,060
You think he's suspicious too, right?

201
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,820
- Aren't you going to work?
- I'm going to but...

202
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,220
You went to the hospital this morning, right?
Did you see that guy again?

203
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,420
Jin, are you...

204
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,240
Do you have a delusional jealousy of her?

205
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,770
No, it's not that.

206
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,620
You told me the other day that Ji Soo
can't refuse guys who have a crush on her.

207
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,030
But you're over thinking.
You're being so petty.

208
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,080
Petty? Every guy is the same.

209
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,980
Hyun Bin, Rain, and Kang Dong Won...

210
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,690
You think they wouldn't be like this?

211
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,190
You said you like Ji Soo.
Then you should trust her.

212
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,740
You trust somebody because you love him?
That's cool.

213
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,610
But I'm still mad.

214
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:06,000
You can't do anything about being mad at your
girlfriend for being close to another guy.

215
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,060
Look at Kay.

216
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,210
Welcome, are you here for a manicure?

217
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,210
I would like him to do it.

218
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,290
Hi. We met on the street the other day.

219
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,390
Hello.

220
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,270
I'm sorry. I can't do it yet
because I'm still learning.

221
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,160
Instead, I can give you a hand massage.

222
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,670
And you can get the manicure from him.

223
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,220
He looks like a playboy but he's good.

224
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,540
You said your name is Woo Jeong Ah, right?
Your hands are so pretty.

225
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,070
Everybody said my hands are
ugly because it's so skinny.

226
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,990
That's not true. Maybe because you
don't take care of your hands.

227
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,380
But I can tell you're very
honest and have a soft heart.

228
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,490
You can tell all that from my hands?

229
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:28,720
Yes. This guy I know said hands can tell
you more than the mouth can.

230
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,610
Kim Ji Soo.

231
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,230
You came...

232
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,850
I'll see you later then.

233
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,420
What did you guys talk about?

234
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,160
Nothing.

235
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,720
I didn't tell you how I met him, did I?

236
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,250
A few days ago, he came to the
broadcasting station for a talk show.

237
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,200
But he looked so nervous.

238
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,660
So I told him to sing a song
to make him calm down.

239
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,060
And he stood up right away and
started singing and dancing.

240
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,870
You didn't ask why Jin didn't come here.

241
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,980
He worried about you all day.

242
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,630
Did Jin go somewhere?

243
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,070
He was asked to do some interview
for this pin-up boy nail artist show.

244
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,520
He told me to tell you how sorry he is.

245
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,460
Thank you.

246
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Did the picture come out well? That was
my first time. I felt so awkward.

247
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,250
What do you mean? The picture came
out like something in a magazine.

248
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,940
I'm... pretty hot, huh?

249
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,500
It's kind of strange to hear
that a guy can be a nail artist.

250
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,520
But what's a good thing about
being a male nail artist?

251
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,790
How do you feel now?

252
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,470
Well...
I feel kind of nervous.

253
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,980
That's it!

254
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:39,890
You can feel stability and warmth through
touch while getting a manicure from a guy.

255
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,530
And you can also have a good feeling
of nervousness from the opposite sex.

256
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,740
It's like the icing on the cake.

257
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,080
The more I talk to you, the
more I think you're attractive.

258
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,380
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Of course, I...

259
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,390
If I say I do, would girls not like me?

260
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,170
Well...

261
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll leave that up to you.

262
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,350
What do you think?
Doesn't this picture look great?

263
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,710
I should've worn a brighter shirt.

264
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,140
Hey, what's that?

265
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,660
'He doesn't have a girlfriend.'

266
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,890
I said that for my fans, you know.

267
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,810
You don't deserve to complain
about that intern guy.

268
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,200
This is why she's...

269
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,640
What?

270
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,600
- Ji Soo's what?
- Never mind.

271
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,180
What is it?

272
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,640
Bunny, you know how sensitive
I am about that, right?

273
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,750
Is there something between
Ji Soo and that intern guy?

274
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,710
- No, I didn't say that.
- I knew it.

275
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,540
That damn guy.

276
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,840
That's it. I'm going to keep my eye on
Kim Ji Soo 24/7 from today.

277
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,450
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

278
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,820
I came here to get a hand
massage from Bunny again.

279
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,500
Can you do that?

280
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,150
Sure, I can.
Have a seat.

281
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,150
- You changed your hairstyle?
- You noticed?

282
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,940
Of course.
You look better with that hair.

283
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,780
That customer... I think she
has a crush on Bunny.

284
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,180
It must be so hard for you to
protect Bunny from guys and girls.

285
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,960
Oh my. Did you get a manicure?

286
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,410
It's pretty but it doesn't really suit you.

287
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,780
- Don't you think so?
- Just let her be.

288
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,250
I think she paid a lot for that.

289
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,050
Let's just go have lunch.

290
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,430
Yeo... Yeo Joo.

291
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,790
You can keep talking to him.
I'll be in your room.

292
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,510
Is there anything else you need?

293
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,910
No.

294
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,830
What about Jin?
Did he leave already?

295
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,840
No. He went out to buy something
that tastes better than rice porridge.

296
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:49,360
Yeo Joo, nothing happened between me and
Doctor Jeong. He just wanted to talk.

297
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,690
Do you...

298
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,660
- Do you like him?
- What? No!

299
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,700
Kim Ji Soo.

300
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,260
I've known you for years.

301
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,080
Well... I know it's hard to
control somebody's feelings.

302
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,170
But just don't be so harsh to him.
You know he's a nice guy.

303
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,670
Bye.

304
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,440
What happened to her? I thought she
would yell at me to straighten up.

305
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,280
- Jeong Ah.
- Bunny.

306
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,960
Did you get hurt?

307
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,400
No.
I got burned.

308
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
Let's go.
I'll walk you home.

309
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,480
It's okay. You don't have to do that.

310
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,000
It's okay. Jin told me that I
should be nice to you

311
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,550
since you became my regular even
though I'm not an official nail artist.

312
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

313
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,260
Come in.

314
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,490
I can just go home.

315
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,590
You walked all the way here for me.
I should treat you to some tea.

316
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,930
No. Do you want to have
dinner with me here?

317
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,200
It's okay.

318
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,770
Please. Actually, it's so lonely
to have dinner by myself every day.

319
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,370
Okay, then.

320
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,820
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

321
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,790
Do you like spaghetti?

322
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,620
Yes, I do.

323
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,200
Actually, I make delicious spaghetti.

324
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,550
Jin.

325
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,770
Aren't you tired?

326
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,440
You can't hang out with people
on the weekends because of me.

327
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,670
What are you talking about?
Staying with you is fun and relaxing.

328
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,950
- Do you want me to leave the hospital?
- Why?

329
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,720
Are you worried about something?

330
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,340
No, it's not that.
I'm kind of worried about the hospital bill.

331
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,420
And I'm not sick anymore.

332
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,360
- Are you really okay?
- Yeah.

333
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,670
Alright!

334
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,760
Honesty, I don't like that
Doctor Jeong or Jang or whatever.

335
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,410
The way he looks at you makes me so mad.

336
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,120
Anyway, you better not get sick again.

337
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,140
- Okay.
- What a darling.

338
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,880
- Do you like it?
- Yes. It's so good.

339
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,650
Excuse me.

340
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,270
Hello?

341
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,390
- Why aren't you calling me?
- Sorry. Something came up.

342
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,980
I told you to come when I called you.

343
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,880
Okay. I'm near the salon now.
I'll be there soon. Bye.

344
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,910
- I'm sorry.
- Was that your girlfriend?

345
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,900
Kind of like that.

346
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,340
Anyway, thank you for the food.

347
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,130
I have to go now.

348
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,340
Can you stay a little bit longer with me?

349
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,720
It's already late.

350
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,060
Please. I'm begging you. Can you stay
here with me for 10 minutes, no, 5 minutes?

351
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,480
Please?

352
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,020
Bunny.

353
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,420
Um...I think you're
misunderstanding something.

354
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,990
I am...

355
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,970
- What are you doing?
- You hate me because I'm ugly, don't you?

356
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,280
You hate me because I'm
fat and ugly, don't you?

357
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,770
What are you talking about, Jeong Ah?

358
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,290
This isn't right. I have to go.

359
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,500
Beanie.

360
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,410
Did you see a ghost or something?

361
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,070
What's with that look?

362
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,350
Nothing.

363
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,710
By the way, how did you know I was here?

364
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,710
I was going to go to the
salon but then I got lost.

365
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,350
You're so weird. How can you get
lost on the way to your work place?

366
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,680
I've never been in this neighborhood.

367
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,040
- Let's go.
- Wait.

368
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,820
Try this one.

369
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,470
What's the occasion?
You don't like to see me drinking.

370
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,340
It's okay if it's just you and me.

371
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,200
It'll be better if you get drunk.

372
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,280
You pervert.

373
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,410
What are you two doing here?

374
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,200
Jin is with his girlfriend
and Alex is on vacation now.

375
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,360
By the way, what happened to
him and the girl he likes?

376
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,030
- What?
- You didn't know?

377
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,850
Shoot.

378
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,230
It should be a secret but
I'll tell only you two.

379
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,520
There's this girl that Alex likes.

380
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,540
But another guy took her already.

381
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,830
Isn't the girl our boss?

382
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,760
No, no. She's mine.
Nobody can take her, you know.

383
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:08,820
But she and Alex seemed so
close so I asked her about it.

384
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,700
Me and Alex?

385
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,670
No. You know he studied
Oriental medicine, right?

386
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,370
I have severe anemia so
I get dizzy sometimes.

387
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,260
He helps me when I get sick. That's it.

388
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:32,100
He likes somebody else.

389
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,900
Are you okay?
Is your hand okay?

390
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,250
Follow me.

391
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,790
Hey, hey!

392
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,860
What's wrong with them? Did I say
something that I shouldn't have?

393
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,750
Let go.

394
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,550
What are you doing?

395
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:12,560
Why are you having feelings for Alex again?
Why do you keep going back and forth?

396
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,490
I didn't know how Alex felt about me.

397
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:27,660
I didn't know what his relationship
was with the boss.

398
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,940
I misunderstood him, my heart
fluttered, and I blamed him.

399
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,530
The guy in front of you is me.

400
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,510
Can't you just focus on me?

401
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,920
What's the use of these couple rings?

402
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,530
What are you doing here this late?

403
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,360
Who's the girl?

404
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,650
The girl that's taken which is why
you're in pain. Who is she?

405
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,190
It's late. Let's talk tomorrow.

406
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,760
Is the girl Bunny?

407
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,340
You probably won't say you didn't know.

408
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:00,210
There is nothing manly about Bunny.
You probably knew she wasn't a guy.

409
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,660
It doesn't make sense if you didn't know.

410
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,390
What are you going to do
if the girl is Bunny?

411
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,150
Let go, Kay.

412
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,810
How could you do this to me?

413
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,850
When you know full well
what she means to me.

414
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,360
- You know how much I care about her.
- What did I do wrong?

415
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,540
It's hard for me too, Kay.

416
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,400
So don't make things harder.

417
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,580
There's nothing for you to worry about.

418
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:44,300
To Bunny, I'm just a co-worker
who doesn't know she's a girl

419
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,350
and has feelings for another girl.

420
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,650
We'll leave it at that.

421
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,380
So don't worry.

422
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,870
What if I don't want that?

423
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:08,780
What you're saying is you're
backing down just because of me.

424
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,620
Since when did I become that pathetic?

425
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,600
Kay.

426
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,970
I don't want you to pity me.

427
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:26,600
And I don't want to be afraid of you.
That's not how I live my life.

428
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:33,000
So, if you don't want to make
me look so pathetic, be brave.

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,560
Let's fight and see who will win.

430
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,810
Are you  getting carried away by bravado or
are you just overconfident about this?

431
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:53,000
Whatever. It's Bunny that will
decide who she's going to choose.

432
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,670
- How are you, Bunny?
- What happened, Alex?

433
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,370
You said you were gonna take a week off.

434
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,020
- I guess not.
- I'm glad you came back sooner.

435
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,220
You can't take another vacation now.

436
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,260
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,950
I have a nail artist meeting to attend.
I'll be back later.

438
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,050
Get back to work, guys.

439
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,550
Ji Soo, are you leaving the hospital?

440
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,080
Yeah, I'm about to leave now.

441
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,660
Yeah.
I'm okay!

442
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,260
Can you give me Patient Kim
Ji Soo's number and address?

443
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,150
Kay, can we talk?

444
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm sorry about last night.

445
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,810
I was so shocked and flustered.

446
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,100
I won't do it again.

447
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,660
You can keep it for now.

448
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,580
I don't want to keep this relationship vague.

449
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,950
Keep it for now.

450
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:54,840
And if you're ready to give all of your heart
to me and focus on me, then give it back.

451
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,620
Kay.

452
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,990
- Excuse me.
- We're not open yet. What's going on?

453
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,460
We're from the police station. Who is Bunny?

454
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,370
It's me.
What's going on?

455
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,200
Sexual harassment?

456
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:30,790
Wait, officer. There must be
some misunderstanding here.

457
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,570
There she is.

458
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,540
Woo Jeong Ah, is he the one you were
talking about? He keeps saying no.

459
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,720
That's him. He came to my house
and had dinner.

460
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,210
And after that he tried to take
off my clothes and grab me.

461
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,470
He ran away because I grabbed a
knife and made him go away.

462
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,040
This is a scar from getting cut yesterday.

463
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,850
What are you saying, Jeong Ah?
Why are you lying all of a sudden?

464
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,560
We can see if she's lying or
not by investigating you.

465
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,540
Do you admit to going to her house?

466
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,590
Yes, I did go there but...

467
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,850
Take him.

468
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,210
Wait.
This is not right.

469
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,180
- I didn't do that.
- Wait, officer.

470
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,620
There's something off here.

471
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,240
Woo Jeong Ah, so you're saying
Bunny was trying to rape you, right?

472
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,300
How can you be so sure?

473
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,640
Because he touched my body.

474
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,980
The you probably felt or touched
Bunny's body. Correct?

475
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,400
Wait, this is sexual harassment.

476
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,070
Then why do you still think
that Bunny is a guy?

477
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,690
This person is....

478
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,810
a girl.

479
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,590
Alex.

480
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,550
If you can't believe me, check her ID.

481
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,270
What's wrong with you?

482
00:45:53,810 --> 00:46:00,850
This can't be right.
This isn't right.

483
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,750
I'm so sorry about that.
You can leave now.

484
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,270
Let's go.

485
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:27,510
I can't believe he fooled me.
I liked him so much.

486
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,920
Alex!

487
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,710
How can you lie to me? Apologize!

488
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,070
Let me go!

489
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,940
Can you give us a moment?

490
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,980
Jeong Ah...

491
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:23,060
Alex is okay.
He didn't get hurt that much.

492
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,720
Just in case you're worried.

493
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:37,270
- If you don't want to talk to me, then...
- I'm sorry.

494
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,760
I didn't mean to do all this.

495
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:53,650
Bunny, you're the first person to smile at me
and actually call my name with warmth.

496
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:06,950
But I thought even you hated me because I'm
fat and ugly. I just couldn't stand that thought.

497
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,120
I couldn't control myself.

498
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:27,980
Jeong Ah, the reason why I could make eye
contact with you and say your name warmly

499
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,140
is because you did the same to me.

500
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,990
Don't you get it?

501
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:47,140
I may not become your boyfriend
but I want to become your friend.

502
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,460
Can I?

503
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,190
Since when?

504
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:21,000
Since when did you know I'm a girl?

505
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,490
When Kay asked you out.

506
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:36,090
And when I realized you're more
than just a little brother to me.

507
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,410
Then why did you pretend
you didn't know anything?

508
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:49,030
Kay is as dear to me as you are.

509
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,060
I'm sorry for being so cranky to you.

510
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:15,010
I couldn't control my feelings around you.

511
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,540
Then...

512
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,290
Are you okay with that now?

513
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:32,450
If it's something I can't
suppress, then I'll let it free.

514
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,870
I like you, Bunny.

515
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:49,330

Boss, I'm quitting Paris.

517
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,180
Beanie.

518
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,580
What are you doing?

519
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,990
I said you can tell her how you
feel about her, not kick her out!

520
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:10,600
Kay, promise me one thing.

521
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,350
Whoever she chooses, let's
not hate or blame the other.

522
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:21,600
Bunny.

523
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,200
Kay.
